popper the pop top this great little
gadget makes homemade popcorn fast and
movie night fun for the whole family
let me show you how it works measuring
the right amount of kernels is easy with
the pop top to make a full 10 cups of
popcorn fill the basin on the bottom
right to the edge
now add the good stuff the pop top works
great with cooking oil or even better
butter to close the pop top fold in the
triangles one by one like this then
place in the microwave for about 2
minutes
use the tabs on either side of the
popper to remove it safely from the
microwave then ask salt and enjoy use
the bistro combo pepper grinder and salt
shaker first you can just adjust the
coarseness by rotating the base there's
a large dot and a small dot so just turn
that to sheet the coarseness that you'd
like to use the salt just shake it to
refill simply twist the cap off and just
recently that you also have a pouring
option where you just pop this open like
that if you want a lot of salt that's
how you do that and to use the pepper
just squeeze the handle and to refill
just twist the entire top portion and
refill that chamber right there and
should get it back in action just go the
opposite direction
and you are good to go
use the pepper ball pepper grinder first
rotate the base from the small dot to
the large dot or vice versa to adjust
the coarseness and then to use squeeze
the handles to grind and to refill very
easy you just twist the handles and
there you go
and just replace by going in the
opposite direction and to use the salt
ball salt grinder do exactly the same
thing to use the garlic zoom garlic
chopper simply just pop open the hatch
the top put in no probably about two
cloves of garlic depending on the size
close the top hatch roll back and forth
depending on how much you roll that's
how much I'll find it's going to beat
sometimes I also roll in my hand
depending on the counter circuit I find
that that helps break it up nice and
easily so there will be more time kind
of tap it down in order to access the
garlic there's another hatch here right
in the center open that up remove the
blade and just tap out your garlic right
into your pan or on your counter surface
and also a great thing about this is you
don't have to get your hands all mucky
you can just put it right in the top
rack of the dishwasher you're good to go
there's also an Excel version if you
want to do more at one time it's good
for chopping garlic as well as herbs and
shallots
