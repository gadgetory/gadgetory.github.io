latest tech here bringing you you
guessed it the latest tech out there
caller perfect let's start things off
with a portable iron gadget this is the
caller perfect
it got settings for most collared shirts
materials allowing you to iron on the go
or even in the house since regular
orange usually don't do all that well
with collars and pockets but this guy
specializes in those areas it's got a
voltage range between 110 to 220 voltage
with 50 60 Hertz so an adapter may or
may not be necessary depending on where
you live
this beauty sets you back just $15 on
Amazon which i think is a fair deal and
could be useful for anyone who travels
frequently back blade 2.0 some guys like
to be clean-shaven all over which can be
a big hassle but the foldable back blade
2.0 is here to help having to safety
blades makes it less likely to cut
yourself but still sharp enough to leave
no stubble it's really got your back so
what I did there it's ergonomic s-shape
handle lets you access all of those
hard-to-reach areas with ease and you
can even shave wet or dry which is a
nice plus the head is even detachable to
make shaving other areas a lot easier to
the blades can be removed and replaced
with no hassle I found it on Amazon for
about forty five US bucks
hold the people up at the company Korca
found an interesting material to make
their wallets out of cork yeah genuine
cork leather and out of their really
cool selection I found my favorite one
out of them all the fold model it's a
slim wallet with space for a ton of
stuff even though it looks very
minimalist fitting in cash your
passports and tons of cards being able
to fold down the less stuff it has in it
it even has RFID blocking to protect
your cards from being scanned I found it
on Amazon for 2250 us with many other
cool wallet types and colors from the
same company it's very stylish well
designed and made
with a unique material which I think
makes it a very nice gift beard bib
beard trimming always leaves a mess so
when I found the beard King beard bib I
thought that's an interesting solution
the suction cups attached to the mirror
and it just lets you do your thing
without getting in the way with hooks on
the suction cups to let you stop mid
shave which is very cool
cleaning up is crazy easy now and all
for twenty-five dollars on Amazon this
is a must for us guys to keep our
bathrooms beard hair free with little to
no fuss the leather man trend let's
finish off this list with a very
functional very stylish accessory that
even a handyman might appreciate the
leather man tread bracelet multi-tool
with 25 tools like several different
screwdrivers several types of wrenches a
few cutting edges and the all-important
bottle opener made in the US of A as a
sort of tool belt that you wear on your
wrist instead of on your waist and can
take on the go it has 11 interchangeable
links each made from stainless steel
with even an optional Swiss watch add-on
that's both water and shock resistant
very very cool watch at that too if
that's not cool enough it comes in two
color options plain stainless steel or a
cool black steel I at first didn't
believe it would be all that functional
but as we're seeing they're all working
as intended and what's even better is
that it's even TSA approved so you can
travel while wearing it which is very
cool it even has a SIM card remover
which is a very big plus when going to
another country and you have to switch
to their numbers I feel like we've all
faced similar situations like these
where we need a tool but just don't have
the energy to dig through our bags or
even know where we stored it well maybe
not the oxygen tank wrench I feel like
that's a bit of a niche tool but
still lifting - have I jumped on Amazon
and I found it for 175 American and even
comes with a generous 25 year warranty
that's cool
this tool is an amazing buy / gift for
all handy work inclined men and yep
there's the MVP letting you crack open a
cold one after a hard day's work
nice we may not look at sometimes but us
guys do care about how presentable we
are when it matters and that's why these
five gadgets are amazing and helping us
look our very best when it matters the
cool Leatherman threats is my personal
favorite and definitely on my wish list

gadgets ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
