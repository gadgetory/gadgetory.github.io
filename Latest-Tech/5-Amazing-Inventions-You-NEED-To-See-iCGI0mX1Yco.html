typing Bluetooth keyboard the ultimate
combination
is the true gadget of the future
mr. miyajima why did you decide to
develop the tea blade professional shoe
I'm usually gone on overseas business
trips about one-third of the year so I
have to work in narrow spaces like
inside airplanes or in cars then I
imagine how useful it would be if I
could stay bleat iped X on my iPad in
such narrow spaces then it hit me the
back surface of the ipad would be the
best position for the keyboard so I
searched the internet for a keyboard
that was placed on the back side of the
ipad but i couldn't find anything like
that so i decided to make a new product
see hey could you tell me the special
points of the t-wave i must say is the
keyboards design our design was based on
our intensive studies of human
engineering since the sense of the
fingertip is very sensitive we decided
to thoroughly investigate how to make a
keyboard that was extremely easy to use
for example frequently use keys like the
return key and space key are placed on
the front side of the Keyblade which you
can operate with your thumbs but I'm
afraid if I can't see the keys on the
back it would be difficult to type well
you won't have to worry about that we
will provide free software to help you
practice using the Keyblade keyboard
just give yourself a few days and you
will find yourself typing on the t blade
with ease only three days Wow it has a
very sense of high-class to it is it
heavy try it for yourself what do you
think oh wow it's much lighter than I
expected it to be I feel like I could
take this anywhere that's right you can
type on your iPad with greater ease
anywhere and anytime that is the maximum
benefit of the Keyblade for instance in
narrow spaces like inside cars or on
airplanes or even lying on the couch you
can type using the T bleh with stable
and comfortable conditions
I see it's very convenient thank you
very much all right and lastly can we
get a message for the people at
IndieGoGo we developed the world's first
back typing keyboard for the iPad the
Keyblade is our dream come true keyblade
will bring another evolution to the iPad
Keyblade is a true gadget of the future

you
me
in 2007 Steve Jobs said that this was
the best input device that was 2007 this
is 2015 in 2015 we love our touch
screens we take them everywhere we go
and why wouldn't we they're light
they're powerful and they're gorgeous
but they're not a perfect input device
to fully express ourselves we need
better precision and more space this is
free and it takes you way beyond the
screen with free you can write or draw
on nearly any surface and your words or
pictures will appear on your screen
instantly free brings us back to a more
direct interaction with the world around
us in part by freeing us to use one of
our most personal skills handwriting
free sophisticated optical tracking
engine can trace anyone's handwriting on
nearly any surface to an incredible
level of accuracy there is melody
anything or I kids Oh give us a minute
Mitch a rocky uncensored it was a
miniature laser which has a collimated
beam to the surface reflections from the
surface combined with internal
reflections to give us some orphan
signals in fact we invented the world's
smallest three-dimensional laser
interferometer that is truly amazing but
let me take it from here free is all
about minimizing whatever stands in the
way of your creative energy it's got a
mini touch display for notifications
that you reply instantly and even
doubles as a headset to take phone calls
Oh Michael write yourself a note the
second you think of it jot down a phone
number or doodle your next brainchild
your thoughts and ideas are captured
instantly on your device
free lets you use all of your screen
turning your mobile phone into learning
incredibly comfortable and efficient
mobile creative station and best of all
free is personal so personal it can even
use your handwriting as a highly
sophisticated form of biometric
identification
making it much harder for someone to
steal your identity present minimal and
classic design with the unique ergonomic
shape so that the touch display
naturally faces you you can simply
select different functions we also have
an open platform so developers can
create exciting your applications
together we can change the way we
interact with the digital world for
everyone we put thousands of hours
developing our motion tracking engine
and now we need your support to build
the coolest mobile input device it's
quick it's convenient it's familiar and
personally it's free hi my name is
Anthony and I'm a founding partner of
mighty audio mighty was born from
personal frustration with the current
on-the-go music experience several years
ago I ditched music downloading for
music streaming the only thing missing
after i switched was a seamless and
integrative experience during my
workouts fast forward to today and every
option to stream music still requires a
smartphone while exercising we all know
how annoying it is to work out with a
bulky smartphone the phones are only
getting bigger more expensive and
consuming more battery life and heaven
forbid if you drop your phone iPod
shuffles are still around but they don't
have any streaming capabilities and
let's not forget the painful syncing
process that requires cords and
computers I was shocked that there was
no product out there that solved my
problem so I thought to myself well if
no one else is going to create this
product then I'm going to give it a shot
my tea is very easy to set up syncing
music never requires cords and computers
just bluetooth and your smartphone after
you download the app onto your phone and
turn on the device that will
automatically detect your vice to pair
with via bluetooth once connected you'll
be asked to sign into your account after
logging in you can sync all your
playlists on to the mighty device in the
same way that you would sing playlists
for offline play on your phone on here
you'll see all your current playlist as
well as how much memory you're using
after a quick sync your music is on your
mighty and you're ready to go no more
phone required at this point we honestly
think a screen is unnecessary
we are proud to be the first ones to
bring a device like this to market we're
altra focus on this one problem and we
want to solve it elegantly and simply
music is a part of almost everyone's
life and so we want my tea to be the
bridge between your music and your
fitness so if you've been asking
yourself why doesn't this exist please
help us make this product a reality say
goodbye to your smartphones and iPod
shuffles and be mighty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
