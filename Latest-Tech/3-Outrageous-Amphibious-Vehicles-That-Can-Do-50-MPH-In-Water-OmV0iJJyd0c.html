manufactured in West Germany from 1961
to 1967 even now anta car is the only
non-military and fibulas vehicle ever
put into production on a commercial
basis the many rules and regulations for
road and water during vehicles make it
very unlikely that another car based on
phibian will ever be produced anta car
is capable of over 70 miles per hour in
road eight knots of water
it's totally watertight and comfortable
enough to drive 500 miles a day the
vehicle costs 5 million dollars to
design in the late 1950s the anta cars
engine was mounted at the rear of the
craft driving the rear wheels through a
four-speed manual transmission for use
in the water
the same engine drove a pair of
reversible propellers at the rear with a
second gear level engaging forward or
reverse drive empty car failed because
it was too expensive when new however it
is capable of some serious sea crossing
like Africa to Spain or England to
France one owner was quoted we like to
think of it as the fastest car in water
and the fastest boat on the road number
2 terrowin's motorhomes if you happen to
find yourself in the predicament where
you have a wad of cash and faced with
the decision of purchasing an RV or
yacht terre wind is about to make your
life just a little bit easier the
world's only luxury amphibious
motorhomes the terrowin's amphibious RV
starting at eight hundred and fifty
thousand dollars is every bit as amazing
as it sounds the terror wind built by
cool and piteous manufacturers in
national has marble floors and leather
furniture as well as mirrored ceilings
and full-size appliances plasma TVs and
then a jet whirlpools have the dashboard
looks almost like an airplane cockpit
full of gauges and controls GPS
navigational charts and the docking
system with access to the Internet or
standard equipment
the terrowin's features a unique rear
deck with an outdoor fresh water shower
and the retractable dice platforms the
Tarot wind has a highway speed of up to
80 miles per hour and can go seven knots
of water number three you're in speed
splash under the ultralight carbon
composites 10 lies much more than just
an agile and lively sports car the rinse
speed splash is a true incarnation of a
really cool and fun sports toy at the
push of a button a cleverly thought-out
hydraulic mechanism transforms the
sports car into an amphibious vehicle a
highly complex integrated hydrofoil
system enables the splash to fly at an
altitude that was out sixty centimeters
above the water the almost magical
transformation from a street vehicle
into a floating and flying all-rounder
is made possible by an electronically
controlled hydraulic system with an
array of sophisticated sensors even the
wheels are free of water contact on
smooth water the splash is capable of
reaching a top speed of about 49 miles
per hour
naturally the splash can also be
operated as a conventional and previous
vehicle with retracted hydrofoil the
splash reaches a top speed of almost 31
miles per hour
that is fast enough for waterskiing or
knee boarding
the body of the splash is designed to be
watertight the sleek lines of the splash
draw tension at first glance the entire
body consists of multi-layered carbon
composite a state-of-the-art plastic
mainly used in Formula One racing hit
