thermostat it's in millions of homes
around the world it's saved billions of
kilowatt hours of energy so far and
that's just the beginning
meet the third-generation Nest Learning
Thermostat it has a bigger sharper
screen and it's even better at learning
what you like just turn it up or down it
will catch on after a few days and
create a personalized schedule for you
that's how the nest thermostat saves
energy in real homes with real families
it saved so much energy it paid for
itself to save even more
just follow the leaf nest even turns
itself down when you leave the house and
you can control it from anywhere you can
see how much energy you use every day
and how to use less energy companies all
over the world are giving the nest
thermostat to their customers because
they know it saves energy that's the
most beautiful part the Nest Learning
Thermostat programs itself then pays for
itself
in 2015 we love our smartphones we take
them everywhere we go they help us plan
our day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us
they even support our work day but all
these fun functions come at a cost
battery do you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bag plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quick charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Hugh simply wrap it into
this tuck away slot and you're good to
go
how really does the cube work well it's
a simple concept just plug your cube
into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down hi my name
is Krishna as every busy person I was
often on the road and almost every day
my phone was running out of the battery
in the afternoon instead of messy wires
and power bank I wanted to have only one
small device that can replace the number
of home accessories I have to carry
every day when we started to think about
the cube we look at the existing
technology on the map and we quickly
notice that most of the available
devices were not complete and not to use
a friend
together with beer our head designer we
developed the cube we went through
several prototypes to find the best
design the design of this elegant
compact and practically it was so
challenging with all these
functionalities together into a small
and cool design which is significant
between transitive it was something that
had never been done but we made it and
we're so proud and excited to bring it
to you cube is the world's first compact
and lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sink and quick charging
cable you'll also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
simply put it's an amazing piece of
technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world so
get yours now and be one of the first
few boulders
once-in-a-lifetime an innovation comes
along that changes the course of mankind
a modern marvel of science and
engineering allow me to introduce yes
Cosmo we can play later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
