don't know
doctor phone introducing the auto dock
it automatically positions grips and
connects power to your device it's
adjustable and universal so if you
change your phone or just change the
case on your phone you don't need to buy
a new dock the auto dock is powered by
an internal battery then how to only
powers itself but can provide a reserve
charge for your phone so if the power
goes out your auto dock doesn't and if
you're in direct sunlight you can keep
that internal battery top down
empower your auto dock completely
wireless in the home the auto dock can
save your delicate electronic plugs from
little hands but in the automobile it
could be saving from a potentially
life-threatening distraction and unlike
other dots you don't have to force your
phone into the auto dock and if
something goes wrong the auto dock will
detect that and it will force the
connection of course there are more
ordinary ways to build a phone dock but
ordinary was simply not one of our goals
it's fast it's reliable its automatic
and we think it's how you've always
wanted your phone dock to work the auto
dock
this isn't about making another ordinary
charging station this is about making a
wireless charger that does more for you
we asked for instance why charging phone
has to lay flat on the surface we
answered with an improvement
an elegant wedge that allows your phone
to face you meaning you can keep
messaging your friends and family
watching your video playing your game
and continuously using your phone for
whatever reason do anything you love
without messy cables uninterrupted
untangled
but mono wear wasn't satisfied with
revolutionising smartphone powering we
also challenged ourselves to create a
worthy counterpart for your SmartWatch
we even designed a mechanism that allows
you to wrap cable up and hide it away
inside the wedge with ease a watch
charger that can be a beautiful charging
stand either on its own or as a complete
unit when seamlessly combined with the
power block when conjoined mono wears
compact shape makes it a breeze to carry
around mono wear is a portable charging
station for your smartphone and your
SmartWatch designed with versatility in
mind a beautiful home charging station
that moonlights as a burden 'less
portable charger no longer trapped by
messy cables no more stressed by low
battery sign keep yourself charged
untangled unwired with mono wear
we use technology we rely on it it
connects us to what we care about
yet there are times when we find
ourselves on our own again
what if you could charge your device
using only a candle
all you need is water
in in charge
it's dependable
and provides an instant source of power
when you need it most
now no matter where you are or whatever
happens to the electricity the candle
charger will be there to keep you
connected
hi Kickstarter its Adam from store we've
been really happy with the progress
we've made since our first campaign and
we're excited to bring you something new
the candle charger is an emergency
preparedness product which means that
you don't know that you're needed
continue
we can't wait to see what you guys do
with it
how many times have you been caught out
without battery you're on the go
your phone's dead and if you like me
your backup battery is sitting at home
when you know
hi I'm Evan an engineer living at IKEA
and I'm loop a designer living in Sydney
where the creators of Plan B failsafe
charge your smartphone we've been
friends for 15 years now we're working
together solve everyday problems we've
created a charger with the difference
some that you can rely on in emergencies
when everything else fails we started to
think how do we take away the pain of
carrying around these bulky batteries
they're either heavy or if they are
compact that can be much charged then we
started to think about your car you
don't carry around a spare battery you
carry around jumper leaves so why
shouldn't the same principle apply to
your phone but does batteries are
everywhere supermarkets gas stations
corner stores convenience stores all you
need is a jumper cable smartphones or
your can't seem to get enough of them
we're using them more than ever before
at home on the bus in bed on the toilet
admit it at work and everywhere in
between there's just one teeny tiny
problem your phone's battery life just
can't seem to keep up we've all had it
happen less once you're out and about
and your phone dies and you're left
stranded when you need it most
there are those backup battery packs but
they're never on you when you really
need them that's why we're here on
Kickstarter we've come up with a
fail-safe solution for when your
batteries on the blink
it's called plan V and it's like a car's
jumper lead for your phone when you're
on the go and staring down the barrel of
a battery catastrophe simply pick up a
9-volt battery connected to the plan V
device and then hook it up to your phone
since these are the sqaure batteries you
find in smoke alarms they're about us
widely available as chocolate bars so
back plan V and help us bring a portable
and durable solution to everyone who's
been caught out with our charge plan V
the failsafe charger for your smartphone
when I go out all I ever take my keys my
wallet and my phone the three point
check that's why we design plan B to be
small enough to fit on your keyring it's
so small you won't even notice it's on
you until you really need this is
something we initially designed for
ourselves and our friends it got our
sight of some tricky situations we think
it can help you - we've worked long and
hard to get to prototype stage we've
come from here to here now we need your
help
honestly without you this won't happen
so if you rely on your phone a lot and
need a truly failsafe charger one that
you can't forget to charge and it's
always on you back us and we won't let
you or your phone down
hi I'm sorry from pond our cubes
passionate about wireless charging and
the convenience and peace of mind that
it brings until recently
fussing with tiny connectors and
plugging and unplugging your phone has
really been the only option for keeping
them charged but now wireless charging
is enabling us to pick up our phone from
our desk or our bedside and find it
fully charged and ready for action it's
a huge envy nians wireless charging is
coming integrated from many phone makers
like Samsung LG Motorola HTC Nokia and
many others in places like cafes hotels
airports restaurants are starting to
provide free wireless charging what's
missing no solution for iPhone 5 or 5s
and that's the challenge our team set
out to solve we're so excited to
introduce a stream Qi wireless charging
case globally available through
Kickstarter and approved by Apple this
is a first it charges at a full 1 amp
like a normal charger and is made with
the best material high performance abs a
durable UV finish and in our premium
versions we feature figured maple and a
rich walnut to complement the stream
case we've designed great solutions for
charging at home and on the go with pond
our first thought was about how to make
something that's beautifully into our
living and working spaces it has a
high-capacity battery inside so there's
no wires to distract from its form and
you can charge your phone on time for
days or weeks before you have to plug in
again it comes in a beautiful black
enamel or hardwoods that match the
premium stream covers and we think
you're going to love pond we've been
working closely with our partners and
manufacturers to make these products a
reality and we're really quite close but
now we need your help to bring these to
market please make a pledge even if it's
small we're really excited to share
these products with the world and allow
everyone to experience the convenience
and peace of mind that wireless charging
brings
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
