to plan your adventures without having
to worry about heavy water loads or
where to find the next River or the next
gas station hi I'm Christopher and I'm
the mentor fountas I wanted to create a
bottle that would never run dry for me
it's like magic because out of thin air
and Sun we are bringing this bowl to
fill itself with drinkable world we
created a compact small and efficient
technology completely independent and
easy to use hi I'm boyum I'm an
electrical engineer they develop a
self-sufficient system which uses a
cooler to conveyance the moisture from
the air hi I'm Brian in charge of
engineering and develop father's comes
in two variations photos ride is
designed for bikers and uses the
airstream to press air into the bottle
the font is arrow is the second version
and is a standalone unit that does not
need to be in motion to function we've
been working on fountas for a couple of
years now here at the University of
Applied Arts in Vienna and our efforts
have been rewarded already with several
design awards we would like you to
become a part of the adventure and
support us so that we can continue with
the development of Pontus and be able to
prepare it for protection
join us in making this vision come to
life thanks for believing in practice

virtual reality is transporting you into
a digital environment where you can look
all around and interact with things as
if you were there whether it's a game a
movie or a 360-degree photo it's a fully
immersive experience and a very
different feeling than simply viewing
digital content on a screen octo is a
new kind of virtual reality headset that
uses your smartphone it was born after
months of user research when we realized
that most PR devices aren't made for
everyday use opto is the first portable
headset with integrated audio sound is
not just an afterthought but an integral
part of the design we have designed octo
as a wearable it is lightweight sits
perfectly balanced on your head and is
made of closed cell foam a material
comfortable to wear and easy to clean
you will no longer feel like you're just
strapping a piece of hardware to your
face the process of inserting and
removing your phone is quick and easy
you simply connect the audio place the
phone inside and then pop the front
cover back on
you can jump in and out of VR whenever
you want inge watch your favorite TV
series on your couch or on the train
opto is your portable entertainment
headset
Tom and I have been working together for
over three years we are based from
somerset house in london and a part of
macon versity it's a community of
creatives designers engineers and
software developers optos body is made
almost entirely of a patented closed
cell foam and is made in the same
factory that produces the famous crop
shoes this material is not only tough
but it's very light and comfortable to
wear we've built opto with large optics
to give you an excellent field of view
after many months of development and
testing we now have a working prototype
and we're ready to start moving into
production we really think that this
thing is going to change virtual reality
yeah by supporting our campaign you'll
help us produce the first 1000 units and
we can make opto a reality
you
we've always felt that there just needs
to be a fashionable alternative for our
climbing community our obsession helped
us continually stay the course through
this long process we pulled inspiration
from a variety of ended shoes and this
classic footwear that stands the test of
time the biggest thing for us was
marrying fashion and function through a
series of introductions we finally
landed on a designer from France that we
fell in love with his work together we
spent about a year and a half perfecting
concepts it was really important to take
a lot of different foot types and foot
sizes and learn the needs of climbers at
different ability levels and really
incorporate them into the functionality
of the shoes and then mixing that
functionality with our design ideas was
probably the the most difficult thing to
do for these final rounds of samples the
rubber we found is a new rubber it was
originally designed for sticky outsoles
for shoes for the military a lot of the
samples we saw and looked at were
actually rubber samples that were
applied to shoes for the Navy SEALs for
different approaches and the different
outdoor activities that they do
changing the color of the outsole rubber
while remaining sticky has never been
done before it's really become the
signature of our collection after we
went through enough samples I felt like
the shoes were finally at the point
where we could test them
there have been a lot of people that
really supported us there's also been a
lot of people who just didn't get it at
all some designers looked at me like I
was crazy there's a reps who told me to
give up and others told me like they're
just industry giants that you're gonna
be up against and
occasionally we feel like we're just
maybe maybe we are too small to attempt
this these types of things just fuel us
for the long road I guess overall we
just refuse to take the easy way out I
just really want to create and make
something different and interesting for
people
you
throughout history people have been
pretty good at solving problems we fix
things change things and if we can't we
invent something
but there are some problems that we've
all faced for so long that we've
forgotten that there are even problems
we've given up on finding a solution and
accept them as normal
my name is dr. michael larson and these
are the kinds of problems i solve sleep
is and has been a huge problem for a lot
of people why is it in an age when we
can send a picture instantly to anyone
in the world we can't come up with a
solution to help people who are not
getting a good enough night sleep that
question hit home for me in 2012 when my
own daughter was diagnosed with a sleep
disorder to call the drug that was
prescribed to her harsh would be a gross
understatement it was GHB and that name
might not mean much to you but it's the
date rape drug and I remember thinking
to myself is this the best we can do
give a seventeen-year-old girl the date
rape drug in order to sleep better why
don't any sleeping solutions work why do
we accept harsh drugs as a solution why
is it that gimmicky products that claim
to track our motion when we sleep get
bought by the millions I think people
started accepting these solutions
because they gave up on finding a real
solution my job is to invent things that
solve problems a lot of times instead of
specific things inventions address broad
issues I knew if this problem was going
to be solved I couldn't just solve her
problem I couldn't just solve sleep
disorders I had to solve sleep and
that's what I did
I had to start by defining sleep sleep
is a mystery but one thing we do know is
that our brain activity rape has to be
really slow for our bodies to be asleep
the challenge then was to find a way to
intentionally slow your brain rate and
what I found were binaural beats and
frankly they're amazing on the surface
binaural beats seemed to just be two
tones when played into each year but
they're actually so much more each tone
is said to a very specific but different
frequency when these signals cross in
your brain your brain adapts to them so
depending on how you set these
frequencies you can raise or lower your
brain rate the studies behind binaural
beats speak for themselves however
binaural beats although effective can
only slightly change your brain rate
when you first go to bed your brain rate
is about 50 Hertz to fall asleep it's
got to get all the way down to 10 Hertz
we discovered that your brain won't
adapt if the beach try to get your rate
from 50 all the way down to 10 in one
shot it's just too big a leap but what
they can do is take you to 45 number 42
35 and so on so the question became how
do we know when to change the beats at
the right time the answer is with this
with just this little guy we can monitor
your brain rate when we put this in
charge of the binaural beats it knows
exactly what tone to play with your
brain ray lowers the chip records that
and lowers the tones accordingly and
when we combine all these elements we
came up with this we call it the sleep
Shepherd
at night when you're getting ready for
bed all you do is put it on and hit
start sleep on the app it instantly
begins monitoring your brain rate and
begins to play the right binaural beats
as a sleep Shepherd senses your brain
rate lowering it changes the tones it's
smart to because it knows when you fall
asleep and when you do it turns off the
tones but it continues to monitor your
brain if the sleep Shepherd senses your
brain is waking up the tones will turn
back on and guide you back to a deeper
sleep because a sleep Shepherd keeps you
in deeper sleep for longer you can get
the same amount of sleep you usually do
but now those hours are going to count
more because of its organic shape
because it's lightweight because the
fabric breathes so well the sleep
Shepherd is incredibly easy to sleep in
on your back on your side it doesn't
matter you're going to forget you have
it on the sleep Shepherd is not some 3d
render that might get made once we get
funded both the fully functioning sleep
Shepherd and app for iPhone and Android
are ready right now there are a lot of
features with the sleep Shepherd we're
really excited about it tracks every
aspect of your sleep how long you're
asleep what kind of sleep you're in even
your head orientation during the night
and it holds on to this data so you can
see how it improves your sleep over time
in the morning the sleep Shepherd uses
the same concept it used to put you to
sleep but in Reverse to wake you up over
time it gently weights your brain up
everyone's had that morning when you
wake up and feel refreshed but it's more
than that you wake up you're ready
you're alert you're excited you wake up
and you feel incredible that's what it's
like when you wake up with the sleep
Shepherd my daughter's been using the
sleep Shepherd every night and as of
December 2013 she's off the ghb
completely she's sleeping better and her
life has changed for the better for the
first time we have a real solution for
sleep and we think that's something to
get excited about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
