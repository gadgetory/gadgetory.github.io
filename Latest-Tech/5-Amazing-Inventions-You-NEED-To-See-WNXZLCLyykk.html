my name is Mark and I'm responsible for
all the communication between the team
at ring clock and you the backers as
part of this campaign the really
impressive images that you've just seen
were put together about two years ago
now by our designer Gustav as part of a
competition entry and when these designs
went online and so many people were
commenting on them and they were saying
that they really wanted to buy this
product they were asking if it was
already in production where they could
get one from and when they found out
that it wasn't yet in production about
four months ago we put together the
right team to take this product into
market we made a conceptual model we
made one or two changes just purely for
for feasibility and we are in the
process of finalizing our prototype and
so that's where you guys come in we
would really appreciate your help and if
you have any questions or any comments
or anything at all please do get in
touch with us and we promise to get back
in touch with everyone who makes contact
with us but in the meantime or we can
say is thank you very much for helping
us make this product intermarket and
thanks once again for your support thank
you
you
we believe the technology should be
seamless and it should give you more
from the experience as you love our
technology fundamentally enhances
all from Sarah turn left in 20 miles
it's just a new evolution the store
again I think this is hot that feels
like tomorrow it really really does it
feels like tomorrow you've taken all
that can electronics out of the
high-tech cars and just put it right
here honestly it's it's gonna change
everything when you put on a skully
helmet you get any essentially an
ecosystem assuage eternally assaulting
into a platform yeah that's all you get
a level of innovation that you had been
folded back before being a professional
motorcycle racer takes a lot of fun away
from raping from riding on the stoop but
this could make a fun again it will make
your writing safer with its high-speed
microprocessor and operating system it's
the smartest motorcycle helmet ever
imagined scully is the future
join the revolution
you
my name is Victoria who I just graduated
from UC Berkeley and I am the co-founder
of accent accent where is a company that
makes innovative headphones that you
haven't seen before I came up with the
idea wild girl but I was never able to
turn into a reality fortunately I met my
best friend Victoria and she was able to
help me with a lot of the things that I
could accomplish by myself so we came up
with the idea for the name for accent
where when we were actually just on
facebook and we were chatting with a
bunch of our friends and we were like
hey guys let's think of a good name that
would be fitting for this new company
and we're just throwing ideas back and
forth and finally someone said oh you
know what what about accent where we're
like you know what sounds pretty good
first I came up with a few sketches I
drew them on people's had to get idea of
how they were looked I tried all
different colors different designs
there's a great lab at UC Berkeley and
we just got a fellowship at the
Innovation Lab and we would go in every
week and we would take around and we
just some things online well I got a
design that I'm happy with I started
doing a 3d model of it I have a physical
model to try on people one of the things
that we ended up changing through
feedback from our our fans on Facebook
was that they wanted bigger cans they
wanted over the year instead of on the
year so we changed that because a lot of
people are requesting that each new
prototype the headphones get closer and
closer to what we envisioned so these
are the headphones action were accent
and the headband and all the plastic
parts are made of ABS which is a
recyclable material so it is
environmentally friendly that way these
are the LED lights that are that show up
to be the color that you choose i'm
going to have a couple of options these
are the sternal speakers so you can
share music with your friends we're
really excited to make these a reality
and to take these from the prototyping
stage to the final product we really
hope that you'll support us in our
endeavor please back us up on our
and help us turn this into a reality
thank you

runs out of juice when you're on that
