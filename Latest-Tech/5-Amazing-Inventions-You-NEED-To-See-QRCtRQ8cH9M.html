if you're anything like me you love your
iPhone can't put it down for a minute
but it seems like you don't even make it
through breakfast before you start to
see that there are some products that
claim to offer wireless charging but
they suck so what if there was a way to
charge your phone without ever taking it
out of your pocket
there is it's called the power case by
prong and it allows you to do just that
a truly wireless charger for your iPhone
you press this button and your iPhone
starts charging from the backup battery
oh and it also comes in these fancy
schmancy colors but I'm going to stick
with black external cords are so laughs
yesterday everything you need is right
here these plugs flip out and the backup
slides off for easy charging whenever
power case by prong its power you can
fit in your pocket
you
this is Bob like many people bob is
constantly on his phone
this means Bob makes some pretty stupid
mistakes
bob is not very smart about using his
phone but even he knows it's too
dangerous to take your eyes off when I'm
driving my smartphone can get me into
some serious trouble hudley is a
heads-up display which projects the
information that I need to an optical
glass in my clear line-of-sight this
allows me to quickly view information
without having to adjust my focus even
in bright light the display is visible
hudley will automatically adjust the
conditions for optimal viewing public is
compatible on iOS or Android and works
with all my apps I love using Waze when
I'm in hurry navigate to work using my
phone's built-in hands-free functions I
can safely use all the applications I
need reply I'm gonna be late boss my
favorite use of hudley is running apps
that are designed for our heads-up
display using the Navi or app I can see
it really looks like my directions are
floating on the road making it so much
easier for me to follow instructions
hudley connects and is powered by my
car's diagnostic port this gives me a
cool jet pilot style view which allows
me to view vital information like speed
fuel RPMs temperatures be a safer driver
drivin ugly
- starter hudley is an opportunity to be
technology originally developed the
military aviation - your own car it
really helped stay focused on the road
and it just looks super warm we're
offering backers 20% off the retail
price

production cost the design of Huntley is
complete and we have a manufacturer who
is ready to begin production hudley will
change the way you drive we can't wait
to bring it to you use hudley and drive
safe be like Bob be better than Bob
a lot of my coffee black and strong I
love the outdoors and it's fresh clean
air and this is why I created the
forever flock the only fully metal back
in class ever
I've looked everywhere for a simple
solid metal class and I couldn't find
one so I decided to make one they just
hate it when tea tastes of coffee and
coffee tastes of tea or worse still you
get a horrible plastic taste the forever
flask puts an end to this horrible
experience the forever Frost is durable
is built to last
hence the name I came up with this green
one design that is made entirely out of
three one six surgical steel without any
question that keeps the taste really
clean and never resistance passes
corrosion the design also contains a
large upper one which holds half a liter
of liquid and turns into either a
thermal mug with the help of the bottom
loop or into a food container it is the
healthiest way to carry your food or
drink the forever flask will only be
launched on Kickstarter it is here and
now only please help us fund this
project and make forever flasks a
reality I've done all the research
lots of prototyping we've talked to over
30 factories in China and found the one
this comfortable making this complicated
product the biggest defense is actually
setting up the factory
doing all of the tooling the production
process this is where we need your help
if you want a flask that will give you
that pure taste and will never break
make a pledge and contribute to the
campaign so if you believe in this idea
and you're going to play stone to stop
there share it post it tell your friends
about this forever flask is the only
flask you really will ever need
forever flask is an amazing and unique
three-in-one food and beverage vessel
it's a vacuum flask thermal mug and also
a food container buying a new thermos or
a vacuum flask every few years plastic
lid smell of old drinks that you can't
wash out tea tastes of coffee and vice
versa two sips from the screw on top mug
is all you can't drink in the mug gets
cold or hot quickly want a proper flask
that will go the distance forever vacuum
flask is three-in-one flask mug and food
container 316 surgical steel no plastic
parts huge 500 milliliters screw on top
mug 1 liter flask capacity compact edges
280 by 90 centimeters

half inches simple clean design and
