think about all the razors you've owned

overpriced cartridge razors that
irritate your skin

modern easy to use update of the classic
shave the Model T is a razor that can
adjust to your skin type and facial hair

subscriptions and marketing gimmicks you
don't need brought to you by a team with
a proven track record of delivering on
Kickstarter the Rockville Model T
couldn't be easier to use simply twist
open the razor place in a blade close
the razor and twist the dial to your
unique setting for the best possible
shave every time the Rockwell Model T's
lowest settings are great for men with
one to three day old stubble or
sensitive skin and is the perfect place
to start for seamless transition from
cartridge razor shaving the higher
settings are great for mend removing or
lining up serious stubble and beards or
men who are prone to razor bumps when
shaving with cartridges how does the

Service to ration cartridges to you one
month at a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
