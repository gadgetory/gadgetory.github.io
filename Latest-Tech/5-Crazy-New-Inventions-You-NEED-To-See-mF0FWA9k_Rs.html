gold coin or even liquid gold what if
there were a magic solution that could
collect all your dog's poop without any
direct hand contact because in reality
your dog doesn't poop gold introducing
picker poo a third parents dream
piccaboo is made up of two parts a
rounded clip of soft silken cushions
that secures comfortably around your
dog's tail and a durable disposable
collection bag that hangs beneath place
pick a poo on your dog's tail before you
go out for a walk
and when he was ready to poop all the
droppings fall directly into the
collection bag when your dog is finished
pooping you just unclip the bag and
throw it away
with no mess and no leakage in the real
world
dog poop is not gold we love our dogs
but don't love cleaning up after them I
try to take charge and shave his back
but he walks around looking like a when
you take your shirt off people run ok ok
ok ok let's everybody let's just take a
breath I know it can be a little
expensive but perhaps you could try
waxing that's up here try this it's the
back blade the easiest do it yourself
back shaver on the planet the back blade
is extremely easy to use unique patented
safety blades
leave a smooth shave and are designed to
minimize the risk of cutting they feel
just like a fast Ratchet back blade 2.0
also features an s-shaped PIRG anomic
design giving you a full range of motion
so you can shave all those hard-to-reach
areas the back blade leaves no stubble
deep and with multi rows of our improved
2.0 blades you'll find that these
old-timers last for quite some time if
you need to change blades slide them out
and slide the new ones in and best of
all the back blade can be used both wet
or dry
don't be an 8 shave your own bed isn't
it about time you put the man back in
manscaping
we spent on average eight times more
time in our beds than in our cars but
for some reason our cars not climate
control and can now park and try
themselves while our beds pay the same
for hundreds of years at smart divan we
believe it's time for our beds to catch
up to the 21st century
introducing the smart vivid breeze the
world's first dual zone climate control
cell making peniel's well possibly even
single biggest innovation in our
bedrooms in the last 100 years in
addition to making the bed for you the
breeze lets you select your preferred
temperature for each side of the bed
independently using the smartphone app
avoiding all future arguments about room
temperature we were able to achieve both
climate control and self making bed
features through our patent-pending
inflatable suit placed seamlessly
between your duvet and duvet cover
no more sweaty nights spent regulating
your body temperature by leaving a leg
out of the duvet
