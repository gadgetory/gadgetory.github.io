bicycle helmet that provides integrated
lights with brake and turn signals I
love cycling because of the freedom it
gives me to get around quickly and
easily but I often feel invisible at
night even with my bike lights on that's
why I created Loomis I wanted to take
control of my own safety by building a
helmet that will make me more visible to
everyone on the road Lumos is a
next-generation helmet that brings
intuitive and common-sense features to
your most important piece of gear at its
core the most say comfortable helmet
designed to be both sleek and strong
with more than 60 of built-in LEDs Lumos
really helps you stand out at night
it's lights make you more visible in all
directions because they are higher and
larger than traditional bicycle mounted
lights and since they are part of the
helmet you don't have to worry about
your lights being stolen off your
bicycle or forgotten at home with a
built-in accelerometer
Lumos detects when you're slowing down
and automatically displays a brake light
so that people behind you and easily see
and react to your changing speed hand
turn signals are often hard to see at
night
Lumos displays left and right turn
signals controlled by a wireless remote
on your handlebar so that drivers can
see your intentions and give your space
we built limos to be rugged and
water-resistant with one button to turn
on and simple micro USB charging Lumos
is easy to use and fits seamlessly into
your daily routine after more than a
year of research and development here in
Boston we have a finalized design and
are working with a factory that has more
than twenty years of experience building
high quality helmets we are ready for
production but first we need your help
by backing this campaign you could be
one of the first people in the world to
receive this helmet and be part of the
movement for better cyclist safety to
get Lumos out on the road please also
consider sharing this with your friends
and people you know who bike thank you
so much for your support be seen and be
saved
it's been our ongoing mission into world
war and I just predict the future but to
make it and we're doing that by bringing
the world the most advanced virtual
reality glasses
the challenge first began three years
ago when we saw that many VR products
were being released but each product
kept getting larger and heavier there
were no companies focused on creating a
lightweight dr product that allowed
users to experience virtual reality
anywhere without being tied down to
computer desktops
so the magic happens in connecting the
v1 glasses to the d1 that's what allows
the VR experience to become completely
portable
the d1 you have a full-size computer in
your pocket it comes with two G's of RAM
and a touch screen that has summit to
sensory functionality that enables easy
control of the glasses the v1 and d1
have taken years of extensive
development and research
leading all the way to our current
product a single pair of lightweight
modern VR glasses that give our users a
complete VR immersion experience I go to
a lot of 3d movies and usually I'm
straining to see but with this this new
panoramic view I think this is something
I would like to invest in
it feels like you could just touch these
things that are right in front of you
what was your first experience of the
weight of the v1 that said they were so
light I just couldn't believe a lot of
the other ones to seem quite quite heavy
and a bit cumbersome these ones were
just like I was wearing a pair of
glasses
so far we've received great feedback
from folks all across the VR and tech
world that had a chance to try the v1
and d1 and that's why we're here we've
reached this point in our development
and we're here on Kickstarter to ask
backer support to help us launch the v1
and d1 to the world please make a pledge
and join our mission of bringing the v1
and d1 to market let's reinvent the
future and create a new world of VR
together
we all want to be that person the one
who wakes up early dives straight into a
morning meditation is super productive
at work drinks those eight glasses of
water Thanks and our brains want to
follow the ones we already have not the
new ones we're trying to cram in but
sometimes all you need is the right
nudge
hi I'm Kayla and meet Modi a smart
companion for building better habits we
created Modi with a distinct purpose to
empower people to take those small steps
that over time result in big impacts in
our health and happiness these more than
just a cute face Modi is designed in the
latest insights from both behavioral
science and social robotics when you
place Modi in your home or office every
time you walk by he becomes an instant
reminder to keep committed each time you
do your have it Modi is there to help
you track and celebrate your small wins
giving you that immediate gratification
the better you get the more excited 30
times but slack off and Modi might get
angry for SAP or stay purely encouraging
Modi knows what works best for you
because he's connected to the web he's
constantly analyzing and evolving so he
knows how you're progressing if you're
at risk of falling off and when to send
the right types of nudges specifically
for you compare all this to the same
daily push notification you keep
ignoring so how can something so simple
actually change your behavior to tell
you about how we form good habits let's
start with something that we're all
familiar with forming a bad habit boom
cookie fundamentally your brain needs
three things to form a habit a trigger a
routine and a reward when I saw that
plate of cookies I didn't even think
about grabbing one my brain immediately
triggered me and I knew that eating that
cookie would reward me with its sweet
doughy deliciousness your brain forms
good habits in just the same way by
completing this loop over and over again
Modi works by seamlessly integrating
these three elements into your busy
lifestyle Modi himself is a trigger more
specifically what's known as an
environmental cue and by using Modi your
habit is already set up to be small
distinct and actionable finally movie
celebrations provide an immediate reward
he makes sure that you feel satisfied
and accomplished each and every time and
perhaps a big guilty if you're not
moenay's the outcome of over a year of
human centered design and engineering
rigor we discovered that triggers and
rewards driven by emotion are far more
potent than numbers lists or alarms now
we're finally ready to release movies
straight to you the only question is
what habit will be formed
when we can't help you magically climb
Mount Everest or run a marathon
overnight he's there to help you do
something more essential become a better
view one habit at a time but we need
your help please back us and be a part
of bringing Modi to life I wanted a good
keyboard and there weren't any out there
I figured well how hard could this be
and then we built the best keyboard we
possibly could
it's not what you'd expect from keyboard
the people love it
creating a keyboard is kind of a weird
thing it's been in obsession hi I'm
Jesse Vincent I'm co-founder and CTO of
keyboard EO
I'm kaya Dekker I'm the CEO of keyboard
EO I'm also married to Jesse
most people are typing 8 plus hours a
day on uncomfortable flat plastic boxes
that are pretty much the same as they
were a hundred years ago you deserve
something better in a musician's not
like well just take the plastic guitar
off the shelf it'll be fine when I'm
staking my entire career and my you know
my professional everything on this like
they're really thinking about it I found
a bunch of research but better keyboard
layouts how your hands work and what
actually matters in keyboard design and
every he board designed in the last 20
years is flat-out ignored it so we built
a good keyboard the model one is
different it takes some getting used to
but it's worth it the model one is that
great sort of tool that supports the way
you want to work and that gets out of
the way unless you do the kind of work
that you can get done without it and I
love the way my fingertips kind of rest
in the keys and have easy two keys are
to reach we're trying to build a
keyboard you'll enjoy using for years we
have this gorgeous maple wood enclosure
you've sculpted the key caps to guide
your fingers to the right keys and yeah
it lights up the LEDs that glow from
under each key are actually totally
customizable and program
for regionally the butterfly shape was
an accident but we loved it it feels
warm it feels friendly ever gonna keep
right out in public and people look at
it and say can I touch it it's a
keyboard you're supposed to touch it
that's the whole point up till now we've
been designing and designing and
designing and testing and testing and
testing we've made dozens of prototypes
before we liked one enough to call it
the model one and now we're gonna make a
few thousand I spent most of my career
building open-source software it was
important to us that we build an amazing
product that wasn't going to be locked
down most products get worse over time
open products get better because it's
open source hardware I know that I can
customize it to my needs and then share
those customizations with the community
you're gonna get firmware source code
you're gonna get schematics to the
electronics you're gonna get a screw
driver even if you never touch a line of
code plenty of other typists will and
their work will make your keyboard
better this is a tool that I can use
over the next 20 years of my career
because it's going to grow with me and
so now it's possible for us to come to
all of you and share with you what we're
making thank you for paying attention it
means a lot to us if typing matters to
you please back our Kickstarter
time is the most valuable thing we have
and we should spend it consciously
in business tracking how we do that is
crucial but ironically it takes too much
time and effort that's why we have
created side we were struggling with
time tracking as many people do it's not
natural and easy to achieve it decreases
productivity and prevents us from
focusing on important things a lot of
people like scientists craftsmen
creatives engineers and many more have
to track their time but when we asked
how they are doing it we were surprised
how many just estimated at the end of
the day week or month which takes more
time and is very inaccurate sometimes
they even forget to account for hours
which results in lots of money because
they are not billable there are already
many powerful software solutions for
time tracking and we don't want to
replace them that's what I integrate
seamlessly into existing solutions just
import the projects assign them to a
site of site and start tracking turn to
switch between projects and breaks
considering that Sai will decorate a lot
of tests around the world our goal was
not only to create a functional product
but a product that looks good and also
feels good initially we spend a lot of
time finding the right geometry the most
obvious solution would have been to use
a cube but throughout the user
interviews Sai evolved an octagon the
beautiful shape with aids identical
sides giving space for eight different
projects clients Corrections the
labeling is totally up to you you can
put a sticker or a post-it on it are
used to supply the raisable pencil the
concavity of each side ensures to the
label the center of off by accident we
provide a mobile app as well so you can
use I on the go in case you forget to
switch or finish the task you can stop
edited afterwards and now it's up to you
because we need your head to go to
production and cover the certification
costs you can help us by backing this
campaign and spreading the word about
side together we can improve how time
tracking is done and help you to focus
more on the things you love
imagine all the hours and the costs you
can save with a small amount of money
please make this campaign and spread the
word about side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
