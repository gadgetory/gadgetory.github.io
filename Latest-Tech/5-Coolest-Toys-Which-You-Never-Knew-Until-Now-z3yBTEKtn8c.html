a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six or even ten feet high on but also
take anywhere you want to go the v4 is
the portable trampoline we've always
dreamed up with the v4 you have the
ability to add or remove air and
completely change the stiffness of the
bounce someone who weighs 300 pounds can
jump on the same exact v4 as someone who
only weighs 80 pounds all you need to do
is change the air pressure in less than
a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family a fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze
whether you're a pro or just stepping on
to the v4 for the very first time you'll
love the weightless flight like
experience you'll get the basics in
minutes and from that point on there's
no limit to how far you can challenge
yourself with the v4 you'll be able to
jump up onto ledges down stairs and over
gaps of all sizes while nailing down
some pretty awesome tricks after playing
around on the v4 you'll never look at
your surroundings in the same way again
obstacles and features that are too high
for bikes and skateboards are perfect
for the v4 so those of you looking for a
fun way to stay in shape the v4 will
worth most of the muscle groups in your
body and get your heart pounding
immediately it's a killer cardio workout
and the best part is that while you're
having fun bouncing around you won't
even realize how quickly you build a
sweat in order to achieve superior build
quality and maintain the high tolerances
necessary for the v4 to work we
manufacture and assemble it right here
in our Southern California shop we work
closely with our suppliers to become a
part of the build process and as each
component is made or right there to test
them
this streamlines are manufacturing and
ensures that every before we make is up
to our standards if you're looking for
the portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it
