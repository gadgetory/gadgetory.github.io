sleeping your dearest one wakes up
silently it has already preheated the
seat and water temperature using its
heating system and has been waiting for
your patient to have a wonderful day
the design of voice is smart Washlet
makes it easy for the aged people and
young children to operate the remote
control you will feel comfortable by the
intelligence of Technology when you seek
them it creates your bottom gently' by
intelligently more warm air drying and
intelligent washing function the design
of user-friendly remote control makes
you enjoy your time in the toilet just
like a mobile SmartWatch league has the
service of speech recognition and you
can operate it with your voice it offers
your family members more convenience to
have a great experience
in the toilet
Smart Watch live if you fresh and
enjoyment every single day the whole
family helps start from the beginning of
Sanitation we have explained two years
for the development of the smart
Washington and we would like to provide
superior quality for the consumers
around the world now we urgently need
the support of the sponsors and we
expect to bring you a quality education
experience in the future introducing new
blade a revolution in toilet cleaning
technology hi I'm here to tell you about
an invention that will revolutionize
ature that we all love to hate cleaning
the toilet recognized this the classic
toilet brush design has remained
unchanged for decades sad fact is it's
completely under proposal the bristles
clogged up very easily meaning they're
extremely hygienic and hard to clean
they retain water meaning they drip
everywhere and they're also extremely
inefficient hapless come back and forth
and they never clean under the room two
years ago I decided to do something
about it
in 2013 Gary brought together a team of
product designers engineers and material
specialists and went into the lab to
work on a new product that would help
change the way that toilets are cleaned
forever with its patented swipe clean
technology the silicon blades follow the
contours of the toilet bowl and reach
under the rim with ease swiping the
surface clean a silver-based editors
kills germs both during and after
cleaning and helps cut down bleach use
the blades do not get clogged up like
bristles and have a hydrophobic coating
that shit's water and dries quickly a
hollow-point head feature also helps
clear blockages
air flows freely through the holder to
quickly evaporate any remaining moisture
the let's look at how loo Glade helps
overcome the main failings of the toilet
brush the bristles of a toilet brush
quickly become clogged which is hard to
dislodge especially after it has dried
with a new blade the smooth flat
surfaces are easily kept clean and clear
with just a gentle shake after shaking
look how much potentially germ filled
and smelly water is still contained in
the brush
loon blades hydrophobic coating ensures
that all water is almost immediately
removed the bristles of a brush only
touch part of the surface which is why
you need to scrub back and forth to get
things clean with continuous contact loo
blades swipes the surface clean in a
single pass shaving us we know it is far
from perfect in courses razor burn
ingrown hair cuts bleeding and even in
ketchup and if you have sensitive skin
for a skin condition it's even more
difficult the US alone turns out two
billion rays of the year most can't be
recycled because they pose a health risk
so they end up in garbage dust
there must be a better way can we create
the eraser that does not cause
irritation a razor that shaves smoother
crow a razor that helps reduce waste
this is why we created the score razor
was working on lasers for cosmetic and
medical purposes I wondered could I put
this technology to barriers I wanted
something that would benefit every
single one of us
shaving what's the obvious officer the
industry has been looking for a laser
shaver for home juice for discovering a
viable technology has eluded everyone
until now wavelengths of light have been
discovered and capturing dark hair but
not light or gray
we wanted a laser that could cut all
hair many prototypes were built and of
the years of experimentation we have
done exactly what we were looking for we
identified molecules in the hair that
observe a particular wave these are
called carnivores this chromophores are
the only continuous structure in the
hair they're shared by everyone
regardless of age gender or race the
scalp razor is for everyone to use and
it works great on any area visit our
works a traditional razor cuts the hair
shaft at an angle this is what causes
your skin to fill run when the scalp
razor makes contact the laser melts
through the hair shaft completely level
to the surface of the skin this leaves a
smoother softer finish the last longer
to the touch we wake up each morning to
a brand new day a day of balance and
wellness we nourish our body with
healthy foods we physically stretch our
bodies in hopes of stretching our minds
everything we do goes back to our
well-being but there is one piece we
often tend to neglect from the wellness
puzzle introducing turbo a simple and
effective addition to your daily routine
before the 19th century toilets were
non-existent people used to squat to
release two thirds of the world actually
still do and for good reason as we
adopted the toilet into our lives we
unknowingly added tension and straining
during bowel movements
studies have shown us the perpendicular
posture brought on by the toilet creates
a kink in the colon which makes it
difficult to go
it also makes us susceptible to a number
of other health issues by elevating your
feet that kink disappears your muscles
are able to relax and your colon is open
for quick and efficient release and
that's why we invented several turbo is
an elegant yet affordable solution that
makes a great addition to any bathroom
it's sleek design allows for flexibility
and comfort the unique ramp design makes
using turbo easier for any person of any
size the lower toe area allows you to
easily load your feet then you can
position your feet forward or backward
on the ramp to adjust to a squat that's
just right for you
and with turbo squatting is only the
beginning turbo comes with
interchangeable massage rollers to
further increase your comfort on the
toilet not only does it feel good but it
can help with constipation to your feet
high pressure points that can stimulate
your colon when it's time to go
massaging with turbo also helps with
blood circulation which can improve your
energy levels to get you through the day
loading of the way three simultaneous
relaxed not only the body but the mind
as well you're removing ourselves from
the bombardment of your senses while
simultaneously relaxing your body on the
surface of the water and give you the
density of the salt water there's no
gravity you're actually escaping the
forces of gravity here on earth which
could spectacular pain relief it's
unlike anything else in terms of
relaxation and distressing and just kind
of unwinding at the end of your day
coding can help everyone in so many ways
it can help with pain relief it can help
you sleep better it can just give you
this place to be at peace so a foot pod
therapy we're moving away from what used
to be coin sensory deprivation and we're
going into sensory acceleration and so
what I mean by that is we're creating a
tool that essentially is allowing the
human being to realize with fuller
potential and so whether that is healing
the body through the body's own innate
ability to heal whether it's deep
relaxation for use in meditation or just
stress relief or levels just a better
night sleep this is a tool that humanity
as a whole just needs it's such a
multi-faceted tool there's so many
different people that enjoy floating
there's so many different ways in which
you can use the fourth thing I think
depending on the kind of person you are
there's a lot for you here
and the fruiting itself is a very
personal experience and we want to make
it even more personal and so the flow
pod comes standard with an mp3 player
and an iPod dock it's right on the side
of the pond so the user has easy access
to it and whether I have a cell phone or
an mp3 player iPod doesn't matter it
plugs right in and now I can finally
listen to all the tracks I've been
wanted to listen to in the past few
years of floating you know jokingly I
say that you know the guts of the float
pod belong inside of its body and so
everything is self-contained and so all
you do is you have that we have a little
access panel in the back that is
actually made out of fiberglass
so it's seamless if you're looking
around you take that access panel off
and you have your UV you have your motor
all of your electrical components things
like that just everything's
self-contained and that's genius the
easy change filter is really from a spa
owner perspective we've been waiting for
that for years it's actually inside of
the float area and now I can do a change
in 30 seconds that's that for me is a
game changer the forethought has a
multicolored LED system that's directly
controlled from inside of the pod and so
by simply toggling the button itself you
can switch through different single
colors you can pause on whatever color
you'd like just for some color therapy
as well as you can enjoy a really
soothing color cycle alternatively if
you're just looking for pure silence and
darkness it's very easy to just turn off
the light and be left there with
yourself
so with a float pod the built-in heater
keeps the temperature constant no matter
if you're floating for one hour or two
or five it keeps the temperature
completely consistent throughout so that
there's no fluctuation at all
it's very nice now that we have
everything integrated into the body of
the float pod and we're controlling the
air temperature naturally in the cabin
we've noticed that the air is a lot
drier there's not that dense feeling
when you're trying to breathe now what's
really neat about this is it has very
little condensation and flow pods tanks
ago everyone knows that condensation is
a huge problem the design of the pod
makes it so condensation falls and then
now that we're heating the air around it
it's we almost have no condensation
truly remarkable the float pot also
features an intercom system and what
that allows is just an easy conversation
between the people working in the spa
and the floaters in the back it's a
little someone forgot towel or needs you
for any reason at all it's just one push
of a button and you're right there one
of the best features about the flew pod
is that it offers constant filtration
when someone's not floating it also
includes ozone and UV the ozone is
basically an oxidizer and now what's
going to happen is that's going to
bubble and you'll see all these
wonderful little bubbles coming up it
starts to smell amazing very fresh and
it dissipates within just 20 seconds so
when that shuts off and you're showering
and you get in there's no ambient ozone
in the air it's just in the water does a
great job of oxidizing it the UV is
interesting so the UV will basically use
photons like UV light and bombard cells
with photons and that's how it destroys
things and so even the beneficial things
I could grow such as algae and it's all
a lot of fish tank for example is made
inert by the UV we have basically four
four inputs and two drains now what's
really interesting is the four intakes
to have ozone that are infused into it
so instead of having one jet that just
pushes out of a single tube and doesn't
really create that much of a flow the
four outputs really create this perfect
flow of water and so because of the
combination of uvz ozone the flow the
solar system is one comprehensive system
there's no scub line it's remarkable
so if you've ever dreamed of opening
your own float center I think this is
your chance what you have here is a
product that provides relaxation unlike
anything else on this planet you're
starting to see flow pods pop up in yoga
studios as the perfect shavasana after a
practice you're seeing flow pods in
locker rooms of gyms because they're
really able to reduce recovery time
after a heavy workout I take full pods
are miraculous in the pain center of any
kind of physical rehabilitation
environment just because of the amount
of pain relief and the relaxation that
if one hour in a flow tank provides
ideally I see floating going into not
only commercial spas but also into
residential homes into hospitals this is
something that can be used across a
variety of different market this is
something that can be used in your home
every single day this can be used in a
spa setting it can be used in a Wellness
Center in conjunction with other
therapies this is literally the tool of
the future for wellness
