its kind charging solution that we
believe will change the way people
charge on the go creating the charge
module was undoubtedly the most
challenging part of this project working
directly with our industry leading an
apple approved manufacturer from day one
we prototype several iterations of the
design to perfect the balance between
charge capacity and overall size the
result is amazing and we've been able to
fit twelve hundred milliamps or sixty
percent extra charge into a form factor
that fits neatly in your coin pocket
another great feature is that the charge
module only takes 60 minutes to charge
your iPhone so I get in power up and put
it away once it's finished augment not
just convenient when you're out and
about once you've used the charge module
you can simply connect it to your phone
plug in the microUSB cable and charge by
the iPhone and charged by the
simultaneously the ordinary case itself
is unique in a number of ways primarily
designed to protect your iPhone case
offers 360-degree jeweler protection the
visually impressive and iPhone
transforming squared design is driven by
the inclusion of the mounting system in
the base which allows for secure and
seamless attachment of the charge module
but we've also added some personality of
a time and applied a combination of
strong visual elements to create what we
think is one of the most beautiful and
unique cases on the market aldermen
charge modules can be used with or
without the augment case but for the
best experience we recommend using both
together meet John John enjoys working
on his new back book but you can't plug
in other devices because he only has one
port meet Sarah Sarah also enjoys
working on her new MacBook but the
difference is Sarah uses qs b qs b is a
modular expandable solution for the
connectivity of your USB c laptop it
expands the capabilities of the new USBC
port standard unlike John Sarah is able
to charge her macbook sink or phone
transfer files between devices and
connect your keyboard or mouse at the
same time for every Q's B Sarah connects
a new USB C port is created so she can
enjoy working on her MacBook without
having to plug in one device at a time
our Q's BT is determined to put our
efforts into making products that will
have a meaningful role in people's lives
we are now in the final development
stages of making Q's be accessible to
you pledge now and change the way you
use your MacBook forever pues be USBC
modular expandable
what if your smartphone could stay ahead
of the pack what if you could add
additional features that you never
thought would be possible on your mobile
device next pack is a modular smartphone
case that allows you to customize your
phone to do more and to allow you to do
more with your phone how does it work
slide your phone into the next pack case
add some modules access the app and
enjoy the unique features in each module
provides we've already created 12
modules to get you going and there's
more to come next pack is the first
phone case that allows you to switch
hardware between Android and Apple
devices this means you can trade modules
with friends and family and experience
the different features each module
provides if you do choose to upgrade
your phone all you'll need to do is
change your case and your modules will
always work with you think about an app
store 4 modules that can enhance your
phone whenever we show it to someone we
get some crazy ideas for future modules
this is refund the world's first
open-source modular phone kit that
allows you to easily create your own
mobile phone the result is the refund
the heart of the refun is a GSM module
featuring the world's smallest computer
on a chip that easily fits to anything
give your refill life by adding a
touchscreen audio
GPS NFC motion sensor camera a single
eye display and many other cool modules
just plug modules together using
flexible NFC strips once connected you
can send text and make calls and even
program your own logic update your
settings with a simple text and a
full-power SDK block and JavaScript are
ready for developers next give your
refund a body by using the pre-cut craft
paper play with different design
patterns to make a phone unique to you
or consider leather bamboo fabric or
existing objects even create a sturdy
case using 3d printing laser cutting CNC
or injection molding imagine making a
call to your dog by adding the GSM and
GPS module to the dog collar program
your e phone with it fists and that
logic so your dog never gets lost or
gyros and GSM modules to a kite and talk
to the sky
forcing messages to control your robots
remotely
talk to a door desk bike retreat
and we partnered with incredible people
organizations and companies around the
world to bring the refund to you make
your call

your iPhone and Android smartphones we
have been approached and have partnered
up with major tech companies from around
the world to bring the best SmartWatch
on the planet to your wrist and as an
open platform we will soon allow anyone
to develop modules</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
