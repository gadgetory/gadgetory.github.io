for energy our machines vehicles and
factories all demanded yet most of the
energy we use is wasted over 30 trillion
watt hours of heat per year are wasted
by power plant alone enough to power the
entire world and our environment is part
of the collateral damage over 15 billion
batteries are thrown away in landfills
every year at matrix we wanted to create
technology that makes the way we use
energy more efficient and more intimate
we wanted to start with a problem
everyone has experienced firsthand
feeling frustrated when your electronic
device runs out of power when you need
it the most
there hasn't been any innovation to
solve this problem and that God is
excited to solve it using our
thermoelectric technology after five
years and several prototypes we're
introducing our first product the matrix
power launch it's a SmartWatch that's
powered by you it works by converting
your own body feeds to electric power
and the best part is you never have to
charge it the walk comes alive because
it's powered by you the human body at
rest emits 100 watts as similar to that
of an incandescent lightbulb when
exercising that number jumps to one
kilowatt similar to the average power we
use in a home
what's so cool about this watch is that
as you exercise and your skin gets
warmer the power walk generates more
power it's got a unique power meter that
shows how much elecricity your body has
generated right on the face of the water
we can do some exciting things with this
technology like accurately measure the
amount of calories you burn our
thermoelectric technology measures the
amount of heat you've generated from the
calories you consume it's also packed
with all the features you'd expect in a
SmartWatch it has sensors track growth
activity and sleep quality we're
designing changeable watch faces to suit
your mood
we also built micro applications so you
can do more than just tell the time and
of course it syncs with your phone and
your account in the cloud arguing to
running mountaineering trailblazing it
works even better when you're out and
about especially in cold weather since
you never have to charge it or replace
the batteries it's very well filled and
water resistant to 50 meters and if you
ever take it off you'll go to sleep and
store all your data when you put it back
on it comes back to life
Oh
it sucks when we need our phone the most
and it runs out of juice
this is preserve the world's most
energy-efficient mobile phone charger
and power bank combined the way it works
is amazingly simple you connect your USB
cable to preserve when charging once
your mobile is fully charged the
electricity stops going to the phone and
starts preserving the energy in the
power bank magic preserve is not just a
power bank but also has a removable
battery that fits nicely into any wallet
it will give you an extra 30% juice when
you need it most
this feature makes preserve the first
power bank in the world that can be used
in two different locations at the same
time these days power bank users carry
more charge than they actually need a
practice that is extremely inconvenient
when you use preserve you simply save
time and increase the efficiency and
longevity of your phone
I've always loved writing the feeling of
being one with the road til your
headphones fall

have to worry about your helmet

experience ever again and with strategic
microphone placement your calls will
always be crystal clear without having
to worry about windows you've built slim
BOTS with passive noise isolation
technology allowing for the most
immersive audio experience you've ever
had while writing at us safety is very
important to us as good as our slim bud
sound we are equally focused on keeping
you safe while riding inside the chin
mic there's a secondary microphone
dedicated to picking up and relaying
environmental noise this means that
you'll hear horns sirens and anything
else you need to hear while riding

searching for the perfect shape
Gaming with smart razor feels good it's
the perfect shade with just a push of a
button
here's how it works each hair has a
tough outer layer that resists being
caught by regular blades
our smart technology brings the precise
amount of heat to the cutting edge of
the blades which instantly breaks down
the proteins cutting through the hair
with virtually no cover Pole smart razor
shades closer and makes shaving
enjoyable our grandfathers knew their
old-fashioned barber shop hot shaves
were the best now with smart razor you
can have a close soothing heated shave
anytime right at home the heated blades
cut hair like a warm knife through
butter
spot razor is scientifically proven
through independent laboratory testing
to cut hair 200% easier than the leading
brands non-heated blades that means a
much closer shave and your blades will
last three times longer
how about razor rash and razor bumps
it's unsightly and it hurts
with current razors shaving sensitive
areas with cold metal blades contracts
the skin and makes tiny goose bumps
those blades then cut the tips causing
razor rash with smart razor the opposite
happens the heated blades warm your skin
so it relaxes and lies flat allowing the
blades to glide through your hair smooth
a smart razor sleek design combines
style and functionality the power source
and microprocessor are sealed within the
watertight casing the razor cartridges
are replaceable and have six heated
blades just press the button
the blades heat up in three seconds
shave is normal and the smart
electronics will maintain the optimal
warm temperature automatically
throughout your entire shave
if you forget to turn it off no worries
it's programmed to turn off
automatically the technology behind the
smart razor is so unique that it is one
of the most protected new razor
innovations ever
