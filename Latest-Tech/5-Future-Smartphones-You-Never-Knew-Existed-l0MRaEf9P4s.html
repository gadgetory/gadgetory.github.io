yourself sharing your creativity
whatever happened to the days in mobile
when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so where sometimes
even considered wacky we needed to
design a device that was not only an
incredible phone but also an amazing
wearable I used to repair a lot of
phones I had crack screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brand's
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and vetting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
and before you knew it the portal was
born
you
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and where we needed to
build a team of incredible people with
the wide range of skill sets who are all
unified to pursue our mission and break
the mold in the mobile market the
problem with the mobile market right now
is that the phones are all the same and
what little differentiation they have is
that some are less user-friendly and
some are less durable things like this
still happen so we're here to change
that with the vibrant pallets clean
typography and easy to understand icon
set the portal UI is experience it
cannot be missed why be stuck with the
same old design when you've got a new
refreshing interface to play with an
interface that hurts you interact that
knows what you want and works with you
in the way that you want it to work the
portal not only has all the features you
would expect such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC but also has a waterproof Kevlar
infuse polyurethane body a six inch
flexible display wireless charging an
unlock network and so much more
you
hello my name is Alejandro Santa Cruz
and I am the CEO of circular devices the
Finnish company behind the puzzle form
the puzzle phone and it's friendly
modularity it's easy to upgrade and is
designed to last up to 10 years by
supporting our campaign you will help us
to change the industry
we are bringing an alternative to all of
you we know that you want more
sustainable long-lasting devices and
that's what puzzle firm stands for this
is puzzle fun puzzle foam is a modular
mobile phone it's made up of three parts
the brain has all of the functionality
the spine has the display and the heart
has the antenna and the battery we
believe this makes sense from a point of
view of functionality but also from the
user upgrading and allowing flexibility
for second use and also potentially to
allow open source designers to develop
their own modules
at the moment we are working with the
whole old hueco system to enable the
puzzle fold creation with modular
product design we need to focus on the
quality and reliability of the modules
we are strongly focusing our efforts to
make sure that the product fulfills the
end-user expectations of modularity and
upgradability
as engineers we are always looking for
challenges like the puzzle form we
already have a working demonstrator and
a model of the final design we know what
needs to be done to make this prototype
into this complete product your support
now is crucial to get these pieces of
the puzzle together
by supporting us you will be triggering
the paradigm shift from take make and
done to upgrade reuse and recycle
we are the androids you have been
waiting for
here we are it's us meet this guy and
this guy him too now meet Robin this is
the other side we made a smart phone the
only cloud first design forward smart
phone we wanted something new something
different a reboot no one is making a
smart smart phone when you get so big
it's hard to see the forest through the
trees let alone the cloud from the
forest their phones run out of space and
make you delete stuff you don't want to
drop your phone you have to start all
over it's not smart it since Robin can
run up here
it always has enough storage this icon
this one's better and since we actively
manage the data you can keep your photos
songs videos and apps and it does it by
being smart by learning by adapting
don't use something for a while we'll
hold it up here you need it back we make
it rain they can chase gigs will rock
the cloud
also Robin looks badass
and kicks ass
it's a super phone that's why we wrote
it down this is our crew badass fearless
makers with fearless experience our dogs
have tricks our interns have tricks
there's so much talent working to unlock
the power of the cloud day and night
this stuff ain't easy but nothing this
special is easy instead of going to a
carrier or bring the special directly to
you we're bringing you a special smarter
super smartphone that adapts to life as
you live it you have what you need when
you need it wherever you are so that's
it we think it's pretty great if you do
too and join us on Kickstarter let's
keep doing this our way from us straight
to you always or next bit get next now
what is being creative creativity is no
longer a word reserved for the musician
or the artist it's something you can
find in anyone it's the ability and the
urge to make something of value
it can be big it can be small
but making something new something
different something that surprises
something that makes you think something
that makes you smile it's making
something beautiful
it's telling a story it's telling your
story expressing yourself it's about
being passionate it's creating something
other people can use sharing your
creativity it's about realizing that
there isn't always a right or a wrong
way of doing things there's not always a
correct answer
only the answers that we create
what's common for creativity is that it
comes from inspiration
inspiration found in the world we live
in and then the people we live with
it's found when we share with them
building on what's given from the
diversity of people's thoughts and
perspectives
so try and drop the assumptions that you
know how to do things and already know
the solution stray away from the direct
path to take risks don't be afraid to
make mistakes
because it's only from the mistakes that
we learn and it's from the mistakes that
the really interesting things happen
we may not always create or invent
but we always learned when they try
one
