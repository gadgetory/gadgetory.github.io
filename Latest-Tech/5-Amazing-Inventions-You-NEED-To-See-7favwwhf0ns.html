distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation why
isn't there a single tool that lets us
measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and at work bagel has
three different modes string mode wheel
mode and remote my string mode is great
for measuring straight lines curves and
around corners wheel mode lets you
measure irregular or odd shaped objects
and it also makes taking measurements
with one hand much easier remote mode
lets you measure objects that are far
away and out of your reach after you're
done measuring you'll need a way to
record your measurements using pen and
paper can be a real hassle with bagel
you can quickly and easily save your
measurements with voice descriptions
just take your measurement push the save
button and then tag a voice memo to it
dog the future ADA when you're done
bangle will send your measurements to
bagels mobile app via bluetooth this
mobile application lets you review your
saved measurements and share them with
your friends bagel is precise it uses
our patented technology to make sure you
always get an accurate measurement also
bagel has an easy-to-read digital
display that's viewable in most lighting
conditions
in the past few years also some
measuring devices have become smarter
and made our lives easier it's not
scales smell thermometers and even
smartwatches but when it comes to
measuring size we still use a cape
measure which is more than a century old
why don't innovate the way we measure
size so we created bagel a smart tape
measure we put a lot of effort into
creating bagel our team work night and
day to make the best quality product
with the spender design we have our
final prototype that is ready for mass
production now we need your help to
deliver this amazing product to everyone
please help us bring this bagel to life
thank
size matters

millions of americans commute less than
10 miles every day but the tree from
home to the office is usually very
inefficient we thought we could do
better
the CMYK four-point-oh is the next
evolution and electric commuting lines
it's smart technology and sensors help
you bypass beat-up streets traffic jams
construction site so you can get to work
easier and faster but the tree from home
to the office is usually very
inefficient and we really thought that
we could better designed by communal
experience today we are launching an
IndieGoGo campaign to fund production of
this smart folding electric by the CMYK
four-point-oh is a bike that thinks one
step ahead of its rider the CMYK
four-point-oh is loaded with features
for the urban biker including advanced
hardware built in brains and mobile
integration
the brains inside the bike are a
processor a gyroscope and accelerometer
it also has a cadence sensor in heart
rate monitor the mobile integration
built into CMYK four-point-oh crunches
all of the data collected by these
sensors and displays it on your phone
through built-in Bluetooth connectivity
the mobile apps direct integration with
the bike tells you stats like speed
cadence ride duration temperature heart
rate and distance we started this
project about five years ago designing
the first version of the CMYK today
we're introducing CMYK number four we
learn a lot along the way and we want to
bring all these good things to you hi my
name is Manuel sighs I'm the founder and
CEO of Brooklyn's buy back in this
project giving us feedback or sharing
with friends you can help us make this
project possible let's all design a
better bike commuting experience thank
