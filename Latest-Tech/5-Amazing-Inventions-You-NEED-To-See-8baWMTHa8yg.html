perfect backup plan
the portable versatile talon by tactical
modern life presents challenges work
sports adventures small things can
easily blow out and become big talent
helps keep the small things small made
with an advanced composite technology
and world-first patent-pending design
the talon packs 17 tools and features to
match in a pocket-sized carry it comes
with metric and imperial wrenches and
rulers box cutter bottle opener and
standard quarter-inch Phillips and
flathead hack stripes the talon adapts
to your life simply swap out the hex
drives for your next adventure whether
you need an Allen head throated stalks
the Talon holds two within its body a
flexible elastomer keeps the tools
locked in place and ready when you need
them the original socket design allows
your hand to be positioned as you would
with a regular screwdriver a feature
that many pocket tools don't allow the
talon is made of one of the world's most
advanced composite materials 40% lighter
than titanium and the strength of
diecast metal plus the material tech
allows you to carry your talent without
fear of scratching your latest phone or
tablet the talon can go anywhere you do
and it complies with current tsa
requirements for air travel the
australian designed engineered and
manufactured talon multi-tool by
tactical compact enough to carry
everyday lightweight enough not to weigh
you down
heavy duty enough to get things done
talon in your hand enough said
two years ago we bought you tactic is
first crowdfunding campaign the one
bottle opener and now we have our latest
innovation ready for you
Talyn pushes the limits with materials
technology and functionality its patent
pending design is made possible by using
an advanced composite material this
makes it super strong and enables the
unique unibody design that increases
strength and hardness we've also created
a dual purpose storage compartment into
the design to function as a socket
something that hasn't been possible in a
multi-tool until now we make the Talon
in Melbourne Australia and over the past
few months our team has worked closely
to perfect the design for manufacture
it's great to be involved again with the
same factory that produces our popular
one bottle opener this kind of
collaborations make sure that everyone
involved has a deep understanding of the
project and the high standards we expect
having a local manufacturer also reduces
the risks usually associated with
overseas manufacture now waiting on
shipments faulty products or delivery
delays will be right there in front of
the machine as they come off the line it
doesn't get any more personal than that
importantly tooling has already
commenced yes that's right
we've made the decision to launch
straight into the production process
because we reckon you're going to want
one or two in time for Christmas we're
tooling the molds now and we'll be ready
for full-scale production well before
Christmas thanks for the support and
look forward to getting a talent in your
hand soon
you
hi i'm richard and i'm the designer of
the award-winning go cycle electric bike
some of you may already know a bit about
my story and have followed our progress
in europe to all of our early customers
and supporters thank you for getting go
cycle this far for those of you that may
have just discovered us on Kickstarter
welcome this is our story in 2002 I left
the dream job at McLaren cars and from
my one-bedroom London flat I began to
design the best folding electric bike in
the world I traveled the globe pitching
go cycle to all the big bike companies
and they all said it couldn't be done so
I started a company and in 2009 we
launched the iconic go cycle g1 followed
by the award-winning go cycle g2 and now
the best go cycle yet the amazing go
cycle g3 but it's not been easy slowly
we built up our team and we work hard to
establish ourselves in Europe but my
vision for go cycle is global and that's
why we're on Kickstarter we want to
break into the North American market
with a new model the go cycle GS making
stuff is hard making the best holding a
bike in the world is really hard you've
got to do a load of testing and I mean a
load of testing because mother nature's
rulebook is tough and there's no undo
button in engineering when you're
developing something new failure and
progress go hand in hand
and we've developed decades of
experience designing lightweight bicycle
parts at go cycle we cook with different
ingredients like our high-tech injection
molded magnesium frame and when it comes
to innovation nothing compares to our
clean drive which keeps oil and dirt off
your clothes
performance is in our DNA our drive
system is light and compact it's four
times the power density of any other
ebike on the market
I designed go cycle should be two wheel
drive the motor powers of front you
power the rear that's the lightest
possible ebuy configuration you can get
and it means the go cycle is balanced
and easy to handle but I've saved the
best for last
our patented pitstop wheel this cool
side mounted design not only looks great
but it means the wheels are quick and
easy to remove of course go cycle is
portable modular and compact this is
hands-down the most versatile ebike
you'll ever
some people are natural sleepers others
not so much a great day starts with a
good night so why don't we pay more
attention to sleep meet Kelo more than
an alarm clock it's an advanced sleep
trainer that helps you fall asleep
faster snooze less wake up earlier tune
your body clock and much more
Kelo is leading the sleep revolution it
starts with looking forward to waking up
with the sounds you love and without
your phone with smart home integration
you won't even have to get up to turn
off the lights
Kelo gets you to sleep in no time just
follow kilos lights with your breath and
you'll slow down to your natural rhythm
for sleep ditching the snooze button is
tricky because it's so tempting to
squeeze in those extra minutes lucky for
you
Kellogg's got you covered it only allows
you to press snooze say three times a
week
Kelo can also help you wake up earlier
so you can get more time for yourself in
the morning it trims a few minutes from
your wakeup time every day and within a
few weeks you'll really wake up earlier
without even realizing
Kelo makes tuning your body clock simple
so as you start the morning after a
great night's sleep
Kelo helps unlock the potential of your
day wake up to a better sleep and back
Kelo now full sleep makes us feel a word
out and unproductive that's why we
jumped on admission to fix this we did
research on the body clock on sleep on
waking up and we asked you how you
pictured your perfect morning
Keller will be by your side every night
and every morning that's why we had to
make it personal and beautiful
we relocate it to Asia to be closer to
our factories we are with the best
experts in hardware design and
manufacturing we've been working with
the kalam for more than a year
I wake up to Kelo every day and it's
incredible it helps you fall asleep
recover from jet lag ultimately to train
your body clock the products almost
finished and the manufacturing plant is
in place today dozens of it at this this
wake up to kill oh we have the team we
have the product and now we need you we
can all become better at morning and
sleep so back hello down
one so here's the problem we're always
on the move we want to be prepared for
the unexpected and that's not always
easy so we came up with a solution a way
to always be ready
we call it the cash bail by Wazzu and
it's designed to be the ultimate
adventure accessory it's a money belt a
travel tool a utility belt a survival
kit whatever you make it our mindset is
this and you're prepared for the
unexpected you can have the confidence
to step into the unknown and you open up
your leg to any cat you choose so we
designed the belt with two goals in mind
one that's to fit with all aspects of
our lives we made a belt milspec webbing
rated at 1500 pounds with a perfect fit
camming adjustable buckle and we're
making it in America because we want to
but also and this is the best part we
needed something highly functional so
the cash belt was designed with a velcro
enclosure that's over 2 feet long for
carrying the essentials and it's fully
customizable we've come up with a lot of
ways to use it but first you're probably
wondering without our we wear wazoo
survival gear for engineers
travelers designers all-around
adventures we've been designing wearable
survival kits for over five years like
bracelets with dozens of different tools
and hats with secret pockets our goal is
that maximum functionality to everyday
items so when you buy a cash belt the
hang tag doubles as a coaster and our
business cards at burnable double has
fire starters we consider the cash belt
the culmination of our experience and
the next step in our evolution starting
with the concept of EDC everyday carry
you probably don't leave the houses out
of belt and with the cash belt you can
lean fully prepared without feeling
encumbered by extra items we've been
attested this beast in our own lives
taking it all around the world and it
passed the test so we're proud to offer
to you in three different options the
first is the minimalist belt that you
customize we find it works great as an
easy to access money belt making it a
perfect travel accessory and great for
when you need access to money and other
items on the go
plus it looks so it's a great
alternative to the goofy-looking money
belts currently on the market when we
travel we use it for a copy of our
passport and other travel Doc's cash in
multiple currencies air B&amp;amp;B key and
memory cards the second option is a cash
belt stock the essentials kit it's a TSA
friendly everyday carry kit that
provides you the strong foundation for
unexpected situations while still living
room for you to customize it with your
own items the third option is a cash
belt stock with the adventure kit we
think the best survival kit is the one
you have with you so we used all our
experience designing survival gear build
our most extensive kit yet it includes
if you're ready for this paracord gear
loops a wire saw zip ties Kevlar cord
ceramic knife and striker a flashlight a
Ferro rod trail markers first-aid tender
a whistle safety pins and a fishing kit
with fishing line that doubles as sewing
thread with a needle plus brass wire
duct tape ranger bands a compass
signaling mirror bandages a water
pre-filter and water bag plus
purification tablets or you can just
boil the water in the bag for real plus
aluminum foil and it's all in the belt
about we wear every day because in the
end we don't know what we're gonna get
into
that's a mixes game so exciting it's an
adventure you are ready we'll see you
out there oh and every version comes
with a bottle opener</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
