magnetic charging adapter it
revolutionized the charging experience
for MacBook users
it's compact simple and safe it
prevented unwanted accidents and made
charging easier but that was almost 10
years ago so why hasn't something
similar been made for our mobile devices
we ventured into tackling this challenge
last year and recall it snaps with snaps
you can charge a mobile device in the
easiest way possible for when you only
have one hand free pull you're in a
hurry to head out
snaps is all about making your life just
a bit more convenient it also protects
your phone wherever you are
one of the biggest hurdles in designing
snaps was its compact size we wanted to
make sure that it is compatible with any
phone case you might have to achieve
that we custom-made many of the internal
components after numerous prototypes and
countless hours of testing we've finally
condensed snaps into the size of your
fingertip quick simple convenient it
snaps
we're proud to share with you today a
product we've been developing it's glow
the first smart headphones that glow
with laser light music inherently is a
very expressive medium and having light
synchronize with music makes that whole
experience much better I think that's
where glow really stands out it's a pair
of headphones but it's also something
that builds up that musical expression
through the form of light the first time
we saw vibrance fiber optical wire was
really incredible that vibrance is just
super vibrant it looks like something
I've never seen before like something
magical the expression actually went
back to our childhood when the movies we
used to watch and hold squeeze to read
was portrayed light and lasers as sort
of the future the first time we were
actually able to see laser wire in the
form of fibrous wire and we got the idea
that maybe we can use this to actually
create a product with it and that's
where we thought the idea of a headphone
is that says sort of a natural
connection of a glowing wire with a pair
of headphones you have the wire glow to
the music with glow we've actually
provided five buttons to be able to
control your music prior headphone
designs don't give you that flexibility
they're a lot more complicated because
they only have a single button glow has
a tight integration with the Android
platform so we're able to use and
leverage that platform to do very cool
things for example I can take a picture
by hitting the center button or I could
even trigger Google now and use voice
actions to control my phone it wasn't
enough that we built an expressive pair
of headphones we wanted the audio
quality to be absolutely amazing
we've come up with a lot of infinite
designs such as the negative profile
which allows you to even take a nap with
your headphones we also chose a in-ear
design because it's minimizes the
external interference of the sound which
allows the music to be a lot more crisp
and have deeper bass over the last few
months we've been building a fully
working prototype and we're there but
now we need your help to take glow from
a prototype to final manufacturing to be
able to bring this to market it's not
enough that we have a fully working
prototype we need the backing of the
community we need the Kickstarter
community thank you for taking the time
out to watch this video we're super
excited about this technology these
headphones but we hope you're as excited
as we are
this is Nuria the first window air
conditioner designed with you in mind
Nuria is 40% smaller than standard air
conditioners and less than six inches
tall unlike typical window air
conditioners Nuria lets you keep your
view Nuria is smart using Android or iOS

a schedule to save power when Nona's
home
noria can bring fresh air into your home
on those cool September nights not even
central air can do that you don't have
to be a bodybuilder to install Nuria the
lightweight frame is installed first
making secure installation a breeze

to hold a heavy awkward object in place
for minutes at a time with Nuria
installation is a one-person job storage
is easy allowing you to keep it under
the bed when not needed
noria renew your PA
we are an established product
development team in Philadelphia with
experience in bringing product designs
from concept to production our team
members have decades of experience in
engineering highly technical products
with expertise in thermal engineering
and aerodynamics electrical engineering
and industrial design for the past two
years we've been developing nuria from
the ground up along the way we've
developed numerous prototypes as we've
perfected the technology we're ready to
make the next step and bring it into
production now we need your help to
bring it to your home
us photographers sometimes we just don't
bother to break tripod
maybe when triforces long loud or that
when shoveling or it just won't be like
to eat but when we're taking pictures in
the less ideal condition it might not
end up so good
that's why we invented the mini pastor
had a super small Turnitin solution two
tripods dark could be set up with tables
railings handrails etc it's more light
and easy to use which supports most
cameras including professional DSLR
there is a special mechanism to Papeete
the buckle which prevents accidental
disintegrates shows Auto is strong
enough from the fixings a simple white
cause slightly not for most dots and
dirt it was also built to withstand
stretching and bending you just have
break it

hello I'm Daniel Barrow fan of the most
efficient pool charger ever made the
juice box juice box was founded in the
great city of San Francisco and our team
cannot wait to share with all of you for
the very first time
My partner and I technic melon first met
Stanford University we envisioned a
method that innovated the way we all
charge our mobile devices so we began by
finding the highest quality components
available and assemble them into the
most proficient portal charger on the
market today
once all necessary testing was completed
the first fully functional juice box was
created our team is ready for our
large-scale production and all funding
will be used directly to fulfill future
design and manufacturing while allowing
the juice box become more accessible
around the world charging the juice box
only takes roughly 20 minutes and when
you need it you simply plug it in and
juice box power your phone or tablet for
upwards of an hour and if some design is
compact enough to go virtually
undetected during the charging process
cloth this set we are proud to be
offering the juice box today following
$9 we include a wall charger a micro USB
to charge the juice box and of course
the juice box itself with attention to
detail the micro USB cable we include is
high quality and double shielded to help
prevent fraying and from all of us here
at juice box headquarters we hope we
share this adventure with all of you and
we are also grateful if you have any
questions please do not hesitate to
email our team and again thank you all
so much for helping the juice box become
a reality thanks for watching our video
on the juice box now we'll be just
demonstrating on just how our product
works when you receive the juice box
said you'll get it one a wall adapter
and the micro USB charging cable when
you receive the kit plug the USB cable
into the wall adapter and little plug
USB charging cable into the back of the
juice box allow it to charge for about
20 to 25 minutes and then it should be
ready for use after charging it take
your juice box and simply plug it into
your phone or any lightning compatible
device
today we'll be using an Apple iPhone 6
to demonstrate the juice boxes features
it's just like using any other charger
all you simply have to do is plug it in
and it will start the charging sequence
as always as you can see on this device
it is almost dead but after we plug in
the juice box here you'll be able to
hear the tone the second we plug it in
there and now you can see that the
device is charging there is the
lightning bolt next to the power and
that's it that's all you've got to do
it's simple guys thanks for interest in
our product
our microUSB version of our juice box
punch is exactly the same as our
lightning version other than having a
different connector at the tip for
demonstration we'll be using a Vizio
tablet that takes a micro USB connection
to charge it all you simply have to do
is the same plug it in and it will be
charging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
