to latest tech we don't want our channel
to be just about the latest gadgets in
new technology but to show you some
interesting things about everyday
objects or facts and things you might
have never heard before like screws for
example screws are everywhere right
they hold your life and furniture
together screws come in all different
shapes and sizes but chances are you're
probably only familiar with a few of
them there's Phillips and flathead and
if you're from Canada there is square
Robertson story as well but that is only
the tip of the screwy iceberg here's a
brief tour of some of the screws you
might have never heard before trust me
you'll be surprised eleven strange
screws you don't see every day
number one more torque the more turrets
screw was built by the Phillips screw
company and there's a resemblance
between it and the company's signature
screw the main advantage the more torque
screw offers is as the name implies more
torque specifically the wide wings of
the screw make for thicker and stronger
drill bits and the increased contact
area means more forces applied to screw
essentially this is a heavy-duty
Phillips screw commonly used in
automotive and aerospace work number two
pentalobe you may have some pentalobe
screws lying around if you own an Apple
device pentalobe screws were first
implemented by Apple in 2009 on its
MacBook Pro battery cases since then
they've been implemented externally on
several MacBook models and in every
iPhone since the iPhone port the primary
purpose of pentalobe screws is
essentially just to be obscure so you
won't automatically have the right
screwdriver to fit them it's a moves to
curb tampering and fiddling with apples
characteristically closed devices
although now that Apple puts them on
everything pentalobe screw drivers are
pretty easy to find number three one
wastrels one way screws come in all
kinds of different shapes but they're
all used for the same purpose turning
one way and
only typically these crews are designed
to fit slotted screwdrivers and feature
a gentle slope in one direction that
provides you a torque they're commonly
found in public restrooms and other
places where people shouldn't be on
screen things numbered four blocks the
lock screw has the shape of four
overlapping squares the idea behind this
type of store is to increase the number
of contact points which increases torque
and decreases where lock screws have 12
contact points one for each side many
more than the four contact points on
Philips or Robertson screws
this makes lock screws well suited to
high torque applications in industry
number five Frierson at first glance
this looks like a typical Philips screw
however there are many important
differences the fearsome shake is a
perfect cross unlike the rounded
Phillips cross giving the fierson screw
higher torque and preventing the bit
from slipping out or stripping the screw
further the walls of the screw drive are
designed so that a single screw driver
can fit every size present screw
basically Friesen is like a better
designed Philips number six pause a
drive posit drive is another screw
designed by the Phillips screw company
like the more torque screw the posit
drive is designed to provide a greater
contact surface for more force and less
slipping one of the biggest downsides to
deposit drive is that it looks too much
like a Phillips and people often use a
Phillips screwdriver an apposite right v
or vice versa the best way to tell the
difference between them is that a
positive screw will have a small shallow
secondary cross in between the main
cross number seven torques torque screws
were invented in 1967 as an alternative
to the already popular Phillips screw
Torx drives feature six or sometimes
five lobes and this greater number of
lobes increases the contact surface
considerably
as a result dark screws can be a grainy
torque and slip out less easily than
Phillips screws
torque screws are used in all manner of
applications primarily in automotive and
electronics industries number eight
torque said Torx head screws are
designed by the Phillips screw company
for sensitive aerospace applications the
goal is to create an extremely high
torque screw every part of the screw
design from the straight walls to the
offset cross is intended to provide the
greatest possible torque number nine da
t p3 da and T p3 are two different types
of screw drive but they look fairly
similar they're triangular drives which
is fairly unique the ta has straight
walls while the t p3 has walls that
curve you'll often find these screws in
the toys in your happy meal and the TA
is also used in a bunch of low security
applications like elevators or camping
stones it's not hard to find a
screwdriver that will fit it but it's
not super easy either
which is just enough security to keep
people from opening up the stove and
accidentally making it explode number 10
tri wing the tri wing screw is another
Apple screw it was used in a few MacBook
Pros back in 2010 and 2011 and it's also
holding stuff together in the new iPhone
7 and 7 plus this one isn't proprietary
though and it can be found in products
made by Microsoft Nokia Nintendo and
others in the past the try way was
mostly used in aerospace and can be
found in some old aircraft made by
Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas number 11
key Rex kirik screws are used in
high-security applications like ballot
boxes and bank vaults key Rex screws are
custom made with a unique shape but will
only work with the corresponding unique
screw driver essentially key Rex screws
are unique keys deliberately created to
be impossible to unscrew for anyone
without the cars ball in dry
