living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to auto ride home
control the temperature turn on the
lights - face it we're living in a
technological Wonderland and yet here we
find fill pools forgotten the
combination of his travel lock is the
current solution to that problem we live
in an era filled with technological
marvels and yet this is what happens
when Phil forgets Allah combination is
that the best we can do no because we
live in an era where the air vault
exists the air bolts is a travel lock
you control it with your smartphone
it's a lot the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
airball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth range well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your lives that's
fine
the settings on this airball require me
to went to a password into the app or
maybe your air bolts been stolen that's
fine too because you can set your air
ball to activate an alarm when it moves
too far away from your phone or you can
activate the alarm manually stop that
man
it's the justice the future deserves hi
Bill hi tell them what happened bill I
lost my bag you lost your we live in a
world where I can use my smartphone to
model my sleeping patterns but bill here
can't find his bag you've built up being
using the air bolt instead of some
antique you could have located it using
the air box crowd-sourced GPS networks
or if you lose your phone
well you can still unlock your able by
logging in from another device well you
can enter a backup button code using
your hands like some kind of prehistoric
man the air vault has a rechargeable
battery which only needs to be charged
once a year by a standard microUSB
connector it's CSA approved so F of
security is not an issue the app will
record a history of every time you've
locked and unlocked your airport you can
even share access to your a vault with
your friends so you'll be able to unlock
it from the other side of the world
thanks pal you're welcome buddy
and look how small it is seriously look
at it it's really small a volt it's the
travel lock we all deserve a kick
starter over the last year we've worked
really hard on building the air box and
we got to say that we're truly proud of
how far we've come but now we need your
help to fund the last stages of
production tooling raw materials and
manufacturing honestly we've all been
there we've all forgotten the
combination to a look the most
frustrating thing ever and losing your
baggage even worse and that's why we
designed the air boat we believe in
innovation like this is long overdue and
it's time we bring luggage lock
technology into the 21st century the air
boat has so many possibilities we're
have been including it with a software
development kit so that you can make
your own features for example imagine
unlocking the air vault with your voice
or gamifying it and using it at a
scavenger hunt
we hope you agree and get on board our
Kickstarter campaign and as a reward for
backing us early we're offering some
awesome deals on the airboat thanks from
all of us here at airboat
hey Kickstarter I'm J I'm Daniela four
years ago we started go tenant to solve
the no service problem we set out to
make it possible to use your phone even
when you don't have cell reception or
Wi-Fi after a lot of hard work we
developed this device which is the first
and only way to use your smart phone to
send text messages and GPS locations to
others over long distances even when you
don't have any service of any kind our
award-winning product has been enjoyed
by tens of thousands and used all over
the planet while adventuring outdoors
traveling abroad attending crowded
events or even during an emergency over
the last year we've been working on a
next-generation product it lays the
foundation for a kind of communications
network that has never existed before
and now we're finally ready to share
what we've been working on and invite
you to be a part of it has this ever
happened to you you're traveling with
friends and versus garden and everyone
has a different adventure plan for the
day Ming wants to climb a mountain to
take pictures David and I don't want to
find a river and enjoy the Sun and you
you just want a pint a Reinheitsgebot
cuz you don't go to birches garden
without trying the right height spot the
problem is is my phone has no service
and French is Scott and I still want to
know what my friends are doing that's
why in this adventure we each brought a
goat in a mesh once paired with your
phone go to the messaging rates its own
radio signal so you can send text and
GPS locations using a simple app no
towers routers or satellites required
sent and received I could send a direct
message of David a group chat to my
friends or brat cast to any Goten in the
area
go tena has great point-to-point
communication range but with this
groundbreaking mesh networking
technology it is possible to double or
triple your range by hopping through
other go tenant mesh units in the area
you don't even need to know the other
users or do anything it's automatic and
privately so how I'm able to receive a
message from Ming who's on top of a
mountain because our friends and other
Goten of mesh users act as relay points
between us imagine using this at a music
festival or on the slopes the
possibilities are endless unlike
traditional communication networks
Goten a mesh actually gets stronger the
more users joining we call this people
power connectivity one more to go please
we're excited to launch goat NMS because
it's the first mesh network of its kind
100% off-grid mobile long-range and
consumer ready this kind of technology
has never existed outside of the
military
and even then they've been big heavy
systems that cost tens of thousands of
dollars
goat Animesh however is tiny and
affordable Goten amesh is our first
product available internationally and
having completed industrial design and
advanced prototyping earlier this year
we're now busy testing and setting up
manufacturing and distribution so people
all over the world can use our
technology to stay connected to each
other during fun off-grid adventures as
well as unplanned emergency situations
it's worth noting that goat Ennis
technology is already fielded and
trusted by public safety organizations
during mission-critical operations which
means that you can count on it - in our
headquarters in Brooklyn New York we've
assembled a small but scrappy team that
includes some of the most talented
engineers in the world we're all
motivated by the mission of empowering
people to create their own connectivity
even when traditional communication
networks are unavailable unreliable or
unaffordable we've built Goten a mesh
because we believe in a future where
communication isn't just delivered by
top-down infrastructure but also made
possible from the bottom up by people
like you we want you to be the first to
experience the future of people-powered
connectivity it starts with enabling
essential communication when you don't
have service but it can be something
much bigger we've built revolutionary
technology into goat Animesh but in
order to change the game we need you
Kickstarter we invite you to become a
mesh founder with us so please support
this campaign until everyone you know
about goat NMS
some people are natural sleepers others
not so much a great day starts with a

hello down
there are moments in life that you never
want to forget when you take a picture
you know the place the people around you
the landscape and the details a couple
of days later and you will forget most
of it a couple of years later and you
probably can't even remember where the
photo was taken your memory is gone
wouldn't it be great to have a camera
that captures everything you experience
with your friends and family and that
lets you and your friends re-experience
those moments later when you spend time
with your mates and loved ones wouldn't
it be great to be able to relive the
atmosphere of that day when someone you
love creates something great wouldn't it
be nice to discover things that you
hadn't even noticed when you took a
photo
hi I'm Jonas creator of the panono
camera a camera that can do exactly
these things that captures everything in
every direction or at once and it has a
super-high resolution of 72 megapixels
it uses 36 tiny but powerful cameras
that fire all at once you just throw
them to the air and at the highest point
when it is barely moving it captures a
fully spherical panoramic image
automatically to view the images you
simply point the smartphone or tablet in
the direction on the sea and move it
around
we built the original prototype two
years ago back then it was called
throwable panoramic ball camera you put
a video of it on YouTube which was
viewed nearly three and a half million
times because a lot of great press
coverage but most importantly we got
thousands of emails from people wanting
to buy the camera at that time and in
that form it was too expensive for mass
production so we sat down to develop a
new camera that a small affordable and
we built how does a new design we call
it the pen no no camera the camera is
tough so you can throw it in the air and
even drop it on occasion
there are several easy ways to use it
firstly of course by throwing it but you
can also put it on the stick and hold it
in the air or simply hold it in your
hand and press a button to make a
picture all the panoramic images in this
video was shot with our prototype the
new design will have the same
functionality but is much smaller and
tougher I was very much impressed by the
360-degree concept you catch the moment
with all the things around you now
everybody can discover the whole
situation
I support the team to ensure a seamless
process from the original idea to the
finished series product we have a
working prototype and a great new design
and with your help we can finish the
development and manufacture of the
camera by September support us and be
one of the first to own a panono camera
download our app and check out our
panoramas and memories
why
as urban cyclists we wanted to deal with
the biggest problems of vitamin cities
namely navigation and security there are
a couple of accessories that try to
solve these issues but there hasn't been
any complete solution introducing smart
Haley smart a low isn't just another
bike accessory in fact it's not meant to
be removed after each ride it installs
permanently on the handlebar and pairs
with your smartphone to turn your bike
into a SmartWatch and provide a biking
experience like no other Smart halos
design philosophy has always been
centered on simplicity biking in cities
can be a challenge so we've made sure
our device was simple yet smart how by
reducing its interface to its simplest
possible form a circle this luminous
halo allows us to communicate an
impressive amount of information smart
halo finds the quickest safest routes
and bike paths for you to make your ride
a stress-free experience just input the
destination in our app tuck your phone
safely in your pocket and let's mutt
halo take care of the rest
our unique circular interface allows us
to show every type of turn the seek in
the mushroom also our light patterns
warn you in advance of a Lincoln
attorney so you get plenty of time to
plan your next people as soon as you
start writing smart halo tracks your
bike metrics your time distance average
speed the calories you've burned as well
as your total elevation unlike regular
fitness apps you don't need to press
start or stop it does it all seamlessly
you don't even need to take your phone
out of your pocket
smart halo is also equipped with a smart
nightlight it turns on automatically
when it's dark and shuts off on its own
when you're done right with the personal
assistant feature smart halo will notify
you of incoming calls or text messages
right on your handlebar all of this
intelligence wouldn't be possible
without having smart halo
living permanently on a nova the design
goal of smart health was to build a
simple and integrated interface that
would fit anybody and under any
conditions it's built to resist the
worst that mother nature can throw it
via train dirt or snow smart halo was
also built to resist your bikes worst
enemy fight these assembled with a
unique temper proof system smart halo
can only be unlocked with a special key
provided with the product but we went
further than this
smart hello is also an integrated alarm
system when activated anyone trying to
steal your sweet ride we'll hear the
angry roar of smart hello smart hello
has been designed to be beautiful inside
and out
there is no on/off button on smart Ella
it's sophisticated sensors detect your
presence it only turns on when you are
frightened when you're done it shuts
down by itself all this leads to amazing
battery life to keep going as long as
you do under normal usage smart Ella
will last around 3 weeks it's become
obvious with greener transportation
methods 8 bytes are to be legitimized we
need to be connected in smart and
elegant with smart hello there is
balance between sophistication and
simplicity
you'll agree when you turn your bite
into a smart bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
