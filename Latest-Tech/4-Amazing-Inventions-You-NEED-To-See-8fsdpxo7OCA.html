you strip away everything weighing you
down holding you back you begin to float
away weightless hovering this is the
hoverboard the essence of pure motion
captured refined and reinvented the
hoverboard translates your will into
motion a single point of contact with
the ground minimizes friction and freeze
your movement from a linear path inside
precision sensors and electronics smooth
and stabilized you arrive gently
accelerating in whichever direction you
mean the controls are intuitive gently
apply pressure to one end of the board
to accelerate lean gently to one side of
the other to turn in that direction when
you stop you can set the board down on
its side to dismount the electric motor
powers a top speed of 20 miles per hour
perfectly balancing safety with
efficiency edit return in my first
company I had to figure out some way to
pack all the control electronics and the
drive electronics into the motor itself
I succeeded in doing that and we called
the product the smart motor that really
poised to me perfectly for making the
ultimate personal electric vehicle the
hoverboard moves you but it's also a
part of you with endless personalization
options to make your hoverboard a
perfect fit for you built-in speakers
hair with your smartphone giving you the
perfect soundtrack for your daily
commute or weekend Joyride on board
lighting gives you visibility at night
letting you ride a cloud of light to
your destination the hoverboard is
perfectly balanced in both form and
function it's fully electronic whisper
quiet and amazingly efficient the
high-capacity battery takes you 15 to 20
miles on a single charge and the best
part it's not just an idea we are riding
the experience today
thing that sets hoverboard apart is that
it really does take skill to operate
it's an earned experience you have to
get in touch with the nuances of the
hoverboard and once you do the reward is
a gliding kind of willful experience
that carries you where you want to go
the hoverboard is an ultimate form in a
new class of electronic transportation
connecting us to our world in a way
we've never experienced before
as of this moment that we're shooting
this video there are only six people on
the planet that can ride a hoverboard we
all have one thing in common we cannot
stop writing it so we want to find out
how many other people share our passion
for the hoverboard and we've set up our
kicks our reward tiers to reward those
people the most who sign up first
we felt there had to be a better way to
handle these short trips our goal at
Marvel was to create the lightest
electric vehicle in the world but also
with amazing user experience we spent
the last two years dedicated to crafting
and refining our marble electric
skateboard the lightest electric
skateboard in the world with an amazing
team modern technology and support from
our community we built the marble board
to be simple to use efficient and of
course exhilarating to ride the marble
electric skateboard is the lightest
electro skateboard in the world it
weighs only nine point nine pounds with
one full charge the board goes ten miles
that's not ten testing the lab miles
it's real world conditions most of our
test riders are actually getting over
ten miles per charge the question we get
most is how fast does it go well it is
one of the fastest electric skateboard
it has over 2,000 watts of power and
will hit speeds of up to 20 miles an
hour it can actually hit 20 miles an
hour even going uphill we realize that
20 miles an hour is pretty quick so we
have designed the board settings to be
completely customizable through a
smartphone app our app that we call the
dashboard lets you set exactly what you
want your top speed to be and determine
the level of acceleration the best suits
your riding style this allows you to
perfectly tuned the board to your needs
if you want you can even directly
control the throttle of the board from
our dashboard app which will allow you
to leave the wireless handheld
controller at home we were able to
achieve all of this by using
state-of-the-art carbon fiber and Kevlar
composites to create the deck design
that completely encases and protects
every bit of the electronics as well as
the battery cells on top of that we're
using incredibly efficient three-phase
DC mode
battery technology very similar to what
you would find in tesla model s our
custom electronics are being
manufactured for us right here in the
united states and finally everything is
assembled tested quality controlled and
shipped from our facility here in tampa
florida
this is the lightest electric skateboard
in the world starry you can use it as
transportation print along on to subways
buses or even car trunks to a further
distance you can write it to get
breakfast or grocery a few blocks away
never need to worry about parking or
locking when entering a restaurant with
your board in fact you can print to
anywhere what we want is a revolution of
electro skateboards so we smashed two
bounces through batteries away who bails
out it's called on motors and redesign a
brand new ultra light electricity board
which is stirring to achieve the same
inning impossible task we had to
redesign the moto2 had it inside whales
as well as putting gearbox and sensor
inside we designed many versions of
remote control running for a better user
experience instead of the short-lived
belt we use the planetary gears to
provide unbeliev place Trump our story
has perfect power systems whose ought I
speed up to 20 miles hour and growing up
here on a 30-degree slope with a small
remote in hand anyone even with no
experience can easily control the board
using our braking and accelerating
features steri is safe and smooth to
write for all users from beginners to
experts
hey there i'm beth i'm jeff three years
ago we set out to design the Seaboard
the world's first wait sensing electric
skater since then we've worked to
improve the board in every imaginable
way today we're excited to announce
seaboard to best weight sensing electric
skateboard we've ever made
Oh
the Z board is a portable easy to use
wait sensing electrics capable to ride
you simply lean forward to go and lean
back to stop speed is totally variable
so you lean forward a little bit to go
walking speed then you can lean forward
a little bit more to accelerate up to
the top speed the Z board is great for
all the in-between commutes that all the
space each and every day since you can
just grab it and go it's really perfect
for any trip that's too far to walk lets
you short to drive
we've improved upon our one-of-a-kind
weights into control by incorporating
foot pads that are larger and more
sensitive the result is a board that's
easier to ride in a lot more fun our new
lithium battery is lighter and slimmer
greatly reducing the weight while
simultaneously improving range and
cutting charge time in half hour
brushless motor is more efficient and
faster than ever finally our new motor
controller is rugged and splash-proof
empowers features like headlights
taillights and regenerative braking our
designers and engineers have worked
tirelessly over the last two years to
make the Z board to the best electric
skateboard on the market and it's almost
ready three years ago you helped us take
the Z border from a project in the
garage to a real product now we're
taking it to the next level
