could use a little shaking up so we
created the no keypad lock the world's
first smart padlock nokia is won
numerous awards and has been recognized
as a game-changing innovation however
some people need an extra level of
protection so we created the no key you
lock
incorporating all the cutting edge
technology used in the original nokia
into a practically indestructible
hardened steel body the nokia lock will
protect your bicycle or motorbike in the
toughest environments while also giving
you easy access using only your
smartphone available with an app for iOS
Android and Windows phones the nokia
lock uses wireless bluetooth technology
when clicked it automatically looks for
a phone with a compatible key and
unlocks you don't even need to remove
your phone from your pocket or purse
just click and go no more worrying about
lost keys or forgotten combinations
sharing your bike with others is easy
with just a couple taps you can quickly
and securely share your bike with your
friends even better you can revoke
access automatically without needing to
track down keys the Nokia lock
incorporates a long life rechargeable
battery that will last several years
between charges but we wanted the no key
you long to do even more so we added an
alarm after locking no key hold down the
button to arm the alarm function if
someone tampers with your no key for
more than three seconds a loud alarm
will shriek for 30 seconds drawing
attention and likely scaring off the
intruders the alarm function resets
every time you open no key the history
function in the app shows you who when
and where no key was used what if your
phone dies or is lost not a problem just
key in your custom quick click code this
ensures that you'll never be left
stranded in the unlikely event that you
ignore the warning in the app and let
your battery die you can always give
Nokia jump start with an external
battery finally maybe you don't have a
smartphone or prefer to bike without it
we've got you covered just add the
optional key fob to your order and
you'll be able to access no key with or
without your smartphone
no key no problem if you've ever felt
the stuffiness of sinus congestion you
know that it's no fun to deal with the
simple act of breathing can be a
challenge whether it's allergies a cold
or the flu congestion leaves you
dehydrated tired and in pain this is
sniff relief sniff relief is a
self-heating mask that warms up your
sinuses to relieve pressure and stuffy
noses we created sniff relief because we
suffered from sinus pain and couldn't
find anything that worked this is the
real deal where medicine can take hours
to kick in sniff relief gives you fast
effective relief plug it in set the
temperature and you're good to go the
snip relief is a safe all-natural
solution there are no chemicals involved
and no risk of addiction use it over and
over and over again without fear or
reservation the fleece mask comes in
three different sizes with an adjustable
strap to fit comfortably safety is our
biggest concern so we created a 3-point
safety system for your peace of mind we
built in a circuit breaker to protect
you if a surge which will ever occur and
limit the max temperature to 140 degrees
Fahrenheit to ensure that the mask never
overheats if you ever fall asleep with
the mask on sniff relief is equipped
with an automatic timer that turns the
heat off after two or 12 hours use it
for kids and children of all ages save
money from years of constantly buying
over-the-counter drugs this is the
safest fastest and most effective nasal
congestion relief it's time we free
ourselves from stuffiness breathe easy
with snick relief
Oh
you
you
backpacking is adventure it's a journey
through the wilderness saying beautiful
sights and carrying everything you need
to survive in your pack if I can pick
the two most important things about my
gear they would be make it lightweight
and make it reliable hey Kickstarter's
my name is Kevin and I'm introducing the
vertex ultralight backpacking stove this
stove has a patent-pending curved
construction that provides incredible
strength while only weighing one point
eight ounces light enough that you won't
even notice it in your pack
the unique design packs completely flat
and the flexible pieces assemble in
seconds with no tools it has no moving
parts valves bow rings or seals that can
wear out
the stove uses solid fuel tablets that
burn at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit and
only weigh 14 grams each the curved
sides of the stove shield the burning
tablet from wind and also serve as a pot
stand for added versatility the stove is
also designed to support the Trangia
alcohol burner that is popular with many
minimalist backpackers and uses
denatured alcohol fuel that can be
purchased at any hardware store I've
tested several rounds of prototypes and
fine-tune the design now I need your
help to take this project to the next
level if you appreciate the simplicity
of ultralight backpacking I hope you'll
consider supporting me on Kickstarter
