community about a year ago with our
passion project
the provoke path we're both crazy about
travel and photography but couldn't find
a bag that we were really stoked about
found that the most bags like cargo
shorts they're incredibly functional and
surprisingly functional but you lose all
dignity wearing and all the bags that we
found that actually looked decent the
sacrifice functionality so we started
thinking about all the great inventors
out there da Vinci
Edison chef boyardee we thought we could
honestly we've been overwhelmed by the
response we got on Kickstarter as well
as the entire photography community the
provoked packets won several awards and
turned out not to be just a great
photography bag but a great all-around
bag for anyone and we far surpassed our
goal on our first guest writer we've
shipped bags to backers in over 40
different countries and the response
we've had from them has been incredible
so after the project was over we started
getting two major requests from our
backers one they wanted a smaller bag in
the liner and two the non photographers
like the bags so much that they wanted
an ala carte option so they could
purchase just the bag and add on a few
accessories so we went to the drawing
board right away
after months of hard work we're excited
to introduce that provoke 21 it's the
ideal size for everyday carry a perfect
companion on any trip and is destined to
be the best friend of film compact and
mirrorless cameras everywhere
the provoke 21 comes with the same
innovative features as the original
provoke pack such as easy to use lay
flat packing an expandable roll top
allowing you to carry more gear when you
need it
with the roll top down the pack holds 21
liters of gear and fully extended it
holds 25 litres our trifold faa-approved
laptop sleeves that fits up to a 15 inch
laptop and allows you to breeze through
airport security a secure passport
pocket that sits against your back
keeping it safe from thieves and for you
photographers the camera cube is easily
added or removed depending on whether
you are bringing your camera gear or
leaving it at home we've designed the
dividers out of a thin molded foam that
is durable yet space-saving and allows
you to customize your gear the way you
would like
the site access make sure your camera is
accessible when you need it and the long
divider
was engineered to swing open so you have
quick access to an additional lens the
integrated camera sling is more
comfortable than an extra and gives you
instant access to your camera but we did
just make a smaller bag we made it
better
we added Y Kate case weather resistant
zippers giving more protection to your
gear when you need it the most
this coupled with the tarpaulin and
ballistic nylon means that you won't
have to worry about unexpected weather
getting into your back we redesigned the
accessory straps to be more secure and
have increased functionality these allow
you to strap gear to your bag and use
your bag as a hands-free workstation we
improve the magnetic tote handles making
them stronger
and easier to use
the upgraded two removable padded waist
straps helping you to distribute the
weight of your gear evenly and
comfortable and we use the new material
on the rain fly making it thinner and
lighter but just this durable and
finally we added a key and accessory
pocket giving you even more organization
we've obsessed over every detail of this
backpack every component down to the
stitching has been chosen for its
durability and aesthetic quality in
other words the provoked pack looks damn
good functions even better ultimate goal
isn't just to make great products but to
inspire others to get out and explore we
also wouldn't mind if you clicked on
that green button over there and helps
make this reality but no pressure please
please
what do you bring to work how do you get
there
the tools we use have evolved but how we
carry them hasn't kept up until now
introducing slim fold slim pack a
minimal modular and modern commuter
backpack built for today's tools and
lifestyles the highly technical
custom-made soft shell material truly
sets the slim pack apart from existing
bags it's manufactured by a mill which
produces material for such brands as
North base and gore-tex combined with
high-end weatherproof zippers the pack
will protect its contents from splashes
and rain without an additional cover
while traditional backpacks are like
SUVs you drag around the slim pack is a
sports card that hugs your body hi I'm
Dave from slim fold I introduced the
world's thinnest wallet with my first
Kickstarter now I've applied my design
approach to reimagine the backpack
backpacks are way too big for what
people carry these days they're still
made for these when all you really need
to work is one of these when I surveyed
previous backers about what I should
make next a minimal backpack was the
number-one request I've been working for
the past two years to bring this perfect
pack to life just like I designed a
minimal wallet around modern everyday
carry
I designed the slim pack around today's
work tools the main pocket suspends a
15-inch MacBook Pro and the front pocket
uses the footprint of an iPad the
patent-pending geometry of the slim pack
gives you complete visibility and access
to what's inside this pack is smaller
and lighter than traditional backpacks
but makes no compromises with the
shoulder straps they have an ergonomic
shape are padded vented and feature a
pivot strap that adapts with you as you
move want to leave your laptop behind
take out the padded divider inspired by
the professional camera bag
the interior can be configured exactly
according to what you carry I've
completed two Kickstarter campaigns and
delivered the rewards for each of them
on time now I'm asking for your support
to help bring the slim pack to life for
being an early backer I'll pass along
the savings to you and you'll be the
first to get one whether you pledge for
a slim pack or a special edition
Kickstarter wallet it'll help out a lot
thanks for your support
word peak design last year our fifth
Kickstarter with Trey Ratcliff brought
the everyday messenger to life and
people loved it but that was just the
first step
it gave us a foundation to build on and
building well that's exactly what we've
been up to let's start here the peak
design headquarters in San Francisco
where our ideas and inventions are
hatched think sketch discuss build test
and repeat this isn't a sprint it's long
painstaking detail oriented we take our
time but that's okay cuz well we're
different we have no investors no
revenue goals no artificial deadlines no
PowerPoint presentations just us our
customers and our partners here in the
Mekong Delta Peak design bags are hard
to make every piece of hardware custom
every pattern unique everything
meticulously crafted to solve a specific
problem we work hand in hand with our
suppliers to perfect every last detail
and when those details come together the
result speaks for itself
friends and backers were proud to
announce not one but four new everyday
bags the everyday backpack tote and
sling offering unrivaled versatility
access organization and expansion
thoughtfully compose to hold your photo
gear but designed for everyone on the
back package mag latch returns for rapid
top access to a vast expandable main
compartment in both the twenty and
thirty liter versions weatherproof side
zips allow dual side access to an
endlessly configurable storage space
thoughtful organization is everywhere an
expandable
laptops leave is separately accessed
inner side panels feature protective
pockets for smaller items wrap around
side pockets retain a clean aesthetic
but provide instant external carry when
you need it
there's a place for capture and for your
keys
but it's the concealed expansion panel
that lets you carry just about anything
there's a lot of ways to carry it or not
carry it and brilliant ways of securing
it lots of us are backpack kind of folks
and we think this is the best everyday
backpack there is but there's plenty
more ways to carry tote bags have
convenient access large capacity and
classic appeal put many lank
organization and utility not this tote a
secure magnetic clasp keeps the tote
weatherproof but opens in a moment dual
side zip panels give you priority access
to your most needed items inside and out
you'll find pockets for days including
dedicated laptop and tablet sleeves
flex fold dividers let you stack your
gear and create separately accessible
compartments protection where you want
it and flexibility where you need it the
everyday tote is gorgeous adaptable and
totally dialed
and then there's the everyday sling
sling is a bag for those who pack light
and move quickly who need expandability
in a pinch
smart organization lightning-fast access
and convenient external carry the
everyday sling is low-profile and ultra
portable the ideal companion for your
active lifestyle it was luck that peak
design was born at the same time as
crowdfunding but it's your support that
has kept us on its cutting edge we are
proud to be ambassadors to a new way of
doing business and we look forward to
seeing you back here again thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
