we have been working on this for the
past two years and in that time we have
built a great team spending days and
nights refining our designs obsessing
over economics and materials to build a
device that looks beautiful and fits
perfectly on any wrist locks menus and
apps are easy to use and the watch will
work seamlessly with your iphone and
android smartphones we have been
approached and have partnered up with
major tech companies from around the
world to bring the best SmartWatch on
the planet to your wrist and as an open
platform we will soon allow anyone to
develop modules we are working with one
of the world's largest and most reliable
manufacturers in Taiwan and they are
ready to start production and this is
why we need your help let's signal to
the world that technology should be more
personal and upgradable back us and
let's kickstart this modular revolution
together
blocks modular SmartWatch demonstrates
how arm and its partners continue to
lead the way in developing new classes
of low-power always on always connected
wearable devices and what's interesting
is that blocks I think has the
opportunity to challenge and change the
intersection fashion and technology I
finally consumers may be given the same
level of choices of fashion was provided
where a wearable software company
started by a group of X google x android
folks we're extremely excited to work
with a blog steam because they are in a
very real and promising sense tapping
into this notion of a personalized
SmartWatch experience so smart watches
in the future I'm going to be quite
different we imagine them today what
blocks enable us is a platform where you
can configure and you can you know
essentially involve this SmartWatch
platform based not only on technologies
that are going to be available to us in
the future based on your needs and I
think we are engaging with lots and
we're supporting us our electrical
mechanic in software engineer Apollo is
the plazas teams so we have to be the
experience for building web web portals
so I think we can help them go into the
next production stage
when we're properly hydrated we feel
better think better look better we just
are better level is not just another
fitness tracker it is the first and only
wearable to measure your hydration
letting you know precisely how much
water you need to feel and perform your
best level also measures your heart rate
sleep quality calories activity and mood
and can integrate all of that
information to show you what kind of
improvements you can see both in your
sleep and during exercise almost all of
us at some point during the day are
dehydrated and those little gaps and
staying up when your hydration needs
have consequences you can lose
concentration and can have an effect on
your mood it could affect your sleep
when you first wake up in the morning
your first thing should be to go grab a
glass water you'll find that maybe it'll
me as much coffee and you definitely
won't meet as much food water will level
set actually just how hungry you are so
it prevents overeating
by drinking more water you suddenly have
more energy what do you have more energy
for working out and when you're working
out you have better endurance your
joints and your muscles don't hurt as
much and you don't feel as much pain the
effect of that workout is continuing on
throughout the day you're running more
calories now that you've done the work
out studies have shown if you were
hydrated throughout the day it's better
for your sleep and you're going to be
more rest in so you have to see all of
this as part of a whole what I like
about level is it gives you the data and
says this is how much you need to get
balanced in life level was designed for
twenty four seven where and can learn
your activity and hydration habits not
only trending them but identifying
patterns that are keeping you from your
best most consumer wearable devices can
only measure a fraction of the metrics
that are important to us so we focused
on research we turn to the world of
medical devices where accuracy and
precision are tightly monitored now
we've developed a revolutionary red
light technology that can look ten times
deeper into the body measuring 10 times
when any other sensor can all with
industry-leading accuracy we're excited
to return to Kickstarter with level our
mission is to revolutionize wearable
health and performance no matter if you
live to train or train to live we can't
wait to see what you'll accomplish by
measuring what really matters
let's talk about something that every
one of us does but then most of us don't
do as well as we should sleep we spend a
third of our lives doing it each day is
dependent on it but we still neglect it
knowing how you slept is good but it's
not enough you need to begin to
understand why you slept a certain way
while you sleep at night you have no
idea what is happening nobody's even
thinking about the most important room
of our lives and how it impacts us the
bedroom hello we want to change that
sense is a simple system the tracks your
sleep monitor the environment of your
bedroom and reinvents the alarm sends
watches for noise light temperature
particulates in the air and more prove
the sleep pill your movements at night
tells you how soundly you're sleeping if
you're disturbed it through a.m. should
be able to see if it was your part of
snoring or a car alarm that went off we
all have a natural sleep cycle but a
normal alarm will wake you up regardless
of when's best for you with census smart
alarm it knows how to wake you up at the
right time so you don't start the day
feeling terrible if you want to be up by
nine-thirty we already half awake in 9
15 then your alarm should know to go up
there not wait for you to fall deeper
into sleep here at hello we've been
heads down for quite a while now
building we're a team of designers
engineers and operations experts who
collectively have built products and
services than millions of people around
the world using love
making world-class hardware and software
on their own as harm doing these things
in concert together obviously becomes
even more complex that's why we've
assembled a team of the best people to
do just that with the rise of wearables
you've seen that people clearly hear
about this sleep but to us it felt so
natural to be worrying about putting
something on charging it remembering to
press buttons we believe that technology
needs to disappear it didn't make sense
to us that we've been told to put
something on just as you get into bed
everything of sense is designed to fade
away you should simply be able to just
sleep when designing sense we didn't
want to create something that looked
like just another piece of technology
that's easy to do it's much harder to
design a device that feels at home
sitting beside your bed every day it
should look like an object that you'd be
happy to have their almost regardless of
its purpose for something so natural
asleep we wanted to design something
that felt organic the spherical form and
Ness like structure helped to keep
things both simple and strong to get to
where we are today we've iterated
literally hundreds of times by being
able to 3d print and laser cut our way
out of almost anything we've settled on
a design that's beautiful and one that
also functions perfectly with all the
sensors we have inside fitting so much
inside such a small space is pretty hard
when you look at what goes inside sense
engineering everything to fit is a
challenge but it's fun it's like a
beautiful puzzle fitting together
perfectly to become strong sturdy and to
protect everything inside
object shouldn't just be designed to
look good they should be designed to
last that's what building things for
people is about but sense in the sleep
pill we wanted things to stand the test
of real life and we've made sure we did
just that sleep is important to the
Chevron so we didn't want to make this
product hidden in silence and without
your help you on the Kickstarter
community to help us in shape from up
we're building as we voted with your
support we can together help you with
better understand themselves and the
world around them we're so excited to
put sense and get it to you control the
revolution in Iowa their first is always
the winner the second is the first loser
after launching the first control I web
products the control one we receive so
many requests from the crowd standing
community for a new design with a full
frame and a new color and there it is
the cultural cross country amongst the
10 best in the world in extreme mountain
biking called the marathon mountain bike
the visibility plays a big role in every
sport and specially mountain biking this
a new I work and really make the
difference I mainly ride in rough
terrain and it's really important to
have your eyes on the road if you go
fast downhill and you don't see you
have to break fast and you can't really
do anything with the normal I way sir
I'm really enthusiastic about this
product using the automatic mode makes
me really feel like I'm more in control
I really feel safe it going downhill
with it with high speed and entering
tunnel is forests or any danger coming
up control I wear uses the fastest
responding and most energy efficient
technology available the disruptive and
patented electronic tint on demand
technology was designed for the US
Special Forces it offers instantaneous
adapting tint within point 1 seconds
