you
love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go they help us plan our
day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us they even
support our work day but all these fun
functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quick charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not you simply wrap it into
this tuck away slot and you're good to
go how really does the cube work
well it's a simple concept just plug
your cube into your phone and into the
power source it detects when your smart
phone is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down hi my name
is Christian as ever be the person I was
often on the road and almost every day
my phone was running out of the bathroom
laughter instead of messy wires and
power bank I wanted to have only one
small device that can replace the number
of home accessories I have to carry
everything when we started to think
about the future at the existing
technology on the map and we quickly
notice that most of the available
devices are not complete and not will
defend together we share our head
designer we develop the skills we learn
through several percent defined by
design
the design of this elegant compact and
practical it was so challenging with all
the functionalities together into Solon
cool design with the significant
deficiency it was something that had
never been done but we made it and we're
so proud and excited to bring this cube
is the world's first compact and
lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sink and quick charging
cable
you'll also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
simply put it's an amazing piece of
technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world if
you need to sport yeah I really like
inliner
you know weaving hair my favorite song
is the freedom
well except for those heavy shoes I've
got a hole in my backpack
hmm and what about hiking sure I love
hiking being out in nature is where I
can unwind to get new idea it's just
really a drag lugging around those heavy
boots all day a lot of you use Skinner
water Skinner enter the most ultra
portable foot bear in the world also or
they may like super cool dinner delight
it's very durable they fit in here
pockets don't slip and have a cooling
effect and that Duvall seriously yep you
can throw them in the washer
dinner's were designed to be worn
anywhere anytime like at our wedding
okay well almost any time if you're
tired of carrying an extra pair of shoes
with you all the time
try Skinner's they're lightweight
portable comfort simply put its Footwear
tuned to perfection I get it so I can
have Skinner's with me all the time okay
so all of us own a few phone accessories
right and some of them can actually do
some really impressive things right now
if I asked you to get one you probably
say I don't have it with me so most of
the time you end up leaning your phone
against some random object instead of
actually using that expensive tripod
that you left at home so because there
weren't any real solutions we made our
own pocket tripod a fully adjustable
stand for your iPhone and holds your
device in both portrait and landscape
note covering the screen that's part is
that it transforms and besides a couple
of credit cards and hide the way into
any wallet or purse until you need it
again but then a few of our very clever
backers realize something that we missed
you told us I've got a case on my phone
I'm not going to take it off every time
that's just too much work and someone
else said so what you guys some kind of
Apple fanboys you know some people
rockin to it right back got us thinking
you can't make a pocket tripod for every
phone case bottle out there there's at
least a million different combinations
who knows so as soon as we shift all
rewards to our two and a half thousand
backers we started working on a
universal pocket tripod instead of
limiting it to only bear our box
for months you studied cases of got
feedback from our backers and tested
ideas once we had a universal opening
shape we made it in a range of sizes so
that it fit as many case and phone
combinations as possible this is the new
universal pocket tripod does it work
with the Apple silicone case perfectly
how about the Galaxy Note up towards
fantastic and landscape and halfway in
portrait does it work with every case
almost unless it's gigantic we've also
created this guide that lets you know
exactly what pocket tripod you need just
by knowing what case and device
combination okay but what if I like it
bare but also sometimes with protection
do i need to pocket tripods nope because
whenever you swap your case or your
phone you can also get the adapters to
match their new size good to go the
pocket tripods been used in tested for
the past two years by thousands of
people on the fly they use it as a
primary tripod every day to take amazing
time lapses for making video calls and
even to create light paintings
we've made the pocket tripod with the
highest standards of engineering
materials and manufacturers they say the
best camera is the one that's with you
and the same is true when it comes to
tripod</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
