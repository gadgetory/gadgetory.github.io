type of aerator that fits into your
existing tab by atomizing water and
creating a mist you can do exactly the
same things you do today only with 98%
less water this is what happens with
your regular faucet most of the water
either bounces off your skin or just
passes your hands without touching them
at all that's millions of gallons of
water literally slipping through our
fingers and down the drain we need to
change that and that's why we want your
help so how do we save 98% of the water
without losing functionality the trick
is in optimization you break up the
water into millions of droplets and
basically you're creating your heavy
mist without mist you're getting contact
with much much a greater percentage of
the water almost all of it that's why
you can wash your hands do your dishes
with just a fraction of the water coming
out of your tap but sometimes you need
more water that's why we developed the
switch in switch mode you still save 85%
of the water compared to your regular
tap but you still get all the water you
need
approximately 18% of the water used in
our homes is water running through our
taps that's about thirty two gallons of
water per household per day if we do the
math and look at some of the most water
stressed cities in the world that's
about 220 million gallons of water
running through the taps in Tokyo 240
millions in Shanghai forty million
gallons in Los Angeles and 50 million in
Rio de Janeiro every day and most of it
is down the drain there are already
millions of forces in the world
that's why we developed the auto nozzle
to be easily installed in your existing
one by altering your existing faucet
rather than buying a new one you get the
same effect that the fraction of the
cost the faucet is also part of our
interior design so if it doesn't look
good it just gonna end up in some drawer
that's why we spend a lot of time
designing the altered nozzle we ended up
with this drop shape it clearly makes a
visual statement but at the same time it
makes it easy to switch between mist and
saber mode today over 1 billion people
are living in areas with extreme water
stress it affects people in the United
States Brazil China Spain basically
everywhere and by the end of the year
2020 an estimated 3 billion people are
gonna live in these areas it's something
we need to do something about we're
ready for production but we need your
help to fund the first line of altered
nozzles be part of creating a really
cool product something we believe can be
a small and simple solution to a huge
problem oh and if you like it please
spread the word Thanks
you
you
what if you could control your dreams
fly over the Grand Canyon visit a
beautiful island or perhaps go back in
time to the age of dinosaurs now you can
meet iPad plus the EEG brain sensing
headband for inducing lucid dreams and
improving sleep what is a lucid dream a
lucid dream is any dream in which you
become aware that you're dreaming
without you actually waking up dreams
occur almost always when you are in the
rapid eye movement phase also known as
the REM phase of your sleep in rim phase
your brain activity is different than in
the other phases of your sleep cycle
IPAM plus accurately senses this dream
face by monitoring variations in your
brainwaves once i've m+ senses this
dream phase it plays audio visual cues
the subtle external stimuli of light
patterns via the LEDs on IBM Plus and
sound appear as anomalies in your dream
making you aware that you are dreaming
without them waking you up once you are
lucid in a dream you can take control of
your dream actions and consciously
reshape the dream to fulfill any fantasy
your wildest desires unrestrained by the
laws of physics or Society
lucid dreams are vivid and highly
immersive once in lucid dream you enter
a virtual world where everything you see
hear touch taste and smell is as
authentic as reality lucid dreaming has
been researched scientifically many
psychologists and researchers have
recognized that lucid dreams can help
with artistic creativity problem-solving
improving sports and language skills and
can even help people prone to nightmares
to get their fears under control sleep
is also very important to restore energy
reserves and strengthen the immune
system even minimal sleep loss affects
mood productivity ability to handle
stress and even body weight Iban plus
tracks your sleep indicates sleep
quality and gives feedback on
improvement I penned plus also has the
most advanced smart alarm feature that
wakes you up with simulated natural
sunlight and sounds at the most optimum
period of sleep cycle so that you wake
up fresh every time
I ban plus headband communicates with I
ban Plus app on your smartphone via
bluetooth so you can conveniently check
your sleep statistics and improvement
suggestions you can even customize your
IBM plus from this app to set LED light
patterns and the brightness as well as
the audio cues developers can use our
open platform to create amazing new
experiences with future software updates
my band plus could be connected to
numerous smart devices in your home to
simplify your daily life dreams and
sleep a widen for optimal health and
happiness so we started working on Iban
plus with the goal to enable everyone to
control their dreams and to enable
everyone to gain insight into their
sleep we went through several prototypes
to realize the best Iban plus design we
are really excited to take Iban plus
from the prototyping stage to the
support finished product we want to hear
from you to know your ideas and
improvement suggestions be the words
forced to own Iban plus back our
campaign and help us make Iban plus a
reality thank you how do you know if the
pillow you're sleeping on is garbage
warnings what you're about to see is
actual
actual garbage I'm as shocked as you are
ah so that's how you know if the pillow
you're sleeping on is full of garbage
unfortunately expensive or cheap most
pillows on the market are simply
terrible and this is exactly why the
real-life comfort scientists that
brought you the revolutionary purple bed
with their inventive genius to work on
designing a completely new kind of
pillow presenting the purple pillow
the only pillow designed to perfectly
respond to your individual sleep type
interesting but before we get too far
into the purple pillow let's take a
quick look at what's inside other
pillows on the market you see for years
pillow technology has refused to grow up
like your brother who's still waiting
for his Hogwarts acceptance letter they
basically take some loose softish stuff
and put it inside of a bag this is a
problem though if the inside of a pillow
is just loose fluff no matter how you
shape and shift your pillow to fit your
neck as you sleep and it all falls flat
this is the reason that no matter what
your bedtime pillow looks like your
morning pillow looks like this the
halfpipe au shaped Gulch caused by a
complete evacuation of the pillow fluff
to either side the wedge the flattening
of fluff resulting in no neck support
and basic sadness the untamable bulge
caused by an overstuffed or over firm
pillow results in the 90 degree neck
sleep position and a future job as an
evil henchman the curvy girl these
curves are always either too much to
handle or there just isn't enough for
true neck support oh and it's memory
foam so no thanks
others though have tried to fix the
problem of loose fluff with this memory
foam but memory foam has its own
problems
it starts softish then as it warms the
cells compact
it loses its shape and becomes a hot
sweaty brick unlike any pillow before it
purple pillow uses a patented comfort
grid system that gives locally but not
globally and even the design the grid
itself is specially engineered to sink a
bit more in the center where your head
rests while remaining comfortably
supportive under your neck where you
need it I mean just look at that
beautiful neck alignment and it doesn't
matter if you sleep backside or
undecided the purple pillow will give
you the exact support you need every
time and that there is the magic of
science everybody but what if you find
you need more or less support well for
those who crave adjustability the purple
pillow is equipped with an adjustable
air booster that you can raise or lower
to your exact comfort needs it's a
completely new sleeping experience it
doesn't feel like the pillows of old
it's got kind of like a blobby feel like
sleeping on the belly of a friendly fat
man also we've said it before weight is
quality and the purple pillow is quality
and its adjustability makes it the
perfect pillow for everyone
yep that's 80 comforts per minute so you
can go ahead and take all your old
pillows and burn them actually don't
because many of them are full of toxic
chemicals that we just don't want to
breathe and hate to all you chronic
pillow flippers always craving the cool
side of the pillow
well you are always sleeping on the cool
side of the pillow it reads much cooler
and post sleep temperature than the
competition if you or someone you know
sleeps we'd love your support pledge um
down here
so the one thing that we keep getting
asked over and over is we love our
purple bed but when are you going to
come out with a pillow that's made with
this same technology so we've worked
really hard we've come out with a pillow
that's the best pillow the world has
ever seen we had to introduce it on
Kickstarter because you got us started a
year ago
so enjoy the pillow purple no pressure
you

hi my name is Hui I'm in nursery
designer hi waiter I'm a mechanical
engineer and I'm gonna shed and I guess
I'm a hustler
we are not was team two years ago we
came together to find a solution to the
last mile problem in our home country
Singapore and has been an amazing
journey developing and refining the
design of the airport with the help of
all the whole community five months ago
we launched our people set sail for
local waters in Singapore the intention
of the pre-production work but to get up
feedback on both hardware and software
so we could quickly iterate and make
improvements to them through this
process the unborn has become a much
better product than we could have
achieved on our own the outboard is
based on the 22 team skateboard format
and weighs in at Reena 1/2 kg it is
light and compact enough to be the
perfect last mile solution
it also has enough power to take the
average person up to 18 kilometers and
goes up to a speed of 25 tricks in our
having enough range to take you from the
train station and back and still be
powerful enough to give you a trill of a
ride
he'll grey is also a 15 percent which
would be enough to take a most event in
any other gear
so why are we our Kickstarter well this
is because we have received quite a
number international requests for us to
make the artwork available for sale
Singapore and there are only a couple
challenges that we need your help to
overcome and make that possible
first we need to acquire the necessary
certifications required for shipment in
two countries suggest the US and the EU
part of the funds raised will go into
competing this process of certification
so we can start shipping upwards
overseas
second you need your help to establish a
network of distributors and suppliers so
we can keep cost to a minimum
by securing an initial quantity of our
box for international shipping we will
be able to manage our costs and provide
the best product and an affordable price
for you as part of the Kickstarter
program we are offering the first batch
of final production
Aquos to you at a special preorder price
in each one will also be customized to
recognize your contributions in helping
to bring this to life our contributions
will be critical to the success about
what's internationally and we will look
forward to delivery the paws to you
