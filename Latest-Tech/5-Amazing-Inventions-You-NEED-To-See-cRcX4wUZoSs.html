our sleep is very important to us so we
decided to do something about it and
redesign every aspect of how beds and
mattresses are made and function
we're beluga comes from is that we're
trying to utilize modern design and
technology to produce beds that you have
full control so you can customize it
anywhere you wish the air cell
suspension system is very unique because
it allows you to control its firmness
and it stays as new throughout the
lifespan of the bed it acts like a
spring but it's very soft and it yields
itself around you rather than resist you
our climate control works by using
ambient air already in your room which
we then are able to either heat or let
pass through to in the summertime
ventilator to keep you cool and in the
winter time to actually warm the bed so
it's not chilled when you come to use it
we've incorporated a vibro massage
that's pressure point rather than a bed
being vibrated it's directly placed in
vibration sensors beneath specific
pressure points in your body because I
was developed to help you navigate your
way in the dark without disturbing your
partner it automatically comes on and we
use an external wireless sensor that
allows the light to come on for a
certain amount of time to help guide you
to and from your bed we also have a
variety of colors that you can choose or
what ambient lighting you'd like when
they come on anti snoring system we
developed because it's just one of the
most disruptive experience you have with
a partner we use our very specialized
air suspension system to change the
angle at which you sleep when snoring is
monitored we have a built-in sensor
within the mattress that is specifically
tuned to pick up your frequency of sound
when you start snoring it will change
the tilt of your head and your neck to
both partners separately the idea of
technology in the bedroom is a challenge
and we felt that it was very important
to keep the ambience of a bedroom
technology free and everything we design
is designed to be invisible and unseen
everything you'd normally have in your
room to create the ambience you want is
the most important thing our control of
the bed is either through an app or you
can have our own touch screen remote
control if you wish to use that beyond
that we have obviously the sleep
monitoring system which can interact
with your existing sleep on technology
as wearable or as something you have on
your smart
or tablet with the help of the
Kickstarter community we'd like the
opportunity to bring Beluga beds to the
mass market we already have
manufacturing in place and we're ready
to take orders for any size of bed for
any continent worldwide
I was always an outdoor guy I like
kayaking surfing you know hiking
anything that's outdoor I'm a sucker for
it and i really like capturing myself as
well doing it you know taking all these
GoPros and the selfie sticks but that's
kinda hard to cuz you need to pick up
this equipment and it's kind of damages
the quality of your sports
and what I like about the up and go is
that finally in a click of a button you
know it follows you you can take aerial
videos with the up and go and then you
can combine it to go the GoPro so you
get the perfect video every time
the up and go is great for outdoor
sports and extreme sports the wearable
devices waterproof so you could use it
while you're surfing or kite surfing and
get amazing videos of yourself the
aerial cam can follow you steadily no
matter how fast you go and since it has
a 1080p 12 megapixel camera you shoot
high definition video and images from
any angle the robust hard carbon fiber
frame and the default flight time of 20
minutes makes it ideally suited for
outdoor activities and environments and
if you happen to run out of power you
can simply replace the batteries on the
go to keep on shooting the up and go is
so smart it is autonomous league flying
around you you don't need to do anything
it's as simple as that just click the
button and it starts shooting the second
thing that it's really cool about it all
you do you open up the box you put in
the battery and it's ready to fly the
third thing is that it's really
affordable anybody can purchase this for
a really decent price the up and go can
capture footage in five professional
camera modes all switched on with a
simple tap on your wrist band it can
steadily follow you pan slide pivot
around you and
hover in midair making you the director
of the perfect shot we created a smart
simple and affordable aerial camera and
now we need your support to bring it out
to market breathing is the most natural
and important thing we do and every day
almost 3,000 gallons of air fill our
lungs air is everywhere where we live
where we work where we sleep but do you
really know what's in the air you
breathe you might think that pollution
is only outside but it's the complete
opposite many studies have proved that
indoor air is up to five times more
polluted than outdoor this is why we
created theory cleary is the most
amazing natural air purifier powered by
real plants that helps people in
reducing indoor air pollution and it
will be the best design object you will
ever have on the market right now there
are only traditional electronic air
purifiers netting plastic very ugly big
and bulky and then early work thanks to
filters this is why we thought about
something revolutionary and we created
the perfect synergy between nature
technology and design so how does cleary
work we designed a smart flowerpot that
amplifies the natural properties of fans
our idea started from a research of NASA
they found out that some plants have
that ability to eliminate toxic age the
problem is that a single plant isn't
that effective so we created a
technology unit that allows more air
flow through the soil and the roots this
is where the filtration happens we use
plants as biofilters roots and soil
generate colonies of microorganism that
trap and filter the toxic agents in year
in a natural way clear in fact tilts is
ninety-three percent of toxic agents
immediately it's very silent and has a
very low energy consumption less than
fifty percent of the LED bulb you can
manage it with your smartphone and the
best thing is that there are no filters
so you don't have to change them and
waste money what happens inside is not
magic but a scientific
back and we proved it we did many
researchers and prove the effectiveness
of Cleary at linde one of the most
important research labs on plants in
Europe and peanut a spin-off of the
University of Florence base in Italy
Cleary is also probably an Italian
design product we work hard for a year
to design it in every detail we develop
multiple sketches and prototypes to make
the design perfect we presented it at
CES 2016 and had great success we have a
super team with two brilliant industrial
designers and a great adviser team that
helps us Italy has a long tradition of
craftsmen especially in the ceramic
field this Italian culture is an
inspiration for us we use a ceramic
first for the statical 12c but mostly
because it's eco-friendly and it doesn't
release any toxic agents in the year
obviously we also work really hard on
the technology part of our products we
came to the Silicon Valley to make
something really powerful we've
developed our technology working close
with engineers and manufactures in the
Silicon Valley to improve the
functionalities of cleary thanks to our
technology unit in our smartphone app
with health and air quality sensors
clear is able to track like toxic agents
in the air and give you real-time
pollution analysis analytics of it and
also temperature in your military
monitor Clary lives with you telling
what's wrong maybe allergies sleep
problems productivity asthma it learns
about you and cares about you it works
with Wi-Fi so wherever you are Larry can
give you how to tips on how to feel
better and tell you something is going
wrong and what more is that every single
product southern Kickstarter will be
unique and will be strictly a limited
edition each will come with its own
number and will be handcrafted by the
best Venetian artists so thank you
Kickstarter please back our product
you
Oh
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
