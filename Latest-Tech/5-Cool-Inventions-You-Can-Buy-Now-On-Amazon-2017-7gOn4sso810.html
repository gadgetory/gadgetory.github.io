your new or existing PC by projecting an
invisible light field over the screen
and what's good about light is that it
responds to pretty much anything so you
can slice with your gloves or long
fingernails pinch with your chopsticks
scroll while you're cooking
or why not use a paintbrush you get the
idea with air bar you get touch gestures
when you need them it's easy to touch
its sleek it won't drain your battery
and you can unplug it when you want to
best of all there's no manual no
installation it's plug and touch it just
works this is your MacBook Air and yeah
it doesn't have a touchscreen oh how
boring but now there's air bar just plug
it in and you have touch finally you can
swipe away unwanted mess or find a
needle in a haystack sweet is that a
poodle cool now you're the poodle scroll
away the sky is the limit just go
bananas or I don't know maybe you just
want to eat a banana
I
imagine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices slick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going to your phone
you simply press the button that's
better
I use the slick app to set it up and
then I can fix like whatever I want I
can even share this flick with my
roommate so we can use it when I'm not
around the flick is adjust for your
house you can stick your flicks anywhere
like in your car or on your bike
it's really cool
a minute on the left
and you can clip your flesh it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut me me me me me hey
like now
oh I'm so sorry I have to take this but
it can be so much more than just a
shortcut to your phone it can be
integrated with lots of different
services beyond your devices check this
one out
take the old cabbie when I get home I
want everything to just take care of
itself
Shh movie starting
another great feature of flick that it
can be used as a safety device which is
the push of a button you can send live
updates with your location or even a
distress signal to your family in front
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
