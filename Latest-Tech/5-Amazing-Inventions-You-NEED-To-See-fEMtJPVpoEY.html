threatened anonymity like never before
undermining our ability to speak and
read freely online from executives of
major corporations to casual home
browsers anyone can become a victim of
Network surveillance that's why we
created an otterbox annona box works by
routing all of your internet traffic
over tor tor was originally developed
and used by the US government as a
secure means of communication but tor
has since become open source and
available for free to the public
tor works just like a normal internet
browser but instead of connecting you
directly to your desired destination tor
bounces your communications around a
network of relays all around the world
this prevents somebody watching your
internet connection from learning what
sites you visit and it prevents the
sites you visit from learning your
physical location this means you can
browse with anonymity and safeguard
yourself from prying eyes Anana box is
your key to the open web sometimes
called the dark or deep web the open web
makes up over 80% of all web pages in
existence and cannot be accessed using a
normal unsecure web browser sites like
Facebook are launching versions of their
site on the open web offering users a
more private alternative while providing
others a way to use these essential
services in countries that enforce
Internet censorship more popular sites
will likely soon follow suit
Anana box also grants you freedom from
network censorship whether it's a
blocked web page at school or work or a
government firewall censoring network
traffic an on a box gives you freedom
and an increasingly restrictive online
world
VPN capabilities are also available with
anonymous this provides you with the
ability to specify an IP location while
adding additional encryption enhancing
your online privacy and security how
does it work
we made a non abox portable and durable
so you can carry your key to privacy in
the open web anywhere you go from hotel
rooms to your home your favorite coffee
shops to work online privacy and
anonymity is seconds away just connect
your computer to an on a box then
connect Anana box to your router then
enjoy using the Internet as you normally
would but with the comfort of knowing
that all of your traffic is being routed
over the Tor network
make sure to learn about our full line
of Inanna box devices to find one that
meets your privacy needs and our support
staff are here to answer any questions

my name is Sean O'Meara and I am a
business traveler after 12 years of
working in the advertising industry I've
had to fly a lot for work and like
millions of people out there I can't
sleep on planes travel pillows could
help if only they fit into my small
carry-on which they don't and to be
honest I've always thought they kind of
look ridiculous it's like wrapping a
life-preserver around your neck in the
age of sleek stylish accessories
I wondered why travel pillows have yet
to evolve and then one night it hit I
was suffering through yet another
cross-country red-eye and I realized you
don't eat a doughnut wrapped around your
neck to get a little comfort
introducing the bull rest the first
travel pillow designed to meet the needs
of the modern business travelers
it's eighty percent smaller than
traditional travel Phillips or about the
size of a pair of headphones or ski
goggles or a gold bar is that it's much
lighter and less expensive of course
basically it's small enough to fit into
any small carry-on it works by using an
ergonomic design that cradles the back
of the head keeping it from shifting
side to side but without having to wrap
around the entire neck and with memory
foam inserts it doesn't sacrifice
comfort clover form it works great with
noise cancelling headphones and is
designed to fit both men and women we
created an opening in the bag not just
for structural and design purposes but
it also provides air flow to the neck
keeping it nice and cool with three
unique colors to choose from there's a
style for everyone
and we are proud to announce that the
full rest will be made right here in the
USA our Seattle based manufacturing
partners will make sure the bull' rest
lives up to our high standards
we've even established a distribution
infrastructure so that we can quickly
scale up to meet high demand after a
year of development my team and I are
finally ready to bring the full rest to
market but to make it happen we need
your help your contribution will finance
the first production run of the full
rest to provide us with an initial sales
inventory we hope you add your support
that helped millions of travelers
finally get the rest they deserve

the day the bold nut has an internal
battery that gives your phone a quick
boost of up to 30% so you can spend more
