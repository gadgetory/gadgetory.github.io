the average American workers spend six
hours a day at their death
the average gamers spent an additional
seven hours a week internet the average
under desk temperature that's early 32
degrees Fahrenheit yes this is what we
do with our feet during the hours and
hours we spend at our desk we could
continue doing this but there's a better
way to sit at your desk
we call it the foot hammock it's the
most comfortable way
I'm a college student and a gamer so I
spend more than my fair share of time
sitting at my desk really more hours
than I spend sleeping and as I was
sitting at my desk I realized my feet
were getting cold my legs were really
supported I wasn't really as comfortable
as I wanted to be as I started looking
for better solutions I tried a bunch of
different things I tried a cardboard box
that wasn't very comfortable I tried my
printer I need a breaking that so I got
together with my roommate Brent and we
began developing the foot hammock the
two main problems we're going to solve
for how to support your feet and keep
them warm we wanted a product that would
be comfortable
machine washable easy to take off and
put back on and most importantly we want
to work on every desk after going
through the design process we went
through 50 different types of fabrics
over 20 different ways to attach it to
your desk using velcro suction cups
double-sided tapes when we finally came
out for the products that we have for
you today to put hammocks team you'll
see sticks to the bottom of any desk
using a powerful patented adhesive
technology that can hold up to 100
pounds it's easy to put on it's easy to
take off and it works under everyday the
foot habit can be adjust to any position
desired whether you want it close to the
ground or up and out of the way
