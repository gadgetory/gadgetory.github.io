send and receive messages browse through
news feed track fitness that and much
more all directly on my wrist all on its
own
here's a pocket screen much like a mouse
a keyboard or a monitor this pocket
screen is simply an interface for my hub
it's not very smart it doesn't need to
be if I need a bigger screen I can grab
a fab screen or I can plug it into this
keyboard if I want to be more productive
I can even use this dongle to turn any
existing TD into another screen for my
wrist now that I'm always using the same
computing hub I can start an application
on one screen and seamlessly continue it
on another if I lose a screen don't
worry it has none of my personal truck
and because these screens are
inexpensive and can be everywhere all I
ever need to carry is my husband
introducing the Zeus smart tire safety
monitors the next-generation technology
that puts you in control of your driving
safety safety has never looked so sexy
using the most advanced German sensors
Zeus monitors both tire pressure and
temperature in real-time and sends this
data to the app the Zeus is the first
ever tire monitor to be able to detect
slow leaks with its advanced data mining
technology this proprietary algorithm
called accurate temp analyzes pressure
and temperature data over time and
alerts you to any slow leaks that other
tire monitoring systems would have
missed the app report clearly pinpoints
the exact tire and the rate of leakage
to make it even more versatile we've
designed it as a device that anyone can
stealth install take it with you on your
next trip and easily install in just
three steps on your rental car when it
comes to protecting your family
everywhere you go choose the next
generation and safety technology a
smartphone that fits in the palm of your
hand this is jelly the world's smallest
4G smartphone it's hard to imagine a
world without smartphones
with performance also the sizes were
increasing and sometimes just wish to
have a smaller phone
so we developed jelly bringing you all
the convenience and performance of other
smartphones packed in a cave as small
and portable as possible
geli fits into any possible without
compromising on features it is the
perfect phone for travel or outdoor
sports or simply great as a backup song
with the dual SIM card slot some can
even manage work and personal calls
by taking advantage of the powerful and
enjoyed new big system you can get the
ultimate user experience on talking
Texas watching videos tracking sport
trip
and using your favorite apps jelly has
few cameras ready to capture any moments
or even taking perfect selfies the
battery is replaceable and fully charged
lasts up to three days working time or
seven days standby time our goal was to
design a great mini sized smartphone
that is smaller and lighter than
anything on the market but also supports
4G network
