Kickstarter campaign we really
appreciate it
I'm Scott Hinton our company is Elwin
and our product is the Elwin fit truely
wireless earbuds that always fit and you
don't have to remove them to charge so
we're a manufacturing company and we've
literally made millions of headphones
for other companies but we decided to
launch our own product because we wanted
to address the two biggest issues in our
field and that is the fit and the
battery life and we think what we've
come up with is pretty amazing what
really separates us is our
patent-pending infinity band and our fit
for live comfort guarantee the Infinity
band is an innovative way to combat the
number one issue with wireless earbuds
the battery life our infinity band
allows you to charge and listen at the
same time who wants to recharge in the
middle of a workout we don't so now you
don't have to plug in the Infinity band
and keep listening while you charge next
we focused on giving you the most custom
comfortable and secure fit possible
while most other earbud companies give
you three or four ear tips we include an
industry-leading 48 different earbud
comfort fit pieces with over 180
different combinations with every pair
of Elwin earbuds
we included the top tier microphone for
your phone calls we use the most
advanced csr bluetooth chipset in the
world that includes CBC and aptX
technology we combine that with
specially engineered six millimeter
micro dynamic drivers and in case you're
worried about getting them wet during
your workouts
we've encased everything in a tough
water-resistant exterior
best part is we've completed our design
engineering and tooling and we're ready
to start production as soon as we reach
our goal

and our city's careers and lives aren't
slowing down this pace and power of
technology has given us great mobility
but we've stopped feeling connected we
text tag post and email but most
importantly we call so cutting through
the noise to hear someone has meant
being tethered to your phone tangled in
your earbuds or being distracted by your
surroundings until now meet ripple buds
the smartest wireless earbuds with an
in-ear microphone that lets you clearly
capture your voice from inside your
eardrum using state-of-the-art noise
blocking technology ripple buds creates
a two-way path for sound waves that lets
you both hear and speak with just a
single bud as sound waves travel from
your body to your mouth they also exit
through the eustachian tube in the
eardrum here ripple buds captures and
transmits this sound to your caller
before it can be interfered with by the
sound waves around you this also means
that your smartphone's voice recognition
services such as Siri will have less
interference when trying to present
commands resulting in improved
functionality thanks to the wireless
design you can commute drive exercise
and perform any normal tasks without
distraction the audiophile quality sound
will make sure your favorite music
podcasts and soundtracks are always
crystal clear during your morning run
and to ensure your ripple buds are
always ready for important calls you can
charge them remotely with the compact
on-the-go recharging capsule that fits
right in your pocket I think years of
research and development a wrinkle
busting finally develop these new
generation air buds
we already have a working prototype all
the way need some capital to bring this
great product help us cut through the
noise by pre-ordering ripple buds today
and sharing the campaign with your
friends and family because it's time to
stop shouting and start hearing with
ripple buds
we're bombarded with noise every day so
sometimes it's good to just quiet down
and to be in silence that's why we
created quiet on a revolutionary noise
cancellation device which combines
active noise cancellation with passive
noise reduction to achieve a greater
degree of silence it can help you rest
focus or to simply quiet down when you
need it quiet ons battery and signal
processing technology allow for up to 50
hours of use on a single charge
planning for a long sleep or for several
flights back to back the system is fully
automatic and wireless activating when
removed from its charge in case it's
simple and it just works no settings no
buttons just silence whenever you need
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
