of the pack what if you could add
additional features that you never
thought would be possible on your mobile
device
next pack is a modular smartphone case
that allows you to customize your phone
to do more and to allow you to do more
with your phone how does it work slide
your phone into the next pack case add
some modules access the app and enjoy
the unique features in each module
provides we've already created 12
modules to get you going and there's
more to come next pack is the first
phone case that allows you to switch
hardware between Android and Apple
devices this means you can trade modules
with friends and family and experience
the different features each module
provides if you do choose to upgrade
your phone all you'll need to do is
change your case and your modules will
always work with you think about an app
store for modules that can enhance your
phone whenever we show it to someone we
get some crazy ideas for future modules
you
we came up with is augment the first of
its kind charging solution that we
believe will change the way people
charge on the go creating the charge
module was undoubtedly the most
challenging part of this project working
directly with our industry-leading
and Apple approved manufacturer from day
one we prototype several iterations of
the design to perfect the balance
between charge capacity and overall size
the result is amazing and we've been
able to fit twelve hundred milliamps or
sixty percent extra charge into a form
factor that fits neatly in your coin
pocket another great feature is that the
charge module only takes 60 minutes to
charge your iPhone so you plug it in
power up and put it away once it's
finished augment not just convenient
when you're out and about once you've
used the charge module you can simply
connect it to your phone plug in the
microUSB cable and charge both the
iPhone and charge Condor simultaneously
the automatic case itself is unique in a
number of ways primarily designed to
protect your iPhone case offers
360-degree dual layer protection the
visually impressive and iPhone
transforming squared design is driven by
the inclusion of the mounting system in
the base which allows for secure and
seamless attachment of the charge module
but we've also added some personality of
the time and applied a combination of
strong visual elements to create what we
think is one of the most beautiful and
unique cases on the market augment
charge modules can be use with or
without the augment case but for the
best experience we recommend using both
together
