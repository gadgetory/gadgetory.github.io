traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I could solve myself you know
once I had a solution for business
travel I realized this had great
application my personal life especially
in the outdoors going backpacking or
just on hikes I could bring water with
me and when the bottle was empty it it
collapses and goes away and takes no
extra space in my pack yeah it fits an
active lifestyle
weather in the winter when you're skiing
and you can fill up the hideaway in the
lodge or in the summer when you're
backpacking or hiking it collapses in
your backpack and takes no extra space
no one loves buying disposable water
bottles it's it's merely out of
convenience and the Hideaway makes a
reusable bottle more convenient in fact
in some places disposable water bottles
are being banned so we're all gonna move
towards the reusable water bottle model
and that's why I feel like this is kind
of the next generation and in hydration
this gives you an option to have a water
bottle all the time without having to
throw anything away the hideaway bottle
comes in two sizes 21 ounce and 12 ounce
which is great for kids and both are
watertight
lock technology hasn't improved in
almost 100 years who doesn't have a lock
that's completely useless because of a
forgotten combination or lost key at
best
we waste time searching for the right
key or fumbling through the combination
we thought it was time for the padlock
to enter the 21st century so we created
the no key
by using your smartphone and the note
key you can effortlessly protect your
belongings and don't whether you're
protecting your bike your locker or
anything else all you need is your
smartphone and your no key and you're
good to go
the no key uses wireless Bluetooth
technology going clicked it
automatically looks for a phone with a
compatible key and unlocks you don't
even need to remove your phone from your
pocket or purse the nokia Liao's you to
easily share your belonging safely and
securely while maintaining total control
with the no key sharing keys has never
been easier or safer with the nokia app
you can quickly give access without the
hassle or risk of giving up your key our
iOS and Android apps allow sharing to be
done on a one-time basis multi use basis
or any other customized schedule you
need giving access to your pool is just
a click away giving access to your
storage unit is just a click away
product design is our passion
form and function complement each other
in an attractive and simple designer we
made the Nokia with a water-resistant
shell devoid of any external buttons and
built with a user replaceable battery
that lasts over a year when it's time to
replace the battery simply unlock the no
key and replace it no tools required
what if your phone dies or is not with
you we thought of that too by
incorporating our quick click technology
you can create your own access code to
use when your smartphone is unavailable
making sure you'll never be left
stranded again we know many of you will
want to use your no key on your bike so
we created a custom cable and bike mount
to neatly and securely attach your no
key to your seat post the peace of mind
along with the convenience you'll gain
by incorporating the no key into your
life makes it a great investment for you
and a great gift for friends and family
no key no problem
okay so all of us own a few phone
accessories right and some of them can
actually do some really impressive
things but right now if I asked you to
get one you probably say I don't have it
with me
so most of the time you end up leaning
your phone against some random object
instead of actually using that expensive
tripod that you left at home so because
there weren't any real solutions we made
our own and back in 2013 we launched our
first Kickstarter campaign for the
pocket tripod a fully adjustable stand
for your iPhone that holds your device
in both portrait and landscape without
covering the school best part is that it
transforms into the size of a couple of
credit cards and hides away in any
wallet or purse until you need it again
once we had a universal opening shape we
made it in a range of sizes so that it
fits as many case and phone combinations
possible this is the new universal
pocket tripod does it work with the
Apple silicone case perfectly how about
the Galaxy Note yep works fantastic in
landscape and halfway in portrait
doesn't work with every case almost
unless it's gigantic
we've also created this guide that lets
you know exactly what pocket tripod you
need just by knowing what case and
device combination you have okay
but what if I like it bare but also
sometimes with protection do any two
pocket tripods nope because whenever you
swap your case or your phone you can
also get the adapters to match their new
size good to go the pocket tripods been
used and tested for the past two years
by thousands of people worldwide they
use it as their primary tripod every day
to take amazing time lapses for making
video calls and even to create light
paintings we've made the pocket tripod
with the highest standards of
engineering materials and manufacturing
they say the best camera is the one
that's with you and the same is true
when it comes to tripods
introducing suits the world's first
truly smart car charger designed in
Germany Zeus has both brains and beauty
the elegance shine lighting system
provides enhanced visibility and dark
environments and most importantly Zeus
is the only smart charger that can help
you find your car when you're at a loss
simply open the Zeus app and follow the
red arrow to find your car
Zeus also sports a powerful smart
chipset to deliver the swiftest charge
to any device charge to iPads at two
times the speed of normal car charges
Zeus is also the only charger to meet
u.s. military high temperature standards
another reason why Zeus is different two
times the speed two times smarter never
lose your car
