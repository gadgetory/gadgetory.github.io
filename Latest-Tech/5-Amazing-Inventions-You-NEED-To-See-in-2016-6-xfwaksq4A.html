the
you
I'm a mom and one of my son's first
words was okay I back which on the one
hand is kind of cute but on the other
hand a little bit scary I think I'm like
a lot of parents totally amazed by how
digitally savvy our kids are but at the
same time concerned that we might be
losing our kids to technology hi I'm
Molly and my kids are definitely drawn
to technology but it's their creativity
and imagination and spontaneity and
playfulness that I'm so inspired by we
can't stop the advance member of
technology but what we can do is use it
to create the type of meaningful
experiences we want to give our kids I
believe that as parents we're
responsible for directing the impact
that technology has on our children so
instead of button pushing or mine was
tapping we're creating a fun and
engaging experience where kids are
actually creating and not just reacting
it's from all of this that the idea for
kabuto was born kibou Co stands for the
kids book company and we're building an
online interactive platform for kids to
create and design their own books we're
bridging the online and offline worlds
so once the kids are finished with their
digital play online you can capture
their work in a printed tactile real
world book the vision for kabuto is big
we want to use technology to enhance the
potential of our children to help
develop a new generation of innovators
and creators not just consumers we also
have a social purpose to our business we
want to use our technology to facilitate
storytelling around the world but big
visions do require big dollars the good
news is we're not just dreamers we're
doers
and I have an insanely talented team who
have the entrepreneurial technical and
creative ability to make those happen
really they're rock stars the entire way
through we've been challenging ourselves
to think like five year olds and it's
from this perspective that we've
developed some really fun and unique
tools and features we've also been
working with kids through our entire
development to ensure we're creating
something that really resonates with
them so we're at a pivotal time in our
business we not only need to raise more
funds we need to continue to grow our
community and aligned and like-minded
supporters partners and collaborators
we've elected to run a crowdfunding
campaign because crowdfunding has proven
to be most successful on projects that
have a motivated following and strong
community and I know as no community
more passionate or powerful than parents
through contributing to our pre sales
campaign you can pre-order a
personalized and customized book that
your child will create when we launched
our site this fall we're really excited
to introduce kibou go to all of you we
hope that you will join our inspired and
Motley Crue on our journey to Goodman
Pope
you
man's history is one of making tools
tools that translate intention into fine
works of men innovating every step of
the way let me introduce myself I am now
and I am here to help you control
anything you put your mouse cursor over
you can use me with phages scroll
balance sliders of course I can also
control virtual knobs use me to drag
pretty much anything the vertically or
horizontally how about dragon keyframes
doing clip ethics face I can work with
radial elements too and I love helping
you ride audio tracks or perform quality
automation knob features a weighted
solid aluminium knob and a very precise
industrial grade encoder delivering
super smooth operation and bringing back
that good old radio tuning feeling that
has been missing from most modern media
production environments knob is a high
quality product all the electronics are
housed inside a durable handcrafted hard
wood mahogany enclosure
we've chosen only the finest materials
in order to create a device that is made
to last this would not have been
possible without the help from
experienced craftsmen putting their
hearts to what they're doing it can be
used with almost any program on any
operating system including Windows Mac
Linux or Android right out of the box
without having to install any extra
drivers or special software this is
possible by intelligently emulating a
human interface device like your
standard mouse or keyboard use it with
touch screens to control any element you
touch it's even possible to combine it
with desktop I tracking technology to
simply control what you set your eyes on
and there's more nob is a number of
additional productivity features that
make it shine in any media authoring
environment like for example touching
the right toggle switch to temporarily
flip the drag direction or double tap
its big knob to undo or redo the last
drag how about double tapping the left
toggle switch to jump between two screen
elements of your choice this is great
for mixing mastering or color grading
where you want to precisely adjust one
parameter against the other knob also
features an open serial protocol
interface to allow developers to use it
in any application they might find a
useful
hi i am do marinas computer engineer and
creator of knob after several iterations
we now have a device we would like to
serve with the world this is what you
can give us a hand by supporting our
campaign you help us kick start the
production of knob and you get the
chance to be one of the first to
experience it thank you for your
attention
let's face it water can be lots of fun
until we need to drink it sure we know
it's healthy but it just doesn't taste
as exciting as all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more of that job hey and
that's a problem a very big problem so
we decided to put some fun into drinking
water with the right cup it's the
world's first ever fruit flavored cup
designed to get people drinking more
water sure it might look simple but it
actually took six years of research and
patented technologies to get where we
are today and we believe it's going to
be a real game-changer so how does it
work Wow for starters our brain
identifies flavor using two main senses
taste and smell that's why we inserted
innovative fda-approved fruit scent and
flavor directly into the right cup so
when you drink water from it your nose
picks up the fruity aroma your tongue
senses the hint of a sweet taste and
your brain yells
what in fact you're only drinking
natural water oh wow that was great but
does it work well we asked ourselves
that very same question so we put the
right cup to the test with our orange
flavored prototype whoa okay wow you're
kidding me right what's in this he's not
just water tastes like something else
just water it's crazy brilliant just
brilliant now that we know that it works
let's meet the team behind the idea for
years I've been researching and
lecturing about scent marketing showing
how easy it is to manipulate the brain
with smell when I was 30 I was diagnosed
as diabetes and my doctors told me to
drink only water but I hated the taste
that's when I came up with the idea for
the right cup
after years of research and development
we've reached the stage where we need
your support to turn the right couple
into a reality the right cup is great
for anyone who wants to cut down on
sugary drinks and drink more water which
is basically everybody please help us
change lives of millions of people by
supporting our project on IndieGoGo
together we can make a real difference
and turn the world into a better and
healthier place one cup at a time let's
make drinking water fun again
