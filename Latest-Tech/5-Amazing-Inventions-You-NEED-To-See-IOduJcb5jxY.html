Mattern form two years ago we asked for
your help to bring 3d scanning to the
world make it affordable and accessible
for everyone with the matoran form 3d
scanner the response we got was
incredible now we want to put the power
of 3d into your hands and change the way
that you communicate you see at Manor
inform were obsessed with capturing the
world in new and unprecedented ways
photos are good videos great but there
are times when existing photography just
can't say what you need it to say when
two dimensions just aren't enough when a
photograph just doesn't tell the whole
picture it's time to move from 2d to 3d
introducing bevel
the bevel is the first 3d attachment of
its kind with isafe lasers it turns your
ordinary 2d camera into an amazing 3d
tool that lets you express yourself in a
completely new dimension elegantly
designed and universally compatible the
bevel works with both Android and iOS
and simply attaches to any tablet or
smartphone through the headphone jack
just hand the person place or thing that
you want to photograph
capture them in 3d and share your 3d
photos the same way you would share your
ordinary 2d photos that's right our apps
let you share your 3d content on your
social networks just like regular photos
we can't believe that 3d photography
isn't already an everyday thing the fact
is the technology already exists it's
just no one's taken the time to make it
into a tool that everyone can actually
use we think it's time to change all
that but we need your help
join us in the next revolution of
photography and you'll receive the bevel
a charging cable a calibration card the
app that lets you use the bevel to
capture amazing 3d photos and free
access to cache you an exclusive online
platform and mobile app suite that
powers your 3d content and lets you
share it online anywhere you want and
the best part is the bevel can be yours
for just $49 let's finally put the power
of 3d photography into your hands
express yourself in a whole new
dimension with bevel
we are surrounded by technology it's
entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal as
a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
into remote controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it select a surface
to attach it to and then to find all the
things you'd like Nike to do Nike can
control a wide variety of devices around
us but the true beauty of our technology
is that what it can do is only limited
by your imagination
put one in your living room or the
kitchen or even your bedroom
I mean imagine rolling over in the
morning and tapping a simple pattern
anywhere on your nightstand to snooze
your alarm and start the coffee maker
without even opening your eyes you just
bought ten more minutes in bed and
you'll definitely want to put one in
your kids bedroom it's exciting to think
of how naki will spark their imagination
as they figure out all kinds of ways to
use it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be
far more reliable and would better reach
than bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day
it currently includes nest Phillips you
live fax smart things IFTTT and more but
even if you're new to the smart
technology world you can still use naki
for simple functions around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
respected our patent-pending technology
uses non acoustic sensors it's able to
distinguish deliberate tap or knock
patterns from random vibrations in the
environment the beauty of our product is
that it makes any regular environment
into a user interface think about the
surfaces around you so many of them
serve one or two purposes add an AA key
to them and you instantly have a hub for
automation we carefully chose every
material and finish for Nagi we've gone
through a series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that naki blends
in in your environment and also looks
beautiful on your services we're doing
our first production runs here in the
USA because it's important for our
entire team to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible product we're excited
to bring Nike back Kickstarter it's not
some far-fetched idea we've finalized
our designs we have beautiful working
prototype and we need to raise funds to
actually get it into production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change
lives and bring joy to people everywhere
Nike accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
things that really matter
happen to the world around you with the
magic of naki
say goodbye to all your remotes and
batteries that you constantly need to
replace QE plug the connected device
that turns your Smartphone into a
universal remote compatible with all
types of infrared appliances TV DVD air
conditioner speakers a video projector
camera whatever the make cue you plug
offers the possibility to control all
your daily electronic devices in a
simple manner
we thought of this innovation to make
your lives easier compatible with
Android and iOS download the Kiwi plug
app from the Play Store or the App Store
connect Kiwi plug to your audio jack
sync appliances in one click according
to each room in your home or office then
the smartphone gathers and saves all
your remotes
once branded bearing a logo or colors of
a company QE plug becomes a promotional
tool or an innovative and original
business gift
then spit for the first time during the
CES at Las Vegas back in January 2016
and into the leading telecom
professionals through the Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona last February
Huey plug is going to change your
everyday life at home and at the office

hi I'm Greg Henderson and I'm Jill
Henderson we're the founders of pendo
the Hendo hoverboard is something that
has to be experienced in order to
understand words cannot describe it the
underlying technology is totally
scaleable we can make it really small or
really big and solving for the problem
of lift also revealed the solution for
propulsion and control we are able to
turn move drive around in any direction
go up and down slopes or do it all at
once if you'd like
imagine a vehicle with all the freedom
of a car and all the efficiency of a
high-speed train with our hover engines
that is now possible the Hendo
hoverboard is just the first step it's a
proof of concept the simplest path for
demonstrating our new technology in a
way everyone can understand it's a dream
realized when you support our
Kickstarter campaign one of the options
is the Hindoo developer kit the white
box inside you'll find a hover engine
you can use to hover whatever you like
you no longer need to be a scientist in
the lab to be a part of building the
future by putting this technology in
your hands who knows what we can develop
together the wheel may finally have some
competition thanks for believing
hello Kickstarter's I'm Zhang Han Chang
the CEO and designer of York I first
want to thank all the supporters of our
first solar project solar aid following
the success of the solar aid this year
we are coming back to present new solar
paper the thinnest and lightest solar
charger in the world let's take a look
you
hmm
you
you
you
solar paper is super small and slim so
you can conveniently carry the solar
paper when traveling or even in daily
life and use solar energy anywhere under
the Sun it can fully charge iPhone 6
within two and a half hours also Solar
paper is the world's first solar charger
that can auto reset by a comparison
operator so you don't have to worry
about shadow or cloud on solar panels
also it allows users to know exact power
amount via numbers displayed on the LCD
screen
various devices such as gopro external
battery Bluetooth speaker digital camera
double a battery charger flashlight
smartphone and even tablet PC that
requires more power can be charged by
adding additional panels magnet
connectors help to conveniently add or
subtract solar panels we are so proud of
that we've come this far but to meet the
price point for more people we need your
support and green we truly believe that
the solar technology can relieve the
battery problem we face every day and
contribute to making the word greener
thank you for watching the video and
enjoy the sunshine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
