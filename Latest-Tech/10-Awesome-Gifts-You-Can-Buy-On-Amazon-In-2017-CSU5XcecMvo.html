luxury we can't always afford until now
we all want to be able to protect what's
important to us
but it's not always easy
sometimes downright dangerous
that is until now the gun box is the
ideal way to defend responsibly the gun
box keeps your handgun safe while
allowing you quick convenient access
when you need it most the gun box is
built tough diecast using aircraft
strength aluminum alloy with a tensile
strength of over 24,000 psi and a
melting temperature of over 1,000
degrees the gun box opens using your RF
signature your biometric signature or if
you want a combination of both you can
charge your phones tablets and other
devices using the two USB ports on the
back beneath the premier models tough
aluminum exterior you'll find other
innovative features like the gun box
auto alert system which will send
notifications directly to your phone in
the event that your gun box is tampered
with and if your gun box is stolen you
can track it in real time with the
equipped GPS technology stay storage
quick access and all the fancy tech you
would expect from James Bond himself

trainer
like poetry
crazy whirlwind recess all y'all hand
they're waiting song imagine if you
didn't have to get your phone out for
every little thing what if there was a
simpler way to interact with your
devices flick is a wireless button that
connects to your iOS or Android device
so instead of going through your phone
you simply press the button
that's better I use the flick app to set
it up and then I can stick flick
wherever I want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around the flick is adjust for your
house you can stick your flicks anywhere
like in your car or on your bike
it's really cool
termination is on the left
and you can clip your flakes it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut me me me me me
like now oh I'm so sorry I have to take
this but so it could be so much more
than just a shortcut to your phone it
could be integrated with lots of
different services beyond your devices
check this one out
take the old cabbie when I get home I
want everything to just take care of
itself
movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates with your location or even
a distress signal to your family and
friends
and
Open Sesame
Sesame is what's called a smartlock
which means you can unlock it using your
phone as the key I've tried other smart
laws they're way too big their apps are
confusing it takes too long to connect
when they're hassle to install I'm
pretty handy sesame is different you can
install it in seconds literally no one's
screwing no replacing sesame has a
patented design that fits any latch
anywhere in the world the app is
handsome and intuitive but you can open
your door without it like this or like
this
sesame sentence when my phone is nearby
and gets ready for my special knob
and I can get the optional Wi-Fi access
it plugs into the wall nearby so sesame
is always on my home network and it's
linked to the access point with
Bluetooth which keeps it connected while
going easy on the battery it would no
keys it's easy to let other people in do
I can choose who has access and who
doesn't
I get notifications when my lock opens
and closes so I can always know what's
going on no matter where I am and it's
got military-grade encryption
no one's acting this way open sexy
