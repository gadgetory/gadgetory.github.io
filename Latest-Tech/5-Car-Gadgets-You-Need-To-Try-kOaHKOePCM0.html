yet all of today's technology for
yesterday's car waste when engulfed by
mass production accelerating consumption
and rampant materialism products are
designed to become obsolete when
discarded for the next big thing but the
pleating our natural resources at
astonishing rates of public pollutants
and trash into the environment
developments and sustainability are
promising but they're not happening fast
enough and the solutions are still too
expensive and inaccessible what if we
can make a machines last longer run more
efficiently and self-improve instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we see today what if we had
solution here and now that's our mission
at try boat X we're tackling the problem
of waste by creating the first of its
kind nanoparticles that actually repair
machines or increase in performance and
efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came up with a small
solution to this big problem paratext
nanoparticles have two phases one
deadlines are one less slides a sticky
side reinforces and strengthens or the
slippery side reduces friction just like
carbon telling to diamond in a mantle of
the earth
TurboTax sulfa lies through a diamond
like lattice structure under the heat
and pressure of the engine unlike other
protective proteins this process
actually reverses engine where particle
by particle restores it to a better than
new condition or initial focus was to
make lubricants safer among many
nanomaterials we worked on one unique
outlier reduced friction dramatically
down to super lubricity level with the
help of national labs and research
agencies we understood the mechanism and
developed proprietary production
products after years of research and
rigorous testing were proud to introduce
car boss a safe and green additive for
your car by improves gas mileage boosts
host power and extends the life of your
engine car boss comes in a small
recyclable
but you inject into the oil fill of your
car as you drive turbo text
nanoparticles are forged into a diamond
like armor around engine components
rejuvenating a daily driver to become
more efficient than when it was new a
third of the gas that you put in your
car is wasted on engine finishing with
612 million cars on the road that waste
adds up Rony on car boss will use less
fuel reduce pollution and leave a
smaller carbon footprint
