and were Ravens
we wanted to tell you about a project
we're starting it's a heated apparel
line we know there's other heated
jackets on the market we know that
they've tried and failed why another
heated jacket and we thought well we
thought we could do better
we started Arabian because we were both
active I wanted to have something that I
could wear from the climbing area all
the way back down to when I go back to
work and we thought well hey why not
create a jacket that we both like and
that fits our lifestyle we wanted to
come up with a jacket
that would solve a few problems one of
them that you could wear anywhere
it's your all-in-one jacket we felt like
it needed to be cost effective and we
felt like it could be something that you
wearing a layer or you can wear alone
and that would cover the temperature
ranges that you needed throughout the
season and throughout the day we
designed her jackets to literally go
from negative four degrees Fahrenheit
all the way up to fifty five degrees
Fahrenheit
along with the COPE you get our battery
which is patented to have a few
technologies in there one of them is
autocycle basically what that does is it
gives you the ability to have the
longest battery life that we think is on
the market up to ten hours on low in the
12 volt system you've got a pocket on
the inside of the jacket and within that
pocket you've got a 12 volt adapter and
all you need to do is plug it into the
battery slip the battery into the pocket
and zip it up and you're good to go with
our 12 volt system the down jackets you
get the jacket itself you get the
battery that 12-volt battery that comes
you get the charger and you get a set of
lightweight gloves that also heat up
power up to 12 volt system you press and
hold the button down for about five
seconds and then to turn it off you hold
press and hold for about five seconds
and then it goes off the battery also
charges in 90 minutes you can actually
charge your devices up to six times and
we've given you a buttonhole through the
pocket on the front of the coat or you
can plug in your phone and then on the
other side it comes through the
buttonhole and then you basically just
plug in it in the battery and you're
good to go instead of having to carry
around another battery or any other
situation you have it there ready to go
whenever you need it if your phone runs
out your iPad runs out or another device
you know we've even considered calling
this code the phone charging code
because you know that's such a useful
feature that people don't so we built
gloves that didn't require battery that
you can connected right into your code
and controlled from your code and the
gloves are thin so you get the dexterity
that you need and they still go to
formula we decided to add the touch
screen ability to our
gloves which makes the super convenient
let's go outside if you're in a
situation where you're in your down
jacket our down jacket and it rains
we've given you a water-resistant
coating so that you can get to where you
need to go without getting wet these
jackets are built to be washed and draw
them around chuck them in your washer
one of the problems we wanted to solve
was the durability of the jacket the
jackets that we found on the market just
weren't there so we wanted to build in a
serious variability and we stand behind
that way we give a 5 year warranty on
the heating element of the heating
system so if you have any trouble we're
gonna take care of it any season you're
gonna need a jacket one of our jackets
could be the solution and with the range
of jackets that's we've given you we
have a hooded down jacket a non hooded
down jacket we have a down vest and a
gray Heather hoodie we're pretty stoked
about how these jackets turned out we
designed them to be the kind of jacket
that you could wear anywhere and we
think they're simple and clean we came
to Kickstarter because we need your help
we need your help to finish our dream to
create and do full production on the
battery in the coats and anybody who
orders these jackets before October 15th
we're gonna deliver these to you before
Christmas we look forward to seeing you
in one of our rainy and jacket soon

you know we've even considered calling

decided to add the touch screen ability
to our gloves which makes it super

need to go without getting wet these
jackets are built to be washed
around check them in your washer one of
the problems we wanted to solve was the
durability of the jacket the jackets
that we found on the market just weren't
there so we wanted to build in a Serie
well maybe even do the robot dance
and if you're worried about losing your
phone lifx also still functions like a
normal light bulb there's so many more
uses for lifx like security mode when
you go on holidays matching the color of
your light to the color of your room
turning lamps into smart lamps great for
photographers or just having fun and
being creative and life it seems you
money life acts smart bulbs are super
easy to install all you need to do is
remove your existing light bulb screw in
the lifx smart bulb download our free
app from the App Store or Google Play
and you're good to go
not to mention they last up to 25 years
so why do we need your help well
reinventing the light bulb is no easy
task
and to produce lifx at an efficient
price point we need to buy thousands of
RGB LED lamps make dyes for the outer KC
create custom-built computer boards and
finalize our onboard software and app
development if we meet our goal we'll be
sending out surveys to all Kickstarter
backers asking which type of lifx bulb
you want the Edison screw the bayonet
cap or the downline they're all exactly
the same on the inside just with
different casings so if you pledge $69
you're essentially pre-ordering a lifx
Mart bulb there's also other pleasures
available if you want to fit out a room
your house or even your business just
check them out in the pledge section I
want to thank you for watching our
Kickstarter video your support will turn
our dream of reinventing the light bulb
into a reality
Oh
ring is a wearable input device which
will allow you to control almost
anything you just need to wear the ring
and tap on the side to start your
gesture ring captures and analyzes your
gesture inside of it it sends the data
to your smart devices vibration and led
notifies you of status updates and
notifications each application has its
own unique gesture mark so when you want
to use it simply perform the designated
action gesture marks can also be edited
making customization simple and easy to
control home appliances simply sync a
ring to them using your smart devices
you can connect directly or by using the
hub
when designing rain we had to start from
scratch we made numerous prototypes in
each time we got smaller while as
functionality improved
capturing and analyzing the fingers
movement was also a challenging task in
2013 our gesture recognition technology
was still in its early stages however by
2014 it has been nearly perfected and
has even precise enough to detect
letters now you can type text midair
anywhere anytime we also provide refund
than making typing quick and easy
another unique feature of ring.this is
advanced payment solution gateway when
used with GPS or ibeacon ring allows you
to immediately make payment transactions
revolutionising the way you shop we will
also open API so developers can make
original applications and publish in the
ring store the ring store allows you to
search for and install many applications
we've already tested and confirmed that
ring works with numerous hardware smart
devices and web services ring is a
futuristic input device that can control
I'm so proud to say that we are almost
ready for the mass production thank you
for your support we hope to begin this
new and exciting journey with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
