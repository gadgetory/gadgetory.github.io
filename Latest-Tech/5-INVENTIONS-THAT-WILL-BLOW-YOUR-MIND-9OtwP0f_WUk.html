and it runs out of juice
this is preserve the world's most
energy-efficient mobile phone charger
and power bank combined the way it works
is amazingly simple you connect your USB
cable to preserve when charging once
your mobile is fully charged the
electricity stops going to the phone and
starts preserving the energy in the
power bank magic preserve is not just a
power bank but also has a removable
battery that fits nicely into any wallet
it will give you an extra 30% juice when
you need it most
this feature makes preserve the first
power bank in the world that can be used
in two different locations at the same
time these days power bank users carry
more charge than they actually need a
practice that is extremely inconvenient
when you use preserve you simply save
time and increase the efficiency and
longevity of your phone nowadays there
is something wrong with the market of
climate equipment on the one hand there
are plenty of absolutely inefficient
small devices that don't prevent
suffering from heat on the other hand
there are other five bulky solutions
that consume tons of energy they require
complicated maintenance and to be honest
not always provide you with the desired
level of comfort I don't know about you
but I would like to have a device that
combines portability of desktop gadget
with efficiency of modern technology
meets next generation of evil polar
smart personal air-conditioner this
multifunctional device group humidified
and purifies the air and creating a
perfect microclimate around yourself the
opal is easy to use as wine to screen
fill the water tank adjust the fan speed
enjoyment if a polar works on power 40
of operation it will create these
natural refreshing breeze one can view
as the Sea coast and I found the dryer
hat and skim report produced moist and
taking care of your house and beauty
everybody has their own temperature of
comfort and optimal humidity level this
is definitely not something that central
air conditioning systems respect also
cooling effect spread and evenly and
those who are close to an air
conditioner always feel too hot and
others always feel to call during the
summer season fully air conditioned
spaces become unbearable and regular
heat way make it much worse even best
climber systems often can cope and you
need some extra cooling power eva polar
makes you feel comfortable in any
condition improving your productivity
and helping you to achieve more the core
technology behind the report is a breeze
especially developed operative
metamaterial based on minor line of
paddle little Oh super pole should be
both compact and powerful unlike
traditional materials have a breeze
doesn't contain any organic elements
this prevents bacteria and more spread
we're always there is no foreign or any
other toxic work
this makes the Apollo technology
absolutely safe to use and eco-friendly
thank you ever polar is a truly smart
delight it consumes less energy than
life saving bulbs significantly reducing
your bill with a variety of tools for
automation smart home integration and
application control ever polar will
easily become a natural part of your
office of home ecosystem
meet the nomadic travel bagg the most
functional travel bag ever don't think

raised on Kickstarter first with the
basics wallet then the basics notebook

supporters now over 100,000 people are
enjoying our products worldwide as our
company has evolved we have changed our
name to nomadic and we are excited to
introduce our most innovative product
yet the nomadic travel bag I want to
share a journey with you but with
20-plus noteworthy features and more
than a year of development and
relentless prototyping I'm going to have
to talk back here it goes first we study
the market current travel bags were good
but not great so we said let's create
the most functional travel bag ever
we met with local industrial designers
and then traveled halfway around the
world to talk this material and bag
manufacturing experts after testing
hundreds of materials reviewing tons of
hardware and learning to drive a
three-wheeled car yep that's me
the first prototype was made and we said
it's not good enough yet many long days
late nights and 20-plus prototypes later
we have finally create
the most functional travel bag ever the
nomadic travel bags let's dive in and
see what makes this bag so functional
the bag is made of strong waterproof
tarpaulin material that will last
forever and at 21 by 14 by 9 inches this
bag meets international carry-on
standard easily switch between backpack
and duffel bag and never have dangling
straps again we added a separate
compartment to keep your shoes separated
and protected a similar pocket can be
found on the top of the bag designed to
easily store socks underwear a light
jacket and other items you like to keep
organized or accessible we designed the
bag with a full perimeter zipper to give
you the widest opening possible for
optimal packing and easy access to the
interior of the bag once the top and
bottom pockets are packed there is still
plenty of room inside the bag for all
your clothing and toiletries by adding a
laptop and tablet pocket you can now
choose if you want to leave your
briefcase or laptop bag behind to fit
everything in one bag the right side of
the bag also has a full perimeter zipper
with multiple features inside first an
RFID safe pocket designed to be durable
and lined with RFID blocking material to
protect your credit cards passports and
other scannable information second there
is a combination of mesh fleece line and
zipper pockets to keep your cords
Powerbank earphones and other
miscellaneous items untangled and right
where you want them back to the top of
the bag our easy access pocket on the
top of the bag is also aligned with the
soft fleece to protect your everyday
valuable phone glasses etc we've also
added a water bottle pocket lined with
waterproof materials to keep your other
items safe in case it spills
moving to the left side of the bag we
added two top entry pockets perfect size
for a book another small item in case
you need to pack extra the vacuum bag
allows you to save room and bring even
more last but not least to keep your
dirty clothes organized while traveling
we have included a laundry bag this bag
easily expands and hangs on a doorknob
so that you have somewhere to put your
dirty clothes and when your trip is over
and your laundry bag is full just zip it
up and put it back in your bag to wash
them you get home we have also developed
some travel accessories that fit
perfectly inside and match the bag for
the ideal travel kit however in order to
make the ordering process easier on
kickstarter these products will become
available right after our campaign ends

sweat and tears put into this bag we
