one wallet I'm Sean and this is James
we're the co-founders of a mossy and
have spent the past twelve months
designing the m1 with three main
objectives number one to keep the card
safe from RF ID fraud number to ditch
the bulk number three pack it with
modern features arriving beauty
presented in its packaging the n1 comes
with five colored woven elastic straps
it's machined from a single piece of
aluminium and will securely hold six to
eight cards and will neatly fit your
banknotes to keep you protected your n1
comes with an aluminium shield which you
can sort in front of your contacts bank
cards to keep them safe from RFID fraud
the central divider is a great way of
avoiding card clash simply keep your
contactless bank cards on one side and
you wish the card or keyless entry card
on the other it's smooth finish and wait
gives it the most premium feel
and with taut elastic straps it still
allows for easy access to your cards and
to make life that little bit easier for
us guys we decided to integrate a bottle
opener into the design equipped with
five coloured interchangeable elastic
straps you'll be able to accessorize the
red one to match your look ever worried
about your wallet falling out of your
pocket
well we've also included a lanyard so
you can attack your anyone to yourself
and never have to worry again one last
great thing about the m1 it's slim and
minimal design makes it one of the most
comfortable wallets out there
nowadays almost everything is code
encrypted your phone your iPad your
Wi-Fi your suitcase the door of your
building and of course your credit card
has a digit code for sure it's better to
be safe by the way how safe is your
wallet in your own home for example have
you ever realized you were missing some
cash or is it safe in your own bedroom
your credit card number never ended up
on the internet without your consent at
the office are you really sure nobody
can sneak in your wallet and violate
your privacy then we realized there was
one item that we don't secure enough our
wallets this is why we created and are
proud to present the many safe wallet
the first code encrypted pocket-sized
vault including a locking system with a
thousand different combination
possibilities and a choose your own
system it's amazing how much progress
has been made in terms of tracking
systems lately that's why we propose the
option to embed your wallet with a
tracking system to ensure you never lose
it again it's also guarded with RFID
blocking technology your contactless
cards will be kept safe and protected
from electronic pickpockets the lock is
made out of metal for maximum
reliability
it is extremely handy thanks to its fan
shape interior giving easy access to all
your cards which are stored and well
sorted it can hold US dollars and euros
and fit up to twelve cards we've been
working on this idea for the past two
years with professional engineers to
reinvent and develop the locking system
to adapt it to a
wallet it's very light and strong thanks
to its conception and high-quality
materials we've also been working with
the designer Eric Bertus and his design
agency in Paris to make this wallet
aesthetically beautiful and practical in
its use so if you think this is a great
product for yourself your friends or
relatives we would love to have you on
board as a backer and don't forget it's
better to be safe
you
hi my name is Eric moon and this is the
latest prototype of my decadent
minimalist one wallet
hi Kickstarter this project started when
I took a mechanical engineering class at
Stanford University earlier this year we
were encouraged to solve real-world
problems with our projects carrying your
wallet in your back pocket is bad for
your back because of back pain I started
carrying my wallet in my front pocket
think about it
you certainly wouldn't sit for 8 to 10
hours a day with a 2x4 under one cheek
I needed something slimming I designed a
truly minimalist metal wallet one that
is well-suited for carrying credit cards
and identification the front pocket I
hate elastic straps velcro and rubber
bands so I designed a card wallet that
securely holds cards and is made from a
single piece of machined aluminum you
can feel and hear a positive click when
cards are inserted in Islam the dam1
wallet starts as a single solid billet
of 7075 t6 aircraft grade aluminum every
surface is precision cut to within two
thousandths of an inch
using computer numerical control milling
machines this results in a beautiful
finish we use a carbide key slot mill to
undercut a channel for your cards there
are also two rounded detents to lock
your cards in place
it makes the dm1 harder to manufacture
but we refuse to use multiple pieces
with screws and fasteners when one
properly designed minimalist part will
do the job we've made multiple
prototypes to ensure the design works
perfectly from CAD bottles to 3d
printing and CNC machine we have already
proven the design works and is
manufacturable the dm1 securely holds
one to eight credit cards in half the
space of a traditional leather wallet
the design is complete manufacturing has
been proven and all this campaign needs
you I'm ready to make your decadent
minimalist wallet we're currently
offering the diem one in four models
black anodized aluminum but clear
anodized deliver bold gold anodized
aluminum and tough a hard anodized
finish like you would find on high-end
cookware all four models can be custom
laser engraved with your name and
contact information please help me
launch this product support this
campaign and select one of the reward
levels now
our examples were the world's most
stylish and handy wallets
we added exquisite operating
characteristics and a practical design a
via door is not just a practical and
beautiful accessory but also a
multifunctional device with a set of
absolutely unique features it's a
totally new kind of accessory that you
have never seen before the trekking
option will prevent you from losing
sight of your wallet and losing your
money and valuable information the
connection works both ways
not only can you find your wallet using
your mobile phone which you can also
find your mobile phone using your wallet
ah Theodore can tell you when your
wallet is being opened you don't need to
worry about your wallet in your mobile
phone you'd better take care of yourself
in case of a dangerous event you can
calmly give the mugger your wallet after
you break one of its corners this panic
button will activate the SOS regime
immediately showing the location of the
mugger this data could be used to help
the police to notify your relatives or
for your own personal use that's not all
one of the while its features is a
built-in NFC chip which means that you
can pay for your purchases provide
personal information from your business
card and so on
check out the NFC options a via door is
also equipped to be used as an
electronic key we designed the wallet
with you in mind and we didn't forget
your information storage needs a via
door has an 8 gigabyte memory card
built-in we are sure this will be the
most original and useful present for a
person you care about a present that
shows you have an amazing sense of style
when designing the wallet
we paid particular attention to the
quality the wallet is handmade we use
cold aletter leather which is perhaps
the finest leather in the world we apply
rigorous quality standards to the metal
part of the wallet that contains the
digital information of the device and
the memory card this will make your
wallet truly unique durable and very
stylish
ah Theodore your chance to speed up the
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
