number 1 1942 the electric egg Paris
1942 at the darkest times of the Nazi
occupation petrol shortages man that the
horses and carts returned for delivery
duties but then reports began
circulating about a strange shiny little
car that silently flashed around the
streets this turned out to be the
invention of engineer Paul arson who had
dedicated to create a lightweight
three-wheeled electric runabout for the
city using a minimal amount of material
the little car soon acquired the name
the electric egg the egg consisted of an
aluminum and plexiglass body and
included full plexiglass doors for
excellent forward and side visibility
the remainder of the body was built of
aluminum hand poured into an egg shape
the Hoebel assemble was amazingly
lightweight and the interior was
minimalist in the extreme the value and
scarcity of aluminum and Plexiglas meant
that only one prototype could be built
and arson kept his beloved electric egg
in his collection for the rest of his
life taking it out for the occasional
drive number 2 1947 Norman Tim special
Norman Tim's was a los angeles-based
mechanical alter engineer who built this
one-off streamliner in the 1940s it is
said that the design was inspired by the
mid-engine auto union racers of the
1930s the resulting car was five point
five meters long curvaceous two-seater
with an exaggerated tail that seemed to
stretch the entire car its sensual and
sleek hand-built aluminum body features
a unique two-piece construction that
allows the tail section to open behind
the cockpit with the tail section up the
gas tank spare tire engine and other
mechanical components can be easily
accessed tim's had spent ten thousand
dollars to build a special enough to buy
three new Cadillacs
he would drive the special for a few
years and then sell it the car was
discovered in the desert of California
in 2002 before this had sat in front of
a restaurant while children would run
out the back of the car to get into the
driver's seat after it was restored and
rescued the car won a number of awards
and has since toured and been shown and
exhibitions across the u.s. number three
1953 General Motors Firebird the 1953
General Motors Firebird 1x p21 was an
actual jet fighter with four wheels a
tail fin and a bubble cockpit the
turbine engines spun off at 26,000
rounds per minute to generate the
whopping for the time 370 horsepower it
was the first gas turbine powered car
tested in the United States the cars
designer Harley Earl took his
inspiration from the innovations in
fighter aircraft design at the time
Emmett Conklin the Firebirds desk
supervisor was the only person qualified
to drive the car and he tested it up 200
miles per hour but upon shifting into
second gear the tires lost traction
under the extreme engine torque and he
immediately slowed down for fear of
crashing General Motors never intended
the cars for production but rather to
showcase the extremes in technology in
design that the company was able to
achieve the car recently joined the
display at the Henry Ford Museum in
Michigan
number four Chrysler Streamlight X Gilda
the guilty' named after Rita Hayworth's
famous role in the 1946 film of the same
name was designed by Giovanni 7ot
a pitiless Kia coach building firm Gilda
is greatly constructed with a sturdy
elegant aluminum body atop a square tube
chassis a separate aluminum floor for
the passenger compartment and the full
belly pan for aerodynamic efficiency the
car was shaped to take a gas turbine but
it was never fitted with one the guilded
toward the show circuit then was handed
over the Henry Ford Museum where it said
until purchased for a hundred and twenty
five thousand dollars the cars new owner
had the car restored and fitted as
originally intended with a gas turbine
computer and when tunnel modeling have
determined that the 70 horsepower
turbine would be capable of propelling
the car up to a hundred and sixty miles
per hour
number five 1970 Ferrari Madhu Lou the
weirdest Ferrari ever the Ferrari
modular was a concept car designed by
Pininfarina unveiled at the 1970 Geneva
Motor Show the company president
believed that it was too futuristic and
that it would not sit well alongside
some of its would be siblings it's easy
to see why even more than 40 years later
it was extremely impractical
only the most negligibly proportioned
adult would find comfort the car has an
extremely low body with a canopy style
roof that slides forward to permit entry
to the cabin of the car all four wheels
are partly covered another special
feature of the design are 24 holes in
the engine cupboard that revealed the
Ferrari v12 engine which develops 550
horsepower a top speed of 220 miles per
hour in 2014
pinin farina sold the car to an American
entrepreneur who is restoring it to full
operating condition number 6 1970
Stratos zero Bertoni the famous Italian
automobile company specialized in car
styling designed a concept car called
the Lancia Stratos zero which was shown
to the public in 1970 the prototype was
fluorescent red in color
and featured a distinctive windshield
providing maximum forward visibility
with almost no rear visibility the
futuristic design featured the row of
headlights across the front with 55 watt
bulbs the turn signals were sequential
going from centre to the edges the rear
ribbon of lights consisted of a strip of
84 mini bulbs the initial concept behind
zero was for bertoni's people to see how
low they could build a car
the seats were near horizontal and as
close to the ground as possible
the final version of the strata zero
peaked at just 33 inches so short
drivers had to enter through the hinged
windshield number 7 2001 BMW Jena
light visionary model the Jena light
visionary model is a fabric skin
shape-shifting sports car concept built
by BMW Jena stands for geometry and
functions and and adaptations the
concept came from BMWs head of design
Chris Bengal famous for upsetting the
German automakers design standbys with
hard geometry and chunky body parts he
covered the car's exterior in
polyurethane coated spandex that would
shift according to the car's aerodynamic
needs at the time the flexible
stretchable water-resistant translucent
man-made fabric skin resists high and
low temperatures the car body changes
its shape
according to exterior conditions and
speeds and it also allows the driver to
change its shape at will the headlights
are revealed when small motors pull the
fabric back in an eyelid like fashion
Jena project started in 2001 and it was
unveiled to the public for the first
time in 2008 number 8 1948 tasco the
company named tasko is an abbreviation
for the american sports car company this
mostly aluminum prototype was created to
inspire a contract with the Beech
Aircraft Company for production of an
aviation styled automobile the
post-world War two American sports car
prototype featured airplane inspired
controls it is the first car in the
world with t-top roof a one-off vehicle
designed by Gordon Buehring
aside from its rather uniquely designed
nose winch eating wheel covers at all
four corners and two passenger capacity
development and production costs for the
single car escalated to a whopping
fifty-seven thousand dollars the tasko
never even came close to scene
production the car can now be seen at
the Museum in Indiana number nine
1959 Cadillac cyclone the Cadillac
cyclone is a concept car built in 1959
by Cadillac the cyclone was never
mass-produced as a production model one
of the last cars designed by the
legendary Harley Earl the cyclone was a
test bed for futuristic styling and
technology the design was heavily
inspired by the aviation and rocket
designs of 1950s of the cyclone
stylistic features the bubble top canopy
was the most prominent silver coated for
UV protection the canopy automatically
opened along with the sliding
electrically operated doors the canopy
could also be stowed in the rear
compartment where it rested on a special
airbag base the black points on the
leading edge of the front fenders hit a
radar based guidance system meant to
interact with future smart roads the
cyclone appeared at various car shows
before its ultimate retirement in 1961
