things on your mind the last thing you
want to worry about is keeping your
devices charged traditional
international travel adapters come with
a single-use views which can be
difficult to replace assuming you have a
replacement meet the Zend or Passport
the world's first multi port
international travel adapter with a
built in self resetting fuse it's the
last international power adapter you'll
ever need while you travel easily charge
all of your devices wherever you are in
the world with its built-in four USB
ports and an AC output you can charge up
to five devices all at once
passports four USB ports deliver up to
five amps and 25 watts of DC power one
of the highest in the industry and in
case of an overload no worries passport
self resetting fuse will automatically
have your power up and running again
within one minute no need to carry
separate power adapters or extra
attachments to match the various outlets
around the world passport is your
compact all-in-one solution
this adapter easily adjusts for outlets
in over 150 countries and it's easy to
use the unique patent-pending press and
slide control system on the side allows
you to quickly adjust passport to any
outlet with just one hand and with all
these features we do not compromise on
convenience we've made passport one of
the smallest multi-port travel adapters
in the world so you can fit it in any
bag without taking up valuable space
when traveling you already have a lot of
things on your mind now charging all
your devices won't be one of them
this is the next step in the evolution
of family bikes visit agha 2.0 the most
comfortable safe easy to ride practical
and just all-around coolest family like
you couldn't possibly imagine the targa
2 has everything our customers wanted
and much more safety first
Tonga has three wheels so it's
inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options Tyga can
take one or two kids facing forwards
backwards or facing each other or a
boatload of laps to keep it versatile in
seconds Tyga - turns from a family bike
into a lockable cargo bike with extra
load space on top we use this brakes and
a Shimano gear and you can always easily
turn it into an electric bike for
effortless long distance rides now for
the fun part apart from the wind in
their hair we wanted the kids to have a
truly enjoyable adventure on our bikes
so we added the accessory bar to which
you can attach a variety of fun add-ons
yes there's also a water gun
and when it rains or if the kids just
want some privacy
there's the royal canopy it can all be
taken apart to fit into your car truck
oh and the seats come in a variety of
colors because you know the personal
touch transforms our own ultimate bike
into your own ultimate fighter last but
certainly not least the price while
creating the Targa - we never forgot the
one thing everyone asked make it
affordable make it affordable so we did
because to turn the family bike trend
into a real revolution we had to make it
accessible for everyone whether you use
it for a weekend trip a drop-off for
shopping or to carry your loyal friends
pataga - is an ideal solution
like poetry crazy world
corners
crazy
