recording so your privacy is protected

Angie hi max welcome home the essence of
home security
is simple you need to know what's going
on at home even when you're not there
did you know that even if you have an
alarm system 41% of attempted burglaries
happen when the alarm system isn't on
that's because classic security systems
are unsophisticated and frustrating to
use I mean who wants to tap a keypad
every time you step outside and even if
the alarm is on classic systems can't
tell you who's in the house whether it's
a spooky cat burglar a ninja or just a
grandma dropping off her famous
casserole which was delicious by the way
thanks grandma but really why is your
smart phone smarter than your home
security system meet Angie the world's
first truly autonomous home security
system for everyone we built it to be
completely secure effortlessly usable
and absolutely reliable Angie's fully
automated 2-step authentication process
senses the Bluetooth signals from cell
phones to immediately identify anyone
who enters your home and if your phone's
dead and uses voice recognition to
identify you and your family so relax
Angie's got you covered
here's a feature that'll turn heads
Angie has 360 degree visibility it
automatically rotates to follow all
motion and activity and it doesn't just
watch the room it's in Angie monitors
the entire perimeter of your home
simpli-stik motion tags on the windows
and doors and you're set the battery
also makes Angie easily portable so it's
ideal for keeping an eye on your kids
pets anything really
but life isn't only about being safe
it's also about having fun with your
family and friends
Angie can help you communicate with
whoever's at home from your kids to your
elderly parents it can also record
stream and share all easily controlled
by your voice so you can always remember
that year little Emma got a new puppy or
that awesome dance I did at the party

mobile applications with millions of
users we've always taken pride in our
ability to create an unbeatable user
experience and with Angie we've taken
this to the next level
what is the most precious thing in your
life for me
it's my home and my family their safety
is priceless I think this is true for
many people that's why I've decided to
build ng the first truly autonomous home
security system for everyone within an
incredible team and funding from a big
hardware company we've built a prototype
of ng in nine months it exceeded
everyone's expectations except ours
eventually the big company wanted to buy
us take away our vision instead we've
invested our own money stuck to our
vision and built a much improved version
of ng to get in G to your home we need
your help I hope you'll join us that was
fantastic
and to think he was nervous about his
monologue seriously guys he's not an
actor just a nerd who built an amazing
product so show some support thanks max</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
