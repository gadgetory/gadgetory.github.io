off the shelf it's the sound of imminent
fun so why haven't cooler designs change
in almost 50 years
boring coolers are boring break easily
and our pain to get to and from your
destination
I wanted to cool it it was really well
built it had so much fun built into it
that I would look for excuses to get
outside and enjoy so I created the
coolest
the coolest is a complete redesign of
what a cooler can be first you've got
this 18 volt rechargeable blender
you don't realize a number of places you
could really go for a blended cocktail
or smoothie until you've got a blender
built right into the lid you're already
carrying around a cooler full of ice and
tasty beverages why not blend them up
and become a summertime hero anytime
anywhere and what's the party without
music the coolest comes with a removable
Bluetooth speaker that connects to any
smartphone to wirelessly stream music
from up to 30 feet away it's amazing
where speaker technology has come in the
last few years
you can skip songs and adjust the volume
right from your phone and this little
box can really put out some sound band
since you've got that 18 volt battery
for the blender why not get the most out
of it maybe your camera battery's low or
maybe you have an iPhone and want to use
it after 2:00 in the afternoon recharge
your gear wherever you are with this
waterproof USB charger the party doesn't
stop just because the Sun Goes Down and
you shouldn't have to freeze your
fingers searching endlessly for your
favorite drink the coolest has
waterproof LED lights embedded in the
lids you can easily find what you're
looking for with the push of a button
one of the biggest hassles of outdoor
fun is hauling your gear back and forth
from the car and I've experimented with
various ways to solve the problem and
love coolers with wheels but I hate that
they refuse to help carry anything else
the coolest has you covered with locking
tie-down bungees so you can carry all
your stuff in just one trip and what
about getting organized to go out in the
first place the coolest helps out almost
like a picnic basket to make sure you
always have a few key essentials with
built-in storage for reusable plates /
cutting boards and this awesome rust
proof ceramic knife plus the removable
divider gives you a whole new level of
flexible packing options you can pull
the drain plug on one side and your
coolers can stay dry and cool just like
your refrigerator say goodbye to soggy
sandwiches regular cooler tires are
flimsy and sink right into the sand we
design the coolest wheels to be twice as
wide to roll twice as easily how many
hours of your life and you lost looking
for a bottle opener my grandpa's cooler
had one and so does the coolest
I create products for a living and the
manufacture the coolest I've lined up a
world-class sourcing company with years
of experience making top-shelf products
and they're standing by to coordinate
all stages of production and logistics
this will make sure you not only get
your coolest on time but it's the
highest quality coolest we can possibly
make as you can see we have our design
finalized and ready for the big leagues
but to move to the next stage requires
expensive tooling to pay for all the
coolest parts and the capital to buy our
components at a volume discount if you
were to go out today and buy all the
gear we packaging the coolest do it cost
over $500 well by backing this
Kickstarter campaign for just $180 you
can be one of the first people in the
world with the cooler it's actually cool
I travel a lot I I think I was out of
town 200 days last year I take a lot of
short trips I never want to check bags I
never want to wait at the Carousel I try
as much as possible as I know a lot of
people do to travel just with carry on
carry on just wasn't good enough the bag
was impossible you couldn't walk with
the bag over anything other than just a
perfectly flat surface and the world is
not perfectly flat we all travel as
commuters we travel more often on
shorter trips like many others I
realized that something was missing a
new type of traveler was evolving this
new traveler was not being taken care of
by any part of the industry this is
where Jiro comes in
the first thing I realized was that we
would need a large diameter wheel to
meet the needs of today's commuters and
travelers what our big wheels good for
for one they put the center of gravity
closer to the rotation axis and that
makes the bag feel dramatically lighter
these large access wheels strengthen the
sides of the bag and they're so slim
that they won't take any additional
space from the interior of the bag and
they run over everything after endless
hours of drawing and modeling
I finally got my dream wheel a
game-changing technology the wheel was
done but the bag wasn't quite there yet
more winning features needed to be added
to make zero the best possible bag for
commuters
we gathered a talented team of designers
and together we begun to develop and
design more and more features that have
made zero even more durable ergonomic
and functional we began work on a
carrion companion that would meet
international airline standards we
designed different compartments one to
all your personal items and one to keep
your work items like your 15-inch laptop
and an easy access pocket for carry-on
liquids we developed a very long strong
economic handle instead of weighing
every bag down with features someone
might not need we developed an optional
electronic module it includes a
proximity detector location tracker two
USB ports international power outlet for
your laptop and a battery strong enough
to charge your smartphone up to ten
times
step-by-step we created our dream bag a
bag that's unbelievably maneuverable and
tough without added weight a bag with
all-terrain wheels and features to help
you comfortably get to where you're
going regardless of where that is
this is the first really disruptive bag
that has come to market in 25 years
turning ideas to reality is an expensive
process we've completed the design and
have sourced the manufacturers and we
are ready to make the toolings and go to
production in order to bring tiro to
commuters and travelers around the world
we need your support to produce zero at
an industrial scale oh hi I'm Alex a
year ago my friend Jonathan and I
started working on a new type of
computer care we call it can oh and
we're really excited to show you it
today we designed it for all ages all
over the world and it gets you coding
right away
hi Alyssa hi
as kids we loved playing games and
building things with Lego
but today the tools are different today
we have cheap computers we have free
software and we started Kanno in order
to make these tools accessible for
everyone for fun and purpose now the
Challenger Kanna was said by Mika Alex's
seven-year-old cousin I want you to make
this a simple and fun as a beggar Mika
at a point and it's not just 7 year-olds
I think a lot of us you know we're
amazed what an amazing time to be alive
we're fascinated by this but we we have
no way to get in the available resources
they're tough there isn't a simple fun
way to get started we wanted to do
something different so we went around
the world we talked to hundreds of kids
parents teachers educators artists and
we came up with Kanna it's based on
three principles simple steps
storytelling
physical computing and tying them all
together a sense of play and exploration
you plug in the pieces you build a
computer your own computer you build a
case you customize it with your own
designs you build an amazing DIY speaker
you code games like snake and pong you
dive into
man line and explore you get to know
your computer you hack up games like
minecraft and at the end of it all you
look back and you realize wow you've
actually learned something you've got a
new type of skill a new way of
expressing yourself and one that's going
to be very very useful we think in the
future those computers have gotten more
complicated they've grown harder to
understand it's more important than ever
to give kids away in where they won't be
ready for the future and it's wonderful
to see the kids making a change in call
with the Caleb with the kind of computer
gives the power to create back to the
people it gives people the tools to
create it gives people the mindset to
think that ok this was once closed but
now it's open we made a consistent we
made the Kudus computer on it so like
you were actually the person who made it
so like dick you weren't just playing it
you felt like you actually made it so as
you can see we got great feedback and
now we're coming to Kickstarter because
we want to make a bigger production and
we want you to help us shape it and make
it happen who spent the last few months
working with the right suppliers
preparing our production schedule and
most importantly building a team of
people from six different countries that
are going to help us make it happen and
bring counter to you we've designed new
plug-and-play hardware for this amazing
simple out-of-the-box experience it's so
much fun and we think you're going to
love it on top of that we've powered up
the pie with these great software game's
levels projects and also fixes an
interface that's more intuitive and more
familiar we want to make more kits of
course but we also want to push these
updates back into the open-source
community we think that together all of
us we have the chance to do something
really cool we can give the new
generation the ability to create with
technology rather than just consume it
and that's something that we think is
really worthwhile
