isn't it fascinating hi a treat convert
energy purity from sunlight
it really needs nothing else
hi i'm ryan mcpoyle a head of the extra
design studio here in shanghai and over
the past few months we've been
developing a product with the intention
to make solar technology more
approachable and available to everyone
by the end of 2013 1.4 billion
smartphone will be in use every day
that is one smartphone for every five
people in the world and every day all
those smartphones are being plugged into
wall sockets to be charged the energy
all those phones need per year is
astonishing 5.6 million mega watts per
year is needed to charge all the
smartphones in the world today nearly
that amount of energy could power almost
half a million homes and this number of
phones is rising in five years time 4.5
billion smartphones will be used around
the world just imagine how much energy
all those phones are going to need and
how big the co2 emission will be to
produce that energy however there are
green energy alternatives solar energy
is not something that can only be used
on a big scale on by large companies
combining affordable technology and a
friendly and functional design we have
made solar energy available on a daily
basis where you this is the king
consolatory
the ginkgo solar tree is a completely
independent source of power relying only
on the Sun it can fully charge your
phone within two hours and can also
provide energy to your tablet by
collecting energy throughout the day and
storing it you can charge when you need
it day or night the tree is also
manufactured from sustainable materials
the leaves are made from Rison
which is a bio-based plastic and the
trunk is made from bamboo reducing the
carbon footprint as much as possible
the folding of the leaves allows for a
smaller packaging and reduced energy
consumption during shipping
all this combined in a product which is
solid durable and made for everyday use
we want to make a product that is
relevant and that will be used we
believe that the infra solar tree can
make a difference imagine the amount of
energy that we could save if our phones
were powered purely by solar energy if
you agree with us then we ask that you
will support us and making the game for
solar tree a reality thank you
