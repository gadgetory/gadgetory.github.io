invented this to turn this into a
dual-sim capable phone so if you have to
sub cards one for personal use one for
business one for data and one for calls
one for when you travel and one for when
you're 11 for Bruce and one for Batman
you can finally use one single iPhone 6
no more need to carry a second phone to
accommodate your second line when aimed
it to a simple phone sleeve that you
just snap on however its functionality
goes way beyond dual sim you can message
and you can call of course and you can
access all your contacts from your
primary line to your secondary line and
with the use of our savvy app and these
pretty lights it's easy to know what's
going on speaking of pity we made sure
to design the cover to be subtle and in
sync with the iphones design it
complements its aesthetics without
overpowering I know I'm prejudiced like
a father who thinks this kid is the
cutest up but it really is pretty isn't
it and so are you yeah but what's beauty
without brains we all know what hot spot
does your battery too is actually really
smart it offers you a 3g hotspot it
calculates your internet activity and
adjust its signal accordingly to give
you the longest battery life possible so
that's the brains what about the Brawn
because you can't just be pretty and
smart to get by in this world so that's
why we added the power bank feature that
will fuel your iPhone when its battery
is running low no more stressing about
getting to an electricity socket quick
beauty brains and brawn the full package
getting all these features back into
this tiny little thing took a lot of
effort two years of
prototypes lots of prototypes oops lots
and lots of arguing until we finally
agreed on two and it is our aim to make
it as transparent as possible so now
that you have our ducks in a row and the
planning and finalization process is
over all we need is your support your
contribution will go towards the
manufacturing costs so we can finally
turn this into this
so if you're tired of using two phones
get a power bank to pull through your
day and want to put an end to hire
roaming goals help us fun too so we can
bring it to life for you and the world
you
you
you
you
Oh
me
you
you
you
you
you
meet backpack the simple sweet and
useful phone case revolutionising how we
use our iphones its ergonomic design
lets you hold your phone with confidence
making the simple things what they
should be simple it's made to stand and
we made it for life with the personal
features that are made to fit you the
individual whether it's helping you wake
up or improving your teaching prowess
with this inbuilt magnet that's perfect
for any metal surface or even just
getting ready for dinner simply peel the
protective skin and press
you're all set
backpack mate for life
I pick play we are not only makers and
we love taking photos a lot lately
iphone have to cut our personal go to
camera because they are always with us
but no matter how powerful that is we
still think there's room for improvement
as a camera last year we launched step 6
thanks to you or ideas being brought to
light we focus on improving every
details and we rebuild that snap from
the ground up this is snap crow what
really connects a person to the moment
of taking a photograph it is a shadow
but with an iphone the virtual shutter
button and the volume keys simply aren't
at the right place and that's why we
design a patent-pending mechanism to
place the shutter button on the bottom
right side of your phone this way it
feels right when taking pictures and our
hands won't get in the way of the lens
with the snap 6 with added lenses to
expand the possibilities of taking
photos we've had Cpl telephoto fisheye +
y + macro lens now we're adding two more
into the mix ultra wide angle and full
frame the shine staff pro now comes with
interchangeable grips so you can switch
between moments like where you're on
photographer mode or we're just on a go
a new feature is that we use hybrid
materials to protect your iphone by
adding soft rubber bumper layer on all
sides of the case it now provides a
greater shock absorbing to your iPhone
this map Pro has a tripod thread whole
embedded to it so now you can do even
more with your iPhone with this feature
you can set up a tripod and use your
iPhone to take group shots night views
landscape shots and even time-lapse
videos we want to take a minute to
really thank you for having us brinda
snap series to life and with all the
feedbacks and support we have received
we have been working very hard to make
major refinements and we love what we
created now we need your help again
please join the right share with your
friends and families back us up we
promise to love it hi I'm Toby I'm from
I park where based on the east coast of
Australia in a little town called byron
bay we've been selling wooden base
products for the last four years so what
if I told you you could make a phone
case out of corn and wood well you can
and that's what we want to do during our
research we came across a material we
could use it's made from non-gmo corn
and the cornstarch is then made into a
resin and then the resin will then
become the shell or the outer part of
the phone case the great thing about
this is is corn is renewable and at the
end of its life cycle it's a hundred
percent compostable we've integrated
that with some Australian hardwood
Timbers for the feature on the back of
the phone case as well as all the ideas
which came from our customers was well
so over the last few years we've talked
to our customers encounter what what do
you want
and the same kind of things kept coming
up they wanted a phone case which was
slim or was durable it was protective it
was Okinawan the great thing about
having the wooden feature on the back is
it's a tactile and it's earthy and it
feels like it's alive if you to all the
phone cases that have been sold for
iphone 6 of 6 out of the last few years
and we had the opportunity to replace it
with our current one then you would
literally save thousands and thousands
of tons of plastic waste going into the
oceans and into landfill so as a small
business we're so excited because we
love researching different materials and
offering consumers a product which is
less harmful for the planet but also
stylish and beautiful
we hope you like the project we threw
for a small business this is a huge
opportunity to create a big change and
your funding I guess a business that
loves creating change in a stylish and
beautiful way the next stage for us is
we're at the prototype stage now which
is quite far is opening up to link and
then the design consultation to get us
through to the end stage so we hope you
like the product and would like to
support us and thank you for the time
and any support we get from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
