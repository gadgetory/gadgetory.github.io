portable wearable device that allows you
to capture and understand what's going
on in your brain in real time with the
emotive insight you can optimize your
cognitive performance you can measure
and monitor your own or your family's
mental health and fitness and you can
develop amazing new applications with
the technology we're pioneers in this
field we've listened to our user base
and we've redesigned the product from
the ground up we're now reaching out to
our community to help make this a
reality the Emotiv EPOC our first
generation device has been adopted and
used in more than 100 countries
worldwide across a broad spectrum of
different application areas everything
from being able to allow a child to
create a 3d monster just with the
fantasy of his or her mind or allow
people to create music just with the
power of their thought or to allow a
patient to be rehabilitated by being
able to control an electric wheelchair
or allow them to experience the ability
to type or to communicate again there
have been so many amazing application
areas and uses that have been
transformative and life changing for
anyone who loves the epochal love this
product even more because we feel like
we've taken not just one generation or
leave but we've taken many generational
leaps we've looked at the sensor
technology we've looked at the
electronics design we've looked at the
wireless communication protocol we've
looked at the overall mechanical design
we've looked at the form factor how do
we make it more affordable how do we
make it much more skeletal much lighter
weight much easier to wear we're really
excited to offer an api and sdk
locals and researchers wanting access to
the raw EEG data or to the detection
algorithms to make it possible for
anyone to take this innovation and
create amazing new applications with the
technology the emotive insight is slated
to be released in 2014 and by being an
early supporter you'll be among the
first in the world to receive it as soon
as it's available and you'll have a head
start in creating amazing new
applications for the technology I've
been believing in this for almost the
last decade and we've learned so much
from our community I mean they're a very
vocal community they care passionately
and deeply about what we've created
they've given us so much valuable
insights and and feedback around what
works what doesn't work and we've taken
all of that into account and we've
really tried to reassess our assumptions
and push that much harder push it at
that much further to try and create
something that's completely
revolutionary yet again
there's magicians that do
sleight-of-hand and then they call it
magic stop motion is animations it is
Magic have something this is inanimate
lifeless object and then having an
opportunity to get in there and bring it
to life is that is Magic sticky bones is
highly articulated precision poseable
animation public you have the
functionality of a skeleton armature but
then you have the form of puppet as well
it can eat up a lot of time when you're
in that exploration phase of exploring
poses so what sticky bones does sort of
bridges the gap between your ideas to
the computer just focus on what we as
and there's not to do and that's just
you know enemy in great stories as an
animator our job is to breathe life into
characters that were given with sticky
bones I thought wow this is a great way
to explore a pose not just in a flat 2d
plane but I can actually explore in 3d
to pose a character in 3d is a very
time-consuming process so much easier to
a little sketch and with something like
sticky bones you can quickly cause you
the way you want there you had all your
perspective it makes the job really easy
being able to hose it out you know maybe
I need to push it more those are sorts
of things that you can like work out
pretty quickly it's going to give you a
different perspective on what you're
doing but sticky bones attack it would
just speed up that planning process to
get me animating that much quicker
ever since Eric pitched the idea I know
I would have been using it throughout my
entire career holding a character that
we get to pose well in our hands kind of
magical I love fabricating and making
the puppets and things like this but I
wish there was a faster way to have the
animation puppet like just already ready
for me to go like right out of the box I
take it out and just start Hannah me so
that's when the first like seed an idea
happened
I start realizing all the other ways you
could use it besides just animation I
saw as a real tool where you can create
really cool poses to help animators and
artists tell their stories faster raise
Lee
sometimes you just want to play around
we just want something that you can dad
the first way I don't look like I 11
things sicky bones would definitely
speed up my process sticky bones just
seemed so accessible and deceivingly
simple with sticky bones it can help
like a people who aren't too familiar
with stop motion get more into it it's
kind of more intuitive just so fun to
just quickly and easily put it into fun
storytelling emotive imposes sticky
bones can change the way people work we
envision a world where sticky bones
could be a part of every animators
toolkit and we're really excited to make
sticky bones a reality
it's time to have real control over your
audio to guide sound directly to your
ears without headphones by focusing
audio directly where it is wanted and
reducing noise pollution in the process
the a speaker targets your music as a
composer and researcher and acoustics
and audio engineering since my youth I
believe the directional sound control is
the audio challenge of the 21st century
two years of research have led us to
this amazing technology to listening to
audio content without spillover and
noise pollution the a from acoustic arts
is a directional audio device offering
high fidelity sound it emits a narrow
beam of sound similar to the light of a
laser and enables us to target a very
specific zone our goal was to have the
science of VA disappear behind a clean
functional design
our technology was achieved through the
work of many different specialists in
acoustics electronics signal design and
industrial design we defined the A's
functionality and possible uses before
considering any technical limits so that
we could better adapt the science to the
need our first patent was registered in
april 2014 we released the a at
international CES this year won the best
starter prize at the la vallée
international virtual reality conference
as well as winning at Santa Clara
augmented world our most recent
installation was at the presidential
dedication ceremony for three resistance
fighters at the Pantheon in Paris VA is
a solution to the noise pollution that
we all experience each and every day it
will allow you to listen to your music
videos and other content and privacy
without distracting or annoying those
around you the A's development phase is
finished now we need your help to launch
the first production series of the a
speaker and bring you the most
extraordinary audio experience join us

alpha hello
I think the key problem is is you walk
into a meeting room with a for a
presentation and instead of worrying
about your pitch about what you need to
get across you're worried about can i
connect can I get it working that's a
problem that you shouldn't have to worry
about I was trying to do a presentation
to basically our entire company
including the CEO but I wanted to turn
my laptop around to show people actually
what was on my laptop screen and as I
was doing that the hdmi cable actually
broke off in my computer and I went oh
this is not good but now is the end of
the presentation
here we are demoing their airtime
technology where we're basically cutting
cables and streaming wirelessly from all
platforms you basically just walk in an
air team into the screen and then it's
one click from here we're connecting to
I have a stream and as you can see
there's nothing flocked in to the
computer and the latency is also pretty
great so that's
that's what we were doing here at CU
week air tame cunning cables work better
wirelessly and that's it I was an intern
in an office last summer I was
responsible for setting up the
presentation I always had confusion with
the wires and when it wasn't working it
was on my back and I was trying to
figure it out and I think something like
this would make that so much easier
they're a pain he had to put these on
through these stupid things and so
they're kind of garbage pretty pretty
old school actually my roommate in
college did and have one of these rip
alphas the side of his computer and we
kind of use it anymore so yeah put it
away yeah I don't like cables it's cool
because I mean you can use it on any
device any OS I think that's that's the
beauty of it you don't need to worry
about anything interesting plugging it
in and then it's being mirrored I think
it's cool
you know in the office you're not going
to bend 15 minutes setting up wires and
fumbling around and trying to connect
the most important thing is to do is if
you can eliminate them you can live
without that it's one less thing for you
to worry about your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
