planet computers introduces the jam
behind the modern clamshell based mobile
device with a palm-sized keyboard fully
integrated into the device its sleek
metal clamshell design both protects the
device and beautifully tucks away the
palm-sized QWERTY keyboard and screen
when closed
it fits into a pocket roughly the same
as today's mobile phone when open the
innovative clamshell also acts as a
support of the device the ultra wide 5.7
inch high-res Dutch screen provides
ample space for creating on the go the
full tactile keyboard is recognized as
the world's smallest keyboard for finger
touch typing Gemini has a powerful 10
core processor a graphics coprocessor
and 64 gigabytes of storage it is fully
equipped with 4G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
enabling both data communications and
mobile phone use it is designed to run
the latest Android OS and all your
favorite apps as well as Linux with a
dual boot option all below 400 grams of
weight the double sized battery provides
two weeks standby and 12 hours talktime
Gemini allows you to work in restricted
spaces comfortably on planes on trains
in coffee bars you can also hold the
device and use it with ease whilst in
the car standing up or on the bus okay
so all of us own a few phone accessories
right and some of them can actually do
some really impressive things but right
now if I asked you to get one you
probably say I don't have it with me so
most of the time you end up leaning your
phone against some random object instead
of actually using that expensive tripod
that you left at home so because there
weren't any real solutions we made our
own and back in 2013 we launched our
first Kickstarter campaign for the
pocket tripod a fully adjustable stand
for your iPhone it holds your device in
both portrait and landscape without
covering the school s part is that a
trance
into the size of a couple of credit
cards and hides away in any wallet or
purse until you need it again people
loved it we raised more than our funding
goal by almost double and even Apple
co-founder Steve Wozniak the was said
why didn't someone do this before what a
great idea that I wish I thought I put
one of them in my backpack which is
always with but then a few of our very
clever backers realized something that
we missed told us I've got a case on my
phone I'm not gonna take it off every
time that's just too much work and
someone else said so what you guys some
kind of Apple fanboys you know some
people with rock angela right-back got
us thinking you can't make a pocket
tripod for every phone and case model
out there there's at least a million
different combinations who knows so as
soon as we ship all rewards to our two
and a half thousand backers we started
working on a universal pocket tripod
instead of limiting it to only bear
iPhones for months
we studied case designs got feedback
from our backers and tested ideas once
we had a universal opening shape we made
it in a range of sizes so that it fits
as many case and phone combinations as
possible this is the new universal
pocket tripod
does it work with the Apple silicone
case perfectly how about the Galaxy Note
yep works fantastic in landscape and
halfway in portrait doesn't work with
every case almost unless it's gigantic
we've also created this guide that lets
you know exactly what pocket tripod you
need just by knowing what case and
device combination you have okay but
what if I like it bare but also
sometimes with protection do any two
pocket tripods nope because whenever you
swap your case or your phone you can
also get the adapters to match their new
size good to go the pocket tripods been
used and tested for the past two years
by thousands of people worldwide they
use it as their primary tripod every day
to take amazing time lapses for making
video calls and even to create light
paintings we've made the pocket tripod
with the highest standards of
engineering materials and manufacturing
they say the best camera is the one
that's with you and the same is true
when it comes to tripods
that's the sound of your phone
connecting to a charger it's the sound
of relief knowing you are still
connected to the world connecting and
disconnecting your phone from a charger
should be a simple seamless task but it
isn't we've all been there
frustrated at our cables for any number
of reasons
despite capable tips becoming smaller
they haven't evolved to become any
easier to connect until now presenting
the future of USB cables ASAP Connect
featuring rare-earth neodymium magnets
with 18 carat gold plating ASAP connect
will change the way you interact with
your USB devices forever
featuring the world's first reversible
cable on both the phone end and charger
end it works by inserting the tip to the
phone and the cable magnetizes on to the
tip instantly meaning you can
effortlessly connect when you only have
one hand free or in a hurry to head out
or even in the dark
you no longer have to worry about your
devices getting damaged
ASAP Connect even helps you retrieve
your phone from hard-to-reach places
we've designed two tips one for micro
USB devices such as Android phones mini
cameras and speakers the other is for
Apple products we've removed the
weakness of your traditional Apple
lightning connector tip which snaps off
easily by combining the tip and base
into one piece we call this the Alpha
connector one of the engineering hurdles
in designing a SAP Connect was its
compact size by condensing the
technology down to the size of a
fingertip we're able to make sure that
it's compatible with all phone cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
