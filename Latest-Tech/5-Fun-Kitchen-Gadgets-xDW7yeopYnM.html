Oh
hi my name is Julian and a few years ago
even though I was the gym guard my diet
was terrible and I was overweight at the
same time my mother was morbidly obese
we are both tried a series of dives in
the past but they were just
unsustainable and only worked for a
short time so at the end of that year my
mom was told she had to have an
operation because of her health and
obesity it was at that point I decide to
go back to university to study nutrition
and personal training as I was
determined to help her and myself
inspired by a method of portion control
where you use your hand to visualize the
amount of food you need for the day I
started designing exploring a workable
solution that had a book with
pre-measured average calorie marks had
pre measured average weights and sizes
of the correct food types and it allowed
us to visualize the correct portions of
food that we needed each day using my
own product I was able to lose 12% of my
points at a huge 50 pounds in just a few
months my mother who became malnourished
after her operation was now using it to
maintain a healthy weight
with texting the early prototypes of my
clients the weight changes up to four
pounds a week it was just amazing and so
simple for them to use the meal kit
gives a unique multifunctional product
whether you can actually see your
portion sizes to recommended average
calorie amount in each food group and
there is also an average portion weight
recommendation and all of this is
illustrated on the meal kit basis it's
beautifully designed to support a range
of diets for men and women it also makes
understanding portion sizes simpler so
even when you go out to dinner you can
now visualize how much you should eat
the milk its patent-pending scoops and
cups can help you to measure the
approximate amounts of protein
carbohydrates and fat you need each day
to reach your dietary goal simply by
moving the scoops to your diet goal
number your portion size would become
visual and not just words in a diaper
this means if you want to lose body fat
gain muscle mass or if you just want to
see the great portion sizes you should
be eating the milk it can quickly
illustrate your food for the day or just
for one minute with greens like lettuce
qtr
a village you can have as much as you
like and the great thing about the Milka
is you can silly the things you love
just in the right portion size we had
partnered with chef nutritional advisors
and personal trainers to create an
easy-to-use guide sort of great food
suggestions home workout videos help you
burn fat and build muscle rest the idea
of videos and we are currently in the
development stage of building an app for
all of this in one place we want the
milk it to be a learning experience as
well as a functional product so that
your diet becomes simple easy to
maintain and affordable the milk it has
been created using new food safe plastic
it is quick and easy to clean dishwasher
friendly easy to store and it keeps your
food safe the lids not only protects
your food but it doubles up as an
industry standard cutting board with a
liquid runoff reservoir and it has
non-slip rubber feet to stop it sliding
when you're preparing the food we have
color-coded each section to represent
different food groups illustrated in the
milk manual it can also help you save a
lot of money for example by using the
milk it's prepare your food you avoid
that expensive short lunch
it also helps the environment by
reducing fast-food kitchen waste all the
while you will be supporting your
digestive system with fresh proportions
healthy eating
to get people back in the kitchen we
wanted to create cookware that you
genuinely enjoy using and what's the one
item in your kitchen that you need to
make virtually every dish whether it's
for the finishing touches on a small
meal or cracking into a big snack your
chef's knife is at the core of every
cooking experience we created the bulat
chef's knife in order to bring you a
beautiful premium knife for less than
half of what you would pay from other
brands the feel is the heart of the
blade and from the very beginning we
wanted something that both performed
well but was also beautiful the folded
condiment escape sometimes referred to
as Damascus or pattern-welded steel has
origins that stretch back in history
steel makers from southern India were
once known for exporting the finest
steel in the world
this steel found its way to Damascus
where I became famous
it was widely traded with the various
empires that interacted with Damascus
including those of Eastern Europe where
it would become known as Bulat steel our
name
bula is a nod to the defender of this
deal we are evolving the art of knives
by taking the inspiration from French
German and Japanese knives making
creating one blade that truly embraces
the history of all of these knife makers
once we had a shape we liked we brought
that into the computer and created a 3d
prototyping CAD but seeing something in
3d on the computer and holding in your
hand are very different experience 3d
printing gave us the incredible ability
to print out and iterate on the design
in a way we could never have imagined
only a few years ago our goal was to
create a blade that catered to all types
of cutting chopping and slicing
techniques ultimately a large gentle
belly and dropped tip gave us the feel
we wanted on the cutting board then it
was time to bring the blades of life
we've established relationships with
some of them
experience makes many factories and
steel suppliers in the world our steel
is made in two cases a region of Japan
famous completely even the sharpest
knives aren't magic but a blade made
with a quality steel will sharpen better
and hold its edge much longer our blade
begins with the cutting core made of
vg-10 this innovative steel combines the
incredible cutting edge of high carbon
steel with the practicality of stainless
steel beyond just being extremely sharp
a next should also be a pleasure to use
we put a lot of thought into how people
hold their neck and after many revisions
we design a blade that's balanced and
comfortable to use regardless of the
size of your hands some groove in the
bolster guide your fingers into a pinch
grip the technique commonly used by
professional cooks my name is Daniel
alway I am the co-founder of urban air
core I I have different types of knives
for different types of jobs so this
knife I found that it was kind of like
them you want to you want a great knife
one great knife in your set this would
be the nice we strongly believe that you
should love your kitchenware as much as
you love your cooking you want a knife
that stays sharp feels great in your
hand and looks beautiful become a backer
and help us build a nice that you'll
love to cook with for years to come
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
