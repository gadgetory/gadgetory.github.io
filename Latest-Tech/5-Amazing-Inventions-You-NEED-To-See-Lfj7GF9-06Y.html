we wanted to create a product that we
ourselves want to use every day so in
developing sky buds we paid attention to
the things that people cared about the
most fit signal strength sound quality
and battery life the real problem with
wireless headphones is that they always
need to be charged charging anything
beside your phone on a day to day basis
is a real inconvenience but with our
patented case whenever you charge your
phone you charge your ear bones it's
that simple there's no need to carry
around a separate charging or storage
device just for your ear buds and so
when you go to sleep at night and you
plug in your thump not only do you wake
up with a fully charged phone and fully
charged ear buds but we added an extra
battery in the back of the case that
provides additional power for both your
phone and your butt throughout the
entire death truly wireless means no
more wires to get tangled on no more
cords to get ripped out of your ears and
our smartphone case allows an easy place
for you to put your sky buds in when
you're finished using them we also knew
that sky buds would have to be the
perfect companion for people with very
active lifestyles so yes sky buds are
sweat proof and to accommodate small
years like mine and much larger ears
like Jamie's we've developed
interchangeable bud tips in order to
make sure that sky buds fit everyone's
ears comfortably and securely we studied
tons of reports by ear surgeons and
tested and 3d map literally hundreds of
years not only your sky bug is going to
look sharp but they're gonna sound great
and the connection quality is going to
be excellent we put amazing speakers
into both year buds and use the process
called nano plating to make sure that
all your sound is uninterruptedly
in terms of battery to last for three to
four hours of continuous play but
remember as soon as you put them back in
the case will start recharged we
converge for products into one to Butz
you're truly wireless earbuds your
Bluetooth headset for Colin smartphone
case an extra smartphone battery are all
compressed into a single totally
convenient solution that charges and
stores or earbuds we've been living in
breathing sky buds for the past 14
months but we've taken it as far as we
can since we've put the best components
in sky buds mass production is expensive
help us by supporting sky buds and
becoming early advocates of the product
we are super excited to bring sky buds
to you the Kickstarter community and we
hope you love sky buds just as much as
we do
