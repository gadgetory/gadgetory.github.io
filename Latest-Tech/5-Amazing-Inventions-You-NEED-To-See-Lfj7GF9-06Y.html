magical with your help magical is about
to become un-freakin'-believable this is
shai a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he is a world loan expert in
cool stuff that flies two years ago shy
was challenged by his friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
thanks to 21,000 backers on Kickstarter
he made it happen people all over the
world are now controlling paper planes
from their smartphones with power up
three shy proudly came back to his
friend and his friend said wow that is
magical but you can't put a live
streaming camera on a paper airplane shy
thought for a minute and said challenge
accepted now after two years of testing

freaking believable invention power up
fpv the first ever paper airplane drone
with a live streaming camera using
state-of-the-art technology power up ftp
lets you see what your plane seems to
put it in different words you feel as if
you are flying through the air writing a
paper airplane yes power up fpv makes
your regular paper plane look like a
kitty next to a life riding a t-rex just
take a piece of paper fold it into a
plane and attach the module put your
phone in the cardboard viewer and you're
ready to fly the camera screams live
video through an app on your very own
smartphone sitting in the head mounted
goggles to control your plane just tilt

gamepad mode for when you feel like
handle control power up FPPs camera can
swivel around that's how you also get
wing view and back view so you can see
this defining moment in your
life look it's you flying a powerup fpv
so I wanted to create the most immersive
real time experience that's why he
partnered with a good folks of carrot

Wi-Fi from over 300 feet to make the
experience really smooth power up ftv

we wanted to create a product that we
ourselves want to use every day so in
developing sky buds we paid attention to
the things that people cared about the
most fit signal strength sound quality
and battery life the real problem with
wireless headphones is that they always
need to be charged charging anything
beside your phone on a day to day basis
is a real inconvenience but with our
patented case whenever you charge your
phone you charge your ear bones it's
that simple there's no need to carry
around a separate charging or storage
device just for your ear buds and so
when you go to sleep at night and you
plug in your thump not only do you wake
up with a fully charged phone and fully
charged ear buds but we added an extra
battery in the back of the case that
provides additional power for both your
phone and your butt throughout the
entire death truly wireless means no
more wires to get tangled on no more
cords to get ripped out of your ears and
our smartphone case allows an easy place
for you to put your sky buds in when
you're finished using them we also knew
that sky buds would have to be the
perfect companion for people with very
active lifestyles so yes sky buds are
sweat proof and to accommodate small
years like mine and much larger ears
like Jamie's we've developed
interchangeable bud tips in order to
make sure that sky buds fit everyone's
ears comfortably and securely we studied
tons of reports by ear surgeons and
tested and 3d map literally hundreds of
years not only your sky bug is going to
look sharp but they're gonna sound great
and the connection quality is going to
be excellent we put amazing speakers
into both year buds and use the process
called nano plating to make sure that
all your sound is uninterruptedly
in terms of battery to last for three to
four hours of continuous play but
remember as soon as you put them back in
the case will start recharged we
converge for products into one to Butz
you're truly wireless earbuds your
Bluetooth headset for Colin smartphone
case an extra smartphone battery are all
compressed into a single totally
convenient solution that charges and
stores or earbuds we've been living in
breathing sky buds for the past 14
months but we've taken it as far as we
can since we've put the best components
in sky buds mass production is expensive
help us by supporting sky buds and
becoming early advocates of the product
we are super excited to bring sky buds
to you the Kickstarter community and we
hope you love sky buds just as much as
we do
