gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained
you are your gun see when it's not on
you you want to know it's secure and
accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are a nuisance to
operate as for smart guns while smart
guns are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing sorex the new
generation of gun stores or X's caliber
specific it has two modes the first mode
is awareness if someone tries to tamper
with your gun you're immediately alerted
and when you need your gun charging it
will eject sorex and chamber a fresh
round the second mode is when your gun
is locked when Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel szura's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it you can also open zorax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with
now if your home is your safe and you
don't lock your gun but you still want
alerts we have a solution the zuhr
watchdog the zuhr watchdog is not a lock
but rather a notification device its
sole purpose is to notify you if your
weapon is tampered with
zorax was invented by veterans of elite
IDF technological and combat units who
worked on it for two years bringing it
to perfection
zorax allows you to be ready aware and
safe more than ever before

backers happy holidays from all of us at
mouth tech California USA
based on official statistics there are
600 million people who get behind the
wheel of pay cars every single day at
75% of that used very smart phone while
driving
hello kick-started my name is Ivan and
today I'm extremely proud to introduce
Hardwick was it is a simple smartphone
accessory but turns your Smartphone into
head-up display just like any fighter
jet or luxury car we've been working on
improving safety and comfort of a driver
for three years
we started with an irrigation app which
transforms our vision how how cellphones
can be used in cars by now over 1
million drivers have tried our and one
customer even told us it saved his life
other glass was inspired by rather racy
when you are driving 120 miles per hour
all your attentions focus on the road
ahead
look away even for a second is extremely
dangerous put in a head-up display in
the racecar is one thing but we realized
regular drivers face all the same
distractions and more using their
smartphones while driving
we put it to the test the two most
common distractions are reading
directions of your phone and checking
your speedometer this causes to drive
blind for approximately 300 feet on
every mile on a typical 10-mile trip we
are distracted and driving blind for
over half a mile using Hardware glass
this distraction time is reduced to
nearly zero head-up displays and cars do
exist already but they tend to be very
expensive and usually found only on
luxury vehicles some companies are
developing more affordable devices but
they still cost several hundred dollars
and a stack in the midst of a very long
and complicated development process so
you still cannot buy them today at Cod
way we take a simple around let's face
it your smartphone already has
everything you need to project data on
and which you bacon bright display GPS
internet sensors the only thing is
missing is a special optical glass to
providing high quality reflection of
your screen they are not rain or shine
well the only thing missing is missing
anymore
imagine that you already have had a
display in your car all you need is just
an accessory for your smartphone imagine
all navigation information is in front
of your eyes all the time imagine music
control conference calls or catching up
with your robot friend Siri there are no
limits you can use any app on any
smartphone that supports head-up display
mode now there is no need to take your
hands of the wheel or your eyes of the
road it's a safer and more comfortable
ride
what do you think about that
I feel like I'm in a sci-fi movie wow
it's really cool I like it I like the
reflection and it doesn't block your
view of anything it actually gives me
the option to just not have to look down
on my phone every two seconds you know
there's a lot of I am luxury cars that
have the capability and if you don't
have one of those kind of cars that you
know I think is great to have it's
convenient it's easy to use it sounds
like it even state wise without having
to take your eyes off the road how much
do you think it costs oh gosh I don't
know it must be some kind of fancy glass
maybe a few hundred dollars actually
only 49 come on $40 if she brings my
cell phone keys that won't work
that's awesome that's cool how the glass
is a spike in very dear face and it's
not appointed by in fact we're already
manufacturers first there's a bunch of
the devices and get great feedback for
my customers drivers and market experts
