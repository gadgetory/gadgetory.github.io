about we go to a Thai restaurant again
tonight yes number seven okay cool it
also doubles as a court organizer so say
goodbye to messy cables forever and you
can tuck it away and take it with you
wherever you go
you
and
and
our idea came from everyday experiences
such as this one lunch with your best
mate we talked about your studies
Netflix your date last night and how
awful it went when you go to check your
notification you notice that your screen
has been damaged since the last time you
looked at it and that's what cific
feeling is something pretty much all of
us can relate to and every time of the
hundreds of times if you look at your
device each day you'll feel it again
this is one of the key experiences that
we set out to fix to protect X what is
not be great the scratch screens were a
thing of the past let's now move on to
another everyday example you are sitting
in a cafe with your colony going over
the latest sales numbers in situations
such as these whether it be because you
don't pay attention or because you go to
hand over a pen it is quite possible
that disaster strikes bill you know that
sinking feeling in your chest when you
still liquid over your cellphone's
we do too now facility just lock all
your pictures and videos well consider
this even simpler case you're in a hurry
take an incoming phone call you place
your cell phone between head and
shoulder and you guessed it the phone
drops did you know around 20% of people
continue using their cell phones despite
its broken screen they don't want to
spend upwards of $200 per repair as the
saying goes new ideas and products are
solutions to problems we all face now
these have been a few of the examples of
all the experience that we took into
consideration when designing protect tax
let's take a step back rewind and have a
look to see how codec tax made
able to help in these examples one
supplier project tax let it dry if
practically becomes one which you divide
you can't see it and that's the point
but you have just had it an extremely
strong layer to your device that
protects it from scratches another great
feature is the so called load assistance
once you apply project packs to device
and it's fully hardened out liquids are
going to fall off your device a lot
faster than normal but drastically
reduce the chances of liquids getting
caught in the electronics and causing
damage so this doesn't mean we just
waterproof your device but the chances
of survival are increased by a large
margin
another big deal of protech packs is the
fact that surety provides fall onto its
screen the chances for a break or reduce
drastically
the most popular method today to protect
your screen are these foil screen
protectors that are a hassle to put on
and look like crap a few days later you
can toss those the side of the follow
these easy steps step one clean your
screen with your education number one to
empty the protector packs cartridge onto
the middle of your screen use your
finger to spread it across the whole
front give it ten minutes to dry then
use to turn number three apply a clean
finish improved touch screen
functionality water repelling properties
and an increased scratch resistance to
take on the challenges of everyday life
this is the way that cell phone
protection should look like in the 21st
century you cannot just use protect
packs on your cell phones but also on
your tablet screens glasses cameras any
surface that needs protection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
