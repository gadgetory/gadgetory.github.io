wherever you go
you
and
and
our idea came from everyday experiences
such as this one lunch with your best
mate we talked about your studies
Netflix your date last night and how
awful it went when you go to check your
notification you notice that your screen
has been damaged since the last time you
looked at it and that's what cific
feeling is something pretty much all of
us can relate to and every time of the
hundreds of times if you look at your
device each day you'll feel it again
this is one of the key experiences that
we set out to fix to protect X what is
not be great the scratch screens were a
thing of the past let's now move on to
another everyday example you are sitting
in a cafe with your colony going over

hand over a pen it is quite possible
that disaster strikes bill you know that

its broken screen they don't want to
spend upwards of $200 per repair as the
saying goes new ideas and products are
solutions to problems we all face now

you can't see it and that's the point
but you have just had it an extremely
strong layer to your device that
protects it from scratches another great
feature is the so called load assistance
once you apply project packs to device
and it's fully hardened out liquids are
going to fall off your device a lot
faster than normal but drastically
reduce the chances of liquids getting
caught in the electronics and causing
damage so this doesn't mean we just
waterproof your device but the chances
of survival are increased by a large
margin
another big deal of protech packs is the
fact that surety provides fall onto its
screen the chances for a break or reduce
drastically

your screen are these foil screen
