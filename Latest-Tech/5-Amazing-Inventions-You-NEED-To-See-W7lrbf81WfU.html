will show you the best mr. reality
possession device for smartphones visual
effects can be rotated on enemy vehicles
acessories furnishings and high class
let's see housing the car
imagine a system that can replicate
environments this is BioPod the world's
most versatile microhabitat
tell BioPod what you wanted to grow and
watch it happen replicating the most
precise seasonal fluctuations year-round
BioPod is space-age technology in your
own home as a young biologist I was
researching the conservation of frogs in
the tropical rainforest frogs are one of
the world's most sensitive creatures
they're often considered the canary in
the coal mine for the entire planet and
because their habitat is disappearing so
rapidly it was necessary to develop new
technology in order to preserve a copy
of the pristine rainforest that these
animals enjoy in nature and then came
the question if we can make a system
that can replicate this environment why
can't it do more BioPod has numerous
applications use it to grow organic
fresh herbs to house your favorite
reptiles or as a beautiful addition to
your home decor biopods advanced sensory
feedback system measures crucial data
from your bio pot and sends it to our
cloud for analysis our algorithms then
send back data to your BioPod so that it
can create an optimal environment we've
packed a considerable amount of advanced
technology into each BioPod the Wi-Fi
connected app and HD camera allow you to
control and view your bio pot from
anywhere in the world
lack of oxygen can be catastrophic for
delicate environments our bio pure
system allows for continual o2 injection
oxygenating the substrate and keeping
your bio pot pristine just as it is in
nature this means that your plants and
animals will require minimal maintenance
which is great for novice users the
built-in LED panel automatic irrigation
system and integrated heating ensures
that your plants and animals have
everything they need to thrive
we've spent several years perfecting the
technology and design of BioPod we've
gone through many iterations and designs
we have working prototypes our suppliers
and manufacturers are ready to go we are
ready to launch BioPod into the market
our vision is to bring a community of
plant and animal lovers together in
order to solve some of the Earth's
conservation and sustainability issues
with your help we can make BioPod a
reality
you
with the success of our first
Kickstarter the world's first heated
down jacket which we produced and
shipped in a record-setting three months
we got to thinking what else could we
create that people use but are just
satisfied with the current products on
the market I recently went camping
probably a little too early in the
season I only have my a two-season bag
that was rated to 30 degrees and I
dropped below like 20 degrees I was cold
I was miserable so I thought why not put
my arabian heated jacket on I fired it
up my core was toasty but my feet were
freezing all I could think was I wish I
had another heated jacket which sparked
an idea why don't we create a heated
sleeping bag he started chewing on that
idea I realize not everyone wants to buy
a brand new bag so we thought what if we
created something that would make their
current bag work in colder temperatures
The Raven heated sleeping bag liner was
born after a lot of iterations we
created two sleeping bag liner versions
first version is what we call the simple
it's the shape of a mummy bag heating
elements wrap around your core and your
feet it has a side zipper like most bags
which can be accessed from the inside or
the outside of the bag the added since
around the top makes it so that you can
close it all the way up as tight as you
want we also added a foot box at the
bottom so your feet are nice and
comfortable there's a vertical draw
along the side of the bag so you can
adjust the length to put the heat on
your feet where you want it adjust to
your height the battery pockets are at
the bottom of the bag so you won't roll
on them or get in your way while you're
sleeping we think this first version of
the bag liner is a great product and it
can be used in any sleeping bag for
those colder outings where your current
bag isn't quite warm enough or as a
standalone sleeping bag for summer
camping where you want to cut weight and
space for our second version of the
sleeping bag liner we went even more ray
V and on it we thought what if we made
the bag liner do
or what have we made it wearable and you
could get up in the morning and stay
warm without having to change clothes in
the chilly morning air you can walk
around camp and cook your breakfast you
can chop some firewood or other stuff
around camp until the day starts to warm
up we added a hood that's heated as well
so you can keep that precious noggin of
yours warm we actually built in a bunch
of other features as well in addition to
the heated hood the core and the feet
there are three temperature settings
high medium and low for each heating
zone your feet and your upper body with
the button controller you can direct
where you want the heat and control the
temperature levels independent of each
other it's all in your control like the
first version it has a vertical
drawstring so you can adjust the length
of the bag liner to your height sensors
are located at the bottom to center
around your feet to keep them toasty or
since around your waist to wear it
around camp like a long jacket we've had
a eunuch us to keep the sleeves in place
and keep the chill out we've given you
some simple hand pockets to stuff things
in and chest pockets for your mobile
devices and other items you want to keep
secure the main zipper is extra long so
you can step into it and slip it on
easily the hood closure is nice and
small to keep the heat in
the batteries are located at the bottom
of the liner so they won't interfere
with your sleep when you have it cinched
around your waist it rides on the back
around your belt line so it won't get in
the way and you won't feel it we cut
down on anything that wasn't necessary
so you're as comfortable as possible
when you sleep some other features that
both of the bag liners share you can
charge your mobile devices while you're
sleeping as well both can last up to 12
hours depending on the setting both are
water-resistant they're easy to clean
and wash both are light and compact
since we don't know when to stop we've
completely redesigned our 12 volt
battery with to capacity size options
the larger one at fifteen thousand six
hundred milliamps and the smaller one at
seventy eight hundred milliamps each
capacity is curved along the length of
the battery and fits the natural curve
of your torso they are one half-inch
thinner than the current battery the
larger battery will increase your play
time by thirty percent each comes with a
protective silicone mesh which also
keeps it from sliding around in the
battery pocket the new battery is also
backwards compatible with the current 12
volt and five volt rabia need a jacket
you think you're going to flip over how
comfortable these batteries are to where
we need your help to fund the production
of the bag liners and the new 12-volt
batteries help us make some really cool
products and be the first to own a
heated rave Ian sleeping bag liner
