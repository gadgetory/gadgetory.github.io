you
that's the sound of your phone
connecting to a charger it's the sound
of relief knowing you are still
connected to the world connecting and
disconnecting your phone from a charger
should be a simple seamless task but it
isn't we've all been there
frustrated at our cables for any number
of reasons
despite capable tips becoming smaller
they haven't evolved to become any
easier to connect until now presenting
the future of USB cables ASAP Connect
featuring rare-earth neodymium magnets
with 18 carat gold plating ASAP Connect
will change the way you interact with
your USB devices forever
featuring the world's first reversible
cable on both the phone end and charger
end
it works by inserting the tip to the
phone and the cable magnetizes on to the
tip instantly meaning you can
effortlessly connect when you only have
one hand free or in a hurry to head out
or even in the dark you no longer have
to worry about your devices getting
damaged
ASAP Connect even helps you retrieve
your phone from hard-to-reach places
we've designed two tips one for micro
USB devices such as Android phones mini
cameras and speakers the other is for
Apple products we've removed the
weakness of your traditional Apple
lightning connector tip which snaps off
easily by combining the tip and base
into one piece we call this the Alpha
connector one of the engineering hurdles
in designing a SAP Connect was its
compact size by condensing the
technology down to the size of a
fingertip we're able to make sure that
it's compatible with all phone cases in
creating a new standard for USB cables
we have performed the most stringent
quality control tests combined with
superior materials to really challenge
the users expectations of what a
state-of-the-art USB cable should be
we've spent the past two years working
closely with one of the world's largest
USB cable manufacturers we're a team of
disruptors from Sydney to LA I believe
that users should be the creators of
products not large corporations seeking
profit over practicality we've created
the final prototypes and delivered
samples to dozens of major tech
publications worldwide through your help
combined with the magic of IndieGoGo we
hope to bring ASAP connect to life and
unleash the future of USB cables today
we love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go they help us plan our
day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us
they even support our work day but all
these fun functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quick charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Q simply wrap it in this
tuck away slot and you're good to go how
really does the cube work well it's a
simple concept just plug your cube into
your phone and into the power source it
detects when your smart phone is fully
charged and redirects the charge to its
internal battery unlike your power bank
that must be charged separately cube
automatically charges itself while
charging your phone so you always know
that cube is there for you and will
never let you down hi my name is
question as every busy person I was
often on the road and almost every day
my phone was running out of the battery
in the arty instead of messy wires and
power bank
wanted to have only one small device
that can replace the number of home
accessories I have to carry every day
when we started to think about the cube
we look at the existing technology
Olimar and we quickly notice that most
of the available devices were not
complete and not user-friendly together
with fear our head designer we developed
the cube we went through several
prototypes to find the best design
review a designer this elegance compact
and practical it was so challenging with
all those functionalities together into
a small and cool design with a
significant battery capacity it was
something that had never been done but
we made it and we're so proud and
excited to bring it to you cube is the
world's first compact and lightweight
device that combines the functions of a
power bank a memory storage and a sink
and quick charging cable you'll also
agree it's one of the coolest looking
power banks around simply put it's an
amazing piece of technology that we can
