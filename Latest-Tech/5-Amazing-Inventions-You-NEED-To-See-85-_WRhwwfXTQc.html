natural world it's like magic it has a
certain feeling to it we all love
technology but what was life like before
it it was an era where people had time
to enjoy the outdoors and soak up
Earth's natural goodness today we live
in a world overflowing with technology
that benefits mankind but what about its
dangers from pollution to radiation to
electromagnetic waves technology affects
the way we think feel and even sleep but
what if there was a way to enjoy your
cell phones tablets and televisions
without the harmful effects introducing
zen cube
the healthiest lab ever inspired by the
purest places on earth we used our
expertise to create and build something
pure that we would be proud of bring the
benefits of the outdoors into where we
spend the most time our homes and
offices being at a waterfall or the
beach or in the countryside gives off
lots of negative ions which is what the
body needs to feel great technology does
the opposite gives off lots of positive
ions which make us feel tired stressed
agitate himalayan salt is one of the
Earth's riches substances Zen cue
harnesses list to bring the benefits of
the outdoors to you it chemically and
physically transforms a room that has
unique healing effects as n cube is
designed to admit negative ions which
cleans and deodorizes the air reducing
allergies coughing reduces radiation and
neutralizes electromagnetic waves
emitted by technology this also reduces
static in the air increases energy

brain resulting in better sleep patterns
Himalayan salt lamps are not new they
traditionally come with their own
problems it often melt your hot to the
touch use a lots of electricity and can
be messy not to mention they didn't
always look the best zen cube stays cool
does not melt his long lasting not to
mention its style we wanted it to look
stunning they had you inspire relaxation

original but had to be big enough to
exhume the right amount of goodness

RGB LED light source to have the perfect
glow with amazing efficiency the RGB

elf Emmett is an active non-invasive
wearable technology that helps us face
the challenges of our stressful
lifestyle even when you're chronically
stressed elf Emmett will help you return
to a balanced State
with so many things going on it's hard
to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn out Emmett will
help you focus and concentrate when you
need to
most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting elf m it
will calm you down and rock you into a
deep sleep elf Emmett works in synergy
with the natural rhythm of your mind and
body waves when you're active and
focused your brain frequency is high
when you're resting it slows down
however because of our busy lifestyle
our brain waves aren't always in tune
with what we need elf Emmett uses pulsed
electromagnetic technology to
non-invasively synchronize your mind
with the frequency of what you want to
do learn and concentrate while feeling
stressed
improve the quality of your sleep stay
awake when feeling tired relax after a
hard day we designed the technology
around a beautiful light headband that
is powered by your smartphone or tablet
and operated with a simple application
people have always used extremely low
frequencies to achieve altered states of
consciousness just think of meditating
to the rhythmic sound of drums Gong
therapy or the steady flashing light of
a fire things that take us into a state
of thoughtfulness even when the sound of
cranes
rhythms in music a ticking clock they
all have an effect on us we always adapt
to an external frequency our entire
biological system the brain and the
earth itself work at the same
frequencies mr. Nikola Tesla once said
that if we can influence those
frequencies electronically we can
directly stimulate the entire body and
mental system of humankind elf Emmett
uses the same power source as your
headphones to generate a weak
electromagnetic pulse between two coils
to demonstrate we can connect the coils
to a speaker and actually hear the
frequency that the application transmits
its music you can't hear the cerebellum
is the part of our brains that links the
brain and the heart depending on our
situation it suggests our performance
rhythm this is the spot that says slow
down there's no danger relax or it says
hurry up we have work to do concentrate
elf Emmett works directly on the
cerebellum and can influence the whole
system it tells both the brainwaves and
heartbeat to speed up or slow down
