technology when it comes to technology
we often forget the history behind some
of the things we rely on here are some
of the weird and fun facts we don't
always think about number one a red
panda is an animal native to the
Himalayas and southwestern China the
English word for red panda is Firefox
which is where the browser gets its name
from so technically it's a panda not a
fox number two if a Duracell battery
leaks and destroys one of your device's
the company will replace the device if
it's sent to them with a defective
battery still in place number three in
2012 at least 17 newborn girls were
named Siri number 4 the very first Apple
logo featured Sir Isaac Newton sitting
underneath a tree with an apple about to
hit his head number 5 tech companies
often test new products in New Zealand
the reason for this the country is
diverse its residents speak English and
if a product fails news don't spread as
fast because it's relatively isolated
number 6 there is a factory in Japan
which can run unsupervised for 30 days
at a time because it's almost entirely
manned by robots number 7
speaking of Japan in Japan 90% of mobile
phones are waterproof as many people
even use them in the shower
number 8 one of the first computer
science PhDs was earned by a nun who
helped develop basic programming
language as a grad student in 1965
number 9 Amazon was originally called
Cadabra short for abracadabra to express
how magical the experience of buying
books from them with me but because
people kept 'miss hearing the word
Cadabra as cadaver and since in 1995
yahoo listed web search results in
alphabetical order Amazon was born
number 10 the computer mouse was
invented at least three times in the
early 1950s Mouse like input devices
were developed at least
twice but both were military projects
that ended up classified later in 1968
Douglas Engelbart gave a revolutionary
demonstration of a computer with a
graphical user interface and it included
a mouse which he had developed number 11
Nintendo was founded in 1889 very early
in Japan's modernization and for 67
years it had one product playing cards
number twelve bulletproof vests fire
escapes windshield wipers and laser
printers were all invented by women
number thirteen Facebook has a blue
color scheme because Mark Zuckerberg
can't see the colors red and green bonus
fact if you find the security bug in
Facebook's code they are willing to pay
five hundred dollars for you to tell
them about it
number 14 in 1956 IBM launched a first
computer with something like a hard
drive that we use today the whole
cabinet weighed over a thousand
kilograms and the five megabytes data
was spread over 50 huge aluminum disks
the machines were leased for $3,000 per
month back in the day number 15
