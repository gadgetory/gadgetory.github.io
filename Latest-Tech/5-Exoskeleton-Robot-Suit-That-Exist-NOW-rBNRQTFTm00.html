I'm soapy Morgan and ambassador for Rex
bionics I'm going to be explaining as
well as demonstrating the many functions
that Rex is capable of as well as
showing how easy it is to transport
having been using Rex for over a month
or so I'm very confident transferring
myself in and out unaided I'm a level t4
complete following a car accident ten
years ago but it's possible to use Rex
with the levels up to c4 to transfer I
simply open Rex's legs I can position my
chair next to Rex and transfer myself
into the exoskeleton once I'm in and
seated as far back as possible
I then fasten the straps around my shins
and thighs until they're secure but not
too tight to avoid too much pressure
also the pads are soft and flexible and
can be detached and washed I transfer
using this method but everybody is
different it is possible to use a hoist
or assistance to transfer once I'm ready
to go I just turn the joystick and
select the stand function by simply
moving the joystick upwards
Rex then stands up it's important to
lean forward as you stand in the same
way that an able-bodied person does when
standing up there are a number of
different functions that Rex can carry
out let's start with the walking by
simply selecting walk from the list of
programmed actions I can begin to move
forwards or backwards with a walking
pace reduced to a third of a typical
walking speed the stability is increased
and I feel more secure and safe we have
found and I agree that most people
certainly don't want to go any faster
than this walking backwards is important
as well because it allows me to stretch
my hip flexors which get tight over time
from sitting in a wheelchair Rex is the
only exoskeleton that is capable of this
function Rex is also able to turn left
and right this can be done when
stationary or on the move this is useful
for navigating smaller spaces that one
might find in everyday
such as in the office or at home I can
also raise the armrest which leave my
hands completely free for more important
things whilst being stable and balanced
it's also possible to shuffle from left
to right this is particularly useful for
negotiating smaller spaces and helping
stretch my hips whilst I benefit from
dynamic weight-bearing activities there
are other functions that Rex can carry
out and one of those is climbing stairs
by using a handrail I can climb up and
down stairs standing at the bottom of a
flight of stairs for the first time in
over a decade
and knowing I can climb them is the most
empowering feeling I can imagine each
Rex comes with two batteries that can
last for two hours of continuous walking
and use no charge while stationary the
batteries are very easy to change it
only takes a few seconds it can be fully
recharged in one to two hours so you
should never be without power for Rex
Rex is also very portable it is easily
placed in a vehicle either lying down
flat on the back or with the knees bent
and in the back seat once purchased a
consultation is given as well as three
to five days of training to really get
the most out of Rex

what you're looking at could be the
soldiers uniform of the future the
not-too-distant future this is the
exoskeleton now being developed by
Raytheon company's newest research lab
in Utah the XO is a robotic suit that
gives its wearer greater strength
endurance and agility
just like the superheroes depicted in
comic books and Hollywood movies think
of the exoskeleton as an amplifier
Raytheon engineer Rex Jamison says it's
easy to use oh it's very natural you can
get it today
walk around no problem I like the the
quick movement like the speed bag and
playing soccer with it and and some of
the power stuff it can carry 150 pound
payload you walk up ramps and walk up
stairs which you know I couldn't do
myself raytheon-sarcos a leader in
advanced robotics is developing the
exoskeleton for the US Army the suit is
a combination of sensors actuators and
controllers all packaged in this
futuristic design dr. Stephen Jacobson
heads raytheon-sarcos and this project
he believes invention is a combination
of art science engineering and design
people call it different things
sometimes they call it inventing
sometimes they call it engineering
sometimes they call it being a mad
scientist whatever but it's it's to us
it's the process of getting together
understanding of problems goals and then
designing something to satisfy the need
with the exoskeleton Raytheon is not
only satisfying a need the company is
pushing the boundaries of technology to
where science fiction will one day meet
reality
