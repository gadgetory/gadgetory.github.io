hi I'm Jason creator of the go hammock
that was recently funded on Kickstarter
all rewards have been filled and we've
been getting lots of positive feedback
it's great to see how much our backers
are enjoying their hammocks many of you
have requested us to design a hammock
camping tarp we listened and here's what
we came up with it's called the apex
camping shelter the apex is a versatile
high quality weather shelter that will
protect you and your gear from rain wind
Sun and even snow I designed this tarp
especially for the go hammock but it can
be used with virtually any camping
hammock on the market it also makes a
great all-purpose camping tarp or shade
canopy even when you're not using a
hammock setup is simple with the
included guy ropes and stakes the apex
can be pitched in countless
configurations to adjust the changing
weather conditions here are just a few
of the many setup modes that can be used
with the apex captain shelter
with 20 tile oops the only limitation of
configurations is your imagination the
apex is made from high-strength 70d
polyester fabric with a durable
polyurethane coating we'll need your
help to bring the apex camping shelter
into production if we can mass-produce
it will be able to pass the savings on
to you and offer it at an amazing price
the prototype shown here were made it
the same factory that made to go hammock
everything's in place for us to begin
production and we should have all
rewards shipped before spring so start
planning your adventures over 650
million people lack access to clean
water we've partnered with a non-profit
charity so each apex old will help
provide clean water for one person for
an entire year so please check out the
rewards and details below and help us
make this project a reality once you try
hammock camping you may never sleep on
