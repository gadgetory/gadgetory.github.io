when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so we're sometimes
even considered wacky we needed to
design a device that was not only an
incredible phone but also an amazing
wearable I used to repair a lot of
phones I had cracked screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brands
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and vetting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
and before you knew it the portal was
born
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and where we needed to
build a team of incredible people with
the wide range of skill sets who are all
unified to pursue our mission and break
the mold of the mobile market the
problem with the mobile market right now
is that the phones are all the same and
what little differentiation they have is
that some are less user-friendly and
some are less durable things like this
still happen so we're here to change
that with the vibrant palates clean
typography and easy to understand icon
set the portal UI is experience it
cannot be missed why be stuck with the
same old design when you've got a new
refreshing interface to play with an
interface that hurts you interact that
knows what you want and works with you
in the way that you want it to work the
portal not only has all the features you
would expect such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC but also has a waterproof Kevlar
infused polyurethane body a six inch
flexible display wireless charging an
unlock network and so much more
some of the biggest challenges are
starting a smart phone company are all
the licensing and government
certifications involved which you can
probably imagine is enormously expensive
all of us here at a rubix truly believe
that we can change the world with our
innovation even if you can't help back
us please help spread the word so we can
revolutionize the mobile industry rapid
advances in technology are shaping the
world when it comes to security touch is
quickly becoming the industry standard
your finger acting is the key we have
chicken lab decided it was about time to
create a POW log for the modern age we
believe a log should always be
functional and provides you as a quick
easy access whenever you need it we are
proud to introduce tap lock and tab lock
lights the world's smartest at logs tap
lock and tap lock light need no key no
combination code and no phone to access
them instead using a cutting-edge
encrypted fingerprint sensor it grants
access with just a tap in point eight
seconds there's nothing to remember and
nothing you can lose it uses the one
thing you always have with you your
unique fingerprint tap lock can also
double as a phone charger so you'll
never be stranded without power but what
about the times when you need to share
access don't worry we have you covered
with the top lock app compatible with
iOS windows and Android using only our
smartphone you can grant anyone access
to your law from anywhere in the world
up to 100 fingerprints can be stored the
time location and duration of access can
even be customized when you want to
revoke access do it with just a tap with
tap lock and tap lock life you're always
in control top lock is designed to keep
unwanted guests out it has a built-in
alarm that will activate if the lock is
cut or if someone without authorization
tries to open it so wherever you decide
the user tap lock or tap lock light you
can feel confident that your valuables
are secure and that accessing them will
be quick and easy tap lock has a
lithium-ion battery that can last up to
three years on one charge and it gives
you the option of accessing your locks
through your phone using Bluetooth 4.1
top lock light was designed with
travellers in mind so we made it small
lightweight and secure it's equipped
with a replaceable battery that can last
up to six months it's also
water-resistant so you don't need to
worry about it being damaged by rain or
snow we have spent colors our screen tap
lock and tableau flight and now ready
bring them to you we take great pride in
modernizing invaluable items through the
power of touch how bus brings her blog
to market by purchasing up
early adopters will be among the first
to experience ultimate in convenience
and security from tab lock and tap lock
light the world's smartest how long hi
I'm Sean and I'm Frank and this is echo
echo is a revolutionary new audio device
that enables your existing headphones or
speakers to receive wireless hi-fi audio
from any source each user simply takes a
battery-powered sound pop from the base
station and plugs in any pair of
headphones the result instant hifi
quality wireless audio for the whole
family most wireless headphone systems
are bulky and expensive and often
designed for only one user we designed
echo because we believe everyone should
be able to use their headphones or
speakers to enjoy a phenomenal wireless
listening experience echo is
specifically designed to accommodate
multiple users up to four or more can
listen together at the same time its
built-in Wi-Fi technology delivers
high-quality ultra-low latency sound for
a real time listening experience it's
perfect for movies music gaming and more
echo delivers a highly customized
listening experience that's designed to
fit each user's preference each sound
puck has individual volume controls
while the smart mobile app controls
equalizer settings streaming settings
and more it even has parental controls
like volume limiting to help ensure safe
listening for kids
we designed echo because we wanted to
create a high quality social wireless
listening experience that our expensive
wireless headphones simply couldn't
provide we wanted something powerful
enough to create an audiophile grade
listening experience it's simple enough
for the whole family to enjoy something
that untethered you that allows you more
freedom and better range in Bluetooth or
RF
and when we couldn't find it we decided
to build it over the past year our
in-house team is prototype to working
proof of concept created an elegant
beautiful industrial design and laid out
a development roadmap for finishing the
consumer ready device we've teamed up
with world-class designers and engineers
and lined up suppliers and manufacturing
partners capable of producing echo to
our high standards we designed echo to
complement your existing entertainment
accessories echo offers each user
individual control of their own
listening experience it was thoughtfully
designed to look great in any setting
now we're turning to kick-start to make
echo a reality for everyone by joining
us and backing this project you'll be
the first in the world to enjoy echo we
thank you for your support then we're
excited to bring you an amazing product

hi Rufus
we've all been there working 40 50 even
70 hours a week while our dogs are bored
and only at home and when we get back
exercising our dogs can be a challenge
because we're tired it's too dark out or
the weather is bad I was looking for
something to help my dog Rufus get the
activity he was lacking during the day
and I had a revelation so I quit my job
and decided to put my engineering degree
to use for a good cause my name is
Santiago Gutierrez and I created the
world's first smartphone the go bone is
the first entertainment device made for
you and your dog it keeps your dog
active while you're at work and it gives
you new ways to play when you're
together it's something that not only I
can use in the evening when I just want
to hang out with my dog and play but
it's also something that can be at home
with him when I can't be using the go
bone is easy just put food or treats
inside tap it and it automatically plays
with your pub for up to 8 hours keeping
them happy and entertained and giving
you a renewed peace of mind the gullible
one is also very smart it actually
personalizes its experience to your dog
based on your breed weight age and other
members when you're ready to get in on
the action you can instantly take
control the go bone through the mobile
app interactive games like go bold fetch
and go bone hide-and-seek turn the go
bone into an interactive gaming device
for you and your pup even capture video
and share it while you play
the go bones exterior can be changed
when it wears out or when it's time for
a new look you don't need to buy a new
gobo and if it gets chewed up our
mechanical engineer has years of
experience designing rugged products for
the military so rest assured the go
bones electronics are safely enclosed
the go bone has been in the works for
more than two years with over a thousand
hours of testing behind it over a
hundred dogs have already had the chance
to play with the go bone many of them
living in animal shelters and that's
where the go bones other function comes
into play we believe the go bone is not
only a great companion for your dog it
could be a life-saving device for dogs
and shelters hoping to be adopted I
think that it is mental stimulation for
animals shelters a lot of times you'll
see that animals are recluse or deemed
in adoptable because they lack
interaction and this is a way to
actually show their personality to bring
out who they are and make them more
adoptable we're also making the go bone
to help shelter dogs have a chance at
getting their own forever homes in fact
one of our rewards lets you get a go
phone for yourself and donate one to the
shelter of your choice
we believe all dogs should be happy
healthy and active no matter where
they're human is or what they're doing
please support our Kickstarter tell
everyone you know so we could get the go
bone into production</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
