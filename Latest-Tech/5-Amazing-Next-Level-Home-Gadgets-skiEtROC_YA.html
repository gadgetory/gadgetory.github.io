level home gadgets high off latest tech
here bringing you you guessed it the
latest tech out there one the hammerhead
rechargeable screwdriver taking all the
functionality of a power drill but
keeping the convenience of a handheld
tool screwing and unscrewing with just
the twist of the activation ring not
content with just being convenient the
hammer head screwdriver has decided to
also steal a few other tools jobs it has
a built-in LED flashlights circuit
sensor to detect live wires and outlets
adjust a press of a button and a wire
stripping and bending slot to help you
with any electrical projects you're
working on it's basically the Swiss Army
knife of screwdrivers I'm sold it also
has got a few extras like a 50-piece
screw driving bit set and even a flip
out model to get to those hard-to-reach
areas around the house you know and you
can't quite move that couch out of the
way to get to those screws I jumped on
Amazon and I found this beauty for about
forty five US dollars with a ninety four
dollar deal on the screwdriver the fifty
piece and the flip out model all in one
I think this is just a straight-up
useful upgrade for every do-it-yourself
kind of person
to rigid power spin plus drain cleaner
this tool can help power through clogged
drain lines mostly found in tubs sinks
and showers but not recommended for
toilets unfortunately it features 25
feet of usable kink resistant max core
cable and a light weight polyethylene
drum that is dent and rust resistant and
it even auto feeds so no pushing the
cable down yourself is necessary if you
thought the power drill is done by just
taking the screwdrivers job think again
this time the power drill has teamed up
with the power spin and now you don't
even have to crank the drum yourself
just remove the crank handle and plug a
power drill in and voila a power drill
powered power spin plus drain cleaner
this tool will chew through most grease
lint and hair clogs with just a few
trigger pulls and a bitter wriggling
this will most likely save you the
hassle and expense of simple plumber
jobs leaving you only calling them for
the major stuff the rigid power spin
will cost you around 44 US dollars last
time I checked on tool barn comm and a
bit more than that on Amazon and around
$60 all in all paying 40 bucks 260 bucks
on a single purchase to save me a lot of
money and a lot of time scheduling
plumbing visits sounds - worth it - you
know pass up 3 rimmer bro wheel step
this steel tile wheel step can fit
snugly on most trucks back or front
wheels giving you a more secure step up
to your truck than what a wobbly
stepladder could do it's even foldable
and lightweight easily fitting in the
back of every truck simply unfold the
wheel step tighten the four nuts and
bolts on the joints place snugly on a
4x4 or a trucks front or back wheel and
enjoy the step up it gives you to work
with relative ease and safety I jumped
on their website rimmer bros comm and
found it for about 43 US dollars or the
equivalent and a bunch of other
currencies which is cool don't have a
big enough car to consider this for
myself but it could be a cool
gift for any truck enthusiasts friends
out there and anyone who packs a lot of
stuff on the roof of their trucks for
Wagner
flexo 3000 it can be used in both indoor
and outdoor paintings or finishings it
has nine settings for various coatings
and precise control with I spray nozzle
or walls siding and a detailed finished
nozzle for small projects and a smooth
finish it has an inbuilt canister that
has a capacity for one and a half
quarter cup or 375 milliliters of paint
that can cover most of a 10 by 12 foot
wall or a three by three and a half
meter wall with an easy five-minute
cleanup time the Wagner flexo 3000 will
set you back around one $59.99 on their
website Wagner spray techcom and around
the same on amazon.com a serious tool
for those committed to painting their
own projects and a nice piece of
hardware for those making their living
off of painting houses and such five
extend climb this ladder took one look
at a telescope folding and unfolding on
itself and said I can do that and did
the extend climb ladder uses the
telescoping technology to extend see
where the name came from retract and
lock to achieve the required height you
need being made of strong aluminum makes
it very lightweight at around 36 pounds
verse 16 kilos with solid rubber grips
on the feet to the ladder maximum height
options ranging from 8.5 feet to 15.5
feet or 2.5 meters to a bit over 4.5
meters if you want to go metric you can
even buy a rubber climb protector to fit
on the top rung of these ladders it
sounds cool to me but not sure if I
would haul heavy stuff up and down it
anytime soon but I can see it's a more
practical ladder than the heavy-duty
stuff I break my back every time I haul
it from storage so I'm considering it so
we have a Swiss Army knife of a
screwdriver a power drill powered drain
cleaner a metal wheel step 4 trucks a
high-quality paint sprayer and a
telescope ladder
is this a textual video or a handyman's
shopping list both I guess
don't forget to subscribe and ring that
notification pal and comment to us here
at latest deck so we can know all about
y'all's opinions about these new gadgets
