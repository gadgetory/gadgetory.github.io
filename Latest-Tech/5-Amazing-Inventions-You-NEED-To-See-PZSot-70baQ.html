beach with my family
we can all relate having to carry a
mountain of items across the sand that
was one of the situations that got me
thinking of a multi-purpose carrier to
help make our lives a little bit easier
that is why I invented the ear over the
ear over is a lightweight transformable
adaptable carrier designed to replace
all those job-specific carriers that
have saturated the market today
I designed the ear over to consolidate
all your carriers into one package with
just a few simple and intuitive
adjustments the ear over simply and
quickly transforms from one form into
another and another
and another
with a sophisticated design to fit your
lifestyle and thoughtful engineering
that provides strength and durability
the e Rover is built to look good be
versatile and work hard stand it up in
any closet or slide it underneath your
bed light enough to pick up and pack in
the trunk of your car
I created the earth Rover so it can
assist you and I in everyday life
adventure
now you can load your cooler tackle box
and fishing rods all in the ear over
making the walk to the pier easier and
stress-free so you can focus on the
things that really matter
for the weekend warriors you'll likely
find yourselves buying supplies and
materials for your home projects getting
those bulky items from your truck into
your house condo or apartment is always
a burden at least it used to be
and since our family enjoys having
picnics and bike rides
now we can load and go with the ear over
so no time is wasted we make less trips
and have more fun we have been working
for more than two years developing ear
over and getting it ready for production
our engineers have worked tirelessly to
bring this unique and functional product
to life help us take it over to the next
level by contributing to our campaign
and we will do our part in making sure
you have an ear over of your own thank

the product firmly tamped say goodbye to
the days of dirty lighters in fact the
omni hv has a lighter slot to carry a
standard mini lighter which can be used
from the exterior of the device the omni
hv has more tricks up its sleeve it
opens to reveal a state-of-the-art
grinder meticulously designed to produce
the perfect rhyme every time it can be
packed to the rim and with little effort
will create that perfect grind thanks to
the Omni HP's lever action inside you'll

and hemp wicks pool hemp quick is used

taste we don't just talk quality we
build it the omni hv is sculpted from
high quality aluminum and is anodized to
increase durability and aesthetic appeal
and the tools are machined from
stainless steel in 2014
we debuted our introductory product the
Omni H speed to an overwhelming response
everyone that got their hands in the
product was stoked to have it we were
able to raise enough funds to run a
small production batch that was
incredibly successful and now we're at
the point where we need to expand reduce
our cost and most importantly bring our
newest version of the product to you
welcome to the Omni 2.0 a sleeker and
more effective version of
original product we are always working
to find ways to improve our products on
the omni 2.0 we've carved an access
point into the school chamber and neural
this pools exterior this allows you to
retract your wick into the device
without having to open it on the side of
the device The Dispensing feature has
been improved for easy retrieval and
rewind the omni 2.0 will also include a
stowaway chamber the grinder easily
turns to deposit your ground product
thanks to its unique design underneath
the screen holder and spool are combined
as one and the screen holder now fits
most screen sizes comfortably both
chambers are carefully designed to allow
upcoming accessories that will release

experience it provides the omni 2.0 will

everyone loves traveling we all love to
explore the amazing place around the
world and most importantly shopping we
all want to pack every silver in the air
wear anything we've bought into the
luggage but we all face the same problem
when we pass no matter how you organize
the size of there will still be too much
in the end we cannot put everything the
luggage but make ourself tired oh and
the dirty clothes that's sticking up
during the trip we don't even want to
mix it with new clothes or maybe there
is no space for it already
hello IndieGoGo I'm Jennifer as a
traveler we are thinking about how to
make more space in the luggage and after
all research we found out clothes bags
and other sort of things occupy more
than 50% of the luggage for a five-day
trip so that's what creates vago a
miracle solution of making more space in
a very short time
now we only need to do is to put our
clothes in Tobago bath think about it
put on bago plug in power and push the
bottoms
Vega will automatically anchor clothes
you can enjoy your time in the hotel or
any other place while Vega is doing its
job don't worry this intelligent vega
will automatically stop when the process
is finished the only thing you need to
do is putting their shrunk vacuum bag
into your luggage we can also use
printable battery to recharge bago we
believe this convenient designed to make
chocoholic to buy more remember those 30
clothes may go vacuum bag to prevent
smelly smell and urine so you can keep
the luggage clean and use more space
efficiently in the same time to make
your overall trip even more convenient
so we use the general micro USB cable
for the recharge design create extra
space for your luggage to lake every
space count currently Vega will have
more color and will have more color
collection in the near future
each bego will come with vacuum bag for
clothes and soft stuffs now vago is in
the modeling design process and we have
a really great thing to make it even
better we will appreciate if you can
support and plus this product and we are
sure bago can make your trip more
relaxed more convenient and later bring
more souvenir and memory home thank you
