microphone personal TV for the amazing
robotic after a whole year of planning
and research with countless trials and
errors we finally finished our prototype
the ganker which is a next-generation
fighting robot with our application do
we control the anchor at high speeds
you can fight with your friends by a
fair and sensitive sports
you can even customize your robot
cashless weapons and armors the
customizable gay curtain is a robot on
your mold design bringing your games to
life
you can play Gator with your family at
home at parties with your friends and
even in our robot toilets around the
world with the Gator he prints you a
brand new entertainment tools we need
your support and we hope you enjoy game
you
everyone loves outdoor activities but
with all that fun comes all that cleanup
that's why I created the rinse kit it's
like having a hose to go my name is
Chris Crawford and after countless hours
of developing I've created something
that is truly revolutionary rinse kid is
super easy to use to fill it simply
attach the Quick Connect adapter to any
sink or hose bib turn on the water it
will fill in 30 seconds attach the
nozzle and it's ready to go there's no
pumping or batteries required it uses no
moving parts and it will hold the water
pressure for months okay so right now
you're probably asking yourself how in
the heck does this thing work inside the
rinse kit there's a sealed chamber when
you connect it to a hose bib the water
pressure from your home simply
compresses the air in the chamber the
best part about this design is that it
essentially uses the air as a spring
there's nothing to wear out we
specifically designed the rinse kit to
be easy to carry and travel with it
holds two gallons of water which will
spray for over five minutes on the
center setting and for over 30 minutes
on the mist setting the lid detaches so
you can clean up and change on it you
can also use it as a cutting board or to
sit on as you rinse off your feet rinse
kit is bpa-free so it's safe to drink
out of and it's extremely durable you
really can't hurt this thing
throughout the years mankind has pursued
their outdoor passions and has suffered
unnecessarily we've always felt that the
rinse kit could be the ultimate portable
shower if it could make its own hot
water but our early attempts to heat the
water and the rinse kit were a little
impractical finally we figured it out we
developed a heating probe that drops
into the tank and runs off a
rechargeable battery it quickly heats
the water in the tank to a nice
comfortable shower temperature I even
included a smart USB port for charging
your devices we've had some help from
friends and family but we're essentially
still a startup company we need your
support to help develop the engineering
tooling and production on this
game-changing heater accessory
no more excuses it's time to get outside
and have some fun thanks so much for
hearing our story we hope that you'll
support us with one of the options below
and please make sure to share us with
your friends on social media

you
my name is John Paul I'm one of the
designers here at carbon six rings my
wife Claire and I have been married for
about five years over that time I've
gone through a lot of wedding rings some
of them have been uncomfortable are
damaged they would get lost I'd lose
them or they just didn't work with the
kind of work that I do and I and so I
started thinking about what I wanted in
a band and I decided that I one thing
that was meaningful and and would work
for my life and so I started looking at
the materials that that I used and I was
learning about and i found that carbon
fiber had properties that represented a
lot of things i believe were common in
my marriage in my life the strength of
it the idea of two things coming
together to make something that was
durable and strong stronger than the two
things could have been separately and I
looked into some of the current
resources being done in aerospace and
they're using a forging method that
allows for three-dimensional shapes to
be made out of the the carbon fibers in
the resin and we wanted to go ahead and
make the rings out of the forged carbon
process it hasn't been easy it's a
proprietary process that they don't tell
you how it's done so we've had to do a
lot of research and we've made hundreds
of prototypes to get the right pattern
and strength that we feel is strong
unique and meaningful and I feel like
we've done that we're carbon 6 and we
hope these rings will be as meaningful
to you as they are to us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
