access situation using a swale access
electronic stabilizer is the most
effective solution at present currently
on the market illness where access
smartphone stabilizers are following
same traditional structure which is what
regularly used for action camera compact
smartphone has better size and weight
it's not easy to achieve the best
stabilization performance tradition of

balance between the cousin instability
from the bottom of last year we spend a
lot of time developing a brand new

gee every year over 300,000 bicycles are
stolen in the UK from train stations to
universities even in person as a cyclist
your options for bicycle security are
limited to locks but if broken sit
quietly and watches a thief rides away
with your bicycle and all on lookers
assume nothing wrong we wanted to design
a device that would add an extra layer
of security but also be easy to maintain
so we combined a bicycle light with a
motion based alarm system to functions
packaged into one easy to use and
maintain device we give you stingray the
powerful 300 lumen LED headlamp and oval
bean shape are perfect for urban cycling
combined with several operating modes
and olivium battery give stingray
running times of up to 10 hours
to mount stingray simply press the quick
release button and mount to your
handlebar when parking lock your bicycle
as you normally would as you walk away
click the arm button on the custom-made
form and know that your bicycle is being
protected this arms the nine axis motion
sensor and an internal lock that ensure
only you can remove stingray from your
bicycle we package stingray into a tough
donut shaped plastic molded case but is
designed to prevent hammer blows or
whatever else are desperate thief might
try smart software and electronics allow
stingray to know the difference between
a bump and a theft so you don't need to
worry about false triggers if someone
dare break through your locks be assured
they won't get far the powerful 140
decibels siren is housed less than a
meter from their face after being
triggered stingray will go into a fine
to be state an emitter warning every 15
seconds
I think the Stingray is a great new
product and it gives me peace of mind
that know if I'm riding my bike or if
it's locked up out on my building or
something like that that this simple
piece of equipment will just give that
little bit extra to help keep my bike
safe at all times but sting ray doesn't
stop there the fob has a panic button
that can be pushed in an emergency this
will cause the sorry to sound
continuously and help draw attention to
you and your bike and because stingrays
are actually your bicycle no matter
where it goes the siren welcome the
moral of the story don't steal a bike
guarded by stingray we all love to
travel whether it's discovering new
places are going back home to visit
family and friends however a long
journey can really do a number on your
body even a few days after you get to
your destination you still seem to be
recovering typically if you're traveling
on a long journey and want to get some
rest you can either use a neck pillow or
a mashed up sweatshirt or jacket we knew
there had to be something better than
this and after doing our research and
creating multiple prototypes we're
excited to introduce the nod travel
pillow
the not travel pillow is the ultimate
sleep travel solution it keeps your neck
and head at a 90 degree angle which is
the exact same position in which you
sleep in a bed the over-the-top design
keeps your head from falling forward or
leaning left or right that way you won't
wake up with a kink in your neck or a
bit of awkwardness from sleeping on the
person seated next to you the nod travel
pillow is simple to use and works on all
types of seats from plane seats car
seats train seats and even desk chairs
plus the memory foam pillow is super
soft and the exterior is a breathable
and water repellent PU fabrics you can
be asleep for hours comfortably we
promise you this is the best sleep you
will ever get while traveling in order
to produce the nod travel pillow at an
affordable price with a quality
manufacturer we need to meet a minimum
order quantity that's where you come in
with your support on kickstarter we can
make the ultimate sleep travel solution
a reality thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
