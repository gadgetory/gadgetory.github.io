when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so where sometimes
even considered wacky we needed to
design a device that was not only an
incredible phone but also an amazing
wearable I used to repair a lot of
phones I had cracked screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brand's
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and vetting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
and before you knew it before that was
born
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and wearable we needed to
build a team of incredible people with
the wide range of skill sets who are all
unified to pursue our mission and break
the mold in the mobile market the
problem with the mobile market right now
is that the phones are all the same and
what little differentiation they have is
that some are less user-friendly and
some are less durable things like this
still happen so we're here to change
that with the vibrant pallets clean
typography and easy to understand icon
set the portal UI is experience it
cannot be missed why be stuck with the
same old design when you've got a new
refreshing interface to play with an
interface that hurts you interact that
knows what you want and works with you
in the way that you want it to work the
portal not only has all the features you
would expect such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC but also has a waterproof Kevlar
infuse polyurethane body a six inch
flexible display wireless charging an
unlock network and so much more
hello my name is Alejandro Santa Cruz
and I am the CEO of circular devices the
Finnish company behind the puzzle for me
the puzzle phone and it's friendly
modularity it's easy to upgrade and is
designed to last up to 10 years by
supporting our campaign you will help us
to change the industry
we are bringing an alternative to all of
you we know that you want more
sustainable long-lasting devices and
that's what partial phone stands for
this is puzzle fun puzzle phone is a
modular mobile phone it's made up of
three parts the Berean has all of the
functionality the spine has the display
and the heart has the antenna and the
battery we believe this makes sense from
a point of view of functionality but
also from the user upgrading and
allowing flexibility for second use and
also potentially to allow open source
designers to develop their own modules
at the moment we are working with the
whole old hueco system to enable the
puzzle Forge creation with modular
product design we need to focus on the
quality and reliability of the modules
we are strongly focusing our efforts to
make sure that the product fulfills the
end-user expectations of modularity and
upgradability
as engineers we are always looking for
challenges like the puzzle part we
already have a working demonstrator and
a model of the final design we know what
needs to be done to make this prototype
into this complete product your support
now is crucial to get these pieces of
the puzzle together
by supporting us you will be triggering
the paradigm shift from take make and
done to upgrade reuse and recycle
we are the androids you have been
waiting for
you
you
technology is growing every single day
every single R and every single minute
today to make it big in technology we
need to have great ideas we love
technology technology has brought a
little perspective in our lives but have
we ever wondered what's coming up next
and how would it change our lives
welcome to the next big thing in
technology lifestyle
