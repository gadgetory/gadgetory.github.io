I'd always suspected those around me had
seen my incessant pen clicking me
shaking and desk tapping but I had no
idea how bad they got
I just figured it all the time with
anything I could get my hands on didn't
matter what a bubble wrap a bubble wrap
the way pop-pop-pop
he just couldn't get enough that was
probably wrong on
thankfully my Kickstarter community told
me
from the people that brought you to ad
comes over the counter fidget cube
fidget cube is a final desk toy designed
to satisfy any urges to click roll spin
and other common fidgety impulses
without driving your colleagues and
loved ones away
the GQ is a cube that you fit with
studies have suggested that fidgeting
increases focus and improves
productivity side effects may include a
sudden ability to cope with boring
meetings pay attention in class power
through Netflix marathons which a cube
is designed to allow discrete digital in
any setting do not news widget cube if
you have an aversion to rectangular
prisms digicube let's B satisfy my
fidgeting without endlessly annoying
those around me I thought I could stop
at any time and now I realize I don't
want to fidget cube can help take the
first step to fidget in freedom today
okay so in all seriousness we make joke
about fidgeting we give our friends and
coworkers a hard time for the pen
clicking and the nail biting but what if
there aren't something what opinion is a
coping mechanism a way for us to stay
focused and more present in the moment
sometimes is smarter than us believe
that we have this thing called floating
attention which makes it hard for us to
focus in certain circumstances okay hey
Mark yeah yeah and actually fidgety has
been shown to be able to help keep that
floating attention occupied which helps
you better focus on the task at hand
which maybe even a little crazier is
that some recent studies have suggested
that students who use fidgeting as a
mechanism during testing tend to perform
better on those tests than when they're
arts itself
fidget cube has been a project we've
dreamt about for almost four years now
and we're excited to finally be bringing
it to you it's been a long road with a
lot of prototypes but we think we're
gonna love it when designing fidgets
cube we wanted to ensure two things
first the functionality needed to truly
satisfy the fidgeting needs it needed to
be an entire toolbox of fidgety options
while staying small and compact which
leads us to our second and equally
important priority we wanted phidget
cube to be a premium desk toy that could
be discreetly used in any situation from
a classroom to a boardroom the fidget
cube of course has six sides
we really think vegek youth has so many
different applications and we're so
important to you trying out life
personal thank you so much for your
support
yeah
you
you
hello we are suggesting we have a
single-minded to for us to deliver
amazing
after 300 days of research we finally
finished our first generation of our
products is nice King
you
we try to make a rather impact all other
robbers a Gundams pretty roses and
better crops Thank You Becky consume
increases more rapidly for entertainment
it has many interesting brain waves such
as robot fighting breathing and
avoidance players can view up and decide
their open curve and joining the robot
competition more importantly they can
share the happiness with their family
friends or even stranger we hold the
robot human tissue become the water well
game with relief tankers can bring you a
new experience we need your support and
we hope you like it
you
you
pelvis ticks always have potential to be
a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six or even ten feet high on but also
take anywhere you want to go the v4 is
the portable trampoline we'd always
dreamed of with the v4 you have the
ability to add a remove air and
completely change the stiffness of the
bounce someone who weighs 300 pounds can
jump on the same exact v4 as someone who
only weighs 80 pounds all you need to do
is change the air pressure in less than
a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family of fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the v4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
down stairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again obstacles and
features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards are perfect for the v4 so
those of you looking for a fun way to
stay in shape the v4 will work most of
the muscle groups in your body and get
your heart pounding immediately it's a
killer cardio workout and the best part
is that while you're having fun bouncing
around you won't even realize how
quickly you build a sweat in order to
achieve superior build quality and
maintain the high tolerances necessary
for the v4 to work we manufacture and
assemble it right here in our Southern
California shop we work closely with our
suppliers to become a part of the build
process and as each component is made or
right there to test them
this streamlines are manufacturing and
ensures that every before we make is up
to our standards if you're looking for
the portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it join us and help change the
way pogo sticks are seen forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
