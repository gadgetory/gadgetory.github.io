Lubitz magnetic lacing solution makes
your own shoes incredibly easy to put on
and take off since our first campaign
tens of thousands of people have loved
their Zubaz because they no longer have
to fuss with tying laces squeezing into
shoes double knots ugly floppy bows or
laces coming undone with xue bits your
shoe is wide open
so you can easily slip in without
squeezing as if you had no laces at all
then just pull the magnets together and
that's it now go for a run or play
sports
Zoop it's magnets are incredibly strong
we've taken the strongest neodymium
magnets and made them even stronger with
our patent-pending magnetic array
technology
to prove how strong they are we gave
some Zubat s-- to our parkour friends at
bay area movement and they really put
them to the test in two days of running
and jumping off buildings trees and
playgrounds the magnets only separated
once so yuzu bits on your daily run
triathlons dance class your gym class
you triple unders at CrossFit go
mountain biking quickly put on golf
shoes play basketball your hiking shoes
can double as slippers around the
campsite clean up casual shoes use the
magnetic force show off your Zubat hang
shoes on your locker or conveniently
organize the whole family's shoes
you
with zubats closures you can
magnetically pair up your shoes and
organize them in new places
this really encourages kids to put shoes
away and helps define them and zubats
are not just for athletic shoes but
perfect for casual shoes and they even
make boots a lot easier to put on
because you don't have to reverse the
laces to squeeze in so in winter time
you can even put boots on with mittens
there are other elastic shoelace
solutions but they stretch out in weeks
zoo bits can be used over and over again
on new pairs of shoes
with this 2.0 version we are offering
six new colors to match your shoes or
make them stand out or even mix two
pairs to support your favorite sports
team our new clips allow you to make
micro fit adjustments anytime and also
make installation much easier to install
zoo bits closures onto your own shoes
unlace the top three rows then relays
through the zoo bits next attach our
securing clips and lock your laces for a
secure hold then you can cut off the
excess lace because you don't need it
anymore and with su bits 2.0 if you ever
want to adjust the fit tighter or looser
just quickly slide the clip as needed
you can also wrap your lace around the
clip for the most secure hold
so get suppes closures for your shoes
and never tie laces again what if it was
simple to use a regular pen and paper
notebook while saving everything in the
cloud perfectly organized the way you

notes in the cloud and filled your paper
