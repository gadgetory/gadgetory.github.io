Oh
you
the ladle allowed us to carry over the
same organ Amma consideration found in
our flip spatula series the angular
break off its 45-degree handle is the
key to the ladles incredible performance
the goal holds three-quarters of a cup
of liquid and we've added large
measurement marks in metric and imperial
units the curved edge was designed to
provide something that we call the
perfect pour this might be the most
research and development we've ever done
on a single kitchen tool we took the
very best aspects of all the ladles we
could find and combined them into one
and then we had a few extras
our very favorite thing about this ladle
is the flexible front edge it can bend
into the corner of any bowl or container
allowing it to reach spots that no other
ladle could I think we can say it this
is the perfect ladle let's face it the
spoon yyl is pretty cool too we've taken
a fresh look at spoon EULA's to achieve
a simple and extremely versatile profile
it combines a spatula with the gentle
curveball of a spoon the spoon eula is
the most utilitarian of all our kitchen
tools it's often seen but never
perfected until now with the spoon eula
much like the ladle we took all the best
attributes of the competition and
combine them into one the edge is sharp
for scraping and precise scooping the
goal is extra deep and the blade has the
perfect amount of flexibility
what an easy ways to control temptation
the kitchen space is a comic container
that puts you in control let me show you
how it works first place an item in the
container next rotate the dial set the
timer and finally press the dial to
activate the alarm once the container is
locked cannot be opened until the timer
reaches zero
it's that easy I came up with the idea
of the kitchen staple completing my
graduate studies I was looking for
something fun and easy to use and help
me with my food cravings lose a little
weight and live a healthier lifestyle
although still being able to enjoy the
occasional snack to design a product
that lives up to the highest standards I
work with Ryan Fang an engineer and
classmate I met while studying at MIT
the kid is safe is a time lock container
that puts you in charge
you put an item in the container and set
the timer once the timer is set and the
button is pressed the container lost and
cannot be opened until the timer reaches
zero it is a simple concept that
produces powerful results the goal when
designing the kitchen safe is to create
a high quality product that works well
looks good and it's fun to use the
product has a large clear display a
smooth dial 30 locks and a clean look to
compare to the highest quality
containers available in stores the
design process took over a year we
investigated many options and with each
prototype we refined the design until we
ended with a great working product the
container base is made from four
millimeter thick acrylic for durability
and a clean look the LCD display was
custom developed to incorporate large
high contrast characters for easy
viewing the dial is specifically
selected for its smooth action time
could be set for short is one minute or
as long as 10 days the electronic
locking mechanism was designed to assure
a strong seal we love our fruits and
veggies and we love both hands equally
that's why we created a better way to
preserve the freshness and leftover
fruits and vegetables food huggers just
pop your leftover half into a hugger and
save it for later
some huggers come in four sizes so that
every half as a hugger that fit the Flex
in the silicone gives a tight seal and
hugs your food to help you save that
second half the food huggers make great
care Stoppers too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
