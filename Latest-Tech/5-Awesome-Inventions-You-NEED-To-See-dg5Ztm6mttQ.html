this is forum card handy pocket size
card meltable bioplastic that you use to
make fix and modify the world around you
you can mold it quickly and simply to
make little solutions to everyday
problems
when it's cool it's really strong like
nylon so you can make solid durable
solutions with it
and then you can reheat it again and
again to adapt some change
and reuse it
because it's handy card size you can
keep one in your pockets wallet kitchen
drawer or toolbox so that it's there
whenever and wherever it's needed and
because you know it melts in a cup of
hot water that might be in a cafe to fix
a broken umbrella all around a campfire
to fix broken temple it's strong enough
for quick solutions to emergency
situations like when you've forgotten a
tool for a job or handle grates on
something
plastic has got a bit of a bad name it's
associated with a cheap disposable world
in which things break easily and then
end up in the B form card is the
opposite of that world when it's very
hot it sticks to other plastics so you
can actually use it to instantly fix
things say a plastic shovel when you're
on holiday there are loads of amazing
applications and we'll be posting more
examples on lines of project develops
just take one out in your pocket
drop it into hot water and fix things
simple thanks for watching and please

today on pre OVR in-depth we're talking
about unlimited control pre OVR is a
full-body motion sensing suit for gaming
that allows unprecedented natural
feeling control typical game control
systems consist of either a mouse and
keyboard or handheld controller in
either case the set of controls is
limited and often unnatural the gameplay
and world interaction is completely
constrained by the controls that are
available and is therefore also limited
for games that require complex
interactions the control inputs must
either be context sensitive or often
used sequences of control and button
combinations these are often unnatural
can be difficult to learn and are
different for every game systems with
inertial sensors and optics have been
used in recent years as a way to move
towards more natural motion based gaming
but these have had limitations that
still resulted in constrained gameplay
prio VR solves this by allowing for
unlimited responsive and completely
natural sensing of the player's body
motion by combining full-body motion
sensing with hand controllers a fully
flexible game control experience emerges
with pre OVR every movement can be
translated one-to-one and it's a game
for example a traditional game control
experience often requires aiming using
an analog stick and controls with pre
OVR
aiming is done by moving your body and
arms just as you would in the real world
rather than pressing a button to crouch
or lie down or take cover with prio VR
you can actually Crouch you can actually
lie down and you can actually lean in
and out of coverage with prio VR the
possibilities are endless for examples
in the following sequence the player has
complete control over how he interacts
with the world around him you notice
that he naturally decides how best to
interact with the game world just as a
person in the real world would every
interaction can be unique different
creative unscripted and unlimited yet
still completely natural and by adopting
a hybrid control approach the player can
still navigate through large worlds
using the hand controllers still shoot
using an actual tactile trigger and
still access other options using the
hand controllers action buttons this
approach allows for a remarkably rich
experience that provides the player with
a
completely unlimited yet totally natural
gameplay experience watch the following
sequence where each and every
interaction is unique and unscripted the
player creatively decides what to do and
simply does it head fell bow head class
me everything is possible even switching
weapons can be achieved naturally with
motions and gestures watch as player
decides to use a bat for one kill then
seamlessly switches to a sidearm for the
next followed by a scoped rifle for the
net
ring is a wearable input device which
will allow you to control the most
anything you just need to wear the ring
and tap on the side to start your
gesture ring captures and analyzes your
gesture inside of it it sends the data
to your smart devices vibration and led
notifies you of status updates and
notifications each application has its
own unique gesture mark so when you want
to use it simply perform the designated
action gesture marks can also be edited
making customization simple and easy to
control home appliances simply sync ring
to them using your smart devices you can
connect directly or by using the hub
when designing read we had to start from
scratch we made numerous prototypes in
each time we got smaller while as
functionality improved capturing and
analyzing the fingers movement was also
a challenging task in 2013 for gesture
recognition technology was still in its
early stages however by 2014 and has
been nearly perfected and has even
precise enough to detect letters now you
can type text midair anywhere anytime we
also provide refund than making typing
quick and easy another unique feature of
ring.this is advanced payment solution
gateway when used with GPS or ibeacon
ring allows you to immediately make
payment transactions revolutionising the
way you shop we will also open API so
developers to make original applications
and publish in the ring store the ring
store allows you to search for and
install many applications we've already
tested and confirmed that ring works
with numerous hardware smart devices and
web services
this is curve Alex the smart nightstand
that makes your life easier you can play
