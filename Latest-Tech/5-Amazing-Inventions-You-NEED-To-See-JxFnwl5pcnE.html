that let's do it it's three sensors
attached to both your shoes and your hip
not your ear not just one foot but
everything that has to do with running
and nothing else step captures the
movement of your entire lower body as
you move it collects real-time data
about your form impact and fatigue using

and activate your agile an affordable
solution to run faster harder and
smarter
hi I'm Fisher where have been developing
this technology for the past five years
we ask people to come to our lab so we
can do research to understand how they
get injured and how to improve the
performance however for many years only
professional athletes can afford to do
that but now we have created these small
sensors when you wear it it can tell us
a lot of useful information about your
running and we can use such information
to help you to have a better
understanding about your running phone
and eventually it can help you to
prevent injury and improve your running
performance but in order to deliver that
to run us around the world we need your
help we have preliminary agreements with
manufacturers but we need capital to
place the order please share and love to
the runners community it's your help we
can really make a difference to your and
your runners friends lives temperature
it's the most widely measured variable
on a planet then why is it so hard to
find a great thermometer introducing
fireboard it's the world's first
cloud-connected smart thermometer
it connects over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth it
has six channels with multiple alerts
and it's a data logger so you can see
all your historical charts we've
engineered the fire board to be simple
affordable but most of all smart it's
the perfect device for around the
kitchen or for the barbecue set up as
many alerts as you need to make sure you
cook is on track it uses patent-pending
synchronization technology to stay
connected to the clock but we wanted to
do even more to be a truly smart
thermometer not only will it show a
graph of what you're cooking now but
everything you've cooked in the past is
saved conveniently in your account so
you can see how to improve and get the
perfect result
in addition to being a revolutionary
thermometer for cooking we've been
contacted by friends wanting to use it
for their wine cellar craft brewing at
home or even just to monitor their mini
fridge in the basement we spend a lot of
time in the lab making sure our
temperature probes are accurate and
reliable grills can get extremely hot so
we made wired probes I can stand up to
the heat they are simple in robust and
time tested for accuracy
the good news is that we've already
spent time designing engineering and
testing our solution
we made sure the fireboard performs
exactly the way it should and let me
tell you it's a fun device to use and we
believe it will make you a better cook
our design is ready to be produced with
our local contract manufacturer here in
Kansas City we just need your help it's
a move fireboard into mass production
thank you from the entire fire war team
imagine if you can eliminate those
awkward phone moments you know those
times when you want to look cool calm
and collected but your phone is ringing
and you can't find it and you miss an
important call or those awkward times
when you're not sure when you're
important call will come in it catches
you off guard and you end up in the
bushes
or how about the times when you receive
a call and your phone is out of reach
and you try to use your SmartWatch but
well that's usually awkward now you have
pin pin allows you to answer your phone
in style whether you are connecting to
an iPhone or Android device it is super
flexible clipping to your shirt or bag
it was tested on the run so you don't
have to worry about losing it go
anywhere and easily access your calls
and messages while on the go and pins
LED lets you see your texts so you won't
miss important messages when you want to
listen to some beats no worries with pin
you can still use your favorite
headphones I lose my phone a lot I want
to keep safely my phone in my pocket
what in my backpack that's why I credit
in the big idea was to create something
that instead of just pulling out your
phone you could actually just pick this
device and look down at it and interact
with it directly without having to even
think about your your phone Sean had a
vision for an integrated device of audio
and phone control and messaging that was
one of the fun challenges of working on
this project was staying true to the
vision and hiding the complexity from
the user so a lot of the engineering
challenges to make them happen we're
allowing as many user options into a
really small compact device that's also
entirely wireless in the main base
itself we have an oily to display we
have a speaker box with in there as well
to allow for conference calling we
created prototypes mock-ups and I
actually took them along with me to my
on my morning commutes I learned a lot
just from riding my bike trying to
access my phone while biking trying to
answer calls and text messages while on
the move I learned a lot how great of a
product this would be when
comedic we have designed in such a way
that when you remove the earpiece it's
very easy to slide it in and out that it
doesn't pull the device off your shirt
that when you remove it you can place it
in your ear and the audio is facing the
correct way so you can look down and
easily see the buttons all those things
were very important and now I can leave
my phone in my backpack all the time and
that's exactly everything I needed my
dream is to make pin available to
everyone though
video and photographic technology has
advanced incredibly in the past years
now just about every video taken is shot
using a smartphone or a GoPro but
something still seems to be missing
even after the challenge of setting up
your device you can still miss that
special moment
we'll just be out of the shop and now
with the move a new dimension is revered
any smartphone or GoPro simply clips on
and easily changes orientation what your
favorite shows with the freedom you have
never experienced before and take a
video call from family and friends with
the new meaning of hands-free
you can record your treasure grants and
be partly
you
with Bluetooth connection just tap the
tag to begin your recording countless
hours have gone into the design of the
move with many prototypes featuring
large rechargeable battery capacity for
many hours of use and robust design to
handle any device now let's test the
move for its strength and agility in the
toughest and fastest moving environment
with the freedom to move unchain new
ways of using your smartphone or GoPro
please support our Kickstarter campaign
and say hello to the move even if the
move isn't for you please help by
sharing with your friends on Facebook
now it's time to introduce devilís
organize your devices in an efficient
stylish and clean way
believe it or not we get the next
generation here Avalos so clean smooth
