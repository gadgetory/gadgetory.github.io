electric transportation Eon is the first
Bolton kit that can convert any
skateboard into an ultra light and
powerful electric vehicle it's simply a
matter of attaching our motor and power
pack to your skateboard and you're ready
to roll
Eon is a radical new transportation
solution it will transform the way you
move around the city
you'll zip through traffic and expand
your ability to use any mode of
transportation as a grad student at MIT
I commute on my longboard I began to
imagine what the future of
transportation could be like when I
moved to San Francisco and created my
first electric longboard I knew I was on
to something I then connected a group of
amazing designers and engineers take
this idea to the next level
forget about car payments gas and
parking with Eon you'll save money and
enjoy your commute in a completely
revolutionary way each motor can deliver
more than a thousand watts of raw power
and can push you to top speeds of over
35 kilometres per hour
by integrating with your wheels we've
reduced drag so you won't even feel it's
there when pushing our of√∂ see
technology makes the ride completely
smooth and silent so stealthy that it'll
be hard to even tell you're on an
electric board well besides the fact
that you'll be able to fly uphill our
kit is modular you can choose between
one or two motors and batteries to
optimize for range and terrain one pack
gives you up to 12 kilometers of range
which can be doubled with a second pack
installing Eon is a breeze just swap
your wheels for our motor and slide the
battery pack under your trucks if you
don't have a board we offer three types
to suit your riding style that will come
completely preassemble Eon is great when
you're learning how to ride you can bomb
down any Hill confidently with the
safety of regenerative braking that will
recharge your board while slowing you
down the Eon remote takes advantage of
the latest in advanced biomechanics
research to create the most comfortable
intuitive and ergonomic controller
available today
your Eon experiences can be controlled
by our mobile app fine-tune your board
review your stats and even connect with
other riders
we've designed Eon to be a platform for
all your urban transportation needs it's
modular design will allow you to swap
the power pack from your board to other
electric vehicles we are already
designing Eon for bikes electric
vehicles have the potential to
dramatically reduce global warming's and
toxic pollution generated from cars
across our mission is to create
transportation solutions for urban
commuters and accelerate our transition
the sustainable energy consumption
Kickstarter community more than a year
seven prototypes later we're on the
verge of manufacturing our first GN
batch we need your support to help us
move into production the funds we gather
will go towards custom tooling and the
first run of EMS your support will also
provide us the validation and feedback
we need to continue developing exciting
electric vehicle technology
this is the lightest electric skateboard
in the world
sorry you can use it as transportation
bring along onto subways buses or even
car trunks to a further distance you can
write it to get breakfast or grocery a
few blocks away never need to worry
about parking or locking when entering a
restaurant with your board in fact you
can print to anywhere I have an opera of
factories people they are heavy clumsy
almost losing the real home skip only
what we want is a revolution of electron
skateboards so we smashed two boxes
through batteries away who bails out
it's called old motors and redesign a
brand new ultra light electricity board
which is stirring
to achieve the same inning impossible
task we had to redesign the model to
hack it beside whales as well as putting
gearbox and a sensor inside we designed
many versions of remote-control running
for a better user experience instead of
the short-lived belt we use the
planetary gears to provide unbeliev
blaze drum power sorry hell perfect
power systems to support high speed up
to 20 miles hour and growing up here on
a 30-degree slope with a small remote in
hand anyone even with no experience can
easily control the board using our
braking and accelerating features Sterry
is safe and smooth to write for all
users from beginners to experts our
technical team has top talent in factory
mechanic and software engineering we
want to change the young people's way of
transportation and your support is
essential for thank you so marble is a
dedicated team of engineers and
designers who are really passionate
about the project and passionate about
the idea of short-range transportation
and sustainable transportation whether
it's community to work getting into the
subway or bus stop running errands or
try to just get across college campus
short trips and urban travel have always
been frustrated in a car we have to deal
with traffic parking and of course
rising fuel costs on a bicycle we work
up a sweat and then have to find a safe
place to lock it up we felt there had to
be a better way to handle these short
trips
our goal at Marvel was to create the
lightest electric vehicle in the world
but also with amazing user experience
we spent the last two years dedicated to
crafting and refining our marble
electric skateboard
the lightest electric skateboard in the
world with an amazing team to modern
technology and support from our
community we built the marble board to
be simple to use efficient and of course
exhilarating to ride the marble electric
skateboard is the lightest electric
skateboard in the world it weighs only
nine point nine pounds with one full
charge the board goes 10 miles
that's not ten testing in the lab miles
its real-world conditions most of our
test riders are actually getting over
ten miles per charge the question we get
most is how fast does it go well it is
one of the fastest electric skateboard
it has over 2,000 watts of power and
will hit speeds of up to 20 miles an
hour it can actually hit 20 miles an
hour even going uphill
we realize that 20 miles an hour is
pretty quick so we have designed the
board settings to be completely
customizable through a smartphone app
our app that we call the dashboard lets
you set exactly what you want your top
speed to be and determine the level of
acceleration the best suits your riding
side this allows you to perfectly tune
the board to your needs if you want you
can even directly control the throttle
of the board from our dashboard app
which will allow you to leave the
wireless handheld controller at home we
were able to achieve all of this by
using state-of-the-art carbon fiber and
Kevlar composites to create the deck
design that completely encases and
protects every bit of the electronics as
well as the battery cells on top of that
we're using incredibly efficient
three-phase DC motor
battery technology very similar to what
you would find in Tesla Model S our
custom electronics are being
manufactured for us right here in the
United States and finally everything is
assembled tested fully controlled and
shipped from our facility here in Tampa
Florida
leaf board is the most convenient and
affordable electric skateboard available
today it performs as good as it looks

traffic leaf board is 25 inch long and
9.5 inch wide and is super lightweight
at only nine point seven pounds it's the
world's lightest electric skateboard we
achieved this by cleverly placing a
powerful battery inside the deck and
using high-tech lightweight components

we insisted on a unique natural
appearance and environmentally friendly
materials the board uses glass fiber and
maple for the deck surface and is
available with five different backside
veneers for a distinctive look that
complements your personal style
we also customized a cool bag for it
the heart of leaf board is the powerful
rechargeable 5000 mah battery that
delivers a range of 18 kilometers and
speeds up to 30 km/h it's powerful
internal motor is strong enough to take
on hills of up to 28 degrees and it
features a state-of-the-art regenerative
braking function leaf board also accepts
quick charge it can be fully charged by
70 men's leaf board utilizes heavy-duty
integrated plate bearings and high
rebound 72 millimeter polyurethane
wheels for durability and a super smooth
ride without any joy loss of common
skateboards leaf board is easy to
operate and can switch modes via an
intelligent
LED remote control using bluetooth 4.0

at least what invites you guys to join
them they guarantee that if you buy this
board you'll have some fun and
definitely
leaf board is the best choice for a
lightweight fast and easy to ride
electric skateboard it's a blast to ride
and a great way to get around town get a
leaf board and you will never find
yourself without a cool ride in nineteen
sixty something a couple of surface from
California had a smart idea they stacked
some wheels under a wooden board so they
could surf on asphalt when there were no
waves fifty years later there is
johannes one since he was a kid he's
been riding every board he came across
always looking for the endless ride for
him
skateboarding is a good way to ride all
year round and yes it's a good ride but
it could be better so he had a pretty
smart idea to it's called mellow
the capital months down the line on surf
trip tomorrow he met Killian when he
tells Killian about meadow he needed
Lisa so they decide of time to bring the
asphalt serve to the next step
meadow is the first and only
state-of-the-art compact electric drive
system that can fit under any skateboard
within minutes it can transform any
normal staple into an electric
skateboard tomato is just the small two
point five kilo component but it has the
capacity to upgrade your favorite board
into the most dynamic and high-quality
electric skateboard on the market all
you have to do is unscrew the rear track
of your board replace it with a melon
Drive and you're ready to go now that
Killian tell you all about the nerdy
details
hi the heart of mellow is the motor and
we're really proud to say that it's been
developed tested and produced in Germany
before we founded Melo I was an electric
car engineer at BMW this definitely
opened some doors when we started
looking for the best partners in supply
they immediately shared our vision of a
compact yet potent inwe'll motor for
direct transmission and thus maximum
riding pleasure even if you are an
absolute skateboard rookie the handling
of Melo is really simple with the
intuitive hand control all functions are
just under your thumb
finding the right battery for Melo was a
challenge on the one hand he wants to an
endless ride on the other hand we wanted
as little weight as possible the
solution is a custom-made swappable
battery pack so in case you really want
to go for an endless ride you can easily
exchange it on the go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
