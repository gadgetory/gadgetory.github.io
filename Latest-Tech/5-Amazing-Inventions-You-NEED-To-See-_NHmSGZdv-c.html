hi I'm Mike Ratan Vaughn founder of
current drives an adventure of the
electric man three years ago I started
developing an electric motor drive
system for small personal watercraft I
ended up with an electric jet powered
kayak we saw an incredible response from
the short YouTube video we posted of
this first design surfers kayakers and
stand-up paddleboarders were contacting
us and we knew that there is a demand
for an affordable and fun electric
conversion kit for personal watercrafts
you can choose between the stand-up
paddleboard and longboard electrician
that attaches to your board's existing
fin box or the kayak Electra fin the
Electra fin R which attaches to the
rudder for a hands-free ride there are
no tools required the Electra fin has a
six plus hour runtime silent motor
intelligent wireless remote and a fast
one hour recharge time using any
standard power outlet the mechanical and
electronic design is complete and we're
ready to go into production but we need
your support make a pledge and share the
Electra fin with your friends thanks
IndieGoGo we'll see out of the water
we've entered the age of personal
manufacturing but when it comes to
making durable things in your own shop
there's still no easy way to cut hard
materials as makers and engineers we
need to work with all materials so we've
built a machine that could the first
desktop waterjet laser works by
combining abrasive particles with a
high-pressure water stream the mixture
exits the nozzle and cuts through the
workpiece it's great for any workshop it
cuts every material it's compact and
contains and it's digital so you can
make precise cuts that are impossible to
make any other way as an industrial
designer I've used a variety of desktop
fabrication tools but they tend to be
very limited by the durability of the
materials you can use on those machines
but it desktop water jet we can go from
design to component to fitting that
component and testing within a couple of
hours that's an incredibly powerful tool
as a jeweler and an artist with the work
I make I spend a lot of time hand
cutting so right now I'm selling pieces
sort of as almost limited edition
because I can't physically output them
not because I want to be making and
in addition Weiser would allow me to not
only make a lot more but also to lower
the price point so they'd be available
to a broader audience I think you know
people tend to have their ideas
constrained by their tools and the
things they're capable of working with
and having a water jet cutter which has
the ability to cut a broader range
materials hard materials like steel and
glass will be enabling and make them
think in different ways and have them
build different things they couldn't
build before the future of manufacturing
is in custom local fabrication people
will be able to make things in our own
workshop that they can use every single
day and will last a lifetime as
mechanical electrical and manufacturing
engineers we design products
manufactured components and set up
assembly lines in the past now we're
preparing for production but we need
enough orders to produce the machines
cost-effectively we've created a unique
desktop tool and we're really looking
forward to all the amazing things that
people create with it
