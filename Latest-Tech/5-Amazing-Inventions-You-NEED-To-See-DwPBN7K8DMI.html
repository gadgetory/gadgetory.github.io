my philosophy of life is if I do
something I want to do it our percent
I always try to be a step ahead of the
others in terms of nutrition in terms of
training every second counts
equipment is is closure today also the
sunglasses
in 1996 the air force approached us we
were three professors I can't State
University's liquor Crystal Institute
and they asked us to see if we can
create a technology that will allow a
pilot or a soldier going into a building
to adapt to the different environmental
conditions as fast as they can that
means that in the dark state it needs to
be like sunglass and in the clear state
as clear as possible it took us about 17
years to create it and we've enlisted
close to 40 million dollars to create
this technology it will allow a person
to be able to control the amount of
light that hits them and when to it I'm
convinced that control we revolutionized
I words had them on automatic mode and I
said it's not gonna work but I went to a
darker place where I was about to grab
my glass and take them down instant at
clear lenses if you go for an easier
right it's nice to play a little bit
right here in a race it's not safe to
take your hand off the bar I would have
it on automatic mode as soon as I leave
the bus if extraordinary that this piece
of equipment designed for the US Special
Forces is available for any demanding
consumer for any athlete for anybody who
wants to enhance performance the product
can be customized in different ways for
optimal fit you can bend the sides and
the nose bed second of all you can also
choose the color of the frame and the
color of the lens
you can take 200 cyclists and let them
try this and they say this is
fantastic
smartphones tablets mp3s GPS computers
are the everyday fundamental devices for
all of us but every day we could see
people wearing headphones and earbuds
that plug one or both of their ears
while they are driving cycling or
walking we thought that they are often a
danger for themselves and others and
technology offers little to really help
just this made us think to come up with
the device so that I can listen and talk
through my smart phone or my tablet
without earphones without wires and with
my hands totally free that's why we
designed and carried on our special
sunglasses project they are able to
listen without earphones
thanks to their boo hell vibe bone
conduction speakers to talk without wind
disruption thanks to their powerful
built-in microphone to be active without
wires
thanks to their 4.0 Bluetooth
we called them sound glasses because
they change your way to listen and stay
connected with your help and support
we can make our dream a reality and you
will be the first to enjoy this amazing
pair of sunglasses Thank You backers
sound glasses give you innovation
freedom safety and easier life
cos it's really one of those innovations
which comes along once in a while and
that has applications in so many
different fields and so many different
sports we've had really fantastic
feedback from a lot of different sports
a lot of different communities tried to
see was that today I absolutely loved
the idea one of the main problems we do
have interest on is trying to coordinate
that getting the helmet on and the
sunglasses at the same time I just had
my son is on because he's in the pool
and I just was going to go underwater so
I decided to just hold him against my
head and as I went under I noticed that
I could see underwater I just have I
guess I created mind and and I just
prototype my own little parts in my
garage at home and and so these are what
sprung out of my garage you place the
sunglasses on your head and you wear
them in this loose position like so and
by pressing the buttons on the side you
activate the mechanism which tightens
them around your head and it's even a
watertight seal if you want to use them
underwater
hello I'm the founder of the startup
