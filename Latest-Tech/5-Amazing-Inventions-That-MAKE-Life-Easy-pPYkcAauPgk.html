through coal hickeys a new lacing system
a new idea fasten ones never tie again
make all your shoes look better and feel
better the core heat is for everyone
they work on any shoe one week's hick is
so special once installed I can sleep on
another shoes you will never have those
places again the adductor muscles
movement making sneakers incompetent
they are easy to use and you can adjust
the tightness no messy walls mega shoes
look fit and perform better
hi my name is Michael youngistan and we
are the founders of hickeys hickeys
lacing system our evolution of shoe
laces what started like a cool accessory
to sleep on and off your shoes has
evolved into hickeys 2.0 a smart adapted
lace internal tip that makes her shoes
fit like a glove so here today
introduced he is 2.0 so our beloved
external will accompany with you I want
to give you the opportunity to be the
first one spouse this is hickeys 2.0
same idea but now more durable more
comfortable a more streamlined design
more secure and we offer two different
models adults and kids
hickies 2.0 allows your shoes small to
every carbon are we wanted everyone to
fill their feet muscles moving in
synchronicity with their shoes how does
it work the fact that he is 2.0 connects
only to idaite at a time makes it
possible to deliver a targeted to
customize hit the key is to thread
hickeys using our different lacing
techniques if you have a high arch you
can loosen your key keys or tighten the
map if your feet are too narrow or flat
this is the only lacing systems smart
enough to be truly elaborative
Hey simulating the levels of tension
that if you put a different is your shoe
you actually give your muscles a lot
more freedom we distracted the way that
you lace up your shoes completely we
don't just turn on your shoes sleep on
we give you the perfect fit always
you may remember our area model of
hickeys that was funded by over 3,000
backers right here on Kickstarter in
2012 since then more than 2 million
people have turned their kicks into
ribbons with Kiki's as you can see 5
years went by and we are still with our
tickets family you have any coke coming
along as well we want to grow our
Kickstarter family too and inspire more
people to live a life without laces with
your help we can change the footwear
industry and make all sneakers look fit
and perform better we can wait for you
to try to get suit poncho so pre-order
now and get them in time for the holiday
season
love your case thank you
this is lock farm in 2014 1800
Kickstarter's help bring his product to
life today he's back to introduce not
one but two macro products the mission
stays the same transforming this to this
crafting solutions to keep your cables
neatly organized and tangle free first
up Marco 2.0 magnetic cable organizer
that keeps your cables neatly bundled
it's easy to use insert the cable
through the slits so that Marco stays
safely attached and secured next roll up
your cable and snap the magnetic ends of
the Marco together and there you have it
the maca does so much more than organize
your cords with the use of magnets you
can also secure your earbud cable on
your shirt it ensures cords will stay
out of the way while you're in the
creative zone going for a morning run or
enjoying a coffee use the magnetic
points to dock Marco to any ferrous
metal surfaces you can dock your
belongings to the fridge so that it's
always in reach and ready to go when you
are for the new maca 2.0 we've made
several improvements it's more
streamlined as the magnets are now
enclosed inside the elastomer rubber
body the new material is both dust
resistant and water repellent
compared to the original macro the macro
2.0 is longer and it's filled with
stronger magnets making it simpler to
use in addition to macro 2.0 we're also
excited to introduce the Big Mac Oh
suitable for larger cords Big Mac Oh is
available in two types of materials the
durable elastomer rubber and the
two-tone premium leather the stay on
cable feature of Big Mac Oh differs from
the Michael the loop design allows the
big Marco to accommodate four cables
with a variety of thicknesses and all
kinds of connectors rest assured big
Marco still shares all the same features
as the Mac of 2.0 there are endless
applications for Big Mac Oh
for instance organize your guitar chords
for easy carrying a quick release it's a
handy travel buddy keep your luggage in
order and your electronic devices tidy
lastly for non-ferrous metal surfaces a
custom design platform can be used to
dock your cables platform incorporates a
removal and reusable micro suction tape
to allow for convenient relocation it is
taken two years to refine the designs or
sketches 3d modeling prototypes and
testing
the design is ready for production your
support will help fund the tooling your
minimum order quantities required for
manufacturing we look forward to having
you join us on this next adventure thank
you from the team at Marco it was really
sad
parking my job cable locks to a railing
by a bunch of the bikes and I came back
to find just the cable hanging there in
the bike was gone
lock my bike to a tree with a normal
cable lock and just got cut when I came
down the next morning I just saw my
cable lock around
I regret we used steal a lot of mics
mostly really easy they really block no
or they use a cable lock promise your
cable logic is not a lot if it requires
any time or effort to cut the lock or or
has a reputation for tough I do not it
wasn't worth the risk of being caught
there so they easy targets out there it
doesn't seem like it's gonna be strong
enough how strong what's it made up
so definitely not breaking doesn't look
like it's even scratch them at all a lot
lighter than my clocks that I have on my
bike right now I like that it's really
flexible I would love to be able to use
something that's this life it seems
great it's really light
I obviously couldn't cut it so oh yeah
that's great
most cyclists understand that locks are
deterrent it's about having enough
durability to slow a thief down for a
racer like me
the huge considerations are weight sizer
bulkiness and ease of use we all know
how stressful it is we have our
expensive bike sitting in public but no
one I know is going to carry a chain or
you lock when training it's just not
going to happen so the challenge was to
create a security solution that's light
enough for training easy to stow away on
your bike or your pocket and still
strong enough to prevent that and that
is when I started working with Auto
design works this has been no small
design challenge locks generally fail
the weight and security trade-off most
are clunky weak or both we figured out
how to keep the way to lock under 115
grams while holding up to the most
rigorous theft attempts it is able to
coil up into this compact portable
package we achieve this with a
patent-pending product design which uses
multiple reinforced bands high tempered
steel this alhazen strap to remain
flexible without sacrificing cut
resistance the result is a secure
compact and lightweight lock with broad
application for the outdoor enthusiast
it's brilliant everyone I ride with his
seen my auto lock has been bugging me to
get one we're pretty lucky to have a
world-class pro racer like Jacob
collaborating with us the auto lock
concept was born from the needs of
cyclists first but it didn't take our
team long to realize there were many
more uses it's not even out there yet
and the people with our beta prototypes
are already raving it's showing us many
other uses both on and off the bike
it's just so simple and we're excited
about our new cinch luck changes things
and that's where Kickstarter comes in we
know we've got something special on our
hands and this campaign is going to fund
our first series production room
auto-lock is almost there the design is
done the manufacturing process and plan
is done the testing is done and frankly
it's just plain cool we're asking for
your support to get it out there now so
check out our rewards make a pledge and
make sure you get yours first
think about all the gadgets you need to
remember to recharge and bring with you
every day it's tedious annoying and
frustrating when you forget the reasons
simple
we need our devices charging with us at
all times and there hasn't been a
solution that actually simplifies their
life until now meets smart Bob the
world's first customizable power bank
with intelligent wireless charging you
don't ever have to remember to recharge
or bring with you again smart Club is
much more than just a battery about we
built-in bluetooth key tracking and act
with intelligent notifications a
removable cable and the ability to
easily add features through its modular
design so if I want to watch my favorite
movies or need more space for photos or
videos on my phone it can also be my
external flash drive or from hanging out
with friends it can be my Bluetooth
speaker and if I want a new module I'll
be able to get it through the smart Bob
marketplace or if the module I want
doesn't exist yet I'll even be able to
build it myself but what really makes
this product magical is that I never
have to think about charging it ever
again
since your keys typically stay in one
spot when you get home we knew this was
the perfect place to recharge them we
created a beautiful charging surface
using state-of-the-art resins wireless
charging technology so you can drop your
keys onto it in either orientation and
without any fuss and your smart bulb
will always be charged and ready for you
to use when you leave your house you can
also plug your phone and a module into
smart phone and place them on the
charging surface for all them to charge
and we built in a male USB adapter so
you can charge your smart BOTS any USB
port for those times when you're not at
home but I know what you're thinking I
always lose my keys or don't always put
them in the same place well we've
thought of that too and have created a
smartphone app which will recognize when
you get home and that you're smart Bob
isn't charging and send you a
notification to put it where it belongs
and if you can't find your keys it'll
even help you locate them using our key
tracking features built right into our
app with our breakthrough intelligent
notifications smart app can connect to
your calendar and suggest modules to
bring with you based on your schedule
like if you're traveling the next day or
have a heavy day of meetings it can
suggest you bring extra battery modules
with you with our app you can check
smart phones battery percentage and
charging status and access your files on
the go but it's not just the hardware
wirelessly charging and it's not just
the software reminding us if we forget
it's the magic that's created when all
these things come together the magic of
a never ending charge our existing
lineup of modules are just the beginning
the possibilities are limitless we've
begun to make strategic partnerships
with hardware manufacturers to bring new
modules to smartphone and we're counting
on you our community to tell us what you
want to see most you've learned so much
since delivering our first Kickstarter
and join district 3 incubator at
Concordia University over two years ago
we've put together an incredibly
talented team mentors coaches and
as partners to ensure an amazing product
gets delivered to you our backers our
supply chain is in place and the
prototypes in this video have been
manufactured by our suppliers who will
be using for mass production and now we
just need your support to make molds
meet minimums and change the way we
charge technology forever
hey guys it's Mike from outdoor element
and we love some carabiners they come in
a variety of shapes and sizes that third
hand that you can rely on and they've
been around for a while they've evolved
over the years and as the adventure type
we wanted to develop an everyday beater
that can help you out when things get
crazy all murmur slowly introducing the
fire beaner understanding that fire
creation is crucial in times of
emergency we've introduced our ever
spark technology to the bener sometimes
all you need is a spark to totally
change the situation designed to be
titanium coated stainless steel and at
one ounce this should be part of
everyone's everyday carry
we integrated a blade for those ad hoc
moments paracord fishing line
perhaps a seat belt and of course a
bottle opener for those moments of
celebration
we've partnered up with SolidWorks with
their entrepreneurial program to develop
the fire beaner for an ergonomic design
for stress analysis and for overall
manufacturability so go on slap under
the keychain or put on your pack and
always be prepared we have our
manufacturer set up and our first set of
prototypes have been approved and now
we're asking for your help to help
launch our first production run to bring
the fire beaner into your hands and to
your adventure and all the features of
the fire beater come in handy day in and
day out
so get those grills and stoves lit clean
up those loose ends and get the backyard
ready
so please back this project you'll thank
yourself later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
