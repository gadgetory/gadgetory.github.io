who wakes up early dive straight into a
morning meditation is super productive
at work drinks those eight glasses of
water and always hits the gym but let's
be real living that life means building
better habits and our brains want to
follow the ones we already have not the
new ones we're trying to cram in but
sometimes all you need is the right
nudge hi I'm Kayla and meet moti a smart
companion for building better habits we
created moti with a distinct purpose to
empower people to take those small steps
that over time result in big impacts in
our health and happiness these more than
just a cute face Modi is designed in the
latest insights from both behavioral
science and social robotics when you
place Modi in your home or office every
time you walk by he becomes an instant
reminder to keep committed each time you
do your habit Modi is there to help you
track and celebrate your small wins
giving you that immediate gratification
the better you get the more excited for
these guys but slack off and Modi might
get angry for SAP or stay purely
encouraging Modi knows what works best
for you because he's connected to the
web he's constantly analyzing and
evolving so he knows how you're
progressing if you're at risk of falling
off and when to send the right types of
nudges specifically for you compare all
this to the same daily push notification
you keep ignoring still how can
something so simple actually change your
behavior to tell you about how we form
good habits let's start with something
that we're all familiar with forming a
bad habit ooh cookie
fundamentally your brain needs three
things to form a habit a trigger a
routine and a reward when I saw that
plate of cookies I didn't even think
about grabbing one my brain immediately
triggered me and I knew that eating that
cookie would reward me with its sweet
doughy deliciousness your brain forms
good habits in just the same way by
completing this loop over and over again
moti works by seamlessly integrating
these three elements into your busy
lifestyle moti himself is a trigger more
specifically what's known as an
environmental cue and by using Modi your
habit is already set up to be small
distinct and actionable finally movie
celebrations provide an immediate reward
he makes sure that you feel satisfied
and accomplished each and every time and
perhaps a bit guilty if you're not
moenay's the outcome of over a year of
human centered design and engineering
rigor we discovered that triggers and
rewards driven by emotion are far more
potent than numbers lists or alarms now
we're finally ready to release movies
straight to you the only question is
what habit will be formed
when we can't help you magically climb
Mount Everest or run a marathon
overnight he's there to help you do
something more essential become a better
you one habit at a time
show me all the places I've never known
raise all
trees
here at bloody technological innovations
we are currently developing a wearable
smartphone in the form of a glove our
main aim is to push the boundaries of
wearable telecommunications and move
into a new area of a fully wearable
world people who are into sports or any
other physical activities often struggle
to carry and use their smartphone in its
fullest usable capacity glove these
aimed at people who engage in sports and
other demanding activities whatever the
situation glove D is right for you both
founders are sparring athletes and faced
a major problem while exercising the
difficulty to use and carry their
smartphones smartwatches and fitness
trackers did not work efficiently for
them
the reason these devices is prepared
with an existing smartphone while
operating them multiple issues can arise
no feasible way to initiate a call or
send a text message take videos or
photos or even be able to use popular
applications on a small SmartWatch
display and that's how glove D was born
a wearable smartphone in the form of a
glove can do so much more than just a
regular one we strongly believe that
glove D will exponentially increase the
quality of our lives not only in sports
but also in other activities of our
daily routine glove Z is not just a
product it's a platform aiming to close
the gap in emerging technologies in
Internet of Things
if you want your children to be
intelligent read them fairy tales if you
want them to be more intelligent read
them more fairy tales Albert Einstein
said this and it is deeply impacted the
way I parent it has also inspired me to
nurture the imagination of my own child
through reading that's me Natalie
founder of moonlight and mom - a fun
sweet imaginative little four-year-old
girl Chloe my inspiration behind
moonlight as you can see bedtime stories
have become a lot more exciting in our
house something we both really look
forward to because of moonlight a
children's projection story reader that
easily attaches to your mobile phone and
instantly adds magic to storytime
stories have always been a staple in our
bedtime routine as I'm sure they are for
many of you they give us a chance to
bond unwind and snuggle with our kids
after a long day
it was sometimes difficult to keep Chloe
engaged in reading books so one night I
decided to shake things up a bit and use
the flashlight from my phone to create
our own story out of shadow puppets
Chloe loved this she was so engaged and
I loved seeing her use her imagination
to create stories with me eventually she
started to prefer the shadow puppets
over her actual books and that's when it
dawned on me what if I could turn her
bedtime stories into images that could
be projected onto the ceiling just like
the shadow puppets and that's when
moonlight was born it uses the flash
from your mobile phone to project images
from a small reel onto your ceiling or
wall all of the words of the story
appear on your phone screen making it
easy to read while projecting the images
I also added in some neat sound effects
to make it a full audio-visual
experience
and the coolest thing is that I was able
to incorporate page detection software
so as you turn the real the story turns
the page on the screen for a completely
seamless reading experience moonlight
has made our bedtime routine simply
magical it has revived the love and
excitement of reading and most
importantly has helped nurture and fuel
Chloe's imagination while creating an
incredible bonding experience that we
both look forward to every single night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
