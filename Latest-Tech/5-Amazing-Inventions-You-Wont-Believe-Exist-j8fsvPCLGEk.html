possessions many companies have tried to
solve the issue but implementing
applications that help them track their
lost possessions but what if you don't
lose your possessions to begin with that
is exactly what slide Tech's Mint has to
offer anti loss the mint is a pretty
incredible product that has a lot to
offer to its users it's size allows for
amazing mobility while keeping track of
your belongings you can attach it to
your keys your wallet your backpack and
anything else you can think of using the
mitten it's also pretty simple you
download the app from your Play Store or
your App Store and you turn on your
Bluetooth afterwards you connect your
phone to your mid and then you're ready
to go some additional features that the
mint has to offer is music shuffling by
double clicking the center button on the
mints you can play music from your phone
remotely
the myth can also help you find your
phone if you've misplaced it nearby by
holding the center button your phone
will give off on an alarm until you stop
it by either pressing the button on your
mitt again or by turning it off from
your phone unfortunately I have a PC
laptop so PCs users such as myself are
unable to utilize the PowerPoint slide
changer function of the mint
since mint was created as an anti lost
product I decided to see how well it
actually works I left my keys with my
admit attached to it on a bench and I
proceeded to walk away as if I had
forgotten it after walking a certain
distance away my phone alerted me to let
me know that I had forgotten my keys
behind and when I tapped on the keys on
my app it showed me the exact location
of where I had left it behind at another
cool function about the mint is that you
can use it as a remote control button
for your camera the only real issue I
see with the mint is that if your phone
somehow drops Bluetooth connection with
the mint your mint will start to alert
you as if you have left your phone
behind besides that the mint is a very
solid product that has a lot of
potential to grow and give back to its
users with such a wide array of
functions the mid has the potential to
be the next big thing
we believe technology should make our
lives better and nowhere is that more
important than when it comes to our
health just imagine what we could do if
we knew where illness was spreading in
our local community before it affected
our friends offend individuals can take
action to avoid getting ill parents
would know at their child's first sign
or symptom how to respond physicians
would better care for patients and
society would finally have the tool that
needs to track and stop the spread of
illness at kinsa were applying design
and technology to give you that
information
I started kinsa after five years running
part of the Clinton Foundation's
international health program I will
always be proud of the work there but I
was struck by how little we knew about
where and when disease was spreading as
a parent of young children I know that
the most important thing to me is their
health unfortunately they do get sick a
lot usually from something they pick up
in a neighborhood or at school and as
technologists I find it remarkable that
there's almost no information available
to me as to what is going around
together we assembled a dream team and
thought carefully about how to gather
this information because fever is often
the first sign of an illness it allows
us to know right when someone is first
feeling sick before they've even visited
the doctor the solution will sound
simple and it is
we think it's the basis of a revolution
in health it starts with a device that's
probably already in your home we've just
made it simpler and smarter by
connecting it to your phone this is the
world's smartest thermometer it tells
you how to avoid getting ill or get
better faster if you are we've designed
the kinsa smart thermometer to be faster
and more accurate my five-year-old
Nathan isn't feeling well so I'm going
to take his temperature by using the
power of your smart phone we've
minimized the electronics inside there
are no batteries processor or LCD this
allows it to be thin flexible and
comfortable to use especially for
children reading complete Nathan's
temperatures okay but he's been
complaining of a sore throat with a few
simple taps I can track his symptoms
over time and share them with our
pediatrician and since he probably got
sick from one of his friends I'm
checking the health of his school to see
what he might have here I can see the
private group that I joined with other
parents from Nathan's class five out of
twenty four kids are sick and strep
throat is going around so he doesn't
have a fever I'm a bit nervous so I look
for the nearest urgent care facility
with an opening to make sure that you
have everything you need to keep your
family healthy we're adding features
like OneTouch call nurse and an illness
forecast so you know when you're
contagious and when you're likely to get
better even if you haven't joined the
private group you can still check your
local health situation here it is on a
Mac we combine our data with data from
others to give you what we like to call
the health weather you can see the
contagiousness level and what illnesses
or symptoms are circulating in real-time
we built the software and if working
prototypes of the thermometer and now we
need your help the funds you provide
will be used to manufacture the product
and scale up production making it even
more affordable but Ken says about more
than just a thermometer it's about an
idea an idea that our health is linked
directly to the health of those around
us your support will start a movement to
share the information we need to keep
our families and our neighborhoods
healthy you will send a signal to the
world that you want to be part of that
movement join us and together let's
revolutionize health hi I'm Niki and I'd
like to introduce you to hideaway the
bottle you'll always reach for because
it's always within reach
experts suggest that for optimum health
the average active person drink over 10
glasses of water every day but for those
of us who are always on the go it's
nearly impossible to stay hydrated
without reaching for disposable bottles
of water or sugary sports drinks bottled
water may be convenient but it's not
cheap it costs more than two thousand
times more than tap water even though
it's less regulated for health and
quality then there's the bottle every
minute US consumers throw out ninety
thousand plastic bottles and less than a
quarter are actually recycled the rest
end up in our landfills and in our
streets parks and beaches we need a
convenient solution to disposable
plastic bottles that fits our active
lifestyle
so as a freelance product designer I'm
traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I can solve myself you know once
I had a solution for business travel I
realized this had great application my
personal life especially in the outdoors
going backpacking or just on hikes I
could bring water with me and when the
bottle was empty it it collapses and
goes away and takes no extra space in my
back no one loves buying disposable
water bottles it's it's merely out of
convenience and the Hideaway makes a
reusable bottle more convenient in fact
in some places disposable water bottles
are being banned so we're all gonna move
towards the reusable water bottle model
and that's why I feel like this is kind
of the next generation and hydration
this gives you an option to have a water
bottle all the time without having to
throw anything away
I'm really excited to share the Hideaway
bottle with with the world and
Kickstarter is an amazing opportunity to
do that to be able to show you the
backers what this is all about so please
check out the rewards we need to raise a
significant amount of money to get this
into production to get it on the shelves
this year and just as important please
share it with everyone you know tell
them about this great water bottle The
Hideaway
we live on a planet that's 71% water yet
we've only explored 10% of it we're
about to change that the fathom one is
an easy-to-use underwater drone that you
control with your smartphone or tablet
we designed it to be the most affordable
most versatile underwater drone ever
made and after two full years of
prototyping and development were finally
ready to bring underwater exploration
and education to the masses
I'm John I'm Matt and I'm Danny we're a
team of outdoor enthusiasts scuba divers
engineers and travelers they had an idea
for an underwater drone that we could
take anywhere and use in any environment
I grew up spending summers on Lake
Louise in northern Michigan where a lot
of large logging operations took place
in the 1800's jump forward two hundred
years and now every cottage has
artifacts and pieces of history on their
walls that washed up on the beach but
there are still legends of horse-drawn
sleds that fell through the ice and got
stuck at the bottom just waiting to be
explored I thought if I could control an
aerial drone from a mobile app to
explore from above why couldn't I do the
same thing from underwater
that's when Patton was born
underwater remotely operated vehicles or
ROV s have been around for a while but
they're mainly large expensive
industrial devices tethered to big ships
and early consumer RVs inspired by their
Big Brother's cost well over a thousand
dollars with no mobile app for piloting
and you need to be a pretty good hacker
to put them together we knew we wanted
an underwater drone that anyone could
drop into any body of water and pilot
easily using an app on their smart
device and it had to be small and light
enough to carry around meaning a
completely new compact design it had to
come fully assembled out of the box
including an onboard 1080p HD camera and
built in high intensity LED headlights
for clear viewing and it had to be as
affordable as lower costs flying drones
with comparable equipment so that every
modern day Explorer could have one we
built the fathom one with all of those
features and thanks to custom components
in a streamlined design now you can have
it for under six hundred dollars that's
less than half the price of the closest
competition
above all we made the fathom one super
easy to use but that doesn't mean it's
limited this thing is fully modular our
patent-pending thruster attachment
system allows you to easily remove all
three thrusters for packing but it also
enables customization and upgrades to
specialized thrusters such as these ones
with larger fins for stabilization and
we're hoping our backer community will
create and share their own ideas for
customization fathom 1 also features an
integrated rail system that makes adding
accessories like action cameras and
additional lights or other sensors a
breeze just slide it on click it in and
you're ready to go we put everything
that we have into making underwater
exploration and education more
accessible to the masses we've built the
prototypes validated at our designs and
now ready to go on a full-scale
manufacturing all that's left is for you
the Kickstarter community to show us
that you want an underwater drone that's
affordable portable modular and
completely easy to use right out of the
box fathom is your chance to go deep and
see the world in an entirely new way the
possibilities are truly endless
what can you fathom
