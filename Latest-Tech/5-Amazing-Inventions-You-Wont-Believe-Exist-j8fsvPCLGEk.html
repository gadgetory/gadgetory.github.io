possessions many companies have tried to
solve the issue but implementing
applications that help them track their
loss positions but what if you don't
lose your possessions to begin with that
is exactly what slide TechSmith has to
offer anti loss the mint is a pretty
incredible product that has a lot to
offer to its users its size allows for
amazing mobility while keeping track of
your belongings you can attach it to
your keys your wallet your backpack and
anything else you can think of using the
mitten it's also pretty simple you
download the app from your Play Store or
your App Store and you turn on your
Bluetooth afterwards you connect your
phone to your mid and then you're ready
to go some additional features that the
mint has to offer is music shuffling by
double-clicking the center button on the
mint you can play music from your phone
remotely please
the mint can also help you find your
phone if you've misplaced it nearby by
holding the center button your phone
will give off on an alarm until you stop
it by either pressing the button on your
mitt again or by turning it off from
your phone unfortunately i have a pc
laptops or pcs users such as myself are
unable to utilize the power point slide
changer function of the mint since mint
was created as an anti loss product I
decided to see how well it actually
works I left my keys with my admit
attached to it on a bench and I
proceeded to walk away as if I had
forgotten it after walking a certain
distance away my phone alerted me to let
me know that I had forgotten my keys
behind and when I tapped on the keys on
my app it showed me the exact location
of where I had left it behind at another
cool function about the mint is that you
can use it as a remote control button
for your camera the only real issue I
see with the mint is that if your phone
somehow drops Bluetooth connection with
the mint your mitt will start to alert
you as if you have left your phone
behind besides that the mitt is a very
solid product that has a lot of
potential to grow and give back to its
users with such a wide array of
functions the min has the potential to
be the next big thing
we believe technology should make our
lives better and nowhere is that more
important than when it comes to our
health just imagine what we could do if
we knew where illness was spreading in
our local community before it affected
our friends offend individuals can take
action to avoid getting ill parents
would know at their child's first sign
or symptom how to respond physicians
would better care for patients and
society would finally have the tool it
needs to track and stop the spread of
illness at kinsa we're applying design
and technology to give you that
information I started kinsa after five
years running part of the Clinton
Foundation's international health
program I will always be proud of the
work there but I was struck by how
little we knew about where and when
disease was spreading as a parent of
young children I know that the most
important thing to me is their health
unfortunately they do get sick a lot
usually from something they pick up in a
neighborhood or at school and as
technologists I find it remarkable that
there's almost no information available
to me as to what is going around
together we assembled a dream team and
thought carefully about how to gather
this information because fever is often
the first sign of an illness it allows
us to know right when someone is first
feeling sick before they've even visited
the doctor the solution will sound
simple and it is but we think it's the
basis of a revolution in health it
starts with a device that's probably
already in your home we've just made it
simpler and smarter by connecting it to
your phone
this is the world's smartest thermometer
it tells you how to avoid getting L or
get better faster if you are we've
designed the Ken so smart thermometer to
be faster and more accurate my
five-year-old Nathan isn't feeling well
so I'm going to take his temperature by
using the power of your smartphone we've
minimized the electronics inside there
are no batteries processor or LCD this
allows it to be thin flexible and
comfortable to use especially for
children reading complete Nathan's
temperatures ok but he's been
complaining of a sore throat with a few
simple taps I can track his symptoms
over time and share them with our
pediatrician and since he probably got
sick from one of his friends I'm
checking the health of his school to see
what he might have here I can see the
private group that I joined with other
parents from Nathan's class 5 out of 24
kids are sick and strep throat is going
around so he doesn't have a fever I'm a
bit nervous so I look for the nearest
urgent care facility with an opening to
make sure that you have everything you
need to keep your family healthy we're
adding features like one touch call
nurse and an illness forecast so you
know when you're contagious and when
you're likely to get better even if you
haven't joined a private group you can
still check your local health situation
here it is on a Mac we combined our data
with data from others to give you what
we like to call the health whether you
can see the contagiousness level and
what illnesses or symptoms are
circulating in real time
we built the software and if working
prototypes of the thermometer and now we
need your help the funds you provide
will be used to manufacture the product
and scale up production making it even
more affordable but ken says about more
than just a thermometer it's about an
idea an idea that our health is linked
directly to the health of those around
us your support will start a movement to
share the information we need to keep
our families and our neighborhoods
healthy you will send a signal to the
world that you want to be part of that
movement join us and together let's
revolutionize health
hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hide away the bottle you'll
always reach for because it's always
within reach experts suggest that for
optimum health the average active person
drink / 10 glasses of water every day
but for those of us who are always on
the go it's nearly impossible to stay
hydrated without reaching for disposable
bottles of water or sugary sports drinks
bottled water may be convenient but it's
not cheap it costs more than 2,000 times
more than tap water even though it's
less regulated for help and quality then
there's the bottle every minute US
consumers throw out 90,000 plastic
bottles in less than a quarter are
actually recycled the rest end up in our
landfills and in our streets parks and
beaches we need a convenient solution to
disposable plastic bottles that fits our
active lifestyle so as a freelance
product designer I'm traveling a lot
visiting clients visiting factories
going to trade shows I was looking for a
water bottle that would not take up a
lot of space in my carry-on and I
started looking around for a product
that would work that would still be
functional and it wasn't out there as
I'm going through airports I'm seeing so
many travelers probably with the same
problem and I figured this is a problem
I could solve myself you know once i had
a solution for business travel i
realised this had great application my
personal life especially in the outdoors
going backpacking or just on hikes I
could bring water with me and when the
bottle was empty it it collapses and
goes away and takes no extra space in my
back
no one loves buying disposable water
bottles it's it's merely out of
convenience and The Hideaway makes a
reusable bottle more convenient in fact
in some places disposable water bottles
are are being banned so we're all going
to move towards the reusable water
bottle model and that's why I feel like
this is kind of the next generation and
hydration this gives you an option to
have a water bottle all the time without
having to throw anything away I'm really
excited to share the hideaway bottle
with with the world and Kickstarter is
an amazing opportunity to do that to be
able to show you the backers what this
is all about so please check out the
rewards we need to raise a significant
amount of money to get this into
production to get it on the shelves this
year and just as important please share
it with everyone you know tell them
about this great water bottle The
Hideaway we live on a planet that's 71
percent water yet we've only explored
10% of it we're about to change that
the fathom one is an easy-to-use
underwater drone that you control your
smartphone or tablet we designed it to
be the most affordable most versatile
underwater drone ever made and after two
full years of prototyping and
development were finally ready to bring
underwater exploration and education to
the masses I'm John I'm Matt I'm Danny
we're a team of outdoor enthusiasts
scuba divers engineers and travelers
that had an idea for an underwater drone
that we could take anywhere and use in
any environment I grew up spending
summers on Lake Louise in northern
Michigan where a lot of large logging
operations took place in the 1800s jump
forward 200 years and now every cottage
has artifacts and pieces of history on
their walls that washed up on the beach
but there are still legends of
horse-drawn sleds that fell through the
ice and got stuck at the bottom just
waiting to be explored I thought if I
could control an aerial drone from a
mobile app to explore from above why
couldn't I do the same thing from
underwater that's when fathom was born
underwater remotely operated vehicles or
ROV s have been around for a while but
they're mainly large expensive
industrial devices tethered to big ships
and early consumer RVs inspired by their
Big Brother's cost well over a thousand
dollars with no mobile app for piloting
and you need to be a pretty good hacker
to put them together we knew we wanted
an underwater drone that anyone could
drop into any body of water and pilot
easily using an app on their smart
device and it had to be small and light
enough to carry around meaning a
completely new compact design it had to
come fully assembled out of the box
including an onboard 1080p HD camera and
built in high intensity LED headlights
for clear viewing and it had to be as
affordable as lower cost flying drones
with comparable equipment so that every
modern-day explorer could have one we
built the fathom one with all of those
features and thanks to custom components
in a streamlined design now you can have
it for under six hundred dollars that's
less than half the price of the closest
competition
above all we made the fathom one super
easy to use but that doesn't mean it's
limited this thing is fully modular our
patent-pending thruster attachment
system allows you to easily remove all
three thrusters for packing but it also
enables customization and upgrades to
specialized thrusters such as these ones
with larger fins for stabilization and
we're hoping our backyard community will
create and share their own ideas for
customization fathom 1 also features an
integrated rail system that makes adding
accessories like action cameras and
additional lights or other sensors a
breeze just slide it on click it in and
you're ready to go we put everything
that we have into making underwater
exploration and education more
accessible to the masses we built the
prototypes validated our designs and now
ready to go on a full-scale
manufacturing all that's left is for you
the kicks our community to show us that
you want an underwater drone that's
affordable portable modular and
completely easy to use right out of the
box fathom is your chance to go deep and
see the world in an entirely new way the
possibilities are truly endless what can
you fathom
