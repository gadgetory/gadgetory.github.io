gold coins
or even liquid gold what if there were a
magic solution that could collect all
your dogs poop without any direct hand
contact because in reality your dog
doesn't poop gold introducing picker poo
a dog parents dream picker poo is made
up of two parts a rounded clip of soft
silicon cushions that secures
comfortably around your dog's tail and a
durable disposable collection bag that
hangs beneath place pick a poo on your
dog's tail before you go out for a walk
and when he is ready to poop all the
droppings fall directly into the
collection bag when your dog is finished
pooping you just unclip the bag and
throw it away with no mess and no
leakage in the real world
dog poop is not gold we love our dogs
but don't love cleaning up after them
say hello to the litter robot an
automatic self-cleaning litter box
that really works its unique design
senses when your cat is inside and when
it's time to clean up
once your cat exits a cleaning cycle
will begin automatically the patented
sifting process separates the clumps
from the clean litter and deposits them
into a carbon filter drawer below
reducing those unpleasant odors and
leaving a clean bed of litter every time
empty the waste drawer when indicated
and as litter is needed it's that simple
the litter robot is great for multiple
cats large cats and cats as small as 5
pounds there's even an automatic
nightlight for elderly cats no special
accessories required just plug it in add
clumping litter and let the litter robot
do the rest so say hello to the last
litter box you will ever buy and say
goodbye to scooping litter forever this
is Kim my guinea pig I cloned him for
security reasons don't look at me like
that it's for the sake of science and
this is Dorothy the housekeeper she is
very concerned about Kim's well-being
perhaps a little too concerned
don't panic Dorothy Kim is waterproof
and so is can if it with Kenneth --it
Dorothy can check up on Kim's daily
activities all data is automatically
synchronized with the application as
soon as he comes into range this means
you can adapt the ideal amount of food
according to the calories burned by your
guinea pig I mean your velvet pet the
results and statistics can be shared on
the kattegat network with other users
make sure your champion stays number one
I can see you Kim you're rubbish at
hide-and-seek even the clones spotted
you anyway
no more hide-and-seek with Kenneth it
the application automatically
synchronizes with the pendant and
locates the fugitive
I used the latest Bluetooth Low Energy
technology which gives the battery in
eight months life but you know what
dollars he is really fond of that she
can match Kenneth it with the color of
her purse or thing about one out your
vet can also access your pets probe
and adapt treatments and food advice
accordingly yes I've also got one of my
own I just need to cut down on the four
course menus apparently with Kanna fit
technology at the service of your pets
well being your pet never looked so
healthy or stylish dogs are part of our
lives and Families we love to spend time
together and take good care of them well
