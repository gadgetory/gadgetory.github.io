specialize in some improved devices
lastly there's the horn speakers
I discovered that I on speaker is a very
high performance unit and decided to
design a party to get design naturally a
mobile phone
once the content is convenient to use of
whatever hands a piece of art this is
symphonica a totally acoustic horn
speaker which naturally amplifies the
sound of your smartphone symphonica
employs passive acoustic amplification
increasing the sound without requiring
electrical power giving you extra volume
for listening to podcasts videos
background music FaceTime chats and
audiobooks symphonica is made from
sustainable woods and is carefully and
painstakingly worked and finished to
produce elegant inspired pieces each
with its own unique character we first
started talking about this idea a few
years ago Freddie's work involves
developing premium products for
consumers at the high end of the market
and so the question became how could we
offer a product that showcases the
beauty of natural wood with distinctive
styling that immediately catches the eye
and commands attention and yet still put
it within the reach of the average
person so that everyone could bring a
little bit of elegance into the homes
offices we've spent over two years
refining and testing designs and
prototypes were now ready to start
production but to cover the cost of the
initial run we need your support
we've got great early bird pricing for
those of you who want to be first to own
these remarkable speakers whether you
prefer a lacquered finish the rich tones
of stained wood the single beauty of
naked wood or wants to paint or stain it
yourself as a DIY project we've got a
version just right for you so please
pledge we know you're going to love
symphonic as much as we do and we can't
wait get them out

tea maker number one is a minimalist tea
brewer whose added to give you maximum
control of your teas flavor the design
is inspired by the guy want a
traditional Chinese tea vessel embedded
for the gong food tea ceremony which
roughly translates to making tea with
skill tea maker number one is hand
formed from borosilicate a
heat-resistant glass which allows the
tea's to Steve on display with each
infusion you wash the leaves slowly open
and reveal themselves while the liquor
darkens in color by brewing in multiple
short steeps each infusion will
highlight different flavor
characteristics using tea maker number
one is easy to learn the requires
practice to master it makes the act of
preparing tea into a small ritual the
labor becomes part of what you enjoy
about making your daily cup of tea the
double-walled construction insulates the
vessel keeping the water temperature
stable throughout the steep the outside
stays cool to the touch the brewer can
simply be picked up like a glass when it
comes time to pour one finger naturally
pulls back the porcelain lid and with a
flick of the wrist the tea is poured out
in one motion into the porcelain bowl
when you choose to slow down to prepare
a cup of tea manually you step away from
the myriad of distractions that surround
you to solely focus on making tea with
skill hi I'm Creighton Berman to founder
and creative director of manual maino
crates designed objects to celebrate
food and drink and I'm super excited to
share this latest project with you so
about a year ago my friends at Spirit
introduced me to this world of specialty
tea and honestly I was blown away I had
no idea that this much flavor could be
found in this one leaf I pretty quickly
became obsessed with tea and that was
the birth of this project so excited
that every backer of the manual tea
maker not only will receive the product
but also some of these really special to
these to try brewing I think you'll love
them and I think you'll become obsessed
as well thanks for checking out this
project thanks to the support Cheers
we all love to travel whether it's
discovering new places are going back
home to visit family and friends however
a long journey can really do a number on
your body even a few days after you get
to your destination you seem to still be
recovering typically if you're traveling
on a long journey and want to get some
rest you can either use a neck pillow or
a mashed up sweatshirt or jacket we knew
there had to be something better than
this and after doing our research and
creating multiple prototypes we're
excited to introduce the nod pod the nod
pod is the ultimate sleep travel
solution it keeps your neck and head at
a 90 degree angle which is the exact
same position in which you sleep in a
bed the patented over-the-top design
keeps your head from falling forward or
leaning left or right that way you won't
wake up with the kink in your neck or
with a bit of awkwardness from sleeping
on the person seated next to you the nod
pod is simple to use and works on all
types of seats from clean seats car
seats train seats and even desk chairs
plus the memory foam pillow is super
soft in the exterior is a breathable and
water repellent tu fabric so you can be
asleep for hours comfortably we promise
you this is the best sleep you'll ever
get well travel
in order to produce the non pod at an
affordable price with quality
manufacturers we need to meet a minimum
order quantity that's where you come in
with your support on Kickstarter we can
make the ultimate sleep travel solution
a reality thank you
