two two three the best mechanical pencil
for artists it is special because it has
three different calibers in three
different hardnesses of lens as well as
a mechanism based on gravity right now
it is just a prototype we need your help
to make it a reality
this is how it works simply hold the
pencil in this position and push the
back button and the smaller and harder
lead will come out by rotating it you
can also select a medium or a larger and
softer lengths the story behind this
pencil is that I love drawing but what I
didn't like as much was gathering all
the needed materials and much less
carrying them around
I wanted a beautiful tool that would
have it all to make the long story short
I am now partnering with a German
company who has produced high quality
pens and mechanical pencils for over 100
years it is made of brass so it has a
very nice weight to it and it is built
to last long the total three has a fully
retractable sleeve these to protect it
were not in use and also to safeguard
your clothing when transporting it it
has an extended in comfortable anti slip
area in the pencil eraser so you have
all you need in one tool and by the way
part of the phones
receiving this campaign will be used to
promote talented emerging artists we are
excited to bring the two two three to
the world but we need your help if you
believe as we do that art is an amazing
activity back this project and share it
with your friends together we will make
it a reality
thank you
there's more art on the internet that in
every gallery and museum on earth but
these objects are trapped they're
trapped inside devices like our tablets
phones laptops they're stuck inside
screens designed for distraction living
between texts and tweets and emails from
work so we wanted to make a new way to
bring art from the internet into your
home it's called electric objects the
first question we asked was how do we
design a computer that just fades away
one that feels more like a painting or a
photograph this isn't a normal screen
and it shouldn't feel like one the
device the hardware is minimal it's
really the experience it's the arm that
comes forth we're designing desktop and
mobile apps to make it easy for you and
your friends to discover display and
collect this beautiful works of art and
I'm really excited about our API and
seeing what artists and developers are
going to do with it we're working
closely with artists to create work
specifically for electric objects and
partnering with museums libraries and
other organizations to bring their
collections into your home it was really
great to think about this existing on
someone's wall and further thinking
about someone choosing this to exist on
their wall and how that was a reflection
of
sometimes when I'm sick maybe the home
should feel different sometimes when I'm
really happy my home should feel
different and the idea of being able to
have art in the house that has that
quality is in a way what I always wanted
art to be able to do
hello my name is David and I'm the CEO
of 3d Simo here's our new product the 3d
Simo mini it all started in 2013 with
our first product the original 3d Simo
it's the very first multi-material 3d
pen in the world you can set the speed
temperature and also choose from the
default material profiles you can draw
with a variety of materials including
flex fluorescents lay wood transparent
thermochromic decomposable materials and
so on but that wasn't enough for us
we've created a tool that would allow
you to create anything you wish the 3d
Simo mini is a smaller and smarter
version of the original 3d Simo
it can also solder burn and cut things
and you can operate it manually or
through your smartphone so don't be
limited by materials take full advantage
of 3d drawing draw fix and create new
things each extension is equipped with
an automatic detector so you only need
to insert and start to create with the
soldiering nozzle you can fix or create
any electrical component the tip can
reach a maximum temperature of 490
degrees
are you a creative person who likes
original items using the extension for
burning you can decorate for example
wooden spoons a belt wallet or your
leather shoes at the same time you can
shape 3d models and printouts if you're
a model maker or handyman you'll be
interested in our extension for cutting
plastics and foam materials you can make
a functional RC plane a ship a clock or
an amusing sponge for children these
four extensions are included in each
package don't be limited by regular
cable and start using our power pack you
can power your 3d Simo mini mobile phone
mp3 and so on and if you use our phone
app you can enjoy more fun with a 3d
Simo mini
thank you very much for your support my
name is Raphael Araujo I'm an architect
an illustrator
I have been drawing for 40 years I was
15 when I started noticing intelligent
patterns in the work of nature
spirals
sequences
proportions the secret of nature's
beautiful designs unfolded before my
eyes see the golden rage this radio
equals 1.618 and is found everywhere in
the rib of major let me show you
every theme I draw is by hand I don't
use a computer just a pencil a compass
and a protractor I leave the
construction lines intact to highlight
the golden radio at work it can take me
up to 100 hours to create a single
composition
recently I have received requests for
prints of my work to color him people
are coloring them into beautiful works
of art of their own style from this came
the idea to create a beautiful coloring
book with my best illustrations I have
been developing this project with a team
in Sydney we have already selected the
drivers if graphic designers are lined
up and the highest quality printing
house is shortlisted we do help we will
be able to get this project on rails
with this book we hope to help you to
understand the magic of nature a little
bit better and feel at one in your heart
with her thank you for your support
you
