convenient it's kind of like a really
really copying little people who's
trying to just a get around and this is
a great ride super easy great for a
beginner because it's low to the ground
low center of gravity it's really pretty
awesome I think I want to get one myself
yeah it's fast
today to make a professional film we
need lighting cameras and sound
equipment that would make us think it's
impossible to do at home but what is
actually holding us back the cell phone
cameras that we have keep getting better
what's the problem the microphones stay
exactly the same to solve this problem
we've created the solo camp an HD
microphone that connects to your phone
via bluetooth built to match the quality
of sound to the quality of video the
solo cam can not only connect to a cell
phone but also to a camera or GoPro the
180 degree pan is possible as a result
of an advanced axial and lets you film
without shaking the camera and getting a
much more stable image we also have a
natural hold handle to allow you to
stable 'support the camera or cell phone
to film for long periods of time finally
we have a smart app with a karaoke
station teleprompter filters and much
more with these options you can
customize the solo camp to film wherever
and however you want if you're a
journalist move faster to catch your
story and stream it live if you're an
aspiring artist or karaoke lover record
your song and directly upload the video
to share your creation with the world
and if you're taking videos of your
family you can catch voices and sounds
without interference we have a great
team of designers and engineers who have
been working for months to make sure
that the microphone provides top sound
quality that the handle is comfortable
and that the stick can stable support
the phone or camera for as long as you
want to film we need a microphone that
is as useful flexible and versatile as
the cell phone and we believe the solo
cam is that solution
