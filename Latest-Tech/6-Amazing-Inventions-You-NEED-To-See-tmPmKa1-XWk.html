this with this why because this has like
1,000,000 awesome games for it and this
is a huge screen so they invented
different Android TV kids the problem
were the controller it turns out that
touch games are actually meant to be
played with you know touch then they
tried using the smart phone itself as a
controller but that just led them
staring at the phone screen and the huge
TV and might as well have been a goat
they even crowdfunded the special
android gaming console for TV and people
are like oh yeah but then they used it
and they were like oh yeah it had no
touch and only had like 50 games we want
the whole 1 million up so now these
awesome geeks are proud to present the
controller that enables you to touch the
TV screens on the couch without looking
at it they call it zero zeros deep touch
technology brings mobile games as they
are to any TV it's a seamless experience
because of one main thing the unique
hover pad controller why is it so unique
the Z touch multi harbor technology
mirrors the position of your fingers
onto the TV when they float above the
controller 0 special indicators will
show you the location of your fingers on
the screen and the distance they are
from the past this way your eyes stay on
the TV and you know exactly where you're
going to touch giving you the exact same
intuitive experience you have on mobile
devices how does it work z touch is a
projected self capacitance space
technology that can detect conductive
objects like fingers up to 1.2 inch
above the sea touch sensor we've been
developing this technology for three and
a half years and boy have we patented it
the zero box comes with a powerful
quad-core processor and dedicated
graphics unit that delivers smooth
lightning fast graphics up to 4k the
controller's motion sensor completes the
gaming experience with a zero box
existing and future game from the google
play store can be downloaded and
instantly
used in exactly the same way as on
smartphones for tablets no extra costs
no modifications just play out of the
box plus you can use all those other
stuff too

agua is an innovative IP x3 stormproof
camera carrier designed to enable quick
drawing of your camera agua is
lightweight comfortable and designed
from the finest durable materials while
other camera bags come with rain covers
that provide limited protection from
water agua gives your camera excellent
protection even in pouring rain there
are numerous weatherproof camera bags on
the market but drawing a camera from
them is a slow and awkward process in
contrast agua lets you quick dry your
camera in any weather so you'll never
miss a shot agua provides double layer
protection against water and impact
thanks to an outer layer of waterproof
tarpaulin and an inner layer of neoprene
and lycra trying to adjust the length of
the strap on most camera bags is slow
and tricky while agua offers quick and
easy adjustment for the best fit with
only one hand the aguas padded strap is
lightweight yet sturdy and designed to
withstand extreme conditions and we mean
extreme
regular camera straps let you respond
quickly but they also leave the camera
exposed to damage on the other hand agua
is always protective and ready to shoot
and here's another cool thing with agua
you don't need your camera strap at all
the camera is attached to the back with
quick release buckle to protect it from
falling when needed simply disconnect
the buckle and shoot as you please we
designed the front lens protector to be
rigid on the outside but Pat it on the
inside this allows you to leave the lens
cap off and keep your camera ready for
action and if you really need a regular
camera strap you got it simply
disconnect the camera from the carrier
and connect it to the strap now all you
have to do is connect the carrier to
your bag or even your bike agua comes in
three different sizes for mirrorless
cameras midsize DSLRs and pro DSLRs they
are all designed to offer I px3
stormproof standard without compromising
on quick-draw ability you don't need to
be a pro to enjoy the a Glock it's
designed for everyone anywhere for all
of life's special moments worried about
nasty sand and splashes of salty water
relax even when you go to the beach you
can trust a gloss excellent protection
we even designed a special pocket for
the lens cover so you'll never lose it
again
agua there's no better way to carry your
camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
