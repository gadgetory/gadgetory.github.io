Wi-Fi routers are dumb machines and they
make us act like dumb people and try to
plug in it for 30 seconds yes we
unplugged it these machines work just
fine a decade ago when I only had one
computer and now my house is more
connected devices and I can even count
I want a modern Wi-Fi network that's
reliable and consistent wherever I am in
the house a network that's fast and
secure a network that keeps kids like my
nephew out of harm's way
enter luma an intelligent Wi-Fi system
that actually delivers on the promise of
fast reliable internet it surrounds you
with Wi-Fi using technology that was
previously only available to large
companies you put one here another one
there immediately you're up and running
we call it surround Wi-Fi luma is smart
enough to know things like what devices
you're using what networks are
interfering and where potential problem
spots are so it can make smart decisions
to get you the fastest data everywhere
and of course no network should be
without a good security system
I can easily grant people access my
network and just as easily revoked
I'm speaking of that I can rest easy
knowing that luma has modern parental
control so I can limit the kid G level
website monitor make sure he's not up to
any shenanigans I can even spend time
limit the pause in the internet like
during dinner time yeah oh here I'll
