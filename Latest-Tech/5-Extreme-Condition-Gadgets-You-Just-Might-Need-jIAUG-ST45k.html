might need hi y'all latest tech here
bringing you you guessed it the latest
tech out there today five extreme
condition gadget Tajima helmet cooling
fan today we will be talking about some
life-saving gadgets for some extreme
conditions the Tajima zero helmet
cooling fan useful for working in hot
humid or cramped areas drying your sweat
and keeping you nice and cool while you
work to protect you from heatstroke
it has a strong adjustable band silicone
funnel and fan and a simple one-button
clip-on controller it's lithium ion
battery can work for a full eight hours
straight at its highest setting and as
the name implies it's a Japanese product
found on Japan trend shop comm for 215
US dollars this is a great way to
protect you from heatstroke while you
work and should be a must for workers in
any hot or humid climate
Milwaukee heated jackets on the complete
opposite of the spectrum the heat
spectrum to be exact here we have the
Milwaukee heated jackets instead of hot
or humid areas these jackets are built
to protect you from the cold perfect for
work in cold weather
by being a self heating jacket powered
by none other than a lithium ion battery
keeping you nice and toasty for up to
eight hours continuously with a really
cool button control on the chest it
boasts that it's three times faster than
all of its competition by heating up
carbon fiber area zones in the jacket
placed at your core areas and the heat
gets distributed all over the jacket
keeping your whole torso warm and since
cold could mean rain or snow it's made
of stretch polyester that's wind and
water resistant keeping all the heating
components on the inside of the jacket
with a thermal knit fleece as the inner
lining making it machine washable and
dryer safe too but while your core is
nice and warm your hands could still be
cold if gloves get in the way the jacket
covers this with a hand warming function
for the pockets letting you warm your
hands it even has a few nifty features
like extra pockets and surprisingly in
the front chest pocket it even has a
very nice USB power port to charge your
phone or music player while you work and
store it there too and to keep you
comfortable it has three adjustable heat
settings of high medium and low so you
don't overheat while you work and find
the optimal temperature you need
depending on the weather around you I
found it on Amazon for 299 us in a bunch
of colors but I think it only ships to
the US and Canada but a very good option
instead of wearing big bulky fur-lined
jackets that could get in the way while
you work
Schmidt's mitts glove the most important
tool any person has is their hands so
let's keep them safe with us
Smith Smith's glove this beast of a
glove has an armored Kevlar outer
protective layer making it almost cut
proof with a double Kevlar stitching
inner glove that is also very cut
resistant this thing is crazy good
protection for your hand no matter what
your work is the fiber of the gloves
providing added protection to not just
cuts but also impacts as well with
carbon fiber on the knuckle guards and
on the finger and thumb joints too even
if you work with hot stuff or fire this
glove practically shrugs off direct
flames even from a freaking blowtorch
making this glove more for rescue
operations and industrial work than
regular everyday use at 85 US dollars on
Schmidt's mitts comm I think it's worth
every penny if your work is this
dangerous
since the choice could be 85 bucks or
your hands bridge he'll fire car blanket
speaking of fires fire and its toxic
smoke are a huge danger not just to
people but everything around it too on
the internet dangerous and toxic people
like this are usually blocked on social
medias and with the bridge hill car fire
blanket you can now block fire but in
real life it doesn't just block fire but
also it's dangerous side-effect smoke
this is a great way to isolate things
like car fires to avoid the risk of
heavy smoke or fire spread in very tight
areas like parking garages and tunnels
it basically snuffs out fires by cutting
off their oxygen supply and letting the
smoke it produces suffocates it being as
easy as roll it out get an extra pair of
hands and simply cover the burning wreck
with a fire blanket making sure to
completely cover it I looked around and
I can't quite find where to buy it not
even on their website but I did find
something
similar in the tignous fire blanket that
costs 599 euros on fire tax EU an
excellent tool for firefighting and
should be placed in every tunnel and
indoor garage or parking to help save
more people and their cars to Cobham
survivor plus workers on boats and ocean
rinks have an uncomfortably high chance
of ending up needing to go overboard and
jumping into the water either on life
rafts or more terrifyingly like in the
movies without one but have no fear the
COPE am survivor plus is here giving you
your very own personal life raft and
life jacket too they are both
automatically inflated after hitting the
water will the life jacket and the life
raft
both tethered to each other preventing
you from drifting apart if the waves and
currents are strong enough it has a
ballast bags on either sides for
stabilization to prevent tipping over
and even having an inflatable canopy and
seat cushion for thermal protection to
the canopy can be completely zipped
closed for maximum protection from the
elements like rain the waves sun
exposure and especially those pesky
seagulls to make it easy to spot at
night the life raft has a strobe light
and a clear face shield to both protect
your face and to let you look out for
rescue I don't think this is a
commercially available product since the
website shows that it's a corporation
catering to other organizations so I
don't think we're gonna get cool life
rafts for us unless you work somewhere
that deals specifically with cop√°n
directly a very cool addition to the
safety equipment anywhere near deep
waters where I'm sure everyone will
appreciate every addition and every
effort to saving their lives obviously I
hope none of us ever end up in
situations where anything like the last
few gadgets would be necessary
but if you ever do I hope you get these
gadgets and may they help save your life
and limbs don't forget to subscribe and
ring that notification bell and comment
to us here at latest tech so we can know
all about y'all's opinions about these
new gadgets ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
