Oh
the sign of a good workout is working up
a sweat you feel good when the sweat
pours down your brow because you know
you push your body to its limits what
doesn't feel good is laying it somebody
else's sweat that they've left behind
gym towels do an okay job at covering up
sweat but the only work when you lay
them on a flat surface also since both
sides look identical you soon forget
which side of the towel is the clean
side that's why I came up with the idea
for the gym gecko it has over 2,000
silicon dots to help it grip to nearly
any surface
once you lay it down provide the
hygienic bear against gross wet
splotches insipid silicone dots will
always be facing downwards you can
confidently wipe down your own face and
body with a soft and absorbent clean
side of the towel hi my name is wheat
and I'm the creator of the Jim gecko by
pledging now you consume to have your
very own Jim gecko by your side wing as
a gym we have for fun color choices for
you to choose from gecko green Jim gray
purple power and blue steel thank you
for watching our video and have a great
workout we all know the benefits of
taking care of ourselves consistent by
eating healthy and exercising but
sometimes in life we just get so busy
that we can't consistently make it to
our local fitness center to get in a
strength into any exercise that's why we
created a product for you a product that
allows you to do every effective
strengthen toning exercise that you
could do at a local fitness center a
product that's compact versatile and
affordable a product known as the mega
bar by Jim supreme
you
you
you
hello everyone my name is OBD I'm the
product designer and creator of the mega
bar by jim supreme now at first sight
the mega bar might seem like just a
better looking pull-up bar but it's so
much more we also made it functionally
better for you because we wanted to give
you home access to every effective
strengthen toning exercise that you
could do at a fitness center during the
design process i kept asking myself one
important question and that question was
what if what if a product that looked
like a pull-up arm could do more for you
what if it was elevated higher what if
it was stronger what if it looked better
what if it was engineered to have better
weight distribution when on your door
frame what if this product could give
you the ability to do every effective
present only exercise that you can do at
a fitness center but now also in the
convenience of your home
well it's been two years of designing
prototyping product testing and
patenting and we're happy to say we've
turned all those what-ifs into reality
for you we're proud to present to you
the mega Blok by jim supreme
so we're here on Kickstarter because we
found a manufacturer that's capable of
creating your mega bar at a high quality
that we approve of but we need your help
start the first production run and by
ordering your mega bar today you're
gonna turn everything we've done for you
into re out we've got some great rewards
lined up for you at a discount just for

and always remember that's good LIF good
look good
we have devices that let us communicate
anywhere explore anywhere even be
anywhere
but we're still stuck here let's change
that
imagine if the world was our jet imagine
if a routine became an adventure imagine
being able to work out anywhere monkey
bars are an ultra portable Fitness tool
that converts into a Suspension Trainer
now you have the freedom to work out on
the trail at the park at the office at
home while traveling or even beneath a
hot-air balloon
quick escapes and short breaks become
the perfect opportunity to sneak in a
workout using monkey bars is simple grab
your bars explore workout you can do
hundreds of movements that work your
upper body core and legs whether your
goal is strength endurance or
flexibility be creative combine
movements to challenge yourself
setup takes less than a minute remove
the suspension line stored inside each
bar toss the line over any support
structure and adjust the loop to your
specific exercise as we refine the
design over the past year we never lost
our focus on creating a product that is
lightweight and ultra portable we
applied human factors engineering to
ensure monkey bars fit perfectly in the
human hand
our earth-friendly finish protects the
wood and preserves the wild we developed
an incredibly strong system built around
an aerospace grade aluminum core and a
hard maple grip each bar contains 18
feet of our proprietary braid of spectra
in advanced fiber normally used for rock
climb our team is a group of designers
product engineers athletes and climbers
that all share love of the outdoors and
a passion for the wild this journey to
make monkey bars a reality rivals any
adventure that we've ever had however
there's one last hurdle before we begin
manufacturing we need your support to
help on the tooling necessary to start
production so check out our rewards and
support us with your pledge and by
sharing the project with your friends
all of our Kickstarter backers will get
a big discount off of retail price
pledge now we'll keep you updated as we
work to get your new monkey bars into
your hands this summer
thank you
this is pull up and dip the world's
first portable pull-up bar that could be
changed for dips within seconds all in
one device in addition you can do a lot
of other exercises like leg raises or
muscle ups to extend your bodyweight
workout it can be attached to trees or
poles of different diameters and solves
all your problems in crowded parks when
you can't do pull-ups on football goals
you can also use a resistance band for
support during your exercises and if the
weather is too bad it allows you to
workout indoors as well without
installing a permanent pull-up bar but
now let's have a closer look at how
pull-up and dip brings your bodyweight
workout to the next level store it away
when not needed and easily assemble it
within a single set break the indoor
adapter is fixed to the wall and thin
enough to hide it with a picture just
insert pull-up and dip into the indoor
adapter with the screwless plug-in
system and you're ready to go to switch
from pull-ups to dips simply turn it
around 180 degrees you can do both
exercises with the same multi bar
it's nice weather and you prefer outdoor
workouts no problem the complete outdoor
package of pull-up and dip fits into a
standard backpack and can be carried to
your favorite location
every component is made out of stainless
steel to be rust proof and durable the
outdoor package includes a tree
protection the adjustable outdoor
adapter and a tension belt to tighten
everything against a tree or a pole
simply insert the sidearm and the two
bars and pull up and dip is ready to use
in less than two minutes the multi bar
offers you many different grip positions
for pull-ups creating various angles in
order to work on multiple muscles in
your back arms and shoulders for dips
you don't have to lower the position of
the adapter as the incline design
provides a perfect height for both
exercises the v-shape of the multi bar
enables a narrow or wider grip
hi Kickstarter I'm Michele and I'm
Johannes and we are both from Munich in
Germany and the inventors of pull up and
did the idea of pull up and dip we had
about one and a half years ago when our
outdoor workout location was closed
during the Oktoberfest and we didn't
have the possibility to do pull-ups
there anymore so that's why we started
to create this product and after many
prototypes and a lot of testing and
adjustments on them we finished the
prototype development so now very soon
we want to go to serial production but
now we need your support we already have
invested a lot of time and money in
prototypes and want to bring pull-up and
dip in serial production to realize this
project we need your support so that we
can bring pull up and dip to you thank
you for watching our video and your
support we would also really appreciate
it if you could share our video with
your workout friends we are looking
forward to offer you a great product
that will improve your indoor and
outdoor workout please support us now
thank you Kickstarter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
