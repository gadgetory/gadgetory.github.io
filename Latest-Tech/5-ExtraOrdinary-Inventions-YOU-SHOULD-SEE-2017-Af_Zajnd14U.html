filling their notebooks and then just
buying more I think the note book
industry has given up on innovation okay
what's this
the notebook Hemingway wrote on that's
cool I guess we're from rocket book and
we make notebooks from the future
at rocket book we are already famous for
inventing the wave notebook the smart
notebook that can be erased in the
microwave we've shipped 100,000 waves to
satisfied customers around the world
others may stop there but we are maniacs
obsessed with lending old fashioned
notebooks with future and awesome so
we've spent a year in the rocket lab
designing a new notebook that feels like
pen and paper but is endlessly reusable
and completely integrated with your
digital lifestyle
introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast brings cloud
scalability to pen and paper simply
write scan and a race
imagine 1000 of your favorite notebooks
in one sleek design that fits in your
backpack and here's how it works
Everlast pages look and feel like paper
but they're actually constructed from a
polyester composite rather than would
you write on the Everlast
using any pen from the pilot FriXion
line which are available in-store and
online writing on the Everlast feels
perfectly natural and smooth and as the
ink dries it forms a complete bond to
the polyester page so it won't rub off
but what makes this formulation so
unique is that each page can be wiped
completely cleaned with a moist towel so
it can be used over and over and over
again the Everlast notebook is also
compatible with the rocket book app so
before you wipe your notes off the page
you can blast them online to your
favorite cloud services in a fraction of
a second rocket book machine vision
scans enhances and send each page to the
specific destination they belong on the
cloud services you already use
each Everlast notebook page has seven
symbols set up the rocket book app to
assign each symbol to a location within
Dropbox Google Docs Evernote or many
other services you could configure your
diamond to suspend meeting notes
directly to your shared team folder in
Dropbox or students could configure
their star symbol to send notes right to
a math folder in Google Drive so you can
make your list break out that diagram or
color in that drawing then tomorrow
start your day with a brand new notebook
would be Everlast one notebook becomes
one thousand notebook the utility of the
clouds and the joy of pen and paper
that's rocket book

how things were made a while back it's
like magic has a certain feeling to it
it was an era when people had time to
pay attention to every detail and things
were made to last
inspired by the bullish headlights we've
collected over the years we combined our
skills to create something useful really
amazing we would be proud of patting
around
we wanted it to have a personality
the stance had to inspire confidence
just like a superhero stamped the
footprint is large enough to keep it
balanced
the size was chosen so it will be tall
enough to provide light for the entire
office that has routine same direction
and at any angle even large enough to be
used at the headphone stand we fitted it
with LED light sources to have the
perfect light for any situation a clear
one for reading you could easily turn on
or off and set the intensity just by
touch and an RGB controlled by mobile I
turn it on or off change the color or
intensity lock fitting comfortably on
the couch this light can even be synced
to music so it will flash to the beat
when you're having a party look some
functionality weren't enough the
materials had to be top-notch as well
the head is made out of old tractor
headlight it's all metal and glass so it
would last even in the toughest
condition the neck the only exposed part
this is made from aluminum so it won't
rust body is made from recycled
polyurethane to help the environment a
bit we wanted everyone to be able to add
a personal touch to it so starting from
day one you can choose the colors to
match your room
biometric personality to have full-body
coverage each ranch will have two layers
of non-toxic water-based paint -
basically it's a clear coat to protect
the paint job from rare scratch over
time let's face water to you lots of fun
so we need to drink it sure we know it's
healthy but it's just an occasion
exciting is all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more that jump hey and
that's a problem a very big problem so
we decided to put some fun as a drinking
water with the right cup it's the
world's first ever fruit flavoured cup
designed to get people drinking more
water sure it might look simple but it
actually took six years of research and
patented technologies to get where we
are today and we believe it's going to
be a real game-changer so how does it
work Wow well for starters our brain
identifies flavor using two main sense
of taste and smell that's why we
inserted innovative fda-approved
fruit scent and flavor directly into the
right cup so when you drink water from
it your nose picks up the fruity aroma
your tongue senses the hint of a sweet
taste and your brain yo
what is that you're only drinking
natural water Wow
great but does it work well we asked
ourselves that very same question so we
put the right cup to the test with our
orange flavored prototype whoa okay Wow
you're kidding me right what's in this
yeah just water tastes like something
else just water
crazy brilliant just brilliant
