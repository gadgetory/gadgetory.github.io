that there was a delicious savory treat
that you've never had before or maybe
never even heard of what if I told you
that it was probably already in your
refrigerator it's the egg well okay so I
exaggerated a little we've all enjoyed
eggs at some point in our lives but have
you ever tasted or ever even seen what's
known as a golden egg a golden egg is an
egg that was scrambled inside of its
shell and its unique preparation that
has been relatively unachievable until
now introducing the golden goose we've
carefully designed and engineered a new
kitchen tool that allows you to create
golden eggs yourself
it's the goose that lays golden eggs the
goose features economic handles abrasion
resistant nylon cordage a tough
scrambling chamber a securely locking
ring and a soft egg cradle designed to
fit a variety of egg sizes and shapes
inspired by the motion of Victorian era
children's toy the goose is a low-tech
kitchen appliance designed to take
advantage of what are known as the
typical forces it's been carefully
designed for performance and can
thoroughly mix an egg while protecting
it from breakage the way it works is to
hold eggs safely in his cradle while the
spinning motion evenly mixes the egg
white with the yolk over the past year
we've carefully designed and developed a
goose following a thoughtful design
process we started with loads of ideas
and sketches created different geometric
prototypes 3d prints and rubber molds
building and testing rough CAD models
and performance testing a variety of
materials we tested our prototypes in a
variety of situations as well and took
the best design to finalise it with
sophisticated computer CAD models we've
refined every important aspect and we
prepared the goose for manufacturing our
next step is to purchase the actual
production tooling and materials we
secure competitive quotes from several
manufacturers both domestically and in
Asia we've crossed our eyes and dotted
our T's we finalized the design and
engineering details
we've had fun inventing new and tasty
dishes now we believe that we've created
an innovative and novel kitchen utensil
that's easy to use fun and effective oh
and did we mention that it's easy to
assemble that it's food safe
it's made with recyclable materials and
it's easily disassembled so it doesn't
end up in the landfill and this is where
you come in it just costs too much for
bootstrapping start up to foot bill we
love the goose and we think you will too
but in order to make things happen we
need your help
please help us share the goose with all
the creative cooks and home chefs and
Kickstarter's of the world
hi I'm Garrett grumpy the creator of the
goose and I'm a product designer with
over 12 years of experience in industry
I just completed my first year of
opening up an independent design
and this is why line product designs
first solo project we've invested
everything we could into it and my
talented group of friends and associates
has helped to do skits where we are
today with your generous support we'll
be able to reach the finish line and in
return we want to share some of these
loss rewards
check out the rest of our Kickstarter
page and tell your friends and thanks
for watching
cooking from home can be a great
experience but let's be honest
nobody likes a messy kitchen or the
cleanup that comes after this is
especially true when working around a
stovetop with vod's bands and everything
else you need to get a meal man what if
there was a product that could minimize
your efforts while simultaneously
keeping your stovetop clean and
organized introducing the listener a
kitchen accessory that actually makes
the cooking experience to the better the
lid sitter attaches to virtually every
kind of lid on the market and once it's
on you can simply rest it on the side of
the pot or pan this keeps it right where
it needs to be without getting in the
way or taking up any counter space plus
you never have to touch the lid and the
lid never has to touch the counter so
burns and inconvenient spills or a thing
of the past
liquid and condensation slides easily
back into the fire
keeping the countertop spotless and
clean you even have a place to rest the
cooking utensil so that everything can
stay together it's incredibly durable
easy to clean and dishwasher safe the
lid sitter was designed to streamline
the cooking experience and consolidate
space all while keeping your
surroundings clean and organ
after countless iterations months of
testing and wonderful community feedback
the final design is here with your
pledge manufacturing can begin on the
lid sitter and shipments can commence
immediately thank you
you
bolo is a true innovation combining two
of humanity's most important inventions
to date the knife and the wheel creating
a one-of-a-kind rolling knife your
perfect kitchen accessory bolo makes
preparing your meals faster and easier
the engineered circular blade coupled
with bolo sturdy construction allows you
to achieve chef quality precision in
your cutting and bolo easily tackles
many of the jobs your other knives can't
do the ergonomic handle makes bolo more
functional and more comfortable than
your regular kitchen knives as a chef a
product designer and a housewares
manufacturer I've worked with then
studied nice for over 30 years and I
find they all have one common deficiency
the angle of the blade and the grip on
the handle puts too much stress on your
wrist and hand bull changes all of that
by placing the force of your hand
directly above the blade you get better
precision cutting while relieving your
hand and wrist from unnatural movements
the result perfectly cut food each and
every time fast and easy
and the special blade break even turns
bolo into a chopper and cleaning bolo
could not be easier just open at both
ends remove the blade and rinse
hi everyone Bonjour I'm Natalie the
creative director thank you for watching
our video we think this little knife is
going to do big things but in order to
get there we need your help every pledge
made to our project brings us one step
closer to be able to put bolo into full
production and start shipping them to
great folks like yourself we already
have a patent in place and our tooling
ready for manufacturing with your
backing we'll be able to manufacture our
units and finalize our packaging
components please help spread the word
about bolo to your friends and family we
promise you will love your new perfect
kitchen accessory
you
as bicoastal foodies we love to cook
because it just brings everyone together
nothing beats Sunday gatherings over
sweet and sticky ribs ketchup and hang
out with our friends it's an adventure
to search those local markets for those
special ingredients and craft dishes
together it's like dinner and a movie
except the process becomes more of the
entertainment and dinner feels like
dessert
good food draws people in and brings
everybody together but sadly only few
people think that they can cook
inspiring dishes they don't think they
have the experience confidence or skills
we want to change that and with your
help we believe we can top chefs all
around the world are using a new
technology to create incredible dishes
it's called an immersion circulator and
they use it to cook sous-vide it sounds
complicated but actually it's a simple
process all you have to do is put your
ingredients and plant it back give it an
airtight seal and then put it in the
temperature controlled water bath this
ensures that the right heat goes all the
way through and it yields perfect
results the Namie who makes this usually
complicated and expensive process simple
and elegant it clips onto any pot that
you already have we have one screen that
you press to turn the machine on and off
and a knob that you can use to adjust
the temperature now if you can turn on a
faucet you can sous vide have you ever
try to cook steak medium-rare and find
it impossible to get the right degree of
doneness with the Namie food you'll
never go wrong because you can apply
exact science a perfect medium-rare
steak happens at 57 degrees Celsius and
that's exactly where you can set your
nam equal to
cooking slow and low that's all the
delicious applying processes take place
fat and collagen melt into the muscle
making each fight so tender and
delicious top chefs like John George and
Thomas Keller are exalted for their
consistency and accuracy that's why they
rely on this method every day in their
modern kitchens I rely on it for when I
have a party in the past when we had a
group of people over we just end up
ordering takeout because cooking for a
group people is a tall order and we'd
always be worried we couldn't get
something just right now our food is
ready for us when we are it sits inside
a perfect temperature bath so it won't
overcook the Namie crew gives us the
confidence to tackle a lot of culinary
challenges like custard it's the bane of
every dessert maker to babysit that
custard but now you can just put your
ingredients inside a bag pop it in at 82
degrees Celsius and put it in the
desired shape you want after 20 minutes
I'm not a top chef but the nominee who
lets me make consistently awesome food
in the kitchen
all the time you'll impress your friends
with how well you cook but especially
you'll surprise yourself to have the
Nami COO in the hands of home cooks but
turn the food world up on its head just
as the microwave make heating convenient
the Nami COO makes crafting perfect
dishes consistently easy we believe we
can give grandparents parents and
students the confidence to enjoy cooking
thank you for taking the time to
hi Kickstarter's my name is Joseph and I
am your hands and yes we are twins and
we are cooking but there are some parts
of it that we don't like
fortunately we found a solution for all
of this I'm a chef in a restaurant and
at work I have these problems
every day in professional kitchens it's
all about a good work flow and a tidy
workplace one day we had a hard day and
a lot to do I have seen the bar of my
colleagues took a container placed it
underneath his cutting board and chopped
the vegetables straight into the
container and that impressed me it was
so fast and clean that I thought I
wanted chopping board that works exactly
like this I started searching for one
but I couldn't find anything so we made
one we had loads of ideas and with many
prototypes we finally found something
that brings it all together and we are
so proud to share with you today so it
is basically a regular chopping board
but it brings a professional workflow to
your home it has these brackets that can
be pulled out to take up containers
now this takes a kitchen bird to a whole
new low use one of the containers for
waste and the other one for chopped food
and simply shoot it off the board into
the container
the third container and we use for tools
so this is great but what this one it
gets even better it's designed to give
you quick access to your favorite
ingredients to your cooking session so
your chopping board has now become a
perfectly organized working place
the whole system is based on these
custom on containers which is developed
red standard or containers and
professional kitchens the flower photo
kit comes in two different sizes and we
designed the Phoenix which takes the
whole system even a separate
Kickstarter's we spent the last three
years on this project and we invested a
lot of money on the patterns and the
developed now we are ready to launch and
we need your help we need as many
pre-orders as possible to get the
production started and to set up our
company so if you love cooking and if
you like the idea we just say it
straight you should buy one you get the
very best chopping board and you help us
getting started and if you don't like
cooking at all then you surely know
someone who does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
