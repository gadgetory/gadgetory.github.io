conspiracy inspired oncologists keeping
life-saving treatments from cancer
victims is the pressure from oil
companies preventing the mass production
of electric cars biggest secrets and
suppressed inventions number one
electric cars and water powered vehicles
perhaps the most notorious suppressed
invention is the General Motors evreyone
the ev1 was the world's first
mass-produced electric car with 800 of
them up for lease from General Motors in
the late 90s General Motors and the the
ev1 line in 1999 stating that consumers
weren't happy with the limited driving
range of the cars batteries making it
unprofitable to continue production many
skeptics however believed General Motors
killed the ev1 under pressure from oil
companies who stand to lose the most if
high efficiency vehicles conquered the
market it didn't help the General Motors
hunted down and destroyed every last
eveyone ensuring the technology would
die out despite how silly it sounds
water fueled vehicles do exist the most
famous is tan Mayer's dune buggy which
achieved hundred miles per gallon and
might have become more commonplace had
Meyer not succumb to a suspicious brain
aneurysm at the age of 57 insiders have
loudly claimed that Myers was poisoned
after he refused to sell his patents or
and his research fearing a conspiracy
his partners have all but gone
underground or shall we say underwater
and taken his famed water powered dune
buggy with them
number two a safer cigarette each day
over 15 billions of cigarettes are
consumed over the world in the 1960s the
Liggett &amp;amp; Myers tobacco company created
a product called the XA a cigarette in
which most of the sticks carcinogens
have been eliminated dr. James mold
liggett's research director reported in
court documents that Philip Morris
threatened to clobber Liggett if they
did not adhere to an industry agreement
never to reveal information about the
negative health effects of smoking by
advertising a safer alternative they
would be admitting the dangers of
tobacco use the lawsuit was dismissed on
technicality and Philip Morris never
addressed the accusations despite their
own scientists publication of research
that showed less cancer and mice exposed
to smoke from the XA Liggett &amp;amp; Myers
issued a press release denying evidence
of cancer in humans as a result of
tobacco use and the XA never saw the
light of day number 3 free energy Nikola
Tesla was an undisputed genius in 1899
they figured out a way to bypass fossil
fuel burning power plants and power
lines
proving that free energy could be
harnessed using ionization in the upper
atmosphere to produce electrical
vibrations JP Morgan who had been
funding Tesla's research had a bit of
buyer's remorse when he realized that
free energy for all wasn't as profitable
as say actually charging people for
every watt of energy use Morgan then
drove another nail in free energies
coffin by chasing away other investors
insuring Tesla's dream would die in the
past century billions of dollars have
been spent researching how to create
energy using controlled hot fusion a
risky and unpredictable line of
experimentation let's make this easier
to understand a tokamak is a device that
uses a powerful magnetic field to
confine the hot plasma in the shape
the Taurus magnetic confinement fusion
is an approach to generate thermonuclear
fusion power that uses magnetic fields
to confine the hot fusion fuel in the
form of the plasma the tokamak is one of
the several types of magnetic
confinement devices being developed to
produce controlled thermonuclear fusion
power a leading candidate for a
practical fusion reactor fusion
reactions combined light atomic nuclei
such as hydrogen to form heavier ones
such as helium producing energy when two
physicists who were working on the
decades-long tokamak hot fusion project
at Los Alamos laboratory stumbled across
a cheaper safer method of creating
energy from colliding atoms they were
allegedly forced to repudiate their own
discoveries or be fired the lab feared
losing the torrent of government money
for tokamak in retaliation the lead
researchers created the focus fusion
society which raises private money to
fund the research outside of government
interference meanwhile there are
scientists and a fringe group of
University researchers have been getting
closer to harnessing the power of cold
fusion which is much more stable and
controllable but far less supported by
government and foundation money in 1989
Martin Fleischmann and Stanley pons
announced that they had made a
breakthrough and had observed cold
fusion in a glass jar on their lab bench
CBS's 60 minutes described how the
resulting backlash from the well-funded
hot fusion crowd sent the researchers
and their ground and overseas where
within a few years their funding dried
up forcing them to drop their pursuit of
green energy number four miracle cancer
cure what is taking so long this
question is asked by millions of
patients and their family members as
they face catastrophic cancer diagnosis
in 2001 rick simpson discovered that a
cancerous spot on a skin disappeared
within a few days of applying an
essential oil made of marijuana
researchers in Spain have confirmed that
THC the active compound in marijuana
kills brain tumor cells in human
subjects and shows promise with breast
pancreatic and liver tumors the US Food
and Drug Administration however
classifies marijuana as a schedule 1
drug meaning that it has no accepted
medical use
unlike schedule 2 drugs like cocaine and
methamphetamine which may provide
medical benefits in 1986 Excel Audrey a
German scientist working at Genentech
first discovered the her2 protein
responsible for causing a specific form
of aggressive breast cancer and gave a
conference about it in which Dennis
layman an American oncologist was
present eventually they found a mutation
in the her2 protein and they started
working together on producing an
antibody to block the protein hoping to
create a new treatment however Genentech
had serious administrative conflicts
regarding the direction of their
research at the time and they refused to
found their research with Elric leaving
the company despite not working at
Genentech Sleiman kept insisting which
led him to being known and disliked
among the staff but eventually he
convinced a group of Genentech
scientists and got funds to do a small
study which proved the efficacy of the
antibody in fighting breast cancer that
was in 1977 21 years before her septons
eventual approval so what took so long
