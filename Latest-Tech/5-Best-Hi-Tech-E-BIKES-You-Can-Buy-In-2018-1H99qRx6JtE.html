the ultimate urban transporter the
world's most approachable electric
motorcycle inspired by the classic
mopeds from the 70s and 80s but with the
technology of today the m1 merges
software and hardware into retro styling
designed and built by both motorbikes in
California there are no gears to ship no
clutch to grab and the ride is whisper
quiet it can go faster and farther than
any bicycle and gets to places
motorcycles camp the company's goal was
to design a motorbike that is exciting
but also that anybody can write the best
part is that you can do it without a
license registration or insurance the m1
was designed to handle mean city streets
and off-road trails and all weather
conditions
an economy mode the m1 is tuned to me
standard electric bicycle regulations
but don't be fooled at 20 miles per hour
with a range of 35 miles you can write
all day use bicycle lane and park
anywhere sport mode delivers pure power
style and attitude no keys the m1 is
Bluetooth enabled and connects your
smartphone with password protection
the perfect vehicle for the city dweller
an e-bike that effortlessly blends the
style of vintage motorcycle with the
practicality of a bicycle number two
stealth b-52 electric bikes belt
electric bikes are handcrafted in
Australia home to some of the most
advanced electric bike and ebike
technology in the world the two
kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery offers
uncompromised safety and reliability
with a three hour recharge time what a
peak power output the 5.2 kilowatts the
b-52 has got what it takes to silently
outrun all enemies the b-52 has a top
speed of 50 miles per hour with the
added bonus of transmitting traditional
pedal power via its advanced 9 speed
sequential gearbox to further increase
range and efficiency in economy mode
without pedaling riders can expect a
range up to 60 miles on flat terrain
while a full throttle ride will shred a
25 mile train at blistering speeds when
slowing down or coasting pilots can also
activate regenerative braking which
recovers kinetic energy
leading it back into the battery pack
further enhancing range and right time
number three rad mini rat power bikes is
on a mission to build bikes that are
built for everything but price for
everyone the rad mini is a compact that
tire electric bike that folds to save
space it's only available in one frame
size for now but the handlebar height is
adjustable along with the saddle so it
can actually fit a wide range of body
types large hundred and eighteen
millimeter disc brake rotors provide
excellent stopping power and control the
750 watt fat bike specific geared hub
motor is zippy and powerful both systems
benefit from a mechanical advantage
because of the smaller diameter 20-inch
wheel size
some basic parts were chosen to keep the
price down including a seven speed
Shimano derailleur with large thumb
shifter non-locking grips a plastic
chain guide mechanical brakes versus
hydraulic and standalone rear light of
the folding pedals adjustable kickstand
an integrated headlight are all great
numbered for all de bike the all de pipe
is based on custom carbon fiber wheels
and the full suspension carbon fiber
frame even the front suspension forks
are custom designed for this bike the
rims look very similar in design to
those on the $80,000 black trail leading
to speculation by some in the e bike
community but this bike was partially
designed by PG bikes the company behind
the black trail the key element to the
all the drive system is that it keeps
the motor weight in the center of the
frame unlike most hub power bikes which
have their heavier motor weight
awkwardly placed in the rear wheel most
importantly this allows the power to be
driven through the bicycles gear system
the bike appears well balanced with most
of the serious weights the trade is very
low and centered in the frame the all te
bike is designed with a very low weights
high power and nimbleness in mind no
doubt this is where BMX type stunts
so the Aldi does not carry a heavy
battery pack instead it features a small
featherweight quick change pack enabling
the rider to choose between riding naked
for short distances or hauling an extra
battery pack in a backpack for longer
rides other interesting design details
include a motorcycle like seat which can
retract during writing to transform the
e bike into a trials type bike for
jumping and stunt riding
a built-in break taillight in the back
of the seat is a brilliant futuristic
touch the audio bike also has LED lights
built into the front of the handlebar a
built-in Android smartphone app serves
as an electronic control system for the
bike not just monitoring battery in
speed but a host of other useful
functions including the ability to
toggle through five cycling modes
unfortunately for now the only bike is
just the counts of prototype and no
announcements have been made about all
these plans to bring it to market
number five trifecta DRTV bike designed
primarily for military use the DRT
treads the blur in line between an
electric bicycle and an electric four
kilowatt motor powered motorcycle the
electric bike is capable of hitting over
40 miles per hour equipped with a
handlebar system with built in Wi-Fi a
compatible iOS app and Bluetooth
connectivity designed to differentiate
itself from other e-bikes the trifecta
has military inspired design wrapped in
metal and carbon fiber the rider
controls ride mode and other settings by
a computer mounted at the center of the
handlebars they can also use the
computer to choose between automatic
gear shifting and electronic gear
selection and to control settings of
both of the suspension port and the rear
shock the computer also delivers the
usual trip functions showing speed
battery life distance and other
important data
the trifecta is powered by a 60 volt
lithium ion unit stored inside a
lockable compartment the battery can
provide enough juice from up to six to
two miles of range without any pedaling
and the charges in about three hours
when plugged in the dr T's braking
system can regenerate power in a similar
way to that of the kinetic energy
recovery system in Formula one cars
