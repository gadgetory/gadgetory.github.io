send and receive messages browse through
news feeds track fitness stats and much
more all directly on my wrist all on
itself here's a pocket screen much like
a mouse a keyboard or a monitor this
pocket screen is simply an interface for
my hub it's not very smart it doesn't
need to be if I need a bigger screen I
can grab a tab screen or i can plug it
into this keyboard if i want to be more
productive i can even use this dongle to
turn any existing TV into another screen
for my wrist now that i'm always using
the same computing hub I can start an
application on one screen and seamlessly
continue it on another if I lose a
screen no worries it has none of my
personal stuff and because these screens
are inexpensive and can be everywhere
all I ever need to carry is my hump
the monolith is the easiest to use and
most intuitive electric skate ever
created this new emerging market
lightweight electric skates under 15
pounds is a pretty exciting new frontier
it transforms your errands on a weekend
or running to this corner store to pick
up vegetables into an activity that you
look forward to and do all the exact
same things that you do on a traditional
longboard skateboard except now you've
got the power to go up a hill at 20
miles an hour the spans of longboarding
and electric gates we kept having issues
with the existing boards on the market
they were heavy they look bad with their
external motors and batteries and the
belts would break down and you can't
push it we'll ride it like a real estate
board that's why we've created an
entirely new technology and it's called
man to drive for the first time ever
we've actually put a motor inside the
wheel of a skateboard this is allowed us
to create a powered skateboard that
feels smooth intuitive and makes the
model if amazingly easy to use yet
powerful
my name is 07 esky I'm one of the
founder and the many ingenuity Lord Theo
nipon action sports athletes our entire
lives we actually met me response about
the same brand you know from speed
flying to paragliding surfing skating we
love these sports because of the
feelings that created us and that's in
large part due to feel the board with
the monoliths in order to create the
highest performance product everything
every aspect of the design had to become
customer the mental drive technology has
allowed us to get rid of the external
motor and break down instead of having a
motor outside of the wheel that turns a
belt and that belt turns a gear in the
neck he returns a wheel everything's
already been integrated inside the wheel
itself so one it looks really clean but
two because there's nothing that's
binding the wheel up once you hit your
top speed you just glide and you get
that coast that's what you get with a
normal skate that's what we wanted to
create with removal of the external
belts and years we've been able to
reduce the weight significantly to
create such a foil thinking product we
knew we had to build a for thinking team
a team of action sports athletes is
engineering and product design skills to
manifest and innovative product
monolith is the only board on the market
with swappable battery packs what this
means that you essentially have a
limited range as soon as you start to
run low on one battery you can just swap
the old for the new so in designing and
boards reflex remote we wanted to focus
mainly on comfort and secondly on
usability and then storage so using this
remote should be completely effortless
so we took a different approach with the
remote design the reflex has a
forward-facing tail this feature will
give the rider a sense of security you
can adjust or even open your hand while
riding and when you close it it'll be
right where you need it to control the
board again in keeping with imports
future for product design we've added
auxiliary USB ports onto the board you
can use this for charging remote or if
you're at the beach and you know the Sun
setting your phone just ran out of
battery you can charge your phone so you
can get that one last snapshot our
mobile app gives you complete control of
the electric skate experience it allows
you to customize your speeds
accelerations connect with other riders
and even recap on your latest session
if you're new to Electric skateboards
our beginner mode makes the monolith
very easy to get going for the first
time in addition our advanced and custom
settings allow the user to realize the
full potential and power of the board
we spent years developing this
technology and now we're ready to bring
it to manufacturing but we wouldn't be
here on Kickstarter if we didn't need
your help with your support will be able
to invest in the custom molds and
tooling to bring the model at the market
we can't wait for you to shape the
future of electric space
I can't wait for you to shape the future
of electric skates you can't wait for
you to shape the future of a PhD
my funny Valentine is this a gramophone
if not what else can it be maybe a
projector or even a home theater with
boundless edge meet the XG me z4 Aurora
the world's first smart heater it is
able to turn your wall into a theater in
seconds and deliver you an ultimate home
theater just plug it in connect it to
your Wi-Fi and you'll be able to stream
your favorite shows from Netflix Hulu
and any other Android supported services
with up to 300 inches giant screen and
700 ANS I lumens the Aurora supports
1080p and 4k picture quality output so
it's compatible with the latest game
systems airplay and Android apps
the Aurora also has built-in customized
Harman Kardon crystal stereo you'll get
high quality sound and incredible
listening experience
the z4 Aurora can also project in 3d
with this function you'll see incredible
images leaping out of your wall where
adopters are ultra ard illumination
which mixes a picture brighter and the
clearer in screens up to 300 inches we
also use high-capacity resizer to
support various functions likes my hand
gesture control 3d movies commercial
wireless pictures synchronization and
the keystone correction
there's not always a perfect place for
your projector so we built the Aurora
with keystone correction software you
can get a straight on image even if
you're projecting from any angle most of
us used to work for traditional TV
company we know that the widescreen
innovations in the market are too heavy
and too expensive so we went to produce
empo smarter under football widescreen
TV with just you man after two years
developing and more than hundred atem of
15 we finally make out the repo Aurora
we have already disabled not positive
feedback we hope that more people I John
us to change the way we watch and sings
and the you at the part of our team
project what are you our imagination

hi I'm Laura Enzo our robotic
engineering student and a commuter every
day I take the train going to my
University it takes me one and a half
hour of walking every single day really
too much time I think a lot of you are
in the same situation and we all know
that commuting is both stressful and
time-consuming this made me think how to
move more quickly and with less effort
and get something portable that I could
carry on train and even in class for
this reason I created both there's more
less and lightest electric vehicle in
the world both is more than just an
electric board is the most portable
vehicle out there it's an amazing mean
of transport powerful lightweight easy
to use as marked as more great
revolution in the world of mobility
ball to let you save time on your daily
commute and three more for your favorite
activities it has a top speed of 21 km/h
in this just as fast as a bicycle it is
a range of about 10 kilometer more than
what you need for the short daily
commuting the city with a length of 60
centimeters is the smallest electric
skateboard in the world with a weight of
four kilograms is light enough to be
carried even when not in use with no
effort on your backpack or by hand to
build the balls I got help from my
father a photographer electronics
engineer and drones maker after one year
of prototyping and testing this is the
final version the battery and
electronics are embedded in the wooden
body he has a powerful motor of 2,000
watts of power and it can go up ill and
start from a full stop the inside
batteries are so powerful that can
recharge your devices on the go to the
built-in USB port you can even recharged
completely your iPhone up to 20 times
with the remote controller rising bolt
is easiest playing a video game whoa I
see thank you well it's Italian design
bolt is both modern and practical and
it's deck is of the right size for a
comfortable and safe landing it also has
the brake to stop safely you can think
bought like a compact longboard he has a
larger track for more stability he has
bigger wheels to overcome every obstacle
on the street both is marked with
bluetooth for connectivity we are going
to develop a smartphone app and also
integrate it with wearables fold as
extremely low running costs and let you
save money on fewer a complete Richard
for an entire year will be less than
five dollars on the build and when the
Sun Goes Down turn on the lights and
continue to skate we believe that
everyone deserves a better way to move
we want to make both the most affordable
for anyone but to cut down costs we need
an economy of scale our manufacturers
are ready but now we need your help
start production of both that's why
we're here on IndieGoGo if you like the
project please tell your friends and
support us to receive amazing perks
thank you
