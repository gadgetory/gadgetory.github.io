experience as it really is missing
important moments and crucial details
but this is about to change forever

of variables to calculate the perfect
settings for your photo this ensures
your photos are always beautifully
exposed

revolutionary feature called high-speed
mode when active built in high speed
sensors can trigger a photo
instantaneously as soon as he is a noise

like when you fire a party popper or
smash a glass or even what a tomato

bullet the capture case has been
designed to make photos better for
uploading this means that your great
times can be enjoyed forever by you and
your friends our mission is to give you
the equipment you need to take your
iPhone photography to the next level we
design the capital case to be easy to
use but powerful enough to unlock
completely new creative possibilities
we've been working on the catcher case
but over 18 months and its development
has been continually driven by user
feedback this has helped us push the
limits and smartphone photography we
have been working with the team of
electrical engineers and manufacturing
companies in the UK to bring the capture
case to life the capture case is now
ready to begin manufacture we have come
to Kickstarter because we need your help
to buy tooling and produce the first
production room we realize that many of
you may be upgrading to the new iphone 7
scene that is why if you back us today
you'll receive a free upgrade to the new
iphone 7 capture case as soon as you are
ready and it is available so join us
buck us today and you'll be one of the

hi Kickstarter my name is Jason Guzman
and I want to share with you the izze
orbit the orbit is fabricated from a
high-quality aircraft grade aluminum
providing a lightweight yet durable
outer layer which surrounds the form
sitting in a protective sleeve the slave
also functions as a stylish standalone
case and fits snugly into the back of
the orbit providing dual layer
protection the izze orbit features a
sure hand stabilizing grip which reduces
handshake and enable the camera operator
to shoot steadier video even when you're
filming moving objects the order
requires no assembly and is ready to use
in seconds simply place the protective
sleeve over the phone
snap it into the back of the orbit
and you are ready to go using peripheral
motion lock technology the izze orbit
gives you instant access to three
high-quality optical lenses in a
convenient all in one package simply
rotate the orbit to select the lens you
want to use you are ready to shoot
fisheye wide-angle telephoto
whether you are shooting a music video
capturing memories of a family vacation
or just looking to take your mobile
photography to the next level the izze
will enhance your expression
he is e orbit is extremely versatile and
allows for dramatic perspectives and the
dependable performance demanded by the
most ambitious iphone photographers and
videographers easy gadgets is proud to
offer kickstarter-funded their choice of
two models for the iphone 4 and 4s the
is the orbit and the is e solo the is e
solo is a single lens counterpart of the
orbit in most all of its amenities minus
the peripheral motion lock technology
the is e solo comes standard with a
fisheye lens additional lens is sold
separately we are also awaiting the
release of the iphone 5 and will have
orbits and solos available for them a
few weeks after the release so
Kickstarter's we're counting on you it
takes a lot of time and money to develop
and launch these products with your
pledge will be able to invest in the
machinery tooling and the park inventory
needed to set up a small manufacturing
operation here in the United States
thanks again for checking out our
project hello Kickstarter's I'm Patrick
O'Neill and I'm Chong pack we're here to
show you our project the olloclip it's a
double sided lens converter for the
iphone 4 that you can slip into your
pocket here's a video of the little clip

I
I've always had speech
I always say yes and I should say no I
go stop them where I should go
I never ever the people
before I know
kill the cat but I don't care about
Annie
ha
something
close to know
makes my curiosity
I need to shoot so as you saw in the
video the olloclip slips on to the
corner of your iPhone changing its field
of view allowing you to capture more of
the scene this is great neither still or

thank you and have a great day
years ago the world of photography
cherished forever and since then it
hasn't stopped for a second this April
we're returning to Kickstarter to drive
it another step forward imagine total
control over your iPhone's camera like
never before with no less than five
external buttons just like a real DSLR
imagine a more comfortable and safer
grip protecting pictures one-handed even
with gloves imagine connecting it to
real camera accessories unleash the
power of your iPhone's camera for better
pictures time after time picked our DSLR
your iPhone so let's take a closer look
at some of picked ours more exciting
features the first and most important is
letting the iphone's camera live up to
its full potential victor offers no less
than five external buttons for
controlling the iphone's camera the
multi-state electronic shutter button is
calibrated for maximum sensitivity just
like high-end cameras a half press on
the shutter button locks the focus and
exposure to allow tracking of a moving
object or to compose the perfect shot
pressing all the way will result in an
immediate shot want to take control to
the next level just press on the center
of the screen and live the circle
anywhere you want to measure lighting at
the front of the grip is the zoom ring
turn it to zoom into the subject or out
pressing this ring will let you toggle
between the front and back camera for
the coolest selfies ever and what's the
most cool about picked our is that it
lets you take pictures with one hand
leaving your other hand for other
important things now let's move up to
the exposure compensation wheel which
gives complete control over the exposure
simply by turning it right or left
increments are by f-stop values just
like in any DSLR this button can truly
open up a whole new world of playing
with light the last button is the smart
wheel same as all other controls it's
also fully programmable with the pict
our app that comes with the device you
decide which parameters you want to
control in default mode the smart wheel
controls the photo modes such as sport
portrait snow and more but this can
easily be changed to manual mode and
many other options picked our app is the
turbo engine driving picked our forward
develop it we teamed up with a great app
company which gave it maximum ease of
use the app is operated by a patented
ultrasonic frequency system which offers
low power consumption of both picked our
and the iphone compared to standard
bluetooth connection picked our design
is inspired by classic DSLR cameras when
you hold it you'll feel right at home
thanks to the ergonomic body coated with
non-slip material victor is designed for
a steady one handed grip without
compromising on the compact feel of
taking pictures with a smartphone and it
even works with gloves victor comes with
a comfy wristband to keep it secured and
also a padded case to keep it safe in
your bag a standard one quarter inch
connector on the bottom lets you connect
any tripod for extra creative shots and
a cold shoe connector on top is useful
for many lighting devices picked our is
compatible with iphone models from 4 to
6 s and is designed to suit future
models too when it's time to upgrade it
also makes sharing a single pic dar to
be super easy and fun oh yeah and
there's US team me go and this is our
third time we're on Kickstarter after we
brought to market thanks to you more
than 10 products the Nick photography a
lot more fun and simple to develop
picked are we put together a winning
team that includes product designers app
developers and techies who worked
together for a year to make this dream
come true
dear backers returning to you again and
asking for your support to bring picked
our to market join us picked on DSLR
your iPhone
imagine being able to see the world from
the perspective of an insect being able
to get into places you never thought you
could before exploring new wildernesses
solving new problems getting a better
understanding of yourself that's what we
had in mind when we created scoop around
scope around is a unique video camera
that can get into places that know their
camera can get into with three different
adjustable heads for different uses the
flexible the fit and the focus the
flexible is equipped with a camera just
4.5 millimeters in diameter helping you
get into tight spaces the fit uses a
macro lens meaning it can get as close
as one centimeter to an object and the
focus has a 150 to one's own for
microscopic use all with ultra digital
clarity or founder James had a vision of
bringing medical grade technology to
consumers I've been designing in the
scope for over five years moving
thousands of cameras from scratch to be
used for medical purposes in the stu
preferences and more then that sounds
why not build a camera that this for
personal use there's so many ways a
consumer can benefit from it
we want you to think of ways to change
the lives of mothers fathers and
children we talked to over 300 consumers
in order to find places where people
wish they could see from that point
really perfected each camera now I
believe we have built something really
cool it's pretty awesome I could see
tight spaces underneath the hood I was
trying to find the origin of an oil leak
I mean normally I'd have to put on
grubby clothes get it under the car take
everything apart to try and find it but
with the scope around I was able to get
into those tight spaces and it just made
my day much easier so I'm gonna take
this one with me is that all right I get
a keep this one right I loved it
actually it was really nice I was able
to check my teeth see if I had any
cavities or evening something stuck in
there I was also able to check my pores
which was interesting because not many
products out there allow you to do that
I would say my favorite part about this
is that he gets to see things about
yourself that you've never seen before
and it's really cool
scope around is ultra simple to use it
comes with the body and three easily
interchangeable heads you just pop one
in pop it out and you connect it to your
Wi-Fi so you can see everything on your
phone or your iPad it turns on with a
single button and you press the button
again to just for light intensity and it
records directly to your phone so you
can upload and share anywhere very
easily scope around was designed to look
elegant and sleek the device consists of
a highly integrated circuit so we were
able to make it very small and compact
the camera is also waterproof which
makes it perfect for inside pipes or
down a drain we are also the first in
the world to integrate a 1080p
high-definition camera that's only four
point five millimeters in diameter we're
thinking this is going to revolutionize
a lot of different fields a new way to
learn a new way to work and your way to
see yourself any way to see the world
after all the research were now done and
we've decided to start with you the
Kickstarter community we're ready to
start production all we need is your
support
