oh we're on
oh I didn't see you there it came to
watch me work did you my name is Evelyn
what we expected on East Ark never mind
all that let's get to work
oh you're curious what it is I do well
simply put I am a fresh air guide that
always directs you to areas with healthy
air quality hmm you still look confused
all right I'll show you now all of you
watch what you eat and even ensure the
water you drink is safe but why is it
that none of you seem to care about the
air you breathe every second of every
day wake up and smell the fumes don't
you think that breathing air like this
would affect your health but like I was
saying Catherine I'm detecting harmful
levels of no.2 straight ahead turn right
turn right
see that now that's what I call personal
guidance
thanks to my embedded electrochemical
sensors I can detect it under 20 parts
per billion all in real time and look
how pretty my design is simple elegant
sleek and I know why they call me Evelyn
Catherine reporting temperature at 70
degrees and humidity level at 20% and Oh
UV levels are dangerously high whoa
looking good Catherine is that suntan
lotion helped also I ain't no dummy I
can analyze countless amounts of
pollution data and organize it for you
all on one easy-to-use map on the blink
of an eye don't believe me really I can
watch my brain get to work I'm
especially a good companion for asthma
patients and people with weaker immune
systems such as kids the elderly
athletes researchers and just about
everyone who wants to breathe fresh
quality air with my powerful battery you
can take me with you all day long one
charge allows for up to 72 hours of use
I'll keep it short
I am the no.2 oh three UV temperature
and humidity level sensing pollution of
data analyzing aggregate all that data
to create a pollution map making Evelyn
that wasn't sure was it and just
remember this
I am the personal portable an Oso smart
one of a kind
fresh air guide
Wow you're still here I'd love to chat
but I think this is adios for now please
check out the campaign for more details
can't wait to meet you soon
sound sound is everywhere there is no
accurate count for how many sounds an
average person hears any other day a
Dorado audio we understand that sound is
what inspires us motivates us drives us
and connects us introducing the Apollo 7
the world's most compact true wireless
earphone we just wanted to make
something that just made sense we wanted
to create an earphone a completely
wireless earphone that delivered
incredible sound the Apollo 7 earphones
come in a sleek aluminum case with a
built-in lithium battery that makes it
easy and convenient to store as well as
charge on the go see you'll never run
out of power no matter where your day
takes you these earphones are ready to
go they're coated with a nano
waterproofing technology that makes them
perfect for any situation as an athlete
I absolutely love the Apollo 7 not only
are they waterproof they're Wireless
true Wireless meaning no wires involved
at all and they're very small and
compact and they fit in the ear
incredibly comfortably and I've done
products for monster and beats and the
Apollo 7 is truly innovative
well-thought-out design and excellent
execution it's a lot of times you get a
wireless Bluetooth headset and you still
haven't an outside box and this wires
all over the place I can't stand wires
I've gone through like I said several
pairs of headphones are just like
garbage the Bluetooth like it just
doesn't doesn't sound good at all you're
sacrificing a lot usually when you go to
a small earbud and these just sound
awesome it sounded really really good
that's my favorite part about them so
it's brilliant
you have the carrying case has wireless
charging essentially where you dropped
the earpieces in and then there's a
battery in the case you don't have to
find an outlet to plug it in and charge
it so this is an all-day solution
we wanted to keep the Apollo 7 easy and
intuitive with its single button
features you'll be able to take a call
skip tracks control volume activate
Google now or even talk to Siri we also
built an omnidirectional microphone for
the Apollo 7 because we know how
important it is to have a crisp
hands-free solution for taking calls on
the go support us now and be one of the
first to experience true wireless audio
the way it should be
Apollo 7 by erato audio

hi I love giving gifts I love giving
gifts at the holidays for birthdays but
what I don't like is wrapping gifts I
don't like getting on the floor chasing
my paper having the roll of paper roll
back up on me while I'm trying to wrap
it or get stuck under something I'm
Britt workman and that's why I invented
wrap buddies wrap buddies come in two
pieces and they attach on either side of
a roll of gift wrap clipping it to the
side of a table they break down for easy
storage simply unscrew the post that
holds the gift wrap in place and you can
store them with the rest of your gift
wrapping supplies we're bringing these
to Kickstarter because while I can
produce them using 3d printing
technology in small quantities it
doesn't scale well we need you to help
us produce injection molds that we can
use to make them in high quantities so
that we can fulfill our Kickstarter
backers and give them into retail stores
as well for every pledge we will send
you a pair of rapid E's in your choice
of several colors and you will know that
you have helped us achieve our goal of
bringing these to the market the hardest
part of giving gifts should not be the
gift wrapping so wrap fast
wrap fun wrap buddies
you
home security shouldn't be complicated
or frustrating it should be
inconspicuous
easy to install and easy to use and it
should be reliable
that's what glo-bo stands for a modular
and flexible system to protect and to
monitor your home and the things you
love even when you're not at home our
idea developing low vo was to create a
fully working alarm system with a
functional range far above conventional
systems but at a fraction of its price
the globe U app turns your smartphone or
tablet into a full-fledged alarm control
unit by using its camera its microphone
and various sensors hidden inside in
combination with the members of the
global family which are equipped with
additional sensors your device becomes a
modular monitoring and remote control
system when an alarm is triggered you
will be informed by email SMS phone call
or video message that way glo-bo makes
your smart phone become your permanent
eye on everything in your home no matter
if you are at work or anywhere else
logo monitors not only motion and
vibration but also temperature air
pressure and air humidity
glo-bo is also an anti-theft protection
if you install it on your bike or on any
other movable property you will not only
get a warning if someone unauthorized
moves it but the serial number will be
sent to the cloud giving you a better
chance of getting it back
moreover glo-bo is a telecom anding tool
which can improve your personal safety
take your global with you and start an
instant emergency call in case of a
threat
we the global team have been working on
this product for two years now we
combining a lot of skills and
backgrounds
we designed the global to be as simple
and small as possible or moreover sleek
and good-looking
the handling is super easy and thanks to
the magnetic mount is really installed
in no time the global app is compatible
with all US and Android devices so far
with about 1 million downloads in the
Google Play Store and that shows us that
we are on the right track concerning
usability and convenience of the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
