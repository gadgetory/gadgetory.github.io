9 and s 9 plus are undoubtedly the best
available Samsung smartphones at the
moment but apparently they're not smart
enough for people to buy them anymore as
a result of the disappointment rumors
say that Samsung has new big plans for
2019
instead of redesigning remodeling
reselling the exact same phones with
different sugarcoating this time we
might finally see a new breakthrough the
Galaxy S 10 a South Korean financial
news site the Bell recently issued a new
report that might be the first one to
reveal some key details about the Galaxy
S 10 let's see what we might expect
Samsung tends to use code names for
upcoming phones that describe their
goals the codename beyond chosen for the
Galaxy S 10 suggests that Samsung's
plans include AI features big upgrades
significant hardware changes and
capabilities that are beyond anything on
the market at the moment we are a little
bit skeptical Samsung couldn't even
overcome their current manufacturing
issues to include an N display
fingerprint sensor according to sources
Samsung wants to include the secure 3d
face scanning feature and the Galaxy S
10 just like the face ID feature Apple
introduced on the iPhone X and they are
working really hard to develop the
software that would be needed to enable
3d face scanning apparently they
couldn't and they still have many other
issues so the galaxy s 10 might not
include this option at all we're still
hoping with fingers crossed and beyond
