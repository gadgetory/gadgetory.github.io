and welcome to latest tank vehicle
pursuits are one of the most dangerous
aspects of law enforcement getting in
front of a speeding vehicle to deploy
tire spikes is dangerous and even if all
four tires are successfully deflated the
vehicle retains the ability to travel
with the possibility to injure and kill
someone unpredictable and cost the
financial exposure can be reduced if the
chase has ended quickly here are four
inventions that show how new technology
can prevent deadly police pursuits
number one grappler the grappler has a
total of two switches located inside the
cab the first switch extends a wheel
locking net and the second switch
releases the tether strap completely
from the pursuit vehicle before or after
net deployment at the officers
discretion with the use of a net one
officer has the ability to quickly end
the chase from the security of their
vehicle number two Nighthawk spike
strips the world's first remotely
launched and retracted police stop
sticks stop vehicles faster better and
safer easier to maneuver than hand
thrown units
Nighthawks dual button remote operates
up to hundred feet away while deploying
a string of spike strips
keeping the officers safe and out of
harm's way
and fast less than two seconds to deploy
and the same for retraction number three
star chase a compressed air launcher
mounted behind the grille of a police
cruiser uses a laser to target the
fleeing vehicle it deploys a GPS tag
this patch views location and movements
of the tag vehicle in real-time on a
secure web-based mapping portal through
the efficient use of technology a
high-speed chase is replaced with a safe
interdiction technology once a suspect
is tagged a high-risk event is
transformed to a safer control event for
all involved
number four arrest net arrest net
deploys a high-strength net into the
pathway of a target vehicle allowing the
operator to non-lethal the end the
pursuit the system is equipped with
barbed spikes that penetrate tires which
then causes a high-strength net to
entangle the front wheels of the vehicle
resulting in a safe and controlled
stoppage as the vehicle drives over the
net the net is pulled from its folded
condition and wraps around the front
tires to lock the wheels thereby
arresting the vehicle in a safe and
controlled manner hit that like button
