first portable pull-up bar that could be
changed for dips within seconds all in
one device in addition you can do a lot
of other exercises like leg raises or
muscle ups to extend your bodyweight
workout it can be attached to trees or
poles of different diameters and solves
all your problems in crowded parks when
you can't do pull-ups on football goals
you can also use a resistance band for
support during your exercises and if the
weather is too bad it allows you to
workout indoors as well without
installing a permanent pull-up bar but
now let's have a closer look at how
pull-up and tip brings your bodyweight
workout to the next level store it away
when not needed and easily assemble it
within a single set break the indoor
adapter is fixed to the wall and thin
enough to hide it with a picture just
insert pull-up and dip into the indoor
adapter with the screwless plug-in
system and you're ready to go to switch
from pull-ups to dips simply turn it
around 180 degrees you can do both
exercises with the same multi bar
it's nice weather and you prefer outdoor
workouts no problem the complete outdoor
package of pull-up and dip fits into a
standard backpack and can be carried to
your favorite location
every component is made out of stainless
steel to be rust proof and durable the
outdoor package includes a tree
protection the adjustable outdoor
adapter and attention valve to tighten
everything against the tree or a pole
simply insert the sidearm and the two
bars and pull up and dip is ready to use
in less than 2 minutes
the multi bar offers in many different
grip positions for pull-ups creating
various angles in order to work on
multiple muscles in your back arms and
shoulders for dips you don't have to
lower the position of the adapter as the
incline design provides a perfect height
for both exercises the v-shape of the
multi bar enables a narrow or wider grip
hi Kickstarter I'm Michele and I'm
Johannes and we are both from Munich in
Germany and the inventors of pull up and
did the idea of pull-up and dip
we had about one and a half years ago
when our outdoor work application was
closed during the Oktoberfest and we
didn't have the possibility to do
pull-ups there anymore so that's why we
started to create this product and after
many prototypes and a lot of testing and
adjustments on them we finished the
prototype development so now very soon
we want to go to serial production but
now we need your support we already have
invested a lot of time and money in
prototypes and want to bring pull-up and
dip in serial production to realize this
project we need your support so that we
can bring pull up and dip to you thank
you for watching our video and your
support we would also really appreciate
it if you could share our video with
your workout friends we are looking
forward to offer you a great product
that will improve your indoor and
outdoor workout please support us now
thank you Kickstarter
what's up kid status my name is maritza
juvenilia and I'm the founder of scuba
tank
my boyfriend Armand and I have been
enjoying watersports and especially
pedaling for quite some years now but
I'm always worried to take our kids with
us because fast changing weather
conditions can make a fast return to
shore quite difficult
those started searching for an electric
motor to use with our equipment such as
then a pedal or a canoe but it was
impossible for me to find a small light
and flexible solution for this reason I
asked I mean if you could build such a
gadget and the idea of scuba jet was
born
for the past two years I mean and the
surrogate who has excellent know-how in
software and technical engineering
developed this quartet and also tested
it extensively
during the development we have used
scuba jet regularly and had so much fun
together with the kids we have met many
people on our trips who were very
excited about scuba jet too often these
been asked where a motor can be bought
last year we have decided to make the
scuba jet ready for mass production and
extended their adapter system different
adapters give you the possibility to use
the scuba chat for almost any waters
product with mental scuba tread terms
your aquatic equipment into fast
comfortable and reliable devices
today we are ready for mass production
and their tour started this Kickstarter
campaign
we hope you are excited about our
product and help us to make scuba touch
a reality by the end of this year
working smarter having more information
giving more information that is what
excites us about civil card we have
taken the ordinary paper business card
and made it smart we patented the
technology to print a USB Drive on
regular paper and now we've applied that
technology to a business card so how
does swivel card work each card has a
unique ID and can be individually
programmed you can setup each card to
open any webpage you want and you can
change which page the card points to
even after giving it out since the data
is stored on the web you have virtually
unlimited storage and can do some pretty
exciting things you could connect the
card to a Dropbox account or to a join
me meeting invitation or to a desktop
sharing application the possibilities
are only limited by your imagination
Silvo card also includes a back-end
interface with very helpful analytics
about your cards you'll be able to log
in and see where your cards are in the
world and other helpful statistical
information right down to the individual
card there's also a QR code on the back
to ensure that if someone doesn't have a
USB port they can still access the card
with their smart device
so why Kickstarter we've already done a
ton of work developing civic art this
project will help us meet one final goal
developing the backend software
interface
the backend is functional but we want to
add features we want to make it more
powerful we want to make it more
visually appealing oh yeah one more
thing did we mention that souville card
is wireless just bring your civil card
close to a compatible smart device and
the data will load automatically we know
that you are going to love these cards
imagine yourself being the most
talked-about person at your next event
simply because of the premium business
card you hold working smarter having
more information giving more information
help us make swivel card happen thank
you for your enthusiasm and support when
someone calls you you know whether you
answer it or not your phone is smart it
has caller ID but when someone knocks on
your door you don't answer it
what happens nothing your door is dumb
until now introducing people the first
device that provides caller ID for your
home
simply attach it to your door people and
download the app no wires no mess people
is easy to install doesn't require
subscription and is less expensive than
a home security system it's even easier
to attach to glass doors never miss a
delivery
keep track of your offspring people will
also tell you when your door has opened
or closed
screen your visitors
or use it to make sure you don't miss
that repair guy
you can also use it for Halloween
have a log of suspicious visitors in the
neighborhood people can alert you for so
many reasons
refrigerator repair AC maintenance Girl
Scouts Boy Scouts little kids comics and
much much more
but what is the secret behind the
miracle of people my name is Chris and
we invented people when my
three-year-old escaped the house I had
no idea he left but I should have you
see your front door is a blind spot and
we have the solution but we can't do it
without your help
here's how people works people is a CMOS
camera attached to a 32-bit ARM
controller a magnetometer and
accelerometer will wake up the camera
and processor and send images to the
cloud when there is a knock or door open
or close you will get a notification on
your phone and that will tell you
whether you need to answer the door or
ignore it
your door is no longer a blind spot
satisfy your security people the caller
ID for your front door get yours today
air pollution is ranked among the most
serious and widespread health hazards in
the world and it exists all around us
most is not visible to the human eye
every day we breathe in dirty air it
goes deep into our lungs and passes into
our blood dust soot smoke air pollution
causes chronic conditions like asthma
and bronchitis and contributes to deadly
illnesses like cancer and heart disease
government-run air quality monitoring
stations are expensive and coverage is
farce so the network doesn't accurately
measure personal exposure to air
pollution as no one knows what they are
breathing in how can we expect things
will ever change after three years of
research and development six prototypes
later technology now exists that you can
use that is being used and is proven to
accurately detect the quality of the air
you are breathing in in real time and
share it with thousands of other people
already using the air casting platform
this is the air beat an Arduino powered
portable palm-sized
air quality monitor that measures fine
particulate matter
also known as PM 2.5 imagine how the
world might change when we can each
accurately measure the amount of air
pollution we are breathing in at any
given moment the air beam is part of a
larger movement and platform we called
air casting thousands of people are
already using it
the platform connects a series of
wearable devices to a network and was
built as an open-source end to end
solution for collecting displaying and
sharing health and environmental data
using your smartphone we even developed
an LED accessory called the light beam
to visualize the measurements from the
air beam or other air casting connected
sensors by documenting and leveraging
health and environmental data to inform
personal decision making and public
policy the air casting platform empowers
citizen scientists and changemakers like
you and me to take matters into our own
hands but in order for us to make change
we need more changemakers to join our
movement that's where you come in
everything we've built and hardware
software as an open source the
possibilities for expanding their
casting platform are truly limitless
because we're not here to tell you what
to do with technology we're to tell you
about the air beam and air casting and
hope to the guiding your imaginations
today the majority of people using air
casting have built their own monitors by
funding this campaign backers will
enable habitat map the nonprofit behind
air casting to mass-produce devices and
get them into the hands of people that
want them we are very excited to be
working with some of the most creative
and bright citizens scientists
developers makers and activists we hope
you will join our movement towards
cleaner cities when we say it starts
with you we mean it the question is what
will you build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
