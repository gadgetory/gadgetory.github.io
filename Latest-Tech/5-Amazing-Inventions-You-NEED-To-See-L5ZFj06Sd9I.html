by the concept of travel is
transitioning transformation the floaty
suitcase is both beautiful and extremely
functional by combining superior
materials innovative features and the
unix time where need is
something that makes me feel good and
all my traveling I don't care if it's
for business or ification I usually put
my handbag on top of the suitcase and
tried to hold it together with a
suitcase handle but it always slips down
the floaty handbag locking is designed
to carry bags and coats of any size and
shape the retractable strap and recess
top scientists have to hold your items
securely no matter how you move etapa
suitcase and this release you from the
stress of holding multiple items at the
same time I was using a four-wheel
suitcase that sometimes got pretty
dragging on the road and the noise
embarrassed me a lot but with the new
protein wheels things got a lot better
floaty is the world's first suitcase
with innovative suspension system
features smooth vulnerabilities for both
pushing and pulling motions impacts and
vibrations are absorbed and neutralized
a custom-designed humble offering a
great handling even on bumpy surface I
use my phone when I'm walking with my
suitcase but it can be a bit annoying
the smart handle is immediate and some
free access to your phone you can make
calls large maps and send messages just
by tapping just
it is designed to help you focus or
where you're going I travel with my
laptop tablet and of course my phone and
having a way to charge them on the go is
definitely a lifesaver the detachable
laptop charger can charge iPhone up to 7
times or macbook for 1.5 times allows
you to take all your electronics to
security check effortlessly I once left
my travel wallet in the hotel but
luckily they called me back to pick it
up you will never lose your belongings
with floaty targets are designed to work
seamlessly platia providing a non stop
loss prevention to the enjoy
overweighted yeah that happened to be a
few times and sometimes they let you
pass sometimes nothing helpful and
understated the building scale shows the
weight of your luggage only with them if
I know how much I have on the skill i'm
sure i will use every single best friend
i cant estyn those pouches onto the
lining so that everything in my suitcase
stays clean tidy and well organized the
concept of transition is in the variety
of materials the other shell made by
Cody polycarbonate with recess aluminum
inserts make the floaty suitcase
extremely durable and lightweight when
the genuine leather trims offer a great
sense of touch personalized handle and
time that great meeting at identity to
your suitcase they also have your
floating to stand out the suitcase for
me is more than just the case that carry
stuff from place to place it's pretty
like a big handbag it's very important
for me how it feels how it looks how it
smells is part of my Luke and the most
important part of the suitcase for me
handle because that's the part i touch
close kate is making coffee opens the
office fridge and realizes raw used all
the milk for his cereal Mike's coworker
keeps turning off the air conditioner
even though it is 90 degrees outside
these sucky moments are part of life if
only there was one simple solution to
all of them meet brick saw an awesome
version of building blocks that bring
your designs to life it will not solve
any of these problems but you'd be
surprised at how it totally makes you
forget them brick so has three types of
blocks connectors action blocks and
trigger blogs use the connectors to
create a circuit then embed the action
blocks to give your design light or
movement now you can use the trigger
blocks to control your design with sound
proximity and light and brick so can
also be controlled remotely it means you
can connect your design to your phone or
even to the internet and do all kinds of
if this then that cool stuff plus you
can use the battery block to keep it
running it works faster than prozac it's
cheaper than a psychologist and it's
better than shutting out civilization
and living on a deserted island you can
also use brick so to upgrade designs
made with regular building blocks and
make them 10 times cooler no wires
needed all break so block components are
built in brick so is also a good
educational tool for your kids but know
that they'll forever mark regular
building blocks wells and Amir have been
working on brick so for a long time
they're both physicists and they know a
thing or two about electricity so if you
like building stuff and don't mind
getting addicted support them some
problems just aren't meant to be solved
now you can forget about them with
bricks aw
it's time the real estate industry kept
pace hi I'm jr. founder of tour
technologies and I'd like to introduce
you to the tour a smart more effective
way to search schedule and access
properties however you want whenever you
want imagine a real estate solution that
works for everyone everywhere with the
press of a button buyers and agents can
request showings in real time to tour
your property no more middleman or
delayed approvals sellers and listing
agents can control access times down to
the minute while receiving notifications
that include showing requests and when
users access the lockbox making the tour
lockbox the most secure on the market if
you're a buyer imagine being able to
tour a home alone with no pressure or
distractions truly giving you the
opportunity to see if the home is a good
fit tour is the first to offer buyers
this incredible experience unlike any
other before buyers now have access to
electronic lock boxes the same way
Realtors have exclusively for decades
giving buyers the freedom to see a
property in minutes as opposed to days
or weeks for all of the homeowners and
agents that require a licensed agent to
be present for all showing tour has you
covered as well simply control your
showing type and instructions using the
tour app and now buyers can just as
easily request nearby licensed agents to
show them a home giving sellers control
buyers an on-demand experience with
expert Realtors and agents a safe and
new way to meet potential clients
everybody wins
with over 14 years of experience in real
estate I've seen the needs of our
industry change tour gives agents and
brokers a new way to grow their business
while keeping up with technology and the
ever-changing market brokers can now
grow their brand and model to reflect
the needs of their community listing
agents can offer their cellars more
control and increase the number of
showings buyer agents can meet more
clients and showcase their expertise
tour gives agents an entirely new way to
serve their clients in turn business and
now sellers can have the luxury of
viewing detailed profiles of agents and
buyers they can send detail showing
instructions and times even monitor the
location of their keys for new agents
tour levels the playing field by giving
you an opportunity to meet buyers and
sellers face-to-face for experienced
agents tour gives you more leverage to
win more listings get more traffic while
working more sides of more deals all
while offering an unparalleled level of
customer service to today's client
allowing you to stay relevant as
technology continues to evolve tour is a
game-changing lockbox that brings this
outdated process into the 21st century
while maintaining the relationship
aspects that make it such an important
phase in everyone's life we believe in
our features we believe in our design
and quality but most of all we believe
that our timing is right and that the
market is ready for the next generation
real estate lockbox at tour we know
everyone has a role to play in this
process and our job is not to change the
people but to change the process I've
been a buyer a seller an agent and I am
a broker I create a tour to cater to the
needs of each user and if you believe in
this process back our campaign and help
bring it to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
