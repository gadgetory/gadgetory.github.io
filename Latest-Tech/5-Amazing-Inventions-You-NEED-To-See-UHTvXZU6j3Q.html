be a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump 36 but
even Ken feet high on but also take
anywhere you want to go the v4 is the
portable trampoline we'd always dreamed
up with the v4 you have the ability to
add a remove air and completely change
the stiffness of the bounce someone who
weighs 300 pounds can jump on the same
exact be4 as someone who only weighs 80
pounds all you need to do is change the
air pressure in less than a minute you
can perfectly tuned the v4 to each
writers preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family of fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy you
can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the b4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
downstairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again obstacles and
features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards are perfect for the v4 so
those of you looking for a fun way to
stay in shape the be four will work most
of the muscle groups in your body and
get your heart pounding immediately it's
a killer cardio workout and the best
part is that while you're having fun
bouncing around you won't even realize
how quickly you build a sweat in order
to achieve superior build quality and
maintain the high tolerance is necessary
for the v4 to work we manufacture and
assemble it right here in our Southern
California shop we work closely with our
suppliers to become a part of the build
process and as each component is made or
right there to test them
this streamlines are manufacturing and
ensures that every v4 we make is up to
our standards if you're looking for the
portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it join us and help change the
way pogo sticks racine forever

Betty is an app enabled alarm clock for
your smartphone but does so much more
than just wake you up for starters Betty
comes with multiple smart buttons that
allow you to control many devices around
your home like the lighting in your
bedroom Betty also includes two USB
ports so you can charge multiple devices
at night the betty has a fully off
feature that totally dims the clock face
so your room is completely dark at night
and since loud noises keep people up to
we also included a white noise maker
that helps peacefully drown out the loud
sounds of your city choose from settings
like rainy night or humming fan to help
you fall asleep but Betty doesn't just
help you go to sleep at night our
sunrise simulator feature gradually
brightens your room in the morning with
soft light gently stirring you awake
five minutes before your alarm goes off
and since Betty is connected to your
home we can talk to your Wemo switch to
prepare your coffee 10 minutes before
your alarm goes off or set your nest so
your place is warm and your coffee is
hot and ready for you when you wake up
and more than that rather than a jarring
buzzer alarm sound Betty comes a Spotify
integration so you can make your alarm
sound your favorite morning playlist but
he also gives you a quick glimpse at
your local weather so you can dress
appropriately for the day today's
weather is rainy and temperature is 68
degrees and even better Betty integrates
with the maps feature on your phone and
knows your morning commute so Betty will
periodically update you in the morning
as to exactly when you need to leave for
work based on your local current traffic
conditions you need to leave in 15
minutes and if you're a lover of the
sharing economy like we are we've also
integrated a OneTouch uber button into
Betty so you can call your uber straight
from bed and
Betty will inform you when it arrives
