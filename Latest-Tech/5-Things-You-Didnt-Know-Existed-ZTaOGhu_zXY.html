this is Luxa for an open source LED
indicator that works with a USB or
battery it shows your colleagues when
you are available for conversation and
when you're busy and shouldn't be
disturbed do you know that feeling when
you're trying to work and suddenly
everybody in the office feels they must
ask you something well we were so
familiar with this kind of situation
because we work in an open office it was
really disturbing as usually it took
time to get back to work before the Luxa
for we used to have flax cardboard signs
etc to make it clear to others that it's
no time for conversations but it's the
21st century so we came up with the idea
of an electronic indicator deluxe afore
works in two modes you can connect it to
your productivity app and it will show
your availability automatically or you
can set up the active mode which won't
let you miss an important message or
email all these activities will be
displayed by the indicator for user
convenience we've created two versions
of the Luxa for regular with a USB and
wireless with a rechargeable battery in
bluetooth for both devices include
magnets which make them easy to attach
to your computer or any other surface
