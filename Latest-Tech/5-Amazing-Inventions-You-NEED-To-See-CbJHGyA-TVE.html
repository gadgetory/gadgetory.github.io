first thing they do is look for their
hands
you
new from our experiences that time of
flight the same technology used in the
new connector is the only solution
robust enough for skeletal tracking of
the hands we've achieved a breakthrough
in the accuracy cost power consumption
for these types of sensors the nimble
sense comes with their skeletal hand
tracking software which will be
completely free for commercial use it's
tailored for PR but it's also flexible
enough to be mounted above your monitor
or on your desk our company consists of
four people who have been building hand
tracking and computer vision technology
for use they have PhDs from MIT Carnegie
Mellon and Berkeley and cut their teeth
at Pixar and ILM and now we've developed
the best skeletal hand tracking tech in
town and we're bringing it to VR we
believe that bring your hands into VR
without gloves markers or controllers is
part of the ultimate solution for input
our system not a matrix your hands but
exposes a full 3d point cloud and
infrared image map to developers backing
us on Kickstarter you'll get the nimble
sense amount design for the dk2 and 3d
printable models for mounting it in
other ways you'll also get the VR
experiences we're showing in this video
as open source demos our technology will
not only change the way we interact in
virtual reality but the real world too
from homes
you
Two Cities
you
to schools
you
to whatever you can imagine with nimble
sense the entire world becomes interact
we offer powerful tools and the
flexibility to create your own
applications games and experiences to
bring science fiction to life with your
backing and support we can take digital
interactions to the next level and make
virtual our new reality the future is at
your fingertips we're BioLite and we're
on a mission to bring energy everywhere
in 2014 view our community helped us
make the BioLite base camp one of the
most successful Kickstarter campaigns of
all time you know us for fire now get to
know us for light introducing the
BioLite based Lantern the world's first
flat pack lantern that creates your own
personal smart grid completely off grid
hi i'm anton and I'm Mike and where the
lead designers on the base Lantern when
you're away from an outlet lighting
large spaces generally means turning to
some form of lantern to get the job done
and it turns out most lanterns out there
could really use an upgrade with that in
mind we designed the base Lantern to
meet three core energy needs big light
without any bulk shareable power so you
choose what gets a charge and smarter
control giving you real-time feedback on
how to make your energy last longer
here's a closer look at the base Lantern
in action utilizing advanced edge light
technology the base Lantern maximizes
brightness while minimizing space
fitting 500 lumens of light into a
compact packable form and unlike old
single-function lanterns as a hub this
can extend even more light with the
integration of bio light site lights
creating easy overhead lighting to light
large spaces or create multiple lit
sites with the use of phones and other
digital tools playing more and more of a
role in off-grid life we need energy to
keep them going the base lanterns
internal rechargeable battery is paired
with two USB ports so you can power your
weekend with up to 50 hours of light or
for phone charges to
what you need grab the base Lantern XL
and add even more power to your system
when energy is scarce making it easy to
monitor and adjust your usage is
critical so we're bringing the controls
and analytics right to your pocket turn
on/off and dim and if you've got site
lights hooked up you can control those
two full color spectrum control allows
you to engage night-vision calibrate the
warmth of your light or even have a
little fun with your surroundings set
sleep timers or alarms to wrap up your
night or start an early day without
fumbling in the dark enable proximity
activation and the base Lantern will
automatically turn itself on or off
based on your location so you can find
your way back home safely and easily oh
and the app itself it barely uses any
battery from your phone thanks to
low-energy Bluetooth settings we've
spent the last two years researching the
intersection of light energy and
off-grid needs both in the outdoors this
is Omni charge the world's first smart
power bank designed by best in field
power management experts that can charge
any device Omni charge is fully equipped
with ac/dc charging capabilities as well
as two rapid charging USB ports and is
the only power bank on the market with
universal charging smart powerful
compact is the only power bank you will
ever need Alamy charge is designed for
the modern professionals mobile
lifestyle with this power bank any space
can become a workspace and being tied to
the wall socket is a thing of the past
you'll be able to get work done wherever
you need without running out of battery
omni charge can power even the most
demanding laptops and it's small enough
to fit inside your everyday bag the
power banks compact size means that you
can carry it with you everywhere and
never worry about running out of power
while you're on the go you don't have to
carry an extra charger the battery's
universal charging port means that it
can be charged with any cable already
around you Omni charge can power an
incredibly wide range of devices and
it's smart power management system means
that it can recognize which device it's
charging and adjust the optimal output
the world's first battery with a brain
all data is displayed in real time from
battery temperature two remaining
charging time with omni charge your
device will be charged in the shortest
possible time allowing you to focus on
what's important this smart power bank
can even be charged with a solar panel
and its unique flow-through capability
allows you to charge other devices while
the battery itself is being charged
totally freeing you from the wall socket
Omni charge allows you to lead a truly
mobile life and never miss an
opportunity to create a warm atmosphere
for family and friends with omni charge
you can power the things that truly
matter to you my name is allen i am the
founder and creator of way it's
originally a physicist and I'm a
full-time product designer weights are
smart high-precision miniature wireless
swang devices that have been designed to
weigh anything in the home last year
when i was in ireland i wanted to weigh
my luggage but i couldn't find any scale
that was capable of weighing a large bag
so i looked around the house and i found
that my parents had a kitchen scale and
off the scale even a bathroom scale but
they didn't have anything that could
just wait suitcase could weigh anything
so we decided to create a device that
could weigh anything in the home and
that's when we came up with the idea of
where
because it outputs to a smart device
that allows us to basically create
applications for our users that makes
their life a lot easier we can actually
weigh nutrient content of food rather
than just the food itself which is a lot
more accurate than normal dieting the
idea behind the way it's the very
innovative part of this is like it
doesn't have any surface so you can use
any of your platform in the house as a
weighing platform so for example you how
you want to wait a suitcase your
suitcase could just become the weigh-in
platform quite often when you're trying
to weigh a baby or you're trying to
weigh a pet it's because that pet needs
care and is stressed or is ill so the
best thing about ways you can use the
wherever they're happiest how's the
weighing scale so you can use the dog's
bed you can even weigh them while
they're sleeping or you can wait a baby
while it's asleep in its crib with
weights you can weigh in real time so no
longer do you have to pack your bag
close it pick it back up and put it back
down you can remove and add items as you
see fit this is so small that it fits in
your pocket so you can just kind of put
in your pocket when you're traveling or
your you just go into restaurant one you
know have food you can just pick it up
put it on the plate on the table and
then weigh the food and stuff so I think
that's the whole idea how well it fits
one of the big benefits of weights is
that we've designed to have a very very
high very high precision and have a high
resolution across a wide range of
weights so you can use way it's in the
kitchen to weigh grams or spoons of
ingredients originally when we designed
this way it was just like travel scale
or a kitchen scale but but the number of
people approached us with various things
like weighing bees and pets and rabbits
and weighing scrap metal and I think
that those are the things which we never
thought about weighing is an age-old
problem and we've found a really modern
smart solution for it
way its way smarter
