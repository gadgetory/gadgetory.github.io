how handy it is to stand when sitting is
not an option
my name is Brandon I'm an engineer and
the inventor of the Porta Potty
the very first automated grass litter
box for dog
I designed the porch potty for my dog
Nick seed because I lived in the city
with no backyard and needed a way to let
her out if I wasn't at home I realized
that if I could put a grass area on my
porch she would have her own potty place
I wanted something simple to use and I
didn't mind picking up after her but I
didn't want I didn't want to clean it
all the time I wanted it to clean itself
and I wanted the option to use real
grass or synthetic grass so I designed a
few variations the idea and I even built
a small company to distribute them there
was however one design I've always
wanted to do that topped them all a
weatherproof resin wicker version made
for the outdoors but stylish enough that
even your dog would be impressed let's
take a look at how this works the porch
potty is eight square feet of grass your
dog made with a sturdy metal frame and
stylish outdoor wicker material to
handle any kind of weather the grass
area is designed to drain to the center
drain hose the drain hose is 15 feet
long so it can reach any nearby patio
drink you could also lead it to a bang
gutter or even a flowerbed once you
connect the garden hose to the porch
potty you're ready to go set the timer
and watch the sprinklers rise from the
grass and rinse the grass clean
automatically you still need to pick up
any solid waste but the rest is done for
you the grass area fills with water and
drains away automatically if you don't
have a garden hose nearby no problem
just run the water over the top and
manually Ridge the grass the drain hose
will drain away any water and urine for
you if you can't use the drain hose
simply slide the catch basin under the
porch potty and empty the rinse water
when it's convenient for you
the porch parting will come with a
special synthetic grass that is designed
with extra drain holes to drain fast and
keep clean but if you want the luxury of
real grass it is now possible to have it
delivered directly to your doorstep
thanks to a specially designed box and a
soilless sod we call training Sun this
special grass hasn't been hydroponically
grown on a sheet of plastic and has
never touched the ground so there's no
dirt or mud to stick to the bottom
middle of the night can really trip you
up ladies hate when he goes with the
seat down he leaves the light off but
missus makes a mess and that could ruin
everyone's night what you need is bulb
right the night-light for your toilet
bowl so you're in control just enough
light without having to turn on the
dreaded wake of light bulb rises
battery-operated it's in a toilet roll
no tools needed simply adhere to the
back of the lid stays right where you
put it no matter how many times you open
and close the lid old rice provides
perfect light for years and years it's
so simple to install in just a second it
was actually easier than changing at all
the secret is full bright smart motion
detection system that automatically
turns on when you enter and turns itself
off when you leave it's the light that
cares because it knows that you're there
bull ride is so smart and even those
whether the lid is up or down red you
let the seat up and green if the seat is
down so you know is it safe to go now
every time when he leaves the seat up
although red tells me elitism
salad tastes the best turning the light
on in the middle of the night will wake
you and everyone else up but not with
Fulbright it's just enough life to make
the bowl right making sure your family
sleeps soundly all night
Fulbright is perfect for the master bath
get back any bathroom in the house I
bought one for my mom and dad and since
I saw how well it worked
I bought Reformation really I did three
perfect lines where and when you need it
and cold rice turns on when you enter in
shuts off when you leave and genius
improve your sleep improved his name and
never spit on a wet feet again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
