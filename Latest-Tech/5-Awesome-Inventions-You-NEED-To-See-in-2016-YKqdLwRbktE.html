thanks for your purchase at the no key
padlock to help you get the most out of
your lock I'd like to highlight some of
its key features it's the smartest
padlock out there and just like the name
implies it requires no key to open it
instead of using traditional keys or
combinations this lock opens using a
Bluetooth enabled device such as your
smartphone tablet or even an Apple watch
the no key works in conjunction with our
no key app which is found on Apple
Android and Windows devices the app not
only allows access to the lock via
Bluetooth but also lets the user invite
guests to have shared access to the lock
by sending them virtual keys in addition
to that the app will keep a history of
the lock so the user can monitor who
accessed their lock and even see where
and when that access took place being
able to track what's going on with your
lock and then make adjustments remotely
not only brings convenience to security
but it also adds a new level of control
which is what makes the no key the
perfect choice for locking your
possessions
this is Jeff and this is his exercise
routine
he works hard to build up his cardio and
muscle he also wants to lose weight but
it takes energy and time to burn away
the pounds Jeff would stay in the gym
and continue to fight for weight loss
results but he needs to get to work
imagine if you could take your weight
loss regime with you to the office and
burn calories all day now there is a
revolutionary technology that allows you
to do just that
introducing the thin ice fast a slick
wearable embedded with cooling
technology that forces your body to burn
extra calories when I first got this
idea I had this bolted realization that
this could be a game-changer in the
weight loss industry the thin ice fest
is comfortable and lightweight and will
help you shed pounds even as you sleep
the vest can even wait until you are in
deep sleep before activating so the
technology won't make you cold
it will just make you thinner the thin
ice fest is also discreet enough to be
worn under regular clothing so you can
use it anytime day or night go to bed
wake up how does the thin ice vest help
produce calorie burning using cold
temperatures the body responds by
revving up and burning fat to keep your
blood warm the process is called cold
temperature thermogenesis that's really
ingenious solution anything that I could
just wear day to day that would help me
lose weight would be an absolute asset
there are certain people out there that
we all love to hate and these are the
people who can eat whatever they'd like
to and not gain any weight and what this
product is actually able to do is give
you those characteristics by speeding up
your metabolism
I'm a gamer so having a cheat code is
something I'm all about another
innovative part of the thin AI system is
the Bluetooth connected mobile app it
allows you to adjust the temperature of
the technology to your comfort levels
you can also track the calories you're
burning second-by-second and if you want
to take things to the next level
the app will recommend special diet and
exercise routines to help you lose
weight like a champ thin ice is getting
ready to ship out its 1.0 version this

technology will be sleeker have a longer
battery life and can be taught to
respond to your body temperature so it

on your smartphone asking yourself
whether or not you should take your
umbrella with you before realizing
forecasts cannot be trusted
what if you could trust your umbrella
let me introduce you to the umbrella
umbrella is a connected umbrella it
sends you alerts on your smartphone when
rain is on the way and reminds you to
take it with you should you go outside
so how does this work
the umbrella is a portable weather
station it collects real-time data such
as temperature pressure humidity and
light data is processed and shared with
all the umbrella community allowing
everyone to receive hyperlocal alerts

into a social umbrella oh and one more
thing you will never leave an umbrella
behind why simply because it is a smart
umbrella an umbrella that is connected

Alec hello not a glib dommage in capsule

a GoPro whatever even a golf club if you
want I hope you appreciate how we turn
this object into an unforgettable smart
device with the team here in Paris we
are really really excited about it and

thank you umbrella the unforgettable
umbrella
more than 40% of our lives are spent in
habit for most of us that time is wasted
the secret to transformation is not to
try harder it's to replace bad habits
with the habits of excellence if you
wanted to transform yourself how would
you start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shock
each surge of voltage trains your brain
and weakens the neural connection until
the bad habit is severed next replace
the bad habit with a positive one reward
yourself when you complete your daily
goal commit to a penalty if you fail the
fear of loss stimulates your basal
ganglia while the chance of reward
motivates your prefrontal cortex in
fewer than 30 days the action becomes a
habit pavlok is the first system
designed to help you build good habits
and break bad ones earn rewards when you
succeed pay the price when you fail and
experience the electric shock that keeps
you on track contribute to the
crowdfunding campaign today hi i'm annie
SE t founder of pavlok now I know that
electric shock sounds crazy but
sometimes crazy works like many
revolutionary ideas ours started off
just as a fun project but it turned into
something much more together with my
co-founder Jim Lynch we set out to
create Pavlov the world's first device
that doesn't just attract what you do
but actually came
what you do here you see pavlok in this
wristband fold but at its core padlock
is a small module it's small enough that
it can stick anywhere on your body
now padlock is able to vibrate beep and
even electrically shocked you on command
but what padlock can do is much more
instead of me telling you what I'd like
to do let me show you what padlock is
already done
hi my name is David Goldstein I'm hoping
to use padlock to get me into a better
exercise routine I am a cancer survivor
I've had heart attack I was in a
wheelchair for a while and I still have
some paralysis in both legs
as you can see I've put on a great deal
of weight and I'm hoping that bad luck
can help me address all of those issues
I am at 65 days out of the past 70 woman
of using the padlock system I am down
seven pounds my arms have got noticeably
stronger and my legs are actually the
strongest they've been since I was
paralyzed in 2001 my kids more at the
end of the day it's now just part of who
I am and what I do you see most of us
just don't know what greatness feels
lovely we assume that we're gonna do
what we've always done but users like
David tell a different story when they
begin to fall back into the old routine
hablas jolts them out of it in most
cases their old routine can be replaced
that he was in 30 days people are
already using pavulon to begin writing
everyday to learn new languages to
exercise to journal to begin to form and
break dozens of new hats in fact there's
infinite capabilities thanks to padlocks
open developer API I know firsthand how
powerful small habit changes can be
and I'm excited to share pavlok with the
world that's where IndieGoGo supporters
like you come in we've built the pavlok
prototype we've begun testing on users
now we need your help begin setting up
manufacturing so we can deliver pavlok
and help it change the habits that
matter most to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
