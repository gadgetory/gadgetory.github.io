hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hideaway the bottle you'll always
reach for because it's always within
reach so as a freelance product designer
I'm traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I could solve myself you know
once I had a solution for business
travel I realized this had great
application my personal life especially
in the outdoors going backpacking or
just on hikes I could bring water with
me and when the bottle was empty it
collapses and goes away and takes no
extra space in my pack yeah it fits an
active lifestyle weather in the winter
when you're skiing and you can fill up
the hideaway in the lodge or in the
summer when you're backpacking or hiking
it collapses in your backpack and takes
no extra space no one loves buying
disposable water bottles it's it's
merely out of convenience and the
Hideaway makes a reusable bottle more
convenient in fact in some places
disposable water bottles are being
banned so we're all going to move
towards the reusable water bottle model
and that's why I feel like this is kind
of the next generation in hydration this
gives you an option to have a water
bottle all the time without having to
throw anything away The Hideaway bottle
comes in two sizes 21 ounce and 12 ounce
which is great for kids and both their
water type</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
