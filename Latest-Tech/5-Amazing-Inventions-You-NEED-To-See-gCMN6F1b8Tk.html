skiing is awesome and the better you are
the more fun you have introducing carve
the world's first real time ski wearable
carve is your digital ski coach that
puts world-class ski instruction in your
ears we've all had skiing lessons before
and they're great but you can't have a
coach with you every time you ski car
fits into any ski boot and is always
with you analyzing your every move by
seamlessly integrating a thin pressure
and motion sensing insert powered by a
tracker with lessons you have to wait
until the end of the run to hear how you
did carve speaks to you as you ski to
correct your form in real time welcome
to your advanced ski training lesson 5
keep your weight forward good job
skiing drills can be repetitive and
boring carve transforms drills into
exciting and rewarding games
carp has trick recognition to track your
time in the park get detailed stuff from
your session with takeoff and landing
analysis to check if your balance when
you should be and aren't lending too
hard
if you're a racing scare you can get a
complete data record to take the
guesswork out of training know what
makes you faster and set targets to
improve
and for all levels of skier carve tracks
your stats over time so you'll really be
able to see the difference carb is made
to your skiing it then lets you share
your progress of friends and see how you
compare skiing is awesome and now we can
make even better
this is flight it's a levitating light
it's floating using magnets and its
power through the air so how does it
work you line up the center of the bulb
with the center of the base when you see
the light turn on you gently let go and
watch it levitate we want your flight to
last a long time so we use energy
efficient LEDs that are safe and don't
need to be replaced we crafted the base
from a sustainable source to oak ash and
walnut oh yeah and just tap the surface
of your flight to turn it on or off when
you're not using your bulb wireless
power is good for other things like
charging your phone we would love for
you to experience flight so back our
project today and be the first to get
your hands on the flight be the first to
experience levitating light
hey my name is the notifier and I'm the
founder of the methods games and movies
are something I'm really passionate
about we have great prints and sound
system on our affordable but still I've
always had the feeling that something
could be improved in the home
entertainment experience something that
would let us be less passive when seated
how do you really feel the thrill of
what's happening on your screen that is
why we've come up with the Murshid to
take games and movies to the next level
the magic that set the Murshid apart is
a massive number of movements and
vibrations that literally take you
inside the screen what we're doing at
Emirates is trying to create the world's
best motion device designed especially
for gaming and movies just imagine
seeing some of the most timeless movies
again and living the experience as if
you were watching them for the very
first time imagine playing and feeling
the helicopters engine rumbling
underneath you and the tilting of your
couch when you're on the fly Merced is
ready to use and very user-friendly you
just have to slip it under the feet of
your favorite couch chair a bed and turn
on the app it will automatically
recognize what movie you're watching or
game you're playing and will synchronize
with it instantly then everything can be
controlled from the app you can adjust
intensity of the vibration and set the
high to your liking if you want a smooth
ride or a big shape
our third generation prototype is
functional both on the other way and on
the software side we're still improving
it daily and adding features but to make
this product a reality for anyone we
need you hardware development and mass
production is a long and expensive
process and we need your support we're
looking for patients dreamers believers
that will help us make this kid's dream
a reality for everyone thank you more
than 300 72,000 people can be saved from
drowning this year that's why it's our
mission at kinji to provide water safety
hi I'm Tom I got be honest I came up
with the idea of kinsey after I lost a
very good friend of mine three years ago
he drowned in the lake similar to this
one and it could have been prevented
when you drive a car you put your
seatbelt on when you ride a bike you put
on your helmet but how do you protect
yourself in water we set out to make the
smallest inflatable in the world and we
came up with a convenient non intrusive
way to provide safety to all of those in
and around water this is Kim G
affordable flotation device that
comfortably secure it onto your wrist
it's fast to deploy durable and
contained within a compact design Kenji
helps in case of exhaustion or heavy
currents or when there's for circulation
or cramps anytime you're on the water
even if you're just relaxing you'll want
a kimchi for you and a friend we like
Kenji cuz it's small it doesn't get in
your way when you're trying to paddle
out a lot of times when you're surfing
there's not a lifeguard anywhere near so
this gives you a little bit more sense
of security Kinji can stay inflated for
over 48 hours it includes a compass as
well as a whistle for signaling help in
case of emergency
having knowledge and good judgment first
steps and water safety but hinchey can
be an important a when your need it's
easy and fast deploy and it's already
been great out of us Kim G is durable in
the co2 cartridge is replaceable so you
can reuse kinji as many times as needed
we need your help to stop production and
fight the dangers of drowning with your
support you become an integral part of
our team of ambassadors and you'll be
the first to receive a kinky do it for
yourself do it for your friends surf
mates fishing bodies and your family
together we can revolutionize water
safety on a global scale join the
movement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
