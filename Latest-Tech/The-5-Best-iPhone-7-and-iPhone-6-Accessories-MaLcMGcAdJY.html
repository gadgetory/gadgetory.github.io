hi guys we're uncle of all the
innovations are there not never
revolutionized the gadget industry like
Apple products however there is one
thing Apple as it looks and that's as
many of you would agree is the Lightning
charging cable the average iPhone like
the cable lasts no longer than half a
year procuring replacements for broken
cables accumulates heavy costs whilst
third bus cables either unsupported or
uncomplimentary the alternatives
available include various DIY methods

unreliable and the complete hustle

issue your deliverance has finally
emerged

cables you won't be seeing those anymore

family thank you
didn't I think of that
hi my name is Joseph thank you so much
for watching our Kickstarter campaign I
came up with a board bracelets at the
beginning of the year because I was
always looking for an iPhone cable and I
also wanted something as well practice
it as my accessories we made both with
an apple certified manufacturer and we
just City products over 10 countries
four continents and among 50 devices
from iPod iPhone and iPads and has been
working amazing today we're II need your
help to raise the funds for the
manufacturing in which case we all get a
bracelet for Christmas so thank you so
much for your support and let's make
this happen together
still using the old fashioned way to
measure sizes and distances measuring by
yourself is always difficult you get all
sweaty it's hard to know how to do it
right either way it can be a waste of
time and effort feeling frustrated and
bothered now you have a better measuring
choice the eye pins spatial ruler from
the eye pins spatial ruler app plug the
eye pin spatial ruler into the iPhone
headphone jack then you can easily
measure spatial dimensions of course you
can save the measuring results and also
instantly share them
it makes the discussions between you and
your designers or even your mates easier
never again worry about picking the
wrong size of furniture snap the
furniture you lie and get its size for
the eye pin spatial ruler app
you'll know if it fits your home right
away
you can edit the same places in
different times and spaces which saves
you time make furnishing easy and with
no more mistakes create lovely and
comfortable living spaces on your own
ha no no no we are doing it again
hey you there
yes you let me ask you sir do you think
for the call from God is a good reason
for you to record your clothes well I'm
sure there are more reasons than that to
record an i phone call you need internet
connection and let's not talk about
external server dependencies
oh and by the way it's never free that's
why we invented cheek the first iPhone
case in the world that can record your
calls now you can record both incoming
and outgoing calls for freedom always
when we started designing the case we
knew that our biggest challenge was to
ideally position the components for high
quality recordings while keeping the
case slim elegant and doesn't fully let
on what it actually does cheek is so
easy to use to start and stop recording
press the top button to playback press
they are the small button you don't have
to worry if the server is reliable
everything you record stays on your SD
card jig can playback your conversation
or upload it into your computer via
dynamic Jake and iPhone cover that can
also record conversations dawned on me
when I was having multiple conversations
with my internet service providers
callsign I was sure that there had to be
a better fairer way for iPhone users to
take control of their own conversations
and I became obsessed with finding that
solution and today I'm proud to share
with you that with Jake
we have that solution with your support
we can move from
concept to widespread distribution we
believe that this is a product that
iPhone users will want to buy anyways
so by pledging your support now you'll
get early access to Jake and a greatly
discounted price thank you so much for
your confidence in us your passion and
your support for Jake
Jake is ready now all we need is your
help to bring it to the rest of the
world to you
introducing the world's first magnetic
connector for iPhone 7 because Apple has
combined the audio jack and the power
jack into one connector on the iPhone 7
we are now able to give you a magnetic
connector that connects this data audio
and fast charging in a single clip it's
never been working the magnetic
connectors are vastly superior to
mechanical connector not only are they
way more convenient to use
they're also far more resistant to dust
water and other contaminants all this
added reliability can greatly improve
your peace of mind our engineering team
has worked very hard to make this
connector as small as possible we have
also developed a two-in-one connector
that works with Android and Apple
devices we've already successfully
completed a pilot manufacturing run of
over 1,000 units
we have done extensive tests to ensure
their reliability over extended use
you're interested please contact us now
through our early review program please
