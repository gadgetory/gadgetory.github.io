Sidewinders patent-pending design
eliminates cable fray ensuring your
charger lasts as long as your laptop its
revolving shell allows you to wind the
cables in under six seconds its
adjustable length control allows you to
stay organized whether you're six inches
or 12 feet from an outlet the Apple
esque design allows for sleek
portability making the Sidewinder the
ultimate MacBook accessory
sonic soak is a smartphone sized device
that uses ultrasound technology to clean
almost anything in ways never before
possible it clings to the microscopic
level beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we'd come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travellers wanting an easy
way to wash clothes while on the go it's
also simple to use you simply place it
water add some soap turn on the built-in
timer and walk away 30 minutes later
your clothes are cleaner than ever
before
sonic Stoke is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close the first ever smartphone control
paper airplane that can do aerobatics
yes other planes can fly but they can't
boot or barrel rolls or fly vertically
dark can it is incredible and it is
small just take a piece of paper fold it
into a plane that's the module download
the app and tell your friends GeForce
got nothing on your an aerobatic pilot
now powerup dark gets its incredible
aerobatic capability from the high
thrust-to-weight ratio and unique shape
of the plane despite being so incredible
why the dart is easy and intuitive move
the phone to any direction and the wings
will follow when you start the plane
goes to 70% of its throttle so you can
fly it like a regular plan but press the
boost button and you give the plane that
extra kick that transforms it into a
flying monster a small flying monster
power-ups bluetooth module easily
charges through its microUSB port and
the entire thing is made of carbon fiber
an island so it's nearly indestructible
dart invites you to make many planes in
many shapes because every plane brings
with it new tricks and with them new
gasps for air try 5 10 50 planes then
fly them all together make a real show
arrange dogfights break every barrier
previously set by lesson
place and this little bugger is so cool
it can even fly around the office yeah
you just sent a love note through a
smartphone control paper airplane you
have lived
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
