Wi-Fi routers are dumb machines and they
make us act like dumb people yes we
unplugged it these machines work just
fine a decade ago when I only had one
computer but now my house is more
connected devices and I can even count
I want a modern Wi-Fi network that's
reliable and consistent wherever I am in
the house a network that's fast and
secure a network that keeps kids like my
nephew out of harm's way
enter luma an intelligent Wi-Fi system
that actually delivers on the promise of
fast reliable internet it surrounds you
with Wi-Fi using technology that was
previously only available to large
companies you put one here another one
there immediately you're up and running
we call it surround Wi-Fi luma is smart
enough to know things like what devices
you're using what networks are
interfering and where potential problem
spots are so it can make smart decisions
to get you the fastest data everywhere
and of course no network should be
without a good security system
I can easily grant people access to my
network and just as easily revoke it
speaking of that I can rest easy knowing
that luma has modern parental controls
so I can limit the kid to g-level
websites and monitor to make sure he's
not up to any shenanigans I can even set
time limits pause the internet like
during dinner time yay awesome here I'll
put this in I love you speed safety
security this is the future I was
promised say hello to the Bravo jet
mopping robot for my robot and say
goodbye to everyday messes just press
clean bravo jet automatically knows what
to do
the precision jet spray loosens dirt
while the vibrating cleaning head gently
scrub stains bravo jet uses AI robots
advanced navigation software and a full
suite of sensors to map and track where
it's been helping it mop in an efficient
systematic cleaning pattern it keeps
going until the whole room is clean
Bravo jet is great for kitchens and
bathrooms it's small enough to work its
way into tight spots it carefully cleans
around obstacles so it won't harm
furniture rugs or walls when it's done
simply eject the pad your hands never
touch the dirt
bravo jet features three cleaning modes
it recognizes the type of cleaning pad
and automatically adjusts the way it
cleans attach a wet mopping pad and
Bravo jet uses a triple pass cleaning
motion precision jet spray and water
activated cleaning agents to tackle dirt
and stains attach a damp sweeping pad
and Brava jet uses a double pass
cleaning motion reduced spray and water
activated cleaning agent to gently clean
everyday dust and dirt with a dry
sweeping pad bravo jet traps and locks
dust
and pet hair using a single pass
cleaning motion bravo jet is great for
hard floors like hardwood tile and stone
so you can enjoy cleaner floors and a
fresher home every day when the battery
is fully charged it's time to select a
cleaning pad choose a Brava jet cleaning
pad that matches how you want to clean
your floor wet mopping damp sweeping or
dry sweeping and slide it into the track
on the bottom of the robot if you choose
a wet mopping or damp sweeping pad fill
the tank to the top with warm water be
sure to replace the cap the bravo jet
robot is designed to clean up to 150
square feet in wet mode always place
your robot in the lower left corner of
the area you want to clean a foot away
from any walls now your Bravo jet is
ready to go press clean once to wake up
the robot then press clean again to
start the job Bravo jet recognizes which
type of pad you chose and then
automatically cleans the way you prefer
avoiding riding up on rugs and other
obstacles and even staying away from
stairs and other drop-offs
when brava jet is done it returns to
where it started and powers off then you
can eject the cleaning pad without
getting your hands dirty to store Bravo
jet make sure to empty the tank Bravo
jet is small so it can easily be stored
wheels down or on its side with the
battery side down
