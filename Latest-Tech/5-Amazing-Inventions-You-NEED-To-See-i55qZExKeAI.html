backpack it's made of an impact
resistant I'll chill an L minium
stainless steel opera and it only weighs
six kilograms

what's up kid status my name is Patricia
cho vanilla not the founder of scuba
tank
my boyfriend are mean and I have been
enjoying water sports and especially
pedaling for quite some years now but
I'm always worried to take our kids with
us because fast changing weather
conditions can make a fast return to
shore quite difficult though started
searching for an electric motor to use
with our equipment such as stand up
paddle or a canoe but it was impossible
for me to find a small light and
flexible solution for this reason I
asked me if you could build such a
gadgets and the idea of scuba Chet was
born
for the past two years Alan and his
father gap who has excellent know-how
and software and technical engineering
developed this quartet and also tested
it extensively
during the development we have used
scuba chat regularly and had so much fun
together with the kids we have met many
people on our trips who were very
excited about scuba chat too often this
been asked where a motor can be bought
last year we have decided to make the
scuba jet ready for mass production and
extended their adaptive system different
adapters give you the possibility to use
the scuba trade for almost any water
sport equipment Google Earth turns your
aquatic equipment into fast comfortable
and reliable devices
today we are ready for mass production
and therefore started this Kickstarter
campaign
we hope you are excited about our
product and help us to makes coveted a
reality by the end of this year
my first impression of the tick wise to
is it fits great and it looks good on my
wrist each little point that you touch
it's very specific and I like how it
goes from being a traditional type
function looking down at it to really
being able to interact with it my first
impression was that it was a neat watch
but outside of that I didn't really know
that I'd explore the functionality or
get to use it in the real world
normally I wouldn't consider answering
any phone calls while I'm riding my bike
but with the tick watch to you just flip
your wrist twice answer the call flip
another two times and hang it up it
tracks my workouts and it fits with my
lifestyle I'm not really what you call
tech savvy but the tick watch tubes been
really easy to use okay tiko we want
sushi I can ask it to find a nearby
restaurant and it shows the rating and
the review and how far away it is
whenever I want to go for a run I can
always track all my fitness goals on it
it's really important for me to be able
to track how I want to do my workout if
I want to use it by calories or with
distance or based on my heart rate I was
really impressed with how convenient it
was the scheduled tasks to meetings
responded my voice commands very easily
okay tiko scheduled a meeting with Bob
Williams for 7am tomorrow I thought was
pretty awesome that you call an uber by
just saying call an uber into your watch
and it would request one for you it's
great to be able to focus on the task I
had at hand instead of having to check
my phone all the time I receive the text
i simply glanced at my watch I can't
dismiss it until I'm ready to reply
later you know I don't see how I've
really been able to function without it
it's really helped me be more fishing
it's made my life a lot easier when it
comes to my workouts or even just my
daily life okay tiko how's the weather
when i'm selecting a watch it actually
matters to me how it looks it's cute I
like it overall I was really impressed
with the tick walks too it's fast it's
intuitive it recognizes my voice faster
than the other SmartWatch have ever seen
so I get to keep this right
hi I'm Steven I'm the new CEO nanotech
last year we raised over 170,000 dollars
for our k11 bumper for the iphone 6 it
took a lot of really hard work and we're
really thankful for all of your support
we love being a part of the other
community but recently we saw a huge
problem with using the Apple watch so we
decided to do something about it because
we can actually he did so the problem is
there aren't any charges available
except the one directly from apple and
plus the space the cable is just a
little bit long I just I mean it's
payment but just to unravel a map of the
state so that is why we created the thin
otech disqus now first of all we wanted
to make sure that the discus is as
compatible as possible so we use the
micro USB because let's be honest it's
everywhere now in all reality will be
honest and just say that Apple said no
when we wanted to use the Lightning
connector so we'll move on but by using
micro USB you can use the existing cord
from your power bank or if you're really
desperate you can use a samsung phone
cord hand sanitizer please
I don't know about you but I have an
iphone charger for work for home in for
traveling but I only have one from apple
watch and I'm not trying to take the
court that's 2,000 feet long and pick it
out the back and put it every time I go
on a business trip so that's why we
brought this product to market that way
you can have a charger for you anytime
anyplace you go and you can charge your
Apple watch just as easy as that I can't
tell you how many times you come to one
of these business events and some idiot
comes up and asks you hey is that one of
those new I watches well it is an Apple
watch but I'll show to you look just you
know it's like it's like coming watch me
whip and then no no it can't tell you
how awkward it is when you pay a
thousand dollars for an Apple watch and
you can't even show it off to your
friends because it dies unlike the Apple
watch charger the discus breaks down
into two separate pieces and it easily
fits into this nice little travel pack
that comes with it you'll have to worry
about doing any of that apple core rap
stuff apparently like this guy is right
now plus it's hard unlike other
Kickstarter campaigns fly little drone
we actually deliver our product last
November we started delivering the k 11
bumper and we sold over 10 jillion of
them by backing our campaign you can
guarantee that you will get your reward
Siri open the door please so you're
probably wondering why in the world are
we doing this Kickstarter thing again
will it simple not only are there
tooling costs but it licensed anything
with apples amazing technology it can be
pretty expensive plus it worked out
better for me instead of me getting pay
for this video I now own 51% of nanotech
Jackson I need you to sign something
actually did you sign that pigging work
Jetson we knew that this is something
that Kickstarter's with an Apple watch
below so we're offering it first on
Kickstarter so you better hurry up join
The Phantom tech team by backing us
today with Joe look at that we're still
up there and everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
