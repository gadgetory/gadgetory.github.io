write motorcycle when I was 7 years old
and I'm a son of a motorcycle rider and
decide establish a company last year in
2015 I should be fine
our dream is to settle a great
international company with a quarters in
the US and the branch in Europe and Asia
there is no bike light solution
thank you for your help and please share
our
hi my name is Nikhil and this
the beep ring is basically about freedom
initiative we like to scream - like
destination and wipe those bones the
city how can you do that with
we began the design process two years
ago and took the tests of the streets
people are crazy about her
the betrayer is a clean potable speedo
backpack it's made of an impact
resistant I'll chill an aluminium
stainless steel opera and it only weighs
six kilograms
as for the sound performance we've got
two woofers dome tweeters and a blasting
level volume above 110 decibels the beep
ringing uses bluetooth for wireless
streaming from your phone and other
devices
it simply all connects
beeping is very easy to use we've got
the signal now the battery indicator and
the master volume battery time is about
15 hours it can be replaced and
recharged anywhere at any time if you
fainted the beep ring please support us
we have a couple of young engineers who
like to party and move around with beer
to get our backs why not bring it all
together the beat bringer is made with
love from all of us to all of you who's
crazy enough to bring it
what's up kid status my name is Patricia
Joe Macmillan and I found out scuba tell
me
my boyfriend Armand and I have been
enjoying watersports and especially
pedaling for quite some years now but
I'm always worried to take our kids with
us because fast changing weather
conditions can make a fast return to
shore quite difficult so started
searching for an electric motor to use
with our equipment such as then a pedal
or a canoe but it was impossible for me
to find a small light and flexible
solution for this reason I asked army if
you could build such a gadget and the
idea of scuba jet was boy
for the past two years Allen and thus
far a gap who has excellent know-how in
software and technical engineering
developed this quartet and also tested
it extensively
during that development we have used
scuba checked regularly and had so much
fun together with the kids he has met
many people on our trips who were very
excited about scuba chat too often this
being asked where a motor can be bought
last year we have decided to make the
scuba chat ready for mass production and
extended the adapter system different
adapters give you the possibility to use
the scuba jet for almost any water sport
equipment scuba trip turns your aquatic
equipment into fast comfortable and
reliable devices
today we are ready for mass production
and therefore started this Kickstarter
campaign
we hope you are excited about our
product and help us to make scope attach
a reality by the end of this year my
first impression of the take wise to is
it fits great and it looks good on my
wrist
each little point that you touch it's
very specific and I like how it goes
from being a traditional pipe function
looking down on it to really being able
to interact with it my first impression
was that it was a neat watch but outside
of that I didn't really know that I'd
explore the functionality or get to use
it in the real world
normally I wouldn't consider answering
any phone calls while I'm riding my bike
but with the tick watch - you just flip
your wrists twice
answer the call flip another two times
and hang it up it tracks my workouts and
it fits with my lifestyle I'm not really
what you call tech savvy but the tick
watch - it's been really easy to use
okay Tico we want sushi I can ask it to
find a nearby restaurant and it shows
the rating and the review and how far
away it is whenever I want to go for a
run I can always track all of my fitness
goals on it it's really important for me
to be able to track how I want to do my
workout if I want to use it by calories
or with distance or based on my heart
rate I was really impressed with how
convenient it was the scheduled tasks to
meetings responded my voice commands
very easily okay to go schedule a
meeting with Bob Williams for 7:00 a.m.
tomorrow I thought was pretty awesome
that you call an uber by just saying
call an uber into your watch and it
would request one for you it's great to
be able to focus on the tasks I had and
instead of having to check my phone all
the time if I receive the text I simply
glanced at my watch I can't dismiss it
until I'm ready to reply later you know
I don't see how I've really been able to
function without it it's really helped
me be more efficient it's made my life a
lot easier when it comes to my workouts
or even just my daily life okay Tico
how's the weather when I'm selecting a
watch it actually matters to me how it
looks it's cute I like it overall I was
really impressed with the tick walks -
it's fast it's intuitive it recognizes
my voice faster than the other
SmartWatch I've ever seen
so I get to keep this right
hi I'm Steven I'm the new CEO of
nanotech last year we raised over a
hundred and seventy thousand dollars for
our k-11 bumper for the iPhone 6 it took
a lot of really hard work and we're
really thankful for all of your support
we love being a part of the opportunity
but recently we saw a huge problem with
using the Apple watch so we decided to
do something about it because we can
actually so the problem is there aren't
any charges available except the one
directly from Apple and Plus let's be
honest the cable is just a little bit
long and just I mean it's famous but
just to unravel unravel this thing so
that is why we created the thin otech
discus now first of all we wanted to
make sure that the discus is as
compatible as possible so we used the
microUSB because let's be honest it's
everywhere now in all reality will be
honest and just say that Apple said no
when we wanted to use the lightning
connector so we'll move on but by using
micro USB you can use the existing cord
from your power bank or if you're really
desperate you can use a samsung phone
cord hand sanitizer please
I don't know about you but I have an
iPhone charger for work for home in
there traveling but I only have one from
Apple watch and I'm not trying to take
the cord that's 2,000 feet long and pick
it out the back and put it every time I
go on a business trip so that's why we
brought this product to market that way
you can have a charger for you anytime
anyplace you go and you can charge your
Apple watch just as easy as that I can't
tell you how many times you come to one
of these business events and some idiot
comes up and asks you hey is that one of
those new eye watches well it is an
Apple watch but I'll show to you look
just you know it's like you'd like no no
can't tell you how awkward it is when
you pay a thousand dollars for an Apple
watch and you can't even show it off to
your friends cuz it dies unlike the
Apple watch charger the discus breaks
down into two separate pieces and it
easily fits into this nice little travel
pack that comes with it you'll have to
worry about doing any of that Apple cord
wrap stuff apparently like this guy is
right now this is hard
unlike other Kickstarter campaigns fly
little drone we actually deliver our
product last November we started
delivering the k-11 bumper and we sold
over 1 million of them by backing our
campaign you can guarantee that you will
get your reward
Ceri over the door please
so you're probably wondering why in the
world are we doing this Kickstarter
thing again we'll accept it not only are
there tooling cost but license anything
with apples amazing technology it can be
pretty expensive plus it worked out
better for me instead of me getting paid
for this video
I now own 51% of nanotech Jackson's I
need you to sign something actually did
you sign that paperwork Jackson we knew
that this is something that
Kickstarter's with an Apple watch for
love so we're offering it first on
Kickstarter so you better hurry up join
the fan o tech team by backing us today
with Joe look at that everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
