the source of our big ideas and it makes
us want to bring them to life
introducing cell robot a modular robot
will to inspire the money it uses cells
as components that allow you to build
and expand your robot too many forms the
cells are powered by a heart a lithium
ion battery that provides power to the
cell as soon as it's connected giving
life to your robot choose from the many
dozens of pre-designed robots from the
shape library follow the helpful
tutorials to walk you through
construction easily combine cells
together through a twist and lock motion
then control your cell robot from the
app additional accessories allow you to
expand your ideas further by adding
wheels amount and even a camera
and you don't just need to stick to the
instructions in custom mode you can
build anything you can imagine program
movements for each individual cell using
custom mode in the app then watch it gum
what you make is up to you cell robot is
an extension of your imagination a
platform for combining building with
creativity share your imagined
inventions and inspire your friends what
will you build cell robot this is a cell
unit it can rotate at different speeds
in different directions the coyote to a
specific position or rotate continuously
it's very simple but when you combine
managers together form different
configurations it can be hundreds of
global scene one
hi MJ we started our work to make robots
plan seamlessly into our daily life we
are trying to create a friendly access
for everyone to get their hands on
robots without coding mechanics or
electronics experis people can easily
starts to build and control the ceremony
it's definitely more than enjoy the
sling is real Power Cell robot is my own
personal robot system setting up
different configurations it just feels
like there are so many different useless
it can be a security monitor to help me
watch my house when I'm out it can be a
robot friend and i guess i can even
entertain my pet it helps me to take
care of my dog when i'm traveling there
are so many different interesting ways i
can integrate the robot into my daily
life the community in the app pretty
cool so i can share what I've made
myself and also be inspired by the
brilliant ideas of publix I have a ton
of different points but the cell robot
is my
baby there are over 50 different sheets
in the app library stand up so robot the
cell robot is a great fan Street helper
hi Eric you want to go to the store with
me today sometimes it's hard to find
something that's fun for everyone in
fact
we have different ages interests but the
cell robot works for everyone building
something solving problems for helping
us with our day-to-day tasks plus we
actually have so much fun and that's
with loose women here becker's we need
your help we have already finished the
design and prototype of Sarah but we
need your support to start production
and we only seem that you call it
backers to write the story or sell but
with us Joy

hi I'm Richard West inventor of the e
shower I'm from Australia where water
has always been a precious resource with
global warming now a reality other
places like California are in severe
drought and we have major water
shortages worldwide yet we can't seem to
stop wasting it every single day on one
hand the price of water is going up it's
not coming down and on the other hand
who doesn't love a nice long relaxing
shower after a hard day of work kids
school or sports that's why i invented
the e shower based on a revolutionary
technology discovered by renaissance
physicist giovanni venturi venturi
figured out that he could surround
bubbles of air with water by spinning
them together at ultra high speed air is
drawn into the e shower causing
tremendous turbulence that forces the
pressurized water into a powerful stream
that rivals any shower for a fraction of
the cost you know I've read that the
average Californian home uses well over
twenty-one thousand gallons of water
every year in a 10-minute shower with
the cost of water in California right
now one a shower will save over four
hundred dollars per year in water costs
the great thing is Annie shower feels
more invigorating than a conventional
shower but uses a whopping seventy
percent less water made of the
highest-quality chromed dr brass a
shower looks great in any style bathroom
I'm so confident about the e shower it
comes with a 30 year return guarantee
and my personal promise of one hundred
percent performance for a lifetime after
10 years of development testing and
perfecting the e shower has proven to
reduce water and power bills in fact a
shower will pay for itself in the first
few months best of all is the feeling of
the water through the e shower generous
satisfying and guilt free for as long as
you like they shall was fantastic it was
it felt amazing the water pressure was
brilliant the first time I've used an
energy saving device where I was able to
wash my hair properly yeah the show was
great pressure feel really good when
your skin it's just really nice bubble
feeling that you get what if it really
good dyeing your hair on your face
everything and there's this really cool
sound it's like I'm under a waterfall so
I loved it really good what I found when
I had the ear shower was that the
pressure it was the same as my old
shower and when I looked down there was
hardly any water falling around my feet
so really impressed by that right with
your support and pre-orders we're ready
to start manufacturing and shipping in
the USA so you can share with your
family and friends go to our Kickstarter
page and grab your early bird special
now the smart water solution for the
best shower and a better planet
I'm a a writer and this is fri wall a
new kitchen tool that makes cooking a
leader than it's ever been for centuries
inventors have sought ways to block
splatter and avoid the drudgery of
cleaning the stove top fry wall cracks
the code by combining the flexibility of
heat resistance of pure silicon with a
simple elegant design the side walls
shield the stovetop roulette vapor
escape so food Sears perfectly the
angled sides also leave the cooking
surface easy to access so you can add
remove or flip ingredients at any time
it's a huge improvement over spider
screens which can't stop oil mist has to
be removed again your food fry wall
keeps whatever you're cooking even that
huge pile of greens neatly inside so
whether you're making a porterhouse
steak sauteing some kale or making some
tomato sauce fry wall keeps the sizzle
on the pan and the mess off your
stovetop afterwards just put fry wall
into the dishwasher and then roll it up
into the simple need sleep fry wall is
made of pure high temperature silicone
no BPA's and no plastics no toxins it
looks playful but it's amazingly tough
I've been using this one like crazy for
the last six months and it's still
perfect when I started silicone experts
told me fry wall would never work the
mold would have to be too big the
biggest ever for a kitchen device fry
wall wouldn't be rigid enough and
wouldn't stand up it would be too
expensive finally I found manufacturing
partner who shared my vision the same
silicon pioneer who introduced a
silicone cupcake pan 30 years ago
now all the hurdles have been overcome
the molds are made and the first
production run is underway this
Kickstarter campaign will help fund the
first production and also make sure we
can keep on making fry walls without
interruption for a pledge of $22 we'll
send you this 10 inch fry wall for
pledge of 29 will send you the 12 inch
fry wall for pledge of 50 will send you
both and even throw in free shipping
thanks for your support I know you love
cooking more when the mess is less
