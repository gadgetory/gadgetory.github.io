y'all
latest tech here bringing you you
guessed it the latest account there one
Hamilton Beach dual breakfast sandwich
maker breakfast is the most important
meal of the day at least that's what
everyone keeps saying so with the
Hamilton Beach dual breakfast sandwich
maker we can make ourselves some easy to
make breakfast egg sandwiches all you
have to do is start your sandwich from
the bottom up inside the cooking ring
then close the cooking plate and pour
your egg and put the top bun on it then
close the whole thing to cook for five
minutes once you hear the beeping
telling you that your eggs are cooked
slide the cooking plate out to drop the
egg and top on the sandwich and voila
your very own egg sandwich the best part
is the cleanup is very easy simply
remove the cooking rings and wash them
by hand or dishwasher it's on Amazon for
$32 and I have to say that this is a
great way to start your day right a nice
easy and quick breakfast with a minimal
mess I would definitely not mind
grabbing this and making myself a
healthier breakfast than what I usually
end up eating to the semi core USB
charging station cable clutter is a very
common problem that's a huge pain to
deal with along with one of its side
effects running out of plug space well
with the SimCorp USB charging station we
have an option that can help us out with
this charging station that comes in four
or six ports comes a bunch of short USB
cables that plugs into most Android and
Apple products to help minimize the
cable clutter and organize your devices
at the same time all you have to do is
plug the charging station in and plug in
any device needing to be charged into
the charging station using the short
charging cables then line the devices up
in between the plastic dividers and
there you have it
charging four to six devices very neatly
and organized while using up only one
outlet plug and as an added bonus soft
blue lights light up under any device
being
and will turn off when they become fully
charged this gives you a visual
indicator when their batteries are full
instead of checking up on them every so
often the USB charging ports use smart
technology that gives your device's the
proper amount of energy it needs
providing more or less energy depending
on your devices and what it can handle
for safety it even has an anti slip
layer under the devices to help keep
them secure if you ever move the
charging station while your devices are
still charging on them and it comes in
silver or space gray I personally like
the silver more it's on Amazon for only
twenty five dollars with a one-year
warranty on top of it - it's too good to
pass up especially if you're like me and
you keep all of your old devices even
when you buy new ones or if you have
devices for each of your family members
definitely buying this first chance I
get three screwdriver pen pocket
multi-tool this is one of those products
that are for the DIY fans a nice stylish
multi-tool the screwdriver pen pocket
multi-tool to be exact it's wide tool
kit includes a bubble level tool a ruler
marked into the pen casing and the pen
itself can be screwed out so that you
can use the pen casing as a ruler while
you write the end of the pen can be used
as a stylus for your touchscreen devices
removing the stylus you will find a
screwdriver underneath that can also be
switched to a flathead screwdriver as
well and all of that is built in a nice
high-quality aluminum that comes in
black silver yellow and blue at just six
bucks for a single pen or ten bucks for
a 2-pack in a mix of colors of your
choice on Amazon this is the easiest and
cheapest gift you can get anyone that is
a DIY type of person or a lover of
unique pens I guess that could work too
for the kitschy
cutter wheel pizza is one of my favorite
meals so it comes as no surprise that
ended up on this tool when I got a bit
hungry looking for stuff on Amazon this
is the kitschy it's a cutter wheel a
nice handheld pizza cutter that fits
nicely into the palm of your hand it
even has a sheath that closes around the
blade to decrease the chances of getting
a cut which makes it a whole lot safer
to store its handle is a lot more easier
to use than your average pizza cutter no
matter what kind of pizza you get it's
also useful in cutting other types of
stuff like ingredients or cooked meals
like pita or or pasta and after using it
it's easy to clean by opening it up and
cleaning all of its components by hand
or even by dishwasher at 14 bucks on
Amazon it's a very nice tool for us
Pizza fiends to have and not about
addition to any kitchen in a house with
kids for the safety aspect of the cutter
Amazon is a great place to spend an hour
or two just going through the mountains
of products of every shape function and
color for the things that you might not
even think that they were gadgets for
just keeping your impulse by instincts
in check is very necessary to keep your
wallet from you know suffering too badly

opinions about these new gadgets ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
