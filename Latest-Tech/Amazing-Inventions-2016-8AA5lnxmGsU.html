we all want to be that person the one
who wakes up early dives straight into a
morning meditation is super productive
at work drinks those eight glasses of
water and always hits the gym but let's
be real living that life means building
better habits and our brains want to
follow the ones we already have
not the new ones we're trying to cram it
but sometimes all you need is the right
nudge
hi I'm Kayla and meet Modi a smart
companion for building better habits we
created Modi with a distinct purpose to
empower people to take those small steps
that over time result in big impacts in
our health and happiness these more than
just a cute face Modi is designed in the
latest insights from both behavioral
science and social robotics when you
place Modi in your home or office every
time you walk by he becomes an instant
reminder to keep committed each time you
do here have it Modi is there to help
you track and celebrate your small wins
giving you that immediate gratification
the better you get the more excited
goodie comes
but slack off and Modi might get angry
or sad or stay purely encouraging Modi
knows what works best for you because
he's connected to the web he's
constantly analyzing and evolving so he
knows how you're progressing if you're
at risk of falling off and when to send
the right types of nudges specifically
for you compare all this to the same
daily push notification you keep
ignoring still how can something so
simple actually change your behavior to
tell you about how we form good habits
let's start with something that we're
all familiar with forming a bad habit
boom cookie fundamentally your brain
needs three things to form a habit a
trigger a routine and a reward when I
saw that plate of cookies I didn't even
think about grabbing one my brain
immediately triggered me and I knew that
eating that cookie would reward me with
its sweet doughy deliciousness your
brain forms good habits in just the same
way by completing this loop over and
over again Modi works by seamlessly
integrating these three elements into
your busy lifestyle Modi himself is a
trigger more specifically what's known
as an environmental cue and by using
Modi your habit is already set up to be
small distinct and actionable finally
movie celebrations provide an immediate
reward he makes sure that you feel
satisfied and accomplished each and
every time and perhaps a bit guilty if
you're not
monie is the outcome of over a year of
human centered design and engineering
rigor we discovered that triggers and
rewards driven by emotion are far more
potent than numbers lists or alarms now
we're finally ready to release movies
straight to you the only question is
what habit will you
when we can't help you magically climb
Mount Everest or run a marathon
overnight he's there to help you do
something more as sexual become a better
view one habit at a time
you
show me all the places
were say
race all
in trains
here at gladly technological innovations
we are currently developing a wearable
smartphone in the form of a glove our
main aim is to push the boundaries of
wearable telecommunications and move
into a new area of a fully wearable
world people who are into sports or any
other physical activities often struggle
to carry and use their smartphone in its
fullest usable capacity glove these
aimed at people who engage in sports and
other demanding activities whatever the
situation glove D is right for you
both founders are sparring athletes and
faced a major problem while exercising
the difficulty to use and carry their
smartphones smartwatches and fitness
trackers did not work efficiently for
them the reason these devices was
prepared with an existing smartphone
while operating them multiple issues can
arise no feasible way to initiate a call
or send a text message take videos and
photos or even be able to use popular
applications on a small SmartWatch
display and that's how glove D was born
a wearable smartphone in the form of a
glove can do so much more than just a
regular one we strongly believe that
glove D will exponentially increase the
quality of our lives not only in sports
but also in other activities of our
daily routine glove D is not just a
product it's a platform aiming to close
the gap in emerging technologies in
Internet of Things hi my name is Andrew
and I'm excited to introduce you to ID
or can ID or can is a Wi-Fi enabled
digital doorbell that allows you to see
hear and speak to the person at your
door no matter where you are or what
you're doing go and leave the package at
the front door
thanks the idea was born from everyday
situations I mean don't you wish you can
know who's at the door before you stop
what you're doing answer it want to see
who's there when you're not home but the
kids are and what about when it started
but we're making all that possible and
we're doing it with minimal design and
cutting-edge technology so how does it
work hold on someone's up my
hey John
hey Andrew want to go to the beach yeah
I'm already down here I'm talking to
folks about how I door cam works why
don't you come down to our usual spot
okay I'd be there soon when a visitor
rings the doorbell ID or cam sends an
alert to everyone in your family and
each person can choose to accept or
ignore the call if you answer it you'll
see hear and speak to the person at your
door hi hi Sarah
so happy you're here come on Ann I'm in
the kitchen I door camp connects to your
home's Wi-Fi and you can receive the
feed over Wi-Fi 3G and 4G installation
is easy all you need is a screwdriver
and it works with your current doorbells
wires for full time power the front
features a button
day and night vision camera microphone
speaker and tiny motion sensor the cover
is made from hardened plastics with a UV
coating that will not rust or interfere
with the Wi-Fi signal it's rugged and it
will survive harsh conditions I door cam
works internationally it's designed to
be compatible with G and N wireless
networks and it's backwards compatible
so it will work with almost any wireless
router I door camp will be made in the
USA right here in Southern California
you'll enjoy some great features for
example multiple users this is perfect
for a whole family a babysitter an
employee or when you're caring for a
senior parent looks like a solicitor
that's okay the babysitter will get the
phone

excited about I adore Ken and we hope
