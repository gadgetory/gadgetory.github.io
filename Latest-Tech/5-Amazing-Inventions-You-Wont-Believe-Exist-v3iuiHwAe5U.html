coquí's battery is capable of charging
your phone for up to two hours we all
have a freezer at home right it's a
household appliance that never gets a
break and we keep it running day and
night why not use all that surplus
energy to keep yourself cool geyser is
an eco-friendly ice powered cooling
system that uses a special cooling gel
that has amazing running costs just
under one cent a day even the casing is
eco-friendly geyser is made of good old
high-grade insulating wood this means
that the ice pack dee Frost's at a
snail's pace lengthening the operation
time greatly it's ventilated all round
giving 360 degrees of cooling power it's
small - which means it's portable and
can be used wherever you need it
it's powered by a Lippo battery and can
be charged via microUSB geyser has no
all knopf switches and only works if the
two parts are connected this makes it
safer for children and pets Damiano and
Ferdinando are two young architects with
a passion for 3d design and
experimentation this is the result of a
lot of hard work on their part they
opened their firm two years ago I
couldn't afford an air conditioner
that's when they came up with the idea
of making a system which had lower
running costs than an air conditioner
and which works better than a fan
the first plans were drawn on paper and
then turned into 3d models
the first prototypes were made using a
3d printer after an in-depth study
regarding possible materials Wood was
chosen for its outstanding insulation
qualities then the best components for
long service life and performance were
chosen the cone-shaped ice pack acts as
a diffuser defrosting itself over a time
scale of 5 hours
there's even an insert for an air
freshener just insert it into the base
to turn on geysers fan just line up the
two blue dots and pop the lid on geyser
is available in natural wood finish or
paint finish with two different
ventilation grids I travel a lot I I
think I was out of town 200 days last
year I take a lot of short trips I never
want to check bags I never want to wait
that the carousel I try as much as
possible as I know a lot of people do to
travel just with carry on carry on just
wasn't good enough the bag was
impossible you couldn't walk with the
bag over anything other than just a
perfectly flat surface and the world is
not perfectly flat we all travel as
commuters we travel more often on
shorter trips like many others I
realized that something was missing a
new type of traveler was evolving this
new traveler was not being taken care of
by any part of the industry this is
where Giro comes in
you
the first thing I realized was that we
would need a large diameter wheel to
meet the needs of today's commuters and
travelers what our big wheels good for
for one they put the center of gravity
closer to the rotation axis and that
makes the bag feel dramatically lighter
these large access wheels strengthen the
sides of the bag and they're so slim
that they won't take any additional
space from the interior of the bag and
they run over everything after endless
hours of drawing and modeling
I finally got my dream wheel a
game-changing technology the wheel was
done but the bag wasn't quite there yet
more winning features needed to be added
to make zero the best possible bag for
commuters we gathered a talented team of
designers and together we begun to
develop and design more and more
features that have made zero even more
durable economic and functional we began
work on a carrion companion that would
meet international airline standards we
designed different compartments one to
hold your personal items and one to keep
your work items like your 15-inch laptop
and an easy access pocket for carry-on
liquids we developed a very long strong
economic handle instead of weighing
every bag down with features someone
might not need we developed an optional
electronic module it includes a
proximity detector location tracker 2
USB ports international power outlet for
your laptop and a battery strong enough
to charge your smartphone up to 10 times
step-by-step we created our dream bag a
bag that's unbelievably maneuverable and
tough without added weight a bag with
all-terrain wheels and features to help
you comfortably get to where you're
going
regardless of where that is

bustle of everyday life sometimes all
you want is just to have a rest but it
seems like you can't escape from all the
noise surrounding me how can we get some
silence into our busy lives introducing
