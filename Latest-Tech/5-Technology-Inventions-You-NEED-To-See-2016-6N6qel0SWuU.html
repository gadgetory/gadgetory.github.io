360-degree camera

for everyone imagine if you didn't have
to get your phone out for every little
thing what if there was a simpler way to
interact with your device's flick is a
wireless button that connects to your
iOS or Android device so instead of
going through your phone you simply
press the button
that's better I use the flick app to set
it up and then I can stick flick
wherever I want I can even share this
flick with my roommate so we can use it
when i'm not around the flick isn't just
for your house you can stick your flicks
anywhere like in your car or on your
bike

this but flight could be so much more
than just a shortcut to your phone it
could be integrated with lots of
different services beyond your devices

just take care of itself
Shh movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends
I'd like to introduce you all to a very
exciting and interesting thing now I've
put a lot of thought and research into
ways of seeing small and delicate things
with the naked eye as you can see
traditional microscopes are big and
heavy they can only be used in certain
places but now the perfect microscope
has been invented let me introduce you
to the new rugo microscope it's very
easy to use you can just mount on the
back of your smartphone there are no
cords and no additional batteries since
it's a small microscope you can utilize
it anywhere and anytime now let's take a
look at this small microscopes amazing
performance as you can see here well
can't be seen with the naked eye can
easily be verified with this product and
the image is a high resolution compared
to other microscopes
let's take a closer look it's
astonishing how this small microscope
can enlarge the target by up to four
hundred times its original size the new
rugo microscope not only can it be used
for research and education but it can
also be utilized in fields that require
a microscope such as work and everyday
lives the two key factors for producing
the high-resolution image are the lens
and the lighting the lens is capable of
enlarging a target by up to 400 times
its original size and this lighting
technology has also been patented you
can also get video without any
additional batteries or cables
Wow everyone had an amazing response

taken by an arugula microscope on SNS if
you simply and easily want the best
results anywhere and anytime Naru go
