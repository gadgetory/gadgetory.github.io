nomadic travel pack the most functional
backpacks ever don't think so
keep watching nomadic is a Kickstarter
born company last year we launched the
nomadic travel bag which quickly became
the most fun to travel bag in
kickstarter history we deliver the
travel bags as promised and have
received hundreds of glowing reviews
travelers all over the world have loved
their nomadic travel bags but our
backers kept asking when are you going
to make an everyday bag or what about a
bag for shorter trips creating the most
functional everyday bag was a daunting
task we knew you would interact with
this bag every day which meant we would
have to think through every last inch
but we accepted the challenge and said
let's do it
so we set off to make the most
functional backpack and travel pack ever
here's a quick view into how we tackle
this feat first in order to understand
what people carry every day we surveyed
you our backers and with thousands of
responses we successfully highlighted
the features that are most important for
your everyday needs and travel needs
then we traveled halfway around the
world and met with bag manufacturing
experts after a year of development and
ten plus prototypes later we are excited
to announce two new bags
the nomadic backpack for everyday use
and the nomadic travel pack for one two
three day trips first let's walk through
the shared features on these bags and
then later we'll discuss what make the
backpack and travel pack different from
each other both the backpack and the
travel pack are made with strong
waterproof zippers and tarpaulin
material that will last forever
our unique strap design allows you to
switch between briefcase and backpack
simply tuck the straps behind the back
panel and snap them down to carry like a
briefcase when you need to look more
professional or hostage drops out to
carry like a backpack for other
activities the full perimeter zipper
gives a wide open view of the inside for
better visibility and packing
additionally our innovative zipper
design gives access from all sides both
bags have over 20 pockets each one
designed with purpose a quick access

mesh elastic pockets RFID blocking and
lockable security pocket a removable
hard protective shell for glasses
multiple meshes upper pockets a notebook
pocket and a hidden pocket for important
items like cash or a passport basically
whatever you're carrying these bags have
a spot for it we've also included cord
pass-through holes between all
compartments to allow you to charge
seamlessly on the move our innovative
water bottle pocket is magnetic it snaps
shut and looks sleek when it's not in
use and expands we need to space these
bags also stand up straight on their own
keeping everything right where you need
it

key and watch it effortlessly returned
to its pocket in the bag to keep you
visible in the dark both bags have
reflective ink on the front and
as you can see the nomadic backpack and
travel pack share these awesome features
so how are they different from each
other

perfect for everyday use we have created
three interchangeable velcro panels to
help you pack for your life now you get
to decide what and how you carry each
nomadic backpack comes with the paper
organizer the tech pocket and the shoe
or clothing pocket and when you need to
carry a bit more our expansion system

laptops compartment is safely surrounded
by foam and is designed to hold a 15
inch laptop comfortably now for the
nomadic travel pack this is the perfect
travel companion for those 1 2 3 day
trips or for people who need to carry
more every day
this bag includes a full perimeter
expansion increasing its volume from 20
to 30 liters to help compartmentalize

dividing wall and a built in shoe or
