zero gravity racks take back your space
back our campaign now and receive an
exclusive discount only on Kickstarter
hey Kickstarter my name is mark i'm the
founder and CEO of zero gravity racks
and this is my son Nick who's in charge
of product development and social media
we be pretty active lives he likes to
serve he likes to stand up he loves the
snowboard and he needs two skis to stand
up your layers is fixie he loves his
mountain bike but all of our gear is
taken up too much room in our garage so
much so that I couldn't park my car in
there many of the storage solutions have
you looked at we're going to work many
worse unsafe clunky so we came up with
this idea to raise all of our quipment
up off the ground in that apartment way
and that became easier to have around
but in order to make zero gravity racks
a reality we really need your help so
click on one of the perks on the right
if you're on a computer or on the
rewards tab below if you're on a mobile
site and don't forget to tell your
family and friends about it if your back
is now would be the first to get in zero
gravity racket it just got an exclusive
to the Kickstarter campaign so don't
miss out and thanks for the support nice
you
you
you

hi I'm Ryan and I'm Valerie thanks for
checking out zubat we all love our shoes
but don't the laces present some
challenges there's the time the
squeezing the floppy bows the coming
undone
the double nodding and the untying to
get them off
well with your support we think Zubat
can help zoo it's our small yet powerful
magnetic it's that you attach to your
own shoelaces making your shoes very
easy to put on so how do you really want
to put your shoes on wooden it be great
if there were no laces at all I mean
nothing to get in the way well this is
what Zubat SAR like when separated zubat
Saleem innate three rows of laces so
there is a huge mouth opening to easily
slide in
then just connect the magnets
and that's it now go for a run
go to the playground
you
go to the gym
play some basketball lubitz hold
securely for most recreational
activities do red but sue boots are not
just for athletic sneakers therefore
your everyday casual shoot
with sue bits you have a clean looking
shoe no ugly bows and they'll never come
undone
now how do you really want to take your
shoes off let's face it most of us do
what we are not supposed to do we step
on our heel and squeeze out of our shoes
this wears down the heel and leaves you
with a knot to untie later but with zube
it's stepping out of your shoes becomes
the right way to do it the magnets will
split as you step out and now your shoe
is open and ready for the next time you
want to slip in zubat SAR not ordinary
magnets they've been specially
engineered to concentrate the magnetic
forces toward the face of the magnets
this gives them incredible holding
forces in a small size this also means
there's almost no magnetism on the
outside of the zoo bits where you don't
want it
you
you
the zoo bits you can wear shoes tight
outdoors then wear them loose at home
around the office
sooo bits are easy to install just
thread your laces through the zoo bits
insert your foot and adjust the
tightness to your comfort level then not
or clip the shoelace ends inside your
shoe we will provide some clips to help
you secure your laces when you're ready
cut your laces off leave a little extra
and you can adjust the fit any time
so the idea for Zubat was actually born
out of the desire to help our own kids
get their shoes on easier but along the
way we discovered everybody likes it
kids adults even the elderly we've
developed fully working prototypes we
taken it this far but we really need
your support to make zoo vets happen we
need the funds to pay for manufacturing
and production moles so please back our
project by choosing a pledge amount
basically you're just buying some Zubaz
that would help us a lot let's make
Zubat tap thanks thank you
hi I'm andreas peernock and I'm here at
our labs at the National Design Center
in Singapore to tell you about Korea pop
and really cool three depend that we are
working on we have been following the
space of personal fabrication for quite
some time and the evolution has really
been amazing just think about what has
happened with 3d printers and 3d pants
however there are a couple of problems
specifically when you look at three
depends all of the pans out there melt
plastic too dangerously hot temperatures
just think about what would happen if
someone gets melting plastic onto their
skin or into their eyes it would be
really bad in addition you get a quite
unpleasant smell when you use pants that
melt plastic it's simply not nice in a
home environment that's how we started
thinking wouldn't it be possible to do
things in a different way couldn't we
make a 3d pen without hot plastic and
without a bad smell this is how Korea
pop was born we came up with the idea of
using light-sensitive ink that is
solidified by shining ultraviolet light
on it in the industry this is called
photo polymers with Korea pop you get a
3d pen without any hot parts without any
melting plastic and without any bad
smell with Korea pop cooling pops up
magically people just love to create
things we see this all the time with
artists and with designers we also see
it with kids who love coloring books
Lego and play-doh Korea pop is the
perfect tool for anyone who wants to
create their own designs in different
shapes and different colors with a
career path you can use some really
cooling we have inks in many different
colors so you can create multi color
designs we have inked that is elastic so
you can make a dress for a Barbie doll
there is magnetic ink that you can use
for making fridge or whiteboard Mac
we have any that glows in the dark if
you want to make objects that radiates
light in a dark room you can use our
aromatic ink to make items that smell
good for your car or for your bathroom
we have got ink that changes color with
temperature so you can for example paint
a teacup and see how it changes color
when you pour in hot water and since
Korea pop is using cooling we have got
body painting to make tattoos and henna
designs we started working on queer pop
last year and this is what a first
prototype looked like and this is what
Korea pop looks like today as you can
see we've gotten rid of the cord and we
made improvements to the design over the
next few months will make further
improvements to the design and to the
functionality until Korea pop is ready
to be shipped we have come quite far
already and now we need your help to
make three apapa reality if you think
Korea pop is cooled please sign up on
queer pop com for our early bird offer
thank you

do you need a much more accurate desktop
3d printer
do you trust your 3d printer to finish
your large and complex high-quality jobs
do you wish that operating and
maintaining your 3d printer was much
easier after years of development and
experience building many printers we are
proud to announce our three new raised
3d fdm printers
meet the n1 n2 and the n2 plus
high-quality highly reliable and easy to
use printers built to be trusted by and
meet the demands of serious 3d printer
users like you the n1 features a
standard build volume of 8 inches by 8
inches by 8 inches the n2 is roomier at
12 inches by 12 inches by 12 inches tall
the n2 plus doubles the build height of
the n2 to 24 inches for tackling your
tallest jobs some of the other things
that I like is that the touch screen
display represents the print and the
process that percentage is illustrated
really nicely through the preview of the
model
normally the most time-consuming and
complicated process is trying to
organize and rename those treaty files
but with the Rays treaties and series
printers the management of my files on
their touch screen display have been
made easier and more manageable with the
touchscreen display you have a very
clear graphic on how to operating my 3d
printers
raised 3d printers are not only easy to
use they are also very accurate and
reliable every printer starts with a CNC
machined frame and components to ensure
stable operation the race 3d printers
come with a heated build plate to assure
great performance with a wide variety of
printed materials all machines come
standard with a removable glass build
plate covered with build tack for even
better performance and the n2 and the n2
plus are pre aligned at the factory so
that you will never need to level and
adjust the print bed the Rays 3d
printers are enclosed the removable top
cover can be used or removed based on
the needs of your specific printing
material our all-metal hot end can work
up to 300 degrees Celsius making it
ready for a wide variety of future high
temperature filament all three printer
models can be upgraded to have a second
extruder with the dual extruder upgrade
you can tackle multicolored prints as
well as complex prints that require
dissolvable supports
for me personally I'm always splitting
models in two parts and then join them
together and I always have forms of the
seam lines they always show through I I
can fill them rich in world them sand
and paint and I always have problems
with the seam lines so being able to
print larger models in one go eliminates
this problem we would like to show you
what we can do with our printers here
are a number of prints that we have
collected to show off the quality and
capabilities of the Rays 3d printers
you
so one of the worst experiences I've had
with a large print I have my compressor
on and it will overheat and they'll turn
off the whole power to the whole thing
the race for ED remembers the exact
position of the extruder so when your
power comes back on you just select
resume and the print carries on as
normal
the race 3d printers come with a modern
touch screen control system with
ethernet and Wi-Fi networking the
control system is built with embedded
Linux we even have 16 accessible GPIO
lines another great thing about the
raise 3d printers is that not only can I
but any member of my team upload a file
on to the printer software cruise
onboard Wi-Fi connectivity not only can
I do this from the comforts of my desk
but really anywhere I have internet
access remote camera makes the whole
printing process easier to monitor even
when we cannot look after the printers
physically now everything is on the
control with the Rays for the remote
control
our idea maker slicer has a powerful 64
bit multithreading slicing engine that
powers through the slicing tasks with
ease it is built to handle large scale
objects the idea maker software is
loaded with features including the
ability to automatically repair broken
meshes and to split large models into
smaller chunks idea maker is highly
adjustable allowing you to use advanced
settings to control nearly every
parameter of the slicing process we
believe our printers are the best fdm 3d
printer ever created a printer designed
for serious users we look forward to
your backing and support to make this
project happen with your help we hope to
raise the standard of 3d printing thank
you
