volleyball player and recent Stanford
grad is a degree in human biology while
I was there I had the chance to learn
from dr. Craig Keller and dr. Dennis
kromm in 2003 the Department of Defense
through DARPA commissioned dr. Heller
and dr. Graham to find a solution to the
overheating problem plaguing our
soldiers at home during training and in
the Middle East after extensive research
and years of testing they invented the
core control pro model the first cooling
device to use the proprietary r-tx
technology the patented r-tx technology
cools your body from the inside out
through the palm of your hand it safely
reduces your core temperature in just a
few minutes professional sports teams
health and weight loss experts industry
leaders fire departments and sports
medicine professionals were impressed by
the military success so they jumped on
board and began using core control Pro
to cool down and do more avec or is now
offering for the first time a consumer
version the new RT X is portable and has
the same function as the core control
pro model but at a fraction of the cost
just fill the r-tx with ice
insert your hands and flip the switch
cooling starts within seconds when
you're hot even before you start
sweating your body naturally cools off
by selectively radiating heat to the
palms of your hands
the r-tx turbochargers this natural
process cooling you up to five times
faster
whether you're exercising working
outdoors trying to lose weight living
through a heatwave or just plain hot and
sweaty
the r-tx lets you pull down like the
pros for the IndieGoGo community the new
consumer r-tx can be ordered for the
exclusive price of $249 more than thirty
five percent off the MSRP and 75 percent
less than the pro model the r-tx will
usher its users into a new world where
overheating will not prevent you from
being cool and doing more because
sometimes being hot is just not
you
five four three two one hi I'm Chris and
I'm Simon and we're the creators of the
underwater jetpack
I came up with the idea for a translator
when I met a French girl that's really
where the story starts I was on vacation
and I met this girl it was difficult for
us to communicate because she didn't
speak English very well
and even when we tried to find a
solution like using some translation app
to communicate it's horrible but if
you're not speaking and our phones are
in a face like this forget it
this is the wolf we're out of this real
world interaction put this in your ear
just right back in it
buddy put this in your ear wish me
Salman oh hey I put in here cancer yeah
okay can you hear me French people
thought the whole thing is but this was
a nobody whole thing yes I can hear you
talk Spanish of course miss but this is
awesome
but how you do it yeah it's translating
strands like
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other hears it in
their language developing the pilot has
been an intensive process our team has
been working over two years andrew is
our original co-founder and overseas
prior development I'm an electrical
engineer and expert and manufacturing we
also have mechanical engineer software
engineer PhD and machine translation as
well as an industrial designer our wide
breadth of experts has allowed us to
develop a product from the ground up
we wanted to create something that hugs
the curves of the year without being
obtrusive something snug but fashionable
to wear in the process we just decided
to throw in an extra earpiece for
wireless streaming music that means the
full system includes two earpieces and
its accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the earpiece it's kind of an
end-all solution for the traveler or the
international professional that's what
we're doing here at Waverly Labs it's
simply the most advanced communication
wearable
this IndieGoGo campaign helps us finish
what we started we can get the ear
pieces along with this portable charger
manufactured and delivered within a year
the app works on its own if you just
want to use the app for basic
translation and will have the app out by
late summer first for our backers here
on IndieGoGo but for the full experience
you really want the ear pieces too it's
the dream you know a life untethered
free of language barriers it's just that
it's no longer dream anymore it's real
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
