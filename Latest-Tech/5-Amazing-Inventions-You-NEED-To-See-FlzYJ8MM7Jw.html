what's amazing about one wheel is the
experience of riding we combine the
motion sensing technology from
smartphone the motor and battery
technology like you find in a Tesla
create a self-balancing electric
skateboard control simply by leaning
your body we started with a dream of a
hoverboard the smooth feeling of flying
over pavement inspired by this vision in
the future we created an incredible ride
that feels like a natural extension of
your balance one wheel is designed to be
intuitive whether you're a pro are never
been on a board you can learn the basics
in under a minute and there's plenty of
room to challenge yourself by riding
more aggressively or inventing new
tricks there are no hand controls you
just lean toward your front foot to go
faster and your back foot to slow down
or even reverse regenerative braking
kicks and as you come to a stop at the
heart of one wheel is a state-of-the-art
direct drive brushless motor in the hub
of the women's movement and balance are
achieved by a custom controller the
reeds gyro and accelerometer sensors
thousands of times a second the
high-speed charger gives the lithium
batteries minute per minute
we made one wheel unusable and dynamic
experience and unlike skateboarding
where you heal every little crack and
pebble in the street one wheel feels a
lot more like surfing or snowboarding a
large tire and carefully tuned
algorithms allow you to carve the
pavement as if it were water or fresh
powder this wonderful feeling of just
stepping on this thing and thinking
about where you want to go and you're
off you lean very much like you do on a
snowboard you just kind of lean into the
turns you want to go on and one wheel
just kind of carbs for you it's a pretty
magical experience prototypes to get one
wheel to where it is today everyone who
rides it loves it and with your help we
want to make one wheel available to the
world we've worked with all kinds of
manufacturers on other projects and we
believe the u.s. is the best place to
build an advanced products like one way
but that kind of quality costs money so
we eat backers like you who share our
vision of creating amazing electric
vehicles with your backing will pay for
tooling costs and build the first ever
one wheel production join us in
revolutionising the experience of ride
I mean venice beach today to tell you
about the unique eagle electric
skateboard full heart ego can go 80
miles at 13 miles per hour the ego is
really light at thirteen point nine
pounds it's really easy to carry around
wherever you need to go with the
wireless remote you can switch from
turtle to rabbit to increase your speed
and eco support to increase your torque
when you push the slider forward on the
remote you will go faster have to stop
or slow down pull back an LED light
indicator on the remote shows you your
poor charge status and remote charge
status it will also vibrate when the
board gets to twenty-five percent charge
in the smartphone app and you can in
your speed and odometer to see your
total distance traveled
when you slow down the regenerative
braking system charges the battery
there's a USB port to charge your remote
or from wherever you go
the rubber mounted flexible batteries
deck allows for classic longboarding to
large 90 millimeter wheels provide
maximum fashion even on rough surfaces
it's so fun the way people look and
wonder how you're skating so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
