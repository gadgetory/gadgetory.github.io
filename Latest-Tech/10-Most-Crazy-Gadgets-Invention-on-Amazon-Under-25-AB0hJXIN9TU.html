Open Sesame
sesame is what's called a smartlock
which means you can unlock it using your
phone as the key I've tried other smart
laws they're way too big
they're apps are confusing they take too
long to connect and they're hassle to
install I'm pretty handy sesame is
different you can install it in seconds
literally no one's screwing no replacing
sesame has a patented design that fits
any latch anywhere in the world the app
is handsome and intuitive but you can
open your door without it like this or
like this
sesame senses when my phone is nearby
and gets ready for my special knock
and I can get the optional Wi-Fi access
point it plugs into the wall nearby so
sesame is always on my home network and
it's linked to the access point with
Bluetooth which keeps it connected while
going easy on the batteries there with
no keys it's easy to let other people in
- I can choose who has access and who
doesn't
I get notifications when my lock opens
and closes so I can always know what's
going on no matter where I am and it's
got military-grade encryption
no one's hacking this thing Open Sesame
