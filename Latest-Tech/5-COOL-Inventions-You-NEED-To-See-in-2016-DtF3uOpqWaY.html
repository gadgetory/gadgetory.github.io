far away you are from your items and
with the tap of your finger you can ring
the device and find the lost item in
seconds and it works both ways
if you can't find your phone press the
button on the device and cause your
phone to ring

goes missing the app notifies our crowd
GPS Network to search for your lost item

there are moments in life that you never
want to forget when you take a picture
you know the place the people around you
the landscape and the details a couple
of days later and you'll forget most of
it a couple of years later and you
probably can't even remember where the
photo was taken your memory is gone
wouldn't it be great to have a camera
that captures everything you experience
with your friends and family and that
lets you and your friends reacts
perience those moments later when you
spend time with your mates and loved
ones wouldn't it be great to be able to
relive the atmosphere of that day when
someone you love creates something great
wouldn't it be nice to discover things
that you hadn't even noticed when you
took a photo
hi I'm Eunice creator of the panda know
camera a camera that can do exactly
these things it captures everything in
every direction all at once and it has a
super-high resolution of 72 megapixels
it uses 36 tiny but powerful cameras
that fire all at once you just throw
them to the air and at the highest point
when it is barely moving it captures a
fully spherical panoramic image
automatically to view the images you
simply point the smartphone or tablet in
the direction you want to see and move
it around
it's amazing absolutely he built the
original prototype two years ago back
then it was called throwable panoramic
ball camera he put a video of it on
YouTube which was viewed nearly three
and a half million times we got a lot of
great press coverage but most
importantly we got thousands of emails
from people wanting to buy the camera at
that time and in that form it was too
expensive for mass production so we sat
down to develop a new camera that is
small affordable and useful
Bakara the new design
recorded the panel or camera the camera
is tough so you can throw it in the air
and even drop it on occasion
there are several easy ways to use it
firstly of course by throwing it but you
can also put it on the stick and hold it
in the air or simply hold it in your
hand and press a button to make a
picture all the panoramic images in this
video was shot with our prototype the
new design will have the same
functionality but is much smaller and
tougher I was very much impressed by the
360-degree concept you catch the moment
with all the things around you now
everybody can discover the whole
situation
I support the team to ensure a seamless
process from the original idea to the
finished serious product we have a
working prototype and a great new design
and review help we can finish the
development and manufacture of the
camera by September support us and be
one of the first to own a panono camera

you
I think the key problem is you walk into
a meeting room with a presentation and
instead of worrying about your pitch
about what you need to get across you're
worried about can i connect can I get it
working that's that's a problem that you
shouldn't have to worry about I was
trying to do a presentation to basically
our entire company including the CEO but
I wanted to turn my laptop around to
show people actually what was on my
laptop screen and as I was doing that
the HDMI cable actually broke off in my
computer and I went oh this is not good
but that is the end of the presentation
here we are demoing their air tamed
technology where we're basically cutting
cables and streaming wirelessly from all
platforms
you basically just talk in an air tame
into the screen and then it's one click
from here we're connecting two I have a
stream and as you can see there's
nothing clocked in to the computer and
the latency is also pretty great so
that's
that's what we're doing here at CU weak
air team cutting cables work better
wirelessly and that's it I was an intern
in an office last summer I was
responsible for setting up the
presentation I always had confusion with
the wires and when it wasn't working it
was on my back and I was trying to
figure it out and I think something like
this would make that so much easier
they're a pain he had to put these on
through these stupid things and they're
kind of garbage pretty pretty old-school
actually my roommate in college did and
have one of these rip off of the side of
his computer and we kind of use it
anymore so yeah yeah I don't like cables
it's cool because I mean you can use it
on any device any OS I think that's
that's the beauty of it you don't need
to worry about anything you should plug
it in and then it's being mirrored I
think it's cool
you know in the office you never I spent
15 minutes setting up wires and fumbling
around and trying to connect the most
important thing is to do is if you can
eliminate them so you can live without
that it's one less thing for you to
worry about your life
why is everybody talking about it is
this revolutionary portable charger the
reason why people are staring
this is I try and know when it is why
should I make this one well other
portable chargers take hours to charge
themselves back up with icon it only
takes 18 minutes to reach a full charge
what does that matter to me well imagine
this your phone suddenly rings while
you're taking a refreshing morning
shower rush out being told that your
meeting has been pushed up but you need
to get out in 20 minutes and you just
realize you forgot to charge your phone
the night before you're upset but you
remember your portable charger badly
your portable charger hasn't been used
in a while and you totally forgot to
recharge it you are screwed
but with Itron it's a little different
let's start over your phone simply rings
while you're taking a refreshing morning
shower and rush out being told that your
meeting has been pushed up you realize
you just forgot to charge your phone the
night before you're upset but you
remember your Itron charger even if you
forget to recharge it you can simply dot
act onto it space you can enjoy your
breakfast while it's charging and in
only 18 minutes it gives you a fully
charged 9000 milliamp per hour
portable charger that can charge your
iPhone or other similar device about
three times over
you can simply grab it and charge your
phone whenever you want what if it's an
emergency you don't have that 18 minutes
well when you use your phone a lot for
games apps social media online dating
and such it loses a lot of power while
it's losing power your boss calls you
then you realize that that last phone
call made up all of your phone's power
you don't have time to charge your phone
or recharge your dead portable charger
you have to go out with your dead phone
and then you're screwed but with Itron
when you use your phone a lot it dies
and your phone dies you need your Itron
even if you forget to recharge your
Itron you just put it back on the base
only a couple of minutes later Itron has
the power to fully charge your phone you
can just grab the Mingo
oh yeah I'm right here sir what else
they ask if you have kids yes I do have
kids
