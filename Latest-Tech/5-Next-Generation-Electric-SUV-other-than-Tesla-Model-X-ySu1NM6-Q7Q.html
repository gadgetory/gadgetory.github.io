than the Tesla Model X hi y'all latest
tech here bringing you you guessed it
the latest tech out there when anyone
mentions electric cars almost everyone
thinks Tesla it's because it's the first
and most well known and only because of
this we won't be looking at the new
Tesla X we here at latest tech try to
find the new stuff out there but the
Tesla X is a great model that's
definitely worth a mention
and a look if you're interested in
electric cars one bite on let's start
things off proper with white on a
Chinese electric company and the bite on
em bite is the electric SUV they came up
with it comes with a 48 inch wide
touchscreen that is way more like a
touchscreen computer in functionality
with a touch keyboard and the car has an
inbuilt face recognition camera for user
and identification it has a lot of
information displayed on the screens and
comes with a nice selection of features
and design aesthetics like rear and side
view cameras that completely replace the
mirror versions and disappearing door
handles hidden antennas and a sleek
sloping roofline voice and gesture
control technology is installed so you
don't have to touch the screen while you
drive for a much safer driving
experience it even connects with smart
devices like phone or smartwatches and
can share and send information to other
screens or even other devices the best
part is that you can use the full screen
for a video to get the full car cinema
experience remember those it is expected
to have a starting price of forty five
thousand US dollars and a 250 mile range
that's upgradeable to three hundred and
twenty three months and will be in mass
production around mid 2019 in China and
will arrive in the United States by 2022
Geo Peng Moltres
let's stay in China for a bit and look
at another Chinese manufacturer Xiaoping
motors
and their electric SUV the Jeep ng3 it's
like the Tesla Model S and X it has a
very large vertical touchscreen next to
the steering wheel that looks more like
a tablet its biggest features is that
its many sensors and radars giving the
car a 360 awareness of up to 10 meters
away it uses this to do the most sci-fi
thing you can think of other than flying
drive and park itself jeeping g3 is a
self-driving and best of all in my
opinion self-parking car it uses its 360
sensing and radar technology to scan and
even judge parking spots you drive by
seeing if the space is big enough and
even if it's a handicap spot or not and
you can even tell it to just park with
the remote control key or on its app
that's just amazing I love this it's
able to self drive and even auto break
when its front sensors are tripped by
things like cars cyclists or even people
not only that but it's even self
navigates taking traffic free routes if
possible it has a range of 365
kilometers with 200 horsepower and
reaches 0 to 100 km/h in 7.9 seconds it
even has a facial recognition technology
and can even memorize your preferred
settings like your seat position
it's priced at 21,000 us up to 30,000
u.s. with unfortunately no plans to ship
to international markets but they are
saying that it might still be possible
in the future the idea of self-driving
cars is one that I both love and fear at
the same time it might take me a while
to fully trust the computer to drive me
on the highway or in a crowded street
but on the other hand it would take away
the nightmare that is parking away from
me but you know I'm definitely keeping
my eye on this one just for that three
riffian
let's leave China and go to America
where the rivey an automotive company
produced the r1 s7 passenger seat
electric SUV let the previous car it
also has a bunch of radar and sensors
allowing it to also self drive to a
certain point it has a ton of room for
storage and is able to carry up to 800
kilograms of weight capacity it has a
nice 15 point seven inch big screen and
lots of room for the interior for a very
comfortable ride for the whole family
all of its important parts like
batteries motors and cooling systems are
at the very bottom of the car making its
center of gravity
very low that is very good for
off-roading since this car is much more
stable on uneven terrain no matter what
it's made of it's got a very nice range
of up to 410 miles with a fast charge
that brings it back up 200 miles in 30
minutes and it can go to zero to 60 in 3
seconds with a nice 750 horsepower using
all of its four motors still in
production but most likely will have a
starting price of up to 72 thousand five
hundred making it the priciest on this
list price is a bit high in my opinion
but I honestly think it's because of all
the extra horsepower in the weight
capacity which could be worth it if you
ever need a heavy duty car but are still
conscientious about your carbon
footprint you know I I personally would
stick to the city when driving
especially if I'm gonna drive a electric
car but there are people that love their
off-roading so this is here for them I
guess for me oak oh dang I forgot
something back in China let's go back
and while we're there I can show you one
more Chinese electric SUV the neo
company made the neo es8 the best thing
about
this is the most obvious feature the
very cute robotic AI cult know me it's
basically the in-car computer system of
all the previous cars but it talks and
has a very cute case it has sensors and
radar to let you open your trunk without
hands sends you notifications on your
app is able to close the roof of the car
when it starts to rain and even take
pictures on command it has a range of
355 miles and can reach zero to 100 in
4.4 seconds and has a maximum horsepower
of 650 some decent stats
it's priced at 68,000 for a six-seater
version and a seven-seater version for
66,000 800 know me I think is the only
reason I might buy this car over any
other on this list who doesn't want
their own talking car right now I'm not
a car person but looking at these
amazing electric cars and how much
innovation is possible now and in the
future I am seriously thinking of
switching to an electric car provided
that charging stations are everywhere
and their maintenance is not more
expensive than you know our regular cars
saving the environment is of course very
good but nothing says we can't do it and
still be comfortable and driving in
style with lots of legroom most
importantly don't forget to subscribe
and ring that notification bell and
comment to us here at latest tech so we
can know all about y'all's opinions
about these new gadgets ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
