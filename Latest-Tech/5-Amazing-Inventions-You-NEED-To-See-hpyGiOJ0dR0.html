jewelry wearables refusing art fashion
and technology look see as infinite
possibilities for your style it really
allows you to take control over your
look and over your use of functions so
this is probably going to be one of the
first commercially available flexible
displays on the market and it's always
on it's a very thin very elegant display
that just flexes around your wrist this
is artwork this is now jewel grace like
this is now very very different it's
technology that is empowering the
fashion versus the design that is
elevating the technology it's a complete
shift in paradigm I mean you're wearing
an accessory why shouldn't it look good
many of the smart watches are pretty
similar they're fairly small displays
normally off to save power I said you
know this this isn't enough the
filtering is essentially limitless you
decide what the selection criteria are
anything in your notification center on
your phone can be custom driven to your
bracelet with a glance of your wrist you
can basically see what appointments are
coming up or you can also look at the
way in which your information is
structured the convenience is really
amazing you can say i want messages from
my spouse i want my sister's facebook
and anything the keyword pizza you can
choose to only have tweets from this
person or text messages from that person
or emails from this other person appear
you can have a moving map so if you're
walking down the streets you can see
where you are and where your destination
is time different watch faces QR codes
for paying for coffee or boarding your
flight and for example activity
monitoring showing how much you've
walked at how many calories you've used
everyone who sees the bracelet loves the
slideshow you can change the image
upload a picture right text you can take
a picture of the outfit that you're
wearing so you're matching that
or if you're walking to work take a
picture of this reach graffiti and
there's something about the quality of
the screen of the e-ink display it just
has a has an appeal to it that's kind of
hard to put your finger arm if you look
at where fashion and tech are going the
tech is getting good enough and small
enough where it can basically be behind
the scenes and make it fashion or design
first your creative vision the aesthetic
vision is taking priority you take
control of your look with look see we've
got the engineering we've got the
designs and now we need your help to
make looks to your reality please help
us thanks
once upon a time in 1971 evil vieira was
born in Paris son of emigrants and
France a self-made man he began to learn
how to speak and write influenced by his
father he then learned how to fly
airplanes he developed a passion for
space and decided to become an astronaut
by the time he was 16 years before
enrolling on a PhD in plasma propulsion
evil felt he needed to become a
missionary in order to help African
persons in Mozambique back in Portugal
and still with the same dream evil
created a space company in 2002 luzhou
space after almost 12 years developing
successful projects luzhou space is
proud to have already launched 12
magnetometers and is now developing a
laser to detect the gravitational waves
predicted by Einstein although
everything was okay a big drawback
occurred in August 2012 his father began
to lose the mobility of his left arm in
February 2013 he was diagnosed with ALS
disease his mind is one hundred percent
ok but today he cannot speak because his
facial muscles do not react
hi I'm evil and i will show you why my
father's disease is an opportunity
rather than a fatality is indeed surfing
a lot because he lost control of most
part of his body for me it was difficult
to accept it to not speak anymore but
everything in life is an opportunity
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other
diseases or conditions such as locked-in
syndrome traumatic brain injury spinal
cord injuries muscular dystrophy among
others can make people lose control of
their body there are several human
interfaces that allow people in such
conditions to communicate I tracking is
one of the most promising technologies
because most of patients in these
conditions can still control their eye
movements however there are still some
problems these systems need to be
calibrated and they are not portable if
you change position you have to rely on
others to recalibrate the system besides
these systems are not very precise when
you are writing a text precision errors
can be very frustrating it's so
difficult to use the system that most of
the time I use a paper sheet and it
takes at least one minute to spell four
letters I want much better for my father
and everyone with similar situation
that's when I had the idea to use the
technology it developed for astronauts
of mounted reality augmented reality
glasses allow the user interface to
appear in the users to review no
calibration is required as the computer
vision algorithms will detect the
position of the classes relative to the
I a high speed high resolution micro
camera is used to track the I striking
is harder implemented eliminating
latency increasing users comfort this
innovative system has significant
advantages over the current ones it is
more while it doesn't need any
calibration or any space
position and it has a potential to be
much faster and precise this is what you
get a pair of glasses with a display
that will track your high and quickly
translate the letters you are looking
into spoken words to the speaker and you
can also use it to control the mouse of
your computer either with or without a
computer you will be able to navigate in
the internet to the wireless connection
of your controller will solve this
project to enable like pearls
communication via wearable device for
mega dramatic difference in my daily
life I will no longer have an
apprehension about my inability to
communicate with others while I am input
in the bathroom or away from home not
being able to communicate as a powerless
feeling but being able to wear my
communication device wherever I am
Prince the power back to me I hope that
you will consider supporting this very
important project that can help people
like me I am fully committed to improve
the quality of life of my father and all
of you and I want you to join us as you
see my father's disease is an
opportunity an opportunity because we
are developing a system that will help
ten of thousands of persons
do you want to be part of this team join
us and you will there are times when
carrying a wallet or purse is
impractical uncomfortable or just a
little bit risky so we made curve the
world's first contactless payment ring
now you can leave all this at home and
still pay for stuff with a single
gesture no pin or paired smartphone
required you can use curve to make
instant payments anywhere that displays
the contactless payment symbol which at
last count was over 38 million locations
worldwide engineered from zirconia
technical ceramic curve is hyper
allergenic nearly a scratch resistant as
diamond and waterproof and unlike
power-hungry smartphones or smartwatches
curve never needs charging but there's
more to curve than just payments if
you're in London you can simply tap in
on buses and on the Underground avoiding
card clash and that frenzied search the
barrier field ticket or oyster card you
can also store contact details to share
with friends or colleagues at the tap of
an NFC enabled phone and you can even
use curve to operate an NFC door lock to
access your home or office hi
Kickstarter's I'm Phil Campbell found of
curve we need your help we've spent over
a year developing curve making the most
convenient and intuitive payment method
possible and a piece of wearable
technology that looks and feels as good
as it works our next step is to take
curve to mass production we can't do it
on our own that's why we're launching on
Kickstarter because we want to build a
community that takes the journey with us
and to help us continually improve our
products there's no better way of
achieving istam with Kickstarter because
it attracts for thinking individuals
early adopters and people who are
passionate about making new things
happen that sounds like you we'd love to
have you along for the journey
you
I guess nothing hey mother CEO off next
song as I passionate about the sports
and music I always train listening to
music espero online or driven of the
sound I used to wear headphones as I
thought it was the only way of enjoying
my music while exercising it all chains
one morning when it was for my early run
I didn't hear a car approaching and it
almost knocked me down after recording
from the show I went to running but with
the headphone around my neck like a
necklace in that precise moment I
realized that this was possible to hear
the music probably without blocking my
ears making is possible to stay aware of
the world surrounding me I felt safe and
comfortable and the sense of freedom and
towards me to keep on trying that's how
i came up with the idea of exile since
the very first moment everything about
next sound is focused on delivering
amazing sound freedom of movement and
comfort the necks out team has been
working with a unique code to create
these martyrs on the cold music device
it's one of us would love to where we
think of next song as a complete a sport
accessory a wireless standalone music
device to a store hours of your favorite
music hands-free kit to move freely
while connected and with a lighter gonna
make and intuitive design if comfort on
design are important even more is
technology the main engineering
challenge has been to get together so
many features in a live thin and
flexible device neck sound is awesome
for sports and great for everything else
in daily life we haven't even all in one
wearable that provides us with premium
audio
blocking our ears next sound speakers
are designed to focus high-quality sound
on the ear so we can enjoy open and
music without disturbing people around
us peek at others we need your support
to help remix on to life so if you like
challenges doing this today back of our
project and collect within next sound
while experience we will be proud you
become an essential part of our team
with your help we can revolutionize the
way people enjoy music parkinson's
disease affects 10 million people
worldwide making it impossible to treat
each and every person the sufficient
level of care if therefore becomes
increasingly difficult to accurately
prescribe medications and get quick
feedback about how well medications are
working that's why I built one ring
which is an intelligent tool for
monitoring Parkinson's
with one ring we look to revolutionize
the way Parkinson's patients interact
with their physicians a patient can pair
their ring to an iOS device using low
Bluetooth energy technology and start
their day as they would any other day
wondering then captures movement data
for their entire day in order to detect
all possible motor distortions present
in the disease when a patient decides to
finish their day our signal processing
driven machine learning algorithms
analyzer I acceleration data to identify
unique Parkinson's movement patterns
such as Brady canisius dyskinesia and
tremor with its powerful classification
engine wandering predicts the severity
of motor symptoms at each and every hour
of the day based on patterns displayed
in real Parkinson's patients during the
model training process these
classifications generate a smart patient
report including date stamps time stamps
and hourly movements abilities that a
patient can view on their smartphone
this report is additionally sent to the
patient's physician we can analyze the
quantified results to alter medication
dosages and timings with the top of a
button a patient can view all of their
daily reports and see how their motor
symptoms are progressing therefore
wondering not only provides vital
quantification of Parkinson's it defines
an entirely new way to monitor the
disease's most common symptoms we now
have a completed product but we need
your help to bring one ring to
Parkinson's patients all around the
world your funding will allow us to go
into production and deploy several rings
at nearby clinical centers for
parkinson's with this we hope to make
dealing with movement disorders far more
efficient by providing a novel
quantified metric for grading symptoms
we hope that you'll be able to join us
in our journey of improving the daily
life of a Parkinson's patient and we
look forward to seeing your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
