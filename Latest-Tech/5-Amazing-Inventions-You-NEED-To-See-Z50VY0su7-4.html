to hold a heavy awkward object in place
for minutes at a time with Nuria
installation is a one-person job storage
is easy allowing you to keep it under
the bed when not needed
noria renew your VA
we are an established product
development team in Philadelphia with
experience in bringing product designs
from concept to production our team
members have decades of experience in
engineering highly technical products
with expertise in thermal engineering
and aerodynamics electrical engineering
and industrial design for the past two
years we've been developing nuria from
the ground up along the way we've
developed numerous prototypes as we
perfected the technology we're ready to
make the next step and bring it into
production now we need your help to
bring it to your home
before heard that sleep is important or
that we spend a third of our life in bed
but quality sleep is rarely what we need
and it seems harder and harder to
achieve these days what if your pillow
could be an active participant in your
sleep rather than just a dumb rectangle
what if your pillow could help you fall
asleep
who could analyze your sleep
intelligently wake you up or even react
to when you snore here we believe a
pillow should do that that's why we
invented Z the world's most
sophisticated pillow the easiest way to
think about what Zeke does is to walk
you through how you would use thee
before you go to bed you'll open up the
Z cap you're gonna set your alarm answer
a few optional questions about your day
even choose what kind of music you want
to listen to Zeke will wirelessly stream
your favorite music whether it's iTunes
Spotify or some of the included sleep
tracks to eight precision place speakers
inside once your sleep timer goes off
zeke starts monitoring and analyzing
your sleep as well as listening for
snoring
if Zeke detects your snoring too loud
it'll subtly vibrate to encourage you to
change sleep positions additionally when
it's time to wake up is equal vibrate
again to make sure you wake up exactly
when you want it to but what's really
neat is with our smart wake feature
since we're already analyzing your sleep
we can tell if you should wake up a
little earlier than your alarm
I needed music to fall asleep at night
but my wife needs absolute silence so
one night I took apart a pair of
wireless headphones and shoved them
inside my pillow and to my surprise I
was able to hear the music but my wife
wasn't I knew his own to something so I
began to figure out how I could make
this pillow better
Zeke's packed with amazing innovations
and technology in order to make all of
this happen we use 8 speakers inside of
Z so the sleeper can experience their
sleep playlist no matter how they lay on
their pillow Zeke also features a 3-axis
gyroscope to analyze motion in
three-dimensional space um this is going
to allow for detailed analysis of your
sleep the microphone in Z is so
sensitive it can determine to the
decibel level how loudly your snoring
if you do begin snoring Zico used its
vibration motors to gently nudge you to
encourage you to change sleep position Z
can wake you up either at your set alarm
time or using smart wake wake you up
based on your sleep cycle all the xik
settings can be personalized to your
specific sleep needs in the app any time
we went through many different component
designs to come up with a pillow that
was not only smart and sophisticated but
also incredibly comfortable for the
sleeper comfort is one of the most
important aspects when choosing a pillow
and as we tested various fabrics for the
outer cover of Zeke we found that
tensile was the perfect choice we spent
the last two years making Zeke our
favorite pillow and it's nearly ready
for you
all the hard work is being done the
prototypes finalized the supplies are
lined up we just need your help to start
mass production please help us bring
Zeke to you thank you for your support
when you're fishing and you know you you
get a bite and and you hook on a fish
and you're reeling that sucker and you
have all that action throughout that
process but then when you catch the fish
you know you take a picture with it you
smile for the camera and you share that
to all your friends saying look at this
cat so we want to make it so that you
can share the actual action go fish cam
Incorporated was developed by me and my
brother and then we developed it to be a
technology for what we found to be an
underserved market there are camera
technologies or fish finders in the
market but what we found was they're not
capturing where the action was and by
seeing which baits are attracting fish
and how a fish might strike just having
the data and learning about those
aspects of fishing will allow you to
make better decisions in what to use and
why and when that's something that it's
very hard to do without an application
like this one of the key features is
that it sits on the line and it works
with your fishing line so it's not gonna
obstruct how you fish or your fishing
style and top of that we have infrared
and green lighting around the camera
room so that you can fish during
nighttime wearing darker lighting and
then we also have the depth of it so
that you can go up to 150 meters
underwater as well as the ability to
last for four hours so we really put in
a lot of work into making sure that when
they go fish that their dignities go
fish camp when we started the project
with Go Fish we broke down the process
into multiple steps we started initially
with a conceptual design looking at the
product from a both a visual as well as
a future benefit standpoint it was
important to us that we had a premium
product that had future benefits that
just weren't available on the market
currently in terms of looking forward to
production the three-dimensional CAD and
mechanical drawings are all completed
the coding for the app is completed at
this point we're really just using
Kickstarter to get ourselves into
production and get this product out into
the marketplace this is a new product
that a lot of people are excited about
and by their support and their backing
of us it's going to allow us to get to
the next step so that we can share our
vision with the world as well it's an
awesome technology that allow you to
caPSURE kind of action-packed footage
and share it with your friends and
family and it definitely bring a lot of
the excitement to the industry
sometimes we want to be in two places at
once to have more time for true values

wireless device that offers a wide range

Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas
and esto you're so extremely impressed
by what frantic picture in November 2014
we'll presented the work and credit type
of front at the representative that will

Bronto is more than just a technological
device that makes us smarter and easier

for us design is like looking at the
details in everyday life and to keep
making them better we're never satisfied
and neither should you
there are no boundaries for the
imagination inspiration can come from
anywhere
pill is one of the coolest sunglasses
you'll ever have it's not just a regular
falling sunglasses it was made from the
best materials from Switzerland called
tr90 which is used in other leading
brands we also applied the best lenses
using anti effects of hydrophobic
coating best of all with the automatic
unfold mechanism you can simply unfold
the glasses from 0.05 seconds our team
worked closely together every level from
the design and 3d modeling to the
material and manufacturing process we
knew is going to be hard but we did it
I've always been fascinated by
freerunning it's such an exciting
spectacle to watch and this sport was
actually the key inspiration behind
Hills
we challenge the status quo to go beyond
limits
foldable portable perfect for traveling
and outdoor activities its water
repellent lens is made to suit any
sports I think you'll agree we have
reinvented folding sunglasses we are
really looking forward to this project
