problem that we all have you see I love
driving but I also love my phone and
when the two come together I find that
I'm constantly distracted and I can't
keep my eyes on the road I've never had
an accident but I have come really close
this inspired us to create bluej the
world's first smart mount
we live in a fast-moving world where
there's only somewhere we need to be and
sometimes we can't really see the way or
find our car well bluejay uses a hybrid
of Bluetooth smart and GPS so it will
always guide you back to your car

every day 80% of Americans driving on
our roads can't see behind them when
they're parking so we decided to look
into why more people didn't have parking
sensor solutions available on their car
and what we found was that it was too
expensive or is much too difficult to
install you practically had to be a car
guide to install it yourself so we made
the world's simplest and easiest
solution yet to hit the market
introducing bent cents the world's first
smart parking device the embedded
ultrasonic sensors can detect any object
within three meters of the car's front
or back blind spots we use an
accelerometer detect when the car is
backing up and then use bluetooth to
automatically launch the app on the
drivers phone we've designed a
completely seamless experience that
requires no interaction on behalf of the
driver the device itself installs in
less than five minutes with absolutely
no wiring and only four security screws
to prevent that it's so easy
your grandma can do it
the device itself knows when your car's
backing up
and immediately launches the app on the
drivers home providing audio-visual and
vibration alerts for optics and your
client spots
Oh

and easiest parking sensor solution
available on the market today and we
need your help to make this product a

while it's lit up to silence it take the
speed trap is no longer there double tap
