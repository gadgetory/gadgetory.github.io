stay closely connected with the world
our business emails messages from loved
ones our whereabouts and personal
information or requires the smartphone
to be readily available to us so we buy
chargers and we buy power banks which
will come with bulky adapters and messy
cables and we lug all this equipment
around for that one moment the moment we
need power the most and it takes forever
to give enough charge to finish off that
mail will check your whereabouts worst
of all when you want to charge you
realize that you have left the cable
attached somewhere while you took the
bulky back power bank out of your bag
because it is so heavy for the past few
months we have worked on designing
something that is minimal to carry and
gives the user and ultra fast charge
we have come up with the rocket the
rocket is a power man that is smaller
than your business card and fits in all
pockets next the highly pushing
resistant aluminum casing gives rocket
lasting durability and heat dissipation
then we designed the smallest possible
control circuitry that delivers up to
five times faster charge than other
products on the market with all the
electrical and overheating protection on
board last but not least we fitted the
rocket with a heavy-duty core battery
that would give you more than 500 charge
cycles not to mention materials that
prevent against fire and battery leaks
there's more the rocket is international
aviation regulation compliant making a
traveler friendly as well the rocket
prototype is now finalized and we need
your support to start the final
production phase the rocket campaign is
exclusively on IndieGoGo and we hope you
will like it rocket micro power bank
power when you need it the most
the most important part of the bike that
it's really light it's 6.5 kilograms and
I can actually lift it up in one finger
which is amazing peter is not just the
product design fanatic but he's also mad
about bikes so these two elements
combined became the hummingbird bike
we're looking to buy a folding bike that
weighs less than 12 kilograms and we
couldn't find one so then Peter thought
he could actually make one and then we
thought we could actually mass-produce
this and help other people who are in
the same situation as we were you carry
it with you all the time you take it on
the cube on my way back home because
it's a long commute I can take it in the
elevator then you save a lot of space
and also my commute is more enjoyable
the invention that we patented for the
hummingbird bike is the way it falls it
uses a unique folding system which moves
the pivotal folding to the center of the
bottom bracket by doing this the chain
is always in tension and you can always
hold it in the chain will never drop we
started with it yellow because we wanted
it to pop and have something to say so
that people actually notice it on the
street also it's customizable so you can
have it in four different colors red
black yellow or pure carbon fiber feels
amazing carbon fiber is a lot better
than alloy or titanium it's absorbed
vibrations of the road that means it's
incredibly strong but also incredibly
light it has a really unique design that
doesn't resemble anything on the market
and we were hoping that it becomes
an iconic design in bikes the response
has been amazing people are stopping us
on the street asking us where they can
buy the bike they can't believe how
light it is also they love it because
it's really bold it has a very
interesting shape we made this bike
because we know there are people out
there who are looking for a lightweight
folding bike that looks good so that's
why I put a lot of thought into how it
looks and how it feels and rice it's not
just a functional bike you can actually
showcase your personality through it we
are ready to go we have a manufacturing
partner and we have a prototype and we
can just launch it straight away where
we wanted to share with the world and
there's no better place and Kickstarter
to find people who want to invest in
your idea so mainly we want your support
because we know there are people out
there who want folding bikes at our
light but there's nothing like that on
the market and that's why you should
invest in or buy
lipstick to you actually it's a
barometer of what is it a firm ometer it
helps women who are ready to get
pregnant or not it does bolt how can it
do both it takes your lowest body
temperature every morning and then it
sinks it automatically to your phone
tracking where you are in your fertility
cycle this little thing can do all that
the thermometer knows when you're
ovulating which makes getting pregnant
or not getting pregnant a little easier
okay it does both too bad I can't send
me pms alert actually it can and the fam
ometer can help you know if your periods
going to be earlier late and you can
share the information with a doctor or
spouse I made these cupcakes things are
going really well I'm dating just check
the app to put around your cycle there's
enough to buy a lot of data to try oh hi
queer no no no no no no it's easy and if
the date is green
hi the date is blue chances of pregnancy
or love
but how accurate is the thermometer the
thermometers readings are accurate to
within one hundredth of a degree isn't
that like too much accuracy why don't we
just use a regular thermometer way more
than a thermometer the thermometer can
detect the smallest variation in your
fertility cycle so we can finally be in
control of our data and our body
looking a thermometer help us get
pregnant just hypothetically thermometer
works for me and now I'm getting 42 no
big sis it really do games nada skills
thank you yeah you big enough fork for
that
hey Kickstarter you might remember us
from our last power cap campaign having
raised more than eight hundred percent
of our funding level since five years we
have been developing solar bags and
backpacks and became europe's number one
in mobile energy supply
we think about the environment we think
about power and we want to raise
awareness for one hundred percent clean
energy because our ecosystem is part of
the larger one therefore we develop a
technology to make your energy visible
to Sonny Beck smart battery
the smart battery charges your
smartphone on the go and provides
revolutionary features that faciliate
your daily life with the built-in
Bluetooth connection you can wirelessly
control your camera and shoot great
selfies from a distance it's also genius
when it comes to security if you forget
your bag or in case of theft you will be
warned automatically
of course you can charge the smart
battery with any standard outlet but
it's more sustainable with our sandy
back solar systems see how much green
energy you produce and additional
battery time you generate for your
mobile devices share your green
activities with your friends and get a
lot of lights
in addition to our smart battery we
offer three exclusive bundles with our
sunny big solar systems on Kickstarter
only
the sunny Pig needs is the world's
lightest flexible solar system that will
support you during your outdoor
activities if you need solar power for
your business life choose our business
class made out of genuine Calif leather
or you choose our solar backpack and
never ever bother about empty batteries
again the first step toilets are green
future starts here so please join our
green community now and be the first to
get the smart battery here on
Kickstarter
that is it time to get up yet
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
