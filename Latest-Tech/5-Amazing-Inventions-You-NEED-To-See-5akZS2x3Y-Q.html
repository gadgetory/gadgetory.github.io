also use high capacity or size circles
to support various functions like my

commercial
lolis picture transition and the
Keystone correction there's not always a
perfect place for your projector so we
built the Aurora with Keystone
correction software you can get a
straight on image even if you're
projecting from any angle most of us
used to work for traditional TV company
below that the widescreen elevations in
the market are too heavy and too
expensive so we went to produce simple
smart and a football widescreen TV with
this in mind
after two years developing and more than
hundred Atem of 15 way family make out
the day for Aurora we have already
received lots of positive feedback
because that more people ajaan us to
change the way we watch and sings and
you a part of our team project what are
you our imagination
you
you
hi everyone I'm Jesse and I'm Jonathon
smartphones are equipped with advanced
camera technology but they're primarily
designed as a phone and not as a camera
so videos and photos can often come out
shaky blurry and a poor quality so two
years ago we started working on this
idea but we think you're going to love a
device that maximizes the camera
potential of your smartphone or GoPro
and produces amazing quality videos and
photographs we are happy to now finally
shared with you here is the India vice
the in device transforms your Android or
Apple smartphone and GoPro into a
handheld camera
it's lightweight ergonomic design
perfectly mimics the natural hold of a
professional camera and brings it to the
smartphone arena its eyepiece was
created to use one's body as the main
stabilizing force for a perfect handheld
shot the viewfinder allows you to adjust
the optics to your particular eye sight
and helps you focus the image with great
precision as well as calibrate the
exposure even under something if this is
too light I can put a monopod on it and
I can pretend to have a low-budget
Steadicam if I'm using it at at a low
angle you can add a monitor the fact
that you guys made this for other
professional accessories is kind of the
next step off
the art of videography and photography
requires the use of different lenses and
with the N device you can now use your
smartphone with almost any lens you
choose
and for the GoPro user we've equipped
the in device with a GoPro camera mount
now you can use the GoPro as a regular
camera and add beautiful GoPro handheld
shots to all your movies
and in situations where you need to
monitor the picture the old way we have
also added a swivel functionality for
you to be able to alternate between the
viewfinder and direct monitoring but
perhaps the most exciting feature we
have added to the in device is the
wireless zoom and record button
controller which can be moved to the
handle as well as to the main body you
can now control your smartphone without
touching the screen while getting those
below the knee and above the shoulder
shots that were difficult to get before
you
this actually will make a lot of young
filmmakers make films in yeah you just
fill you put it next to your eye oh man
my is really cool where can you find
this so that's the in device our team
has over 25 years of experience in
professional videography and photography
for the past 10 years we have also
focused on design and innovation in
these fields and we're now ready for
production but to get there we have to
order expensive molds and to take
advantage of large volume discounts we
need to raise additional capital it's
been an amazing journey and we hope that
you can join us by packing this project
and becoming part of the in device
revolution
