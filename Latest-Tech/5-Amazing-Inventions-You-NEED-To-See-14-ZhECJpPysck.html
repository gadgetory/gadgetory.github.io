out I'm Ken and I'm Scott and the
product is the human wallet after
traveling to various parts of the world
we realized the current wallets out
there just don't seem to make a lot of
sense My partner and I came up with the
human wallet while we were traveling
because we kind of saw a need for a
wallet that did what she wanted it to do
but at the same time wouldn't blow out
your pockets while you're carrying it
around we've pretty much tried every
type of wallet money clip out there
while some are good at a few things we
got frustrated because most of them
simply suck what we realized after
trying out various types of wallets and
money clips and credit card cases was
that they were great at a couple things
but they weren't able to do everything
let's face it the day is a fat bulky
wallet and money clips are gone well
they should be we came up with the human
wallet we wanted to create a wallet that
would last a long time and wouldn't wear
out
so while leather wallets are great they
don't do that well in you know dramatic
climates whether it's really warm or
really cold or very humid we wanted a
wallet that would be able to withstand
you know pretty much anything that you
could throw at it the human wall can
function is either a stripped down or a
full wallet it's not only fully
customizable from two plates to a single
plate depending on how active you are
you can either use the two plates for
daily use or you can break it down to a
single plate with the elastic shock
strap just to carrying your cash and
maybe one or two cards we have two
versions aircraft-grade aluminum and
carbon fiber they not only look awesome
but will also protect against RFID
skimming theft our Phi T stands for
radio frequency identification what
you're seeing more and more today are
credit cards and driver's licenses that
have these radio frequency
identification chips inside the cards
you don't have to worry about someone
with an RFID scanner basically skimming
your numbers and information from your
credit cards as well as your driver's
license which are also now embedded with
RFID chips how cool is that
the low-profile minimalist design has
plenty of room for your cash credit
cards business cards and ID's it will
hold everything that you currently carry
with you so you really don't need to
carry a wallet or a money clip and a
business card case the human wall was
designed to be an extension of who you
are a wallet you can customize and make
personal by mixing and matching the
color plates one of the great things
about this wallet is that with the
aluminum plates we have you know
different colors that you can customize
it to any way that you want using
different colors of the plates as well
as the straps and with that
customization it allows you to show your
personality at the same time it's highly
functional we see guys using it we see
women using it everybody you know that
needs a wallet meets all our needs and
actually does what today's active person
requires in a wallet
for examples were the world's most
stylish and handy wallets
we added exquisite operating
characteristics and a practical design a
via door is not just a practical and
beautiful accessory but also a
multifunctional device with a set of
absolutely unique features it's a
totally new kind of accessory that you
have never seen before the trekking
option will prevent you from losing
sight of your wallet and losing your
money and valuable information the
connection works both ways not only can
you find your wallet using your mobile
phone which you can also find your
mobile phone using your wallet how the
adorn can tell you when your wallet is
being opened you don't need to worry
about your wallet in your mobile phone
you'd better take care of yourself in
case of a dangerous event you can calmly
give the mugger your wallet after you
break one of its corners this panic
button will activate the SOS regime
immediately showing the location of the
mugger this data could be used to help
the police to notify your relatives or
for your own personal use that's not all
one of the while its features is a
built-in NFC chip which means that you
can pay for your purchases provide
personal information from your business
card and so on
check out the NFC options a via door is
also equipped to be used as an
electronic key we designed the wallet
with you in mind and we didn't forget
your information storage needs a via
door has an 8 gigabyte memory card built
in we are sure this will be the most
original and useful present for a person
you care about a present that shows you
have an amazing sense of style when
designing the wallet we paid particular
attention to the quality the wallet is
handmade we use cold aletter leather
which is perhaps the finest leather in
the world we apply rigorous quality
standards to the metal part of the
wallet that contains the digital
information of the device and the memory
card this will make your wallet truly
unique durable and very stylish
you
what if you could charge your phone
wireless headphones to another gear with
something you already carry your wallet
for something we bring everywhere we
believe while it should be way more
useful so we set out to design an
entirely new everyday carry for the
mobile era focused on cards power and
NFC the result is pocket pocket is an
entirely new way to stay charged it
packs an ultra-thin battery and has two
integrated cables to charge iPhones
Android devices and thousands of
accessories it's the only emergency
charger that's always with you and
pocket is not just the best charger it's
also the best wallet thanks to a special
spring-loaded mechanism you can access
all your cards with one finger pocket
also has an exterior card holder for
instant NFC payments and chickens and a
flexible quick strap that's super
convenient for storing cash we managed
to squeeze all these features into a
slim lightweight design that's thin on
an irregular wallet and slides right
into your front pocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
