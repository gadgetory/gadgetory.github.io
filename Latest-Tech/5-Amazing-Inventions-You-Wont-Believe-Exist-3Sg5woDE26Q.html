connector for iphone 7 because Apple is
combine the audio jack and the power
jack into one connector on the iphone 7
we are now able to give you a magnetic
connector to connect your data audio and
fast charging in a single click it's
never been more convenient magnetic
connectors are vastly superior than
mechanical connector not only are they
way more convenient views
they're also far more resistant to dust
water and other contaminants all this
added reliability can greatly improve
your peace of mind our engineering team
has worked very hard to make this
connector as small as possible we have
also developed a tumor board connector
that works with Android and Apple device
we have already successfully completed a
pilot manufacturing run of over 1,000
units we have done extensive testing to
ensure their reliability over extended
use if you're interested please contact
us now for our early review program
please support us and make this a
reality you cannot do it without you
revolt is proof that a personal aircraft
can be easy to fly comfortable and
affordable all at the same time
imagine flying over mountains lakes
rivers and traffic jams our aim has been
to create a futuristic means of
transport that is as efficient as it is
easy to use
revolt needs only one-tenth the energy
used by the most efficient vertical
takeoff and landing aircraft and is more
eco-friendly than any other wheeled
vehicle electric or non-current
airplanes also need complex logistics
Frederick transport and huge areas for
takeoff and landing where volt needs
less than 50 metres and can be
transported in any kind of car revolt
has been classified as a parameter which
means it is not subject to many of the
regulations for other motorised aircraft
even though revolt is a revolutionary
paramotor with improved quality and
safety it can be used in any
conventional paramotor course
reaching the stream has not been easy
and required years of hard work with our
own cash to evolve from a lab prototype
to a real commercial product we need
your help when you join our Kickstarter
campaign you become part of revolts
production and engineering process
believe in the freedom to move in a
better future personal flight for
everyone be part of the revolution
hi I'm Dave I like to make things for
the longest time I've been looking for a
building system that's strong yet
convenient and affordable problem is I
just couldn't find what I was looking
for so I created makeup I it's simple
affordable easy-to-use system of
connectors that pairs with inexpensive
electrical conduit the result is a
building platform with endless
possibilities it's a smart elegant way
to create what you love let me tell you
the things you can make with it are
infinite so if you're like John and need
to support your leisurely hobbies cheers
or if you go for something a little bit
more on the extreme side let's see what
you got
so I guess what I'm saying is mega pipe
is fun the only limit to what you can
use it for is your imagination our
desire was not only to make something
endlessly creative but also affordable
which we did and here's how electrical
conduit is an extremely inexpensive type
of metal pipe that electricians use all
the time you can find it at almost any
hardware store the maker pipe connector
system turns that conduit into one of
the most versatile and cost-effective
building materials you can find but not
only is maker pipe easy to build and
adjust it's completely reusable so build
something you love and if you get tired
of it turn it into something else and
when you get tired of that well you get
the picture transforming it from one
thing to the next or even breaking it
down to move it is as easy as turning a
hex bolt making it extremely portable
but this portability doesn't mean you
have to sacrifice the integrity of your
bills maker pipe is super strong and
durable to demonstrate we had the
biggest guy we know stand on it and then
we gave them an engine yes yes thank you
thank you mr. president we've all
received some great feedback on these
connectors makers love it students and
educators love it robotics teams love it
hackerspaces love it and we know that
once you get your hands on it you're
going to love it too with your help we
can put these connectors into mass
production and start you on your way to
making your very own designs of reality
so check out the building kits we have
available through our Kickstarter and
join our maker community back maker pipe
today so we can make these connectors
and you can make well anything you want
when we're properly hydrated we feel
better think better look better we just
are better level is not just another
fitness tracker it is the first and only
wearable to measure your hydration
letting you know precisely how much
water you need to feel and perform your
best level also measures your heart rate
sleep quality calories activity and mood
and can integrate all of that
information to show you what kind of
improvements you can see both in your
sleep and during exercise almost all of
us at some point during the day are
dehydrated and those little gaps and
staying up when your hydration needs
have consequences you could lose
concentration and can have an effect on
your mood it could affect your sleep
when you first wake up in the morning
your first thing should be to go grab a
glass of water you'll find that maybe
you'll need as much coffee and you
definitely won't need as much food water
will level set actually just how hungry
you are so it prevents overheating by
drinking more water you suddenly have
more energy what do you have more energy
for working out and when you're working
out you have better endurance your
joints and your muscles don't hurt as
much and you don't feel as much pain the
effect of that workout is continuing on
throughout the day you're wearing more
calories now that you've done the work
out studies have shown if you were
hydrated throughout the day it's better
for your sleep and you're going to be
more rest in so you have to see all of
this as part of a whole what I like
about level
is it gives you the data and says this
is how much you need to get balanced in
life level was designed for twenty-four
seven where and can learn your activity
and hydration habits not only trending
them but identifying patterns that are
keeping you from your best most consumer
wearable devices can only measure a
fraction of the metrics that are
important to us so we focused on
research we turn to the world of medical
devices where accuracy and precision are
tightly monitored now we've developed a
revolutionary red light technology that
can look ten times deeper into the body
measuring 10 times what any other sensor
can all with industry-leading accuracy
we're excited to return to Kickstarter
with level our mission is to
revolutionize wearable health and
performance no matter if you live to
train or trying to live we can't wait to
see what you'll accomplish by measuring
what really matters
typing on the keyboard of an apple to
see computer may well be the best way to
pass time for some in the past however
would it have been more fun to do that
with a wireless controller like this
with this idea of enhancing people's
gaming experience we created a Rachel
receiver for this vintage machine with
just a single click on the button there
you are enabled to replace the keyboard
with a Bluetooth controller consoles
became very popular starting from the
80s leaving us with a lot of crappy
games to still play and enjoy nowadays
our a blue 40 controller is created to
bring back those who total memories for
us on those old-school consoles like
this the trend continued to the 90s with
the birth of a Super Nintendo people
were able to enjoy more varieties of
games our AP 40 is also compatible with
those games on this classic machine from
the design of the controller it is very
easy to see that we especially make this
for apples a 40th anniversary only to
show our respect to the pioneering
company who has a profoundly affected
our way of living in the personal
computer gyro
with a change of giving devices into
smartphones and tablets at price of time
we also created a unique stand to suit
gamers habit today we stand this an
ammonium failure in the design of a
mini-sized Apple to computer which can
hold your gaming device beautiful while
enjoying a game of your choice unique
different and something no one has done
before is what we wish to achieve
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
