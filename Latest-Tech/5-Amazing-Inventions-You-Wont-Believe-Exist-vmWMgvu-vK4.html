pen and paper notebook while saving
everything in the cloud perfectly
organized the way you want and what if
after you saved your notes in the cloud
and filled your paper notebook you could
just erase it with the push of a button
and use it again that's not magic
that's the rocket book wave notebook
with the wave notebook and the rocket
book app you instantly blast your notes
into the cloud using your mobile device
in a fraction of a second rocket book
machine vision scans enhances and sends
each page to the specific destination
they belong on the cloud services you
already use each wave notebook page has
seven symbols set up the rocket book app
to assign each symbol to a location
within Dropbox and Google Docs Evernote
OneNote or simply to your email inbox
let's see how Jake has his setup he
marks the diamond symbol and the rocket
book app sends the notes to his customer
meetings notes in Evernote when he's
brainstorming he marks the star symbol
which he decided are for the notes that
belong in his ideas folder in Google
Docs now that your notes are in the
cloud when your notebook is filled
there's no need to go buy another book
or let use notebooks clutter your life
here's how you can reuse your wave
notebook multiple times with the mere
push of a button take your notes using
friction pilot
available in many office supply stores
and amazon.com friction pilot egg turns
clear under heat and the wave notebook
is specially designed to the microwave
safe that means you can clear your
entire wave notebook in your microwave
in the same amount of time it takes to
make a cup of tea when our specially
designed thermal logo on the cover turns
from blue to white your wave notebook
has been cleared and is ready to be
reused and with your notes in the cloud
an empty notebook has endless
possibilities the utility of the cloud
and the joy of pen and paper
that's rocket book
we believe the technology should be
seamless and it should give you more
from the experience as you will our
technology fundamentally enhances
call from Sara turn left in 20 miles
there's just a new evolution in the
store again
I think this is hot that feels like
tomorrow it really really does it feels
like tomorrow you've taken all that can
electronics out of the high-tech cars
and just put it right here honestly it's
it's gonna change everything
when you put on a Scully helmet you get
an e us essentially an ecosystem as soon
as you journey it was walking into a
platform yeah then it suddenly you get a
level of innovation that you had been
fooled about before being a professional
motorcycle racer takes a lot of fun away
from rape if I'm riding on the stoop but
this could make a fun again it will make
your riding safer with its high-speed
microprocessor and operating system it's
the smartest motorcycle helmet ever
imagined Scully
the future
join the revolution
when you see a problem my brain just
immediately starts thinking about how I
could put these things together these
these materials are these processes
together to really solve that problem
there's a personal satisfaction I get
and being able to take technology and do
something very meaningful and important
and valuable with it my name is Stefan
Marsh I'm the inventor of the ear ring
technology and the president of the
company my name's Tom Cotton's I'm live
in Southborough Massachusetts with my
wife I'm a farmer it's what I like to do
I found I had sleep apnea through a test
you
man starts out usually doing things in a
way that's brute force but sometimes you
can figure out a way to do it that's a
little bit more elegant a little bit
easier simpler but that usually requires
an invention this is amazing
I think that if this works this will be
the answer for 99 percent don't never go
back to using that starwars piece on
their head again when I see this I say
how can that possibly get the air in me
when I first talked to people about this
and I say well you know we have these
little micro pumps and and turns out
that they're very powerful and they can
they can pump the right amount of air at
the right amount pressure their first
response is no way get out of here and
you know I got well yes I think we can
because our micro pumps our micro
blowers are very very small it's based
on two membranes that are
electrostatically attracted or repelled
from each other opposite charges attract
and that's the bellows closing and
blowing the air out and like charges
repel and that's the bellows opening and
sucking air in and if hundreds and
hundreds of these little bellows are
plus of minus plus and minus going
together you get a large amount of air
to flow through zinc-air batteries is a
battery technology that has a lot of
stored energy in it it's very dense
which means it could be very small and
have the right amount of energy the nose
buds they're easy to insert it really
it's one hand grab it stick it in you
knows you've done the molded silicon
rubber is extremely pliable everybody
that we've tested with has found it very
comfortable really for the first time in
this disease we have a treatment that
patients will be willing to use the
long-term consequences of sleep apnea
will be reduced it's comfortable it's
well tolerated patients can sleep in a
variety of positions just a perfect
treatment it's almost like you can't
wait to try I got a no it's important to
get this technology to get this device
to get the airing into people's hands as
quickly as possible the fastest way that
I know how to do that is to
raise sufficient amount of money so we
can and you factor it produce it and get
it out there so we're here to ask you to
give us a hand
if you can take this simple technology
and treat this sleeping disorder this
condition it just that's what technology
is for you've got to go do something
that's important and I can't think of
anything more important for these
blowers to do then to save somebody's
life
do any of your earbuds fall out
sometimes
or worse have you ever felt that the
wires from your earbuds were
inconvenient especially when playing
sports now you have an option
