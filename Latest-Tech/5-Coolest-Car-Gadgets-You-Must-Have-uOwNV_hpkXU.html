to be that's where I come in I'm carbage
cannon here to bring some order back to
your life on the road at a glance I may
look like an ordinary trash can but I'm
so much more
I'm the world's first no-spill
non-intrusive trash can for your car
other trash cans get in the way or don't
hold up to the rigors of the road I stay
out of your way while keeping your
floorboards in the environment clean
when you make a turn
I won't topple over my revolutionary
patented design keeps me fastened tight
to your floor mat using two small clips
keeping your trash in place your car as
neat as it can be
I can be installed in any area of your
vehicle quickly and easily for you and
your passengers convenience
I'm lightweight and compact giving
everyone plenty of legroom but I fit
tons of trash as well I'm made of 100%
recycled plastic and I'm designed to use
all your old plastic shopping bags plus
I can store additional bags to install
me in your car simply insert a plastic
bag folding under any excess material
for a neater look use the plastic bezel
to keep your bag in place attach the
clips to your floor mat and set me on
the clips we're ready to roll it's that
simple
we need to take me out just pull me off
my clips and put me in a safe place
until you need me again whether you're
on the road one day or every day I'll be
here preserving your sanity and
cleanliness for the long haul
hello again empty fastest route found to
early bird cafe
you and me we're busy people
then being busy means checking your
phone even when you're not supposed to
even when you're on the road but now
there's Navi hold on I gotta get this KC
talk to me hey Adam quick reminder first
thing today about coffee with Connie and
Greg at the earlybird already on my way
see what's brilliant about navdy is this
faster route phone automatically
rerouting to save ten minutes perfect
never been this way before we switch to
Navi - see what's so brilliant about
Navitus it's display is focused in the
distance so your eyes are never off the
road it's also forty times brighter than
your smartphone and it dims
automatically so it's easy to see day or
night in fact sorry gotta take this one
- Greg and I actually want to do bears
cafe out on 60 - smiley face Oh awesome
luckily Royce is one of my favorites NAB
D uses Google Maps and built-in offline
maps so you'll never get lost like out
here in the desert and it's connected to
your car which means that gas rerouting
- nearest gas station text Connie be
there in 15
you have arrived
thanks Navi see you soon
this is for ever since he was a child or
has a special talent a talent for things
that fit perfectly into other things
perfection is a rare thing to come
across that moment when everything falls
into place and you feel whole you feel
pleased the world is in complete harmony
with that in mind here's your cause
windshield now in a perfect world we're
on the windshield would you put your
phone that's right not on the windshield
why because it's just not clever and
even illegal in some places one day when
all was sitting in his car he had an
epiphany he invented read the perfectly
fitted mount we add most slides in your
car CD player perfectly and your phone
slides into red mow perfectly perfectly
it's amazing it placed it's stable like
a rock and it doesn't take up any
windshield realistic rad mow is made of
infusing Ireland and is durable to last
for years this is not a fling it's a
very serious relationship yes you can
still use your CD player if that's the
kind of thing you're into no problem
read most patents and mount can fit any
phone with any cover or without once
easy and it also fits GPS devices mini
tablets or even two phones at the same
time just adjust the handles and you're
done rad mow has no Bluetooth no Wi-Fi
lightning connector no NFC no USB and
yet it's the best accessory ever made
for smartphones introducing suits the
world's first truly smart car charger
designed in Germany Zeus has both brains
and beauty the elegance and lighting
system provides enhanced visibility and
dark environments and most importantly
Zeus is the only smart charger that can
help you find your car when you are at a
loss simply open the Zeus app and follow
the red arrow to find your car
Zeus also sports a powerful smart
chipset to deliver the swiftest charge
to any device charge to iPads at two
times the speed of normal car charges
Zeus is also the only charger to meet
u.s. military high temperature standard
another reason why Zeus is different two
times the speed two times smarter never
lose your car
