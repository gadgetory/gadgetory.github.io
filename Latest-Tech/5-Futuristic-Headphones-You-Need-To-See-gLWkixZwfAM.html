Beshear's 3d molded open-air frame
design allows you to interact with your
environment while you're listening to
your audio this is the first pain-free
bluetooth headphone it doesn't press on
your ears which can cause discomfort
instead the 3d geometric frame sits
around your ear with minimal body
contact this allows airflow and makes
them comfortable to wear for long
periods of time B shares core audio
technology comes from Yamaha smock five
module one of Yamahas most advanced
codecs and enables us to provide
superior sound quality our headphones
have an onboard 3-band equalizer that
works with all your music apps and
allows you to customize the sound to
your own personal taste
it's important that you and only you can
hear the sound of your headphones V
share is designed with directional flat
speakers that produce amazing sound
quality and yet focus the sound directly
to your ears to keep what you're
listening to private can we get this
alright let's go
the airframe keeps you in touch with the
sounds around you so you notice when
other people approach or want to talk
with you and without removing your
headphones or adjusting your audio you
can carry on a normal conversation when
you want to be undisturbed the V Shara
headphones have an interchangeable
closed frame as well for when you want
to concentrate or when you're in a loud
environment each headset is able to
broadcast or receive from other headsets
so you can use V share to share your
audio with your friends without
disturbing others around you we hope you
can find places where V share fits your
lifestyle we partnered with a major
Japanese audio company to help us
manufacture the highest quality
headphones possible our plans are set
and we have a scheduled to deliver be
sure to you on time we need your help we
need funding to cover the cost for moles
and tools for manufacturing with your
help we can deliver these amazing
headphones to you please share and a
backup
this is what I design vhere sound is
arguably the most important of the
census it conveys emotion tell stories
and helps us navigate our world while we
can only see what is directly in front
of us we can hear everything from all
around all of the time when was the last
time your headphones made you feel like
you were actually there not just
identifying the sound but feeling
transported that's the sound we want you
to hear I'd like to introduce you to the
Asik ex Asik ex headphones combined
advanced 3d audio algorithms with head
tracking an individual Anatomy
calibration to create incredibly
realistic 3d sound in real life sound
comes from everywhere and the way you
hear the world is unique only to you
it's based on your position in space the
size of your head even the shape of your
ears but with traditional and even
surround sound headphones these elements
are not taken into account in effect you
are removed from the sound equation this
makes for an incredibly small audio
experience where sounds can only come
from a few places instead of anywhere
the Asik ex is the world's first
headphone that instantly calibrates to
the listener creating the ultimate 3d
listening experience you can be on a
train and have the same experience you
had hearing the concert from the best
seats in the house we can now transport
you to the highest-end theater that has
a full array of speakers so you feel
like you were at the movies when you put
them on Asik X will allow you to
accurately hear the sounds anywhere in
the full sphere and it's going to be
crucial in virtual reality to help
direct your attention and create an
incredibly immersive experience that
ties in with the visuals to create the
ultimate presence Asik X is going to
change the way we aim we bring a whole
new level of accuracy to hearing sounds
anywhere in space not just around us
we also have the ability to unlock the
sounds above us and below us you get the
feeling that you've been teleported into
the game communication is important in
gaming the asik X headphones use a 3d
microphone array with beam
Cormack to give you the same noise
rejection you would get with a boom but
unlike a boom ensure that your voice
level is always consistent the key to
creating an accurate and realistic sound
experience is knowing the listeners
individual auditory anatomy and how it
influences the way we hear sound this is
called an HR TF or head related transfer
function in order to create this instant
calibration we've incorporated sensors
into the headphone and we take the
information from the sensors and feed it
into software and we have an adaptive
algorithm that customizes the playback
for the individual wearing the headphone
additionally we have multiple drivers
within the headphone that can beam the
sound around the ear and so we can have
the sound naturally interact with the
ear the way it normally would we know
that there's a huge gap between what's
currently available for 3d sound and
what's possible that's why we started
Asik we want to bring this technology to
life we want to put it in the hands of
content creators gamers VR enthusiasts
audio files together we can shape the
future of audio we all love to listen to
music on the go but this isn't always
easy to achieve
managing playlists takes effort unstable
internet connections are frustrating and
frequently having to recharge your
battery simply cuts you off we believe
listening to music should be easy and
this is why we make Ivy ivy our smart
standalone headphones they open the door
to more than 40 million songs from the
moment you put it on the music is on
Ivy is easy to use simply swipe forward
to skip a song tap if you like a song
once you've liked a song Ivy remembers
it and adds it to your favorite channel
it's like having a personal DJ Ivy
learns what you like and generates
playlists just for you switching between
channels is super easy just use the
channel rank and you're there through
sensors Ivy learns where and when you
like to track the more you use Ivy the
better it understands your preferences
the more it plays music you like no more
wasting time for organizing your music
Ivy organizes it for you select it from
a library of over 40 million tracks Ivy
refreshes your music whenever you charge
it this means no more syncing with a
computer searching through apps are
waiting for songs to load with Ivy music
is simply there anywhere anytime Ivy's
battery life lasts up to 40 hours it's
as if the music never stops until you
want it to when you remove your
headphones it pauses the track
automatically so you'll never miss a
beat

multicultural multi-generational team
from around the globe we believe we've
created device that will revolutionize
the way you listen to music we have
proven our core functionality and we are
confident we can deliver how is slim
line lightweight and use premium durable
materials the source of the music in the
cloud is of the highest resolution we

the highest quality drivers the best
technology in noise cancellation with

music in a high-definition highway is a
result of collaboration and many people
have helped to get us to where we are

community with your support we can make
ever even better together
my name is viktoria who I just graduated
from UC Berkeley and I am the co-founder
of accent accent where is a company that
makes innovative headphones that you
haven't seen before I came up with idea
wild girl but I was never able to turn
into a reality
fortunately I met my best friend
Victoria and she was able to help me
with a lot of the things that I could
accomplish by myself so we came up with
the idea for the name for accent wear
when we were actually just on Facebook
and we were chatting with a bunch of our
friends and we were like hey guys let's
think of a good name that would be
fitting for this new company and we're
just throwing ideas back and forth and
finally someone said oh you know what
what about accent wear and we're like
you know what sounds pretty good first I
came up with a few sketches I drew them
on people's had to get idea of how they
were looked I tried all different colors
different designs there's a great lab at
UC Berkeley and we just got a fellowship
at the Innovation Lab and we would go in
every week and we would take around and
we just some things online finally got a
design that I'm happy with I started
doing a 3d model of it I have a physical
model to try on people one of the things
that we ended up changing through
feedback from our our fans on Facebook
was that they wanted bigger cans they
wanted over the year instead of on the
year so we changed that because a lot of
people were requesting that each new
prototype the headphones get closer and
closer to what we envisioned so these
are the headphones accent or accent and
the headband and all the plastic parts
are made of ABS which is a recyclable
material so it is environmentally
friendly that way these are the LED
lights that are that show up to be the
color that you choose we're going to
have a couple of options these are the
external speakers so you can share music
with your friends we're really excited
to make these a reality and to take
these from the prototyping stage to the
final product we really hope that you'll
support us in our endeavor please back
us up on our campaign and help us turn
this into a reality thank you
you
