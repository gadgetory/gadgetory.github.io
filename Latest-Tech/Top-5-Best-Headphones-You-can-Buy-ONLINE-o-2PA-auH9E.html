communication device inspired by the
human body we will once again discover
sound my name is Benjamin Willis I'm a
co-founder here at human and we are all
about a new era of human empowering
technology we are a group of industry's
best designers and engineers that have
come together behind a vision to develop
extraordinary products and we're
starting first with sound for decades
we've been placing bulky and obtrusive
designs on our head we've been wedging
little pieces of plastic into our ear
canal and this step towards a more
natural design towards a design that
encapsulate the ear to create a fuller
and more protected sound was to us
inevitable enjoy truly wireless
listening buttonless listening pause
play
on/off experience touch control playback
and features via numerous touch commands
our core offering includes social
multiple individuals can enjoy the same
audio simultaneously fade activate fades
ambient noise system to block out the
world or engage it amplify simply place
the ears together and enjoy a fuller
sound that truly fills the room 3
additional features are available to a
limited number of beta testers active
enjoy a complete suite of biometric
monitoring functions speak speak with
anyone anywhere in lifetime with our
advanced language translation software
sleep a design and rhythm that lulls you
into REM and wakes you gently by alarm
or playlist all while tracking the
quality of your sleep sound is made
possible via a truly brilliant
relationship between the human app and
the hardware sound includes an induction
charging pad and sound accommodates all
listeners with four sizes and a range of
intentional and beautiful colors the
sound program is great alignment with
this community it's a piece of hardware
it's a piece of audio innovation and so
for us it's a privilege to bring this to
you guys first we have a world-class
product development team with decades of
manufacturing experience and we're
moving towards production we're really
asking you to join us in the pursuit of
building
the best products in the world this is
our first of hopefully many programs to
come and on behalf of the entire team at
human we say thank you for the privilege
of launching sound thank you
discover sound with human
we're proud to share with you today the
product we've been developing it's glow
the first smart headphones that glow
with laser light music inherently is a
very expressive medium and having light
synchronize with music makes that whole
experience much better now I think
that's where glow really stands out it's
a pair of headphones but it's also
something that builds up that musical
expression through the form of light the
first time we solve fiber and fiber
optical wireless really incredible that
vibrance is just super vibrant it looks
like something I've never seen before
like something magical and that's where
we thought the idea of about the
headphone because that's sort of a
natural connection of a glowing wire
with pair of headphones and have the
wire below to the music we've provided
five buttons with glow to intuitively
control your music
we can also use it to control your phone
like being able to read and reply the
text messages without even taking it out
of your pocket
it wasn't enough that we built an
expressive pair of headphones we wanted
the sound quality to be amazing
so we chosen in hair design using
Knowles dual balanced armature drivers
the same premium drivers found in the
best headphones on the market today
over the last few months we've been
building a fully working prototype and
we're there but now we need your help to
take globe from a prototype to final
manufacturing to be able to bring this
to market thank you for taking time out
to watch this video we're super excited
about this technology these headphones
and we hope you're as excited as we are
you
you
hi my name is yasm Umrah I'm jazz
drummer I used to work for major record
company music lover like me live in the
city we always use the headphones
headphones gives you a good sound
mobility and silence but sometimes I
couldn't stand it headphones are painful
leave them on for more than an hour and
get hurt when running it gets
uncomfortable and sweaty I thought why
not to design a headphone and solve
these problems this is Beshear's 3d
molded open-air frame design allows you
to interact with your environment while
you're listening to your audio this is
the first pain-free bluetooth headphone
it doesn't press on your ears which can
cause discomfort instead the 3d
geometric frame sits around your ear
with minimal body contact this allows
air flow and makes them comfortable to
wear for long periods of time the B
shares core audio technology comes from
Yamaha smock five module one of Yamahas
most advanced codecs and enables us to
provide superior sound quality our
headphones have an onboard 3-band
equalizer that works with all your music
apps and allows you to customise the
sound to your own personal taste
it's important that you and only you can
hear the sound of your headphones be
cher is designed with directional flat
speakers that produce amazing sound
quality and yet focus the sound directly
to your ears to keep what you're
listening to private can we get this
alright let's do so the airframe keeps
you in touch with the sounds around you
so you notice when other people approach
or want to talk with you and without
removing your headphones or adjusting
your audio you can carry on a normal
conversation when you want to be
undisturbed the Viera headphones have an
interchangeable closed frame as well for
when you want to concentrate or when
you're in a loud environment each
headset is able to broadcast or receive
from other headsets so you can use V
share to share your audio with your
friends without disturbing others around
you we hope you can find places where V
share fits your lifestyle we partnered
with a major Japanese audio company to
help us manufacture the highest quality
headphones possible our plans are set
and we have a scheduled to deliver be
sure to you on time we need your help we
need funding to cover the cost for moles
and tools for manufacturing with your
help we can deliver these amazing
headphones to you please share and a
backup
this is what I designed be here one
sound is arguably the most important of
the census it conveys emotion tell
stories and helps us navigate our world
while we can only see what is directly
in front of us we can hear everything
from all around all of the time when was
the last time your headphones made you
feel like you were actually there not
just identifying the sound but feeling
transported that's the sound you want
you to hear I'd like to introduce you to
the Asik ex
Asik ex headphones combined advanced 3d
audio algorithms with head tracking and
individual Anatomy calibration to create
incredibly realistic 3d sound headphones
haven't changed a lot in the past 65
years the mission at Asik is to take the
final leap from reproduced audio to
something that's indistinguishable from
reality our founding team has a passion
for audio we have a combined 50 years of
experience designing some of the
top-selling gaming headphones and
speakers on the market our mission is to
change the way people hear sound oh I
got it so it's so different it's like a
movie theater experience buzz yeah
hey the sound everywhere was it was
awesome oh my gosh I don't know I was
amazing huh I don't think everything
like that before in real life sound
comes from everywhere and the way you
hear the world is unique only to you
it's based on your position in space the
size of your head even the shape of your
ears but with traditional and even
surround sound headphones these elements
are not taken into account in effect you
are removed from the sound equation this
makes for an incredibly small audio
experience where Psalms can only come
from a few places instead of anywhere
the Asik ex is the world's first
headphone that instantly calibrates to
the listener creating the ultimate 3d
listening experience you can be on a
train and have the same experience
you've had hearing the concert from
best seats in the house we can now
transport you to the highest-end theater
that has a full array of speakers so you
feel like you were at the movies when
you put them on hi my name is ty ahmad
taylor I'm the CEO of thx for the first
time in my life I was able to actually
experience sound outside of being the
center of my head and in a natural sound
field that expanded about several feet
in front and behind and above me it was
really revolutionary in virtual reality
is all about immersion
it's about transporting you to another
world asik x will allow you to
accurately hear the sounds anywhere in
the full sphere and it's going to be
crucial in virtual reality to help
direct your attention and create an
incredibly immersive experience that
ties in with the visuals to create the
ultimate presence house is so real yeah
I can see what the fuss is about now the
audio effects ended up meshing perfectly
with what I was seeing on all seek is
really bringing a whole new element here
because if you have three sixteen in
massive sound it's a more powerful
feeling of being there it's intelligent
sound asik x is going to change the way
we game we bring a whole new level of
accuracy to hearing sounds anywhere in
space not just around us but we also
have the ability to unlock the sounds
above us and below us you get the
feeling that you've been teleported into
the game from a visual standpoint when
you're playing the game it gets really
intense and so having like accurate
audio cues to go with it
can be just as important being able to
know where someone is behind a wall or
how close someone is if they're about to
turn a corner that you can't put a price
on that like and you know it cost your
game so after listening to the austech
headphones seems like they've given me
an accurate representation with 3d audio
that i've never had before communication
is important in gaming the asik x
headphones use a 3d microphone array
with beamforming to give you the same
noise rejection you would get with a
boom
but unlike a boom ensure that your voice
level is always consistent the key to
creating an accurate and realistic sound
experience is knowing the listeners
individual auditory anatomy and how it
influences the way we hear sound this is
called an HRT F or head related transfer
function
in order to create this instant
calibration we've incorporated sensors
into the headphone and we take the
information from the sensors and feed it
into software and we have an adaptive
algorithm that customizes the playback
for the individual wearing the headphone
additionally we have multiple drivers
within the headphone that can beam the
sound around the ear and so we can have
the sound naturally interact with the
ear the way it normally would by taking
the intelligence of the adaptive
algorithm and the physical hardware
that's interacting with you were able to
create a personal experience that's
unique to you the headphones feature a
uniform headband design and high-quality
lightweight aluminum construction and so
unbreakable they have been designed for
durability acoustic quality and comfort
for prolonged periods of use they
conform perfectly to the user's anatomy
featuring soft over the ear pads and a
revolutionary micro adjust ear top
it's taken our team numerous prototypes
and years of research to package
components necessary for accurate 3d
audio into a high fidelity and durable
headphone with a design ready we've
secured manufacturing partners who are
experienced in production of
high-quality audio products now we are
excited to get 3d audio into your hands
we know that there's a huge gap between
what's currently available for 3d sound
and what's possible that's why we
started Asik we want to bring this
technology to life we want to put it in
the hands of content creators gamers VR
enthusiasts audio files together we can
shape the future of audio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
