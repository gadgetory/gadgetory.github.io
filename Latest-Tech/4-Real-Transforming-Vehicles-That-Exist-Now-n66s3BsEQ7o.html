blow your mind
number four Jade I tried all this time
we thought that the Transformers
franchise was fictional but it turns out
that those giant battling robots are
real jadeite right is a transformer
robot that transforms into humanoid
robot from a robot car designed by
Japanese engineers the almost 4 meter
tall robot takes one minute to transform
into an electric sports car with two
passengers on board it is a cool idea
but let's not get too excited for now it
looks like my grandma could outrun this
thing
this is a first though in a true real
car to robot transformation okay it is
slow but it can actually transform into
a robot and take a few steps and if they
have the ability to do this then it will
only improve as technology gets better
seems like the new beginning of new
possibilities number three
yo smart connecting car this tiny
electric car drives sideways and shrinks
to fit into parking spaces created by a
team of German engineers the concept of
this car was to make driving and living
with an automobile easier in the densely
populated urban areas with increasing
numbers of people it can shrink to take
up less space and even drive sideways
into parking spaces since each wheel can
rotate 90 degrees
although the eeo car excels at parking
you won't be amazed by its performance
the top speed is just 40 miles per hour
the onboard battery pack takes 4 hours
to fully recharge while range is
estimated at between thirty and forty
four miles the eeo smart connecting car
isn't designed for production but it
demonstrates possible ways to make cars
easier to use in cities number two
Hummer either Hummer either looks like a
standard Jeep Cherokee SUV but when it
gets stuck in traffic the car body can
elevate the
bass widens and the car can drive right
over other cars the hydraulic rig is big
and heavy Hummer either weighs 8,500
pounds almost double the weight of a
standard Jeep Grand Cherokee fully
extended the roof of the car stands at
nine feet tall offering just enough
clearance over the roof of a standard
car and decent clearance from the sides
however to make sure the Hummer either
doesn't shear off a mirror or scrape
roof there are four cameras and an
integrated quad split video screen in
the vehicle seeing a car transform like
that on a public street would surely
raise some eyebrows but this cool smart
idea is just a well-executed marketing
stunt for the time being to get some
attention and promote the company's
other services number one antonin a
real-life BMW transformer made by a
turkish company called lecture on their
first model the anthem on took 8 months
to complete and the basic price is six
hundred thousand US dollars anthem on
the transformer has been built using an
actual car the head neck arms and
fingers move using a variety of motors
speech and voice control is possible
through the integration of sound
sensitivity although it's not drivable
yet it is possible in the future due to
its electric engine and it can function
via remote control
