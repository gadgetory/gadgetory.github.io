what exactly is a power bank before
diving into any juicy technical details
let's clarify the basics a power bank is
a portable device that can supply power
from its built-in batteries through a
USB port power banks allow you to store
electrical energy and then later use it
to charge up a mobile device technically
a power bank consists of rechargeable
lithium ion or lithium polymer batteries
installed in a protective casing guided
by a printed circuit board to control
power low fact number one what does the
power bank capacity tell us the
milliamp-hour figure tells us the amount
of power flow that can be supplied by a
certain power bank at a specific voltage
in other words the more milliamp-hour
the power has the larger the energy is
to have your phone's battery fully
charged you should have a power bank
with more million power than your
phone's capacity fact number two what is
the lifetime of a power bank the battery
is used in power banks and smartphones
eventually lose their capacity over time
depending on the quality of the
controller circuitry and battery cells a
good power bank can hold charge for
three to six months with minimal loss
lower quality power banks may struggle
to retain a useful charge more than four
to six weeks the bigger the battery is
the fewer cycles you will need to charge
it and the longer it will last
here's a tip to prevent overcharging and
overheating whenever possible remove the
power bank from charge when it's full or
at least avoid leaving it connected long
term after it's full when a battery is
constantly stored in high heat its
capacity will go down a bit quicker than
if it's stored in a cooler environment
don't put it in the freezer though just
store it inside out of the Sun and in a
cooler area that will help extend the
life and capacity of your battery pack
number three how long does it last for
the most logical question right we all
want to know
that damn phone would eventually
completely run out of juice it is based
on how long a battery will last when
power is drunk constantly a typical
smartphone battery which is between two
thousand two thousand five hundred
milliamp hours will power a device
drawing 100 million powers for 20 hours
the usage time depends on the load or
how much current you are drawing from
the battery at any given time if you're
using a battery to power something more
powerful but will obviously last a much
shorter time back number four how many
times can a power bank charge my device
the number of times you can charge your
device from a power bank is dependent on
three primary factors what device you
are charging what is the device doing
while it's being charged and the age and
current charge of the power bank an
iPhone 4 has a 1420 milliamp hour
battery while on iPhone 7 plus has a
2915 milliamp hour battery so the iPhone
4 can be charged twice as many times as
the iPhone 7 plus since it requires a
lot less from the power bank for 100%
charge a good rule of thumb is to divide
the milliamp hour of the power bank by
the milliamp power of the device battery
keep in mind that this is never 100%
accurate but it will at least give you a
rough idea generally the bigger the
power bank and the smaller the device
you're charging the more girlz you get
other factors can also improve or limit
the discharge potential of a power bank
so look after them and they will work
better for longer pack number five what
is the fastest way to charge my
smartphone some phones may download
updates automatically and consume more
power when connected to the charger if
we really want to save energy when
charging from a power bank it is a good
idea to keep the phone in flight mode
this will allow you to only charge the
battery cell only using the basic
features of the operating system on your
phone
if you're watching a movie on your
device while you're plugged into the
power bank you may drain the power bank
but it will appear that your device
never charged this is because you were
taking the charge out of the device
battery as quickly as the power bank
charged it
if you leave your device on airplane
mode and let it charge you will get a
lot more charges out of your power bank
since the device is not taking much
battery charge at all to run while the
power bank is charging it up if you
