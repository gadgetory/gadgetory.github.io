what if your smartphone could do
something more something you never
imagined a phone could do well we've
done it we've taken your smartphone and
made it fly
there's an entire realm that has never
been tapped by a smartphone until now
introducing phone drone ethos the first
and only device that allows your
smartphone to access the third dimension
with phone drone ethos we've leveraged
the sensor processor and wireless
capability of your smartphone what you
get is a powerful cloud connected aerial
vehicle at a fraction of the cost of a
typical drone
you
ethos doesn't even require two phones
just use a single device and set your
mission or you can tether it to another
device for real-time control
you
phone drone is packable and can be
broadly extended not only that but found
around ethos is the first drone that can
be controlled from Apple watch
you
you
you
our team will be releasing the phone
drone controller API to the market
allowing developers to build drone
capability into their existing apps and
even create completely new apps around
this technology with over 10 million
mobile app developers in the industry
phone drone ethos will have the largest
potential developer community in
existence
imagine the innovation where will it go
image recognition obstacle avoidance
swarm operation through the cloud we
know the possibilities are endless
but we need your help we need you to
join in on the revolution be one of the
first to usher in the new drone era and
left phone drone ethos give your
smartphone access to the third dimension
so this started about a year ago where
we had to measure the contours of an
organic surface turns out that's a very
hard problem the only available solution
cost twenty thousand dollars and that
that's ridiculous so we start out to
build Arun we looked at what was
available out there at the intersection
of computer vision and surface
measurement and we couldn't single
solution that was compelling the 3d
scanners ever precise cost tens of
thousands of dollars and the ones that
were affordable weren't precise well
today that changes so we've invented the
eora 3d scanned the world's first
high-precision 3d scanner that is
purpose-built
for a modern server we're only just
beginning to explore the possibilities
of capturing the world in 3d 3d printing
is an amazing tool it converts a digital
file into a physical object some call it
an industrial revolution the eora 3d
scanner does the exact opposite of the
3d printer it lets artists makers and
designers capture objects and surfaces
and turn them into high-quality 3d
models and use them as part of the
creative process we knew we had to use a
smart phone
Moeller phones are simply amazing the
yura 3d scanner is powered entirely by
your smartphone using it as easy just
open the app and press scan it'll
automatically adjust focus and exposure
and drive a green laser to scan your
object as it sweeps we take over 1,000
photos and analyze them in real time to
give you a 3d model a typical scan takes
three to five minutes and gives you a
full-color mesh with up to eight million
points with a range of one meter you can
capture objects big as well
a cure to less than 100 microns that's
the thickness of a single sheet of paper
we're engineering the scanner we had one
objective in mind precision
all that's possible thanks to a design
that's both beautiful and functional
machined from a solid block of aluminium
with over 35 million operations we've
designed it to be both robust and
precise the light ring gives you quick
visual feedback and the adjustable knob
just to secure any model smartphone the
green laser lets you scan in any
lighting conditions as most cameras are
twice as sensitive to green than any
other color for water type models we
also design a Bluetooth turntable it
will sync to your scanner and rotate
your object to make sure you get every
angle then meticulously design every
aspect of the hardware and we've tested
seven different prototypes we've put
together a great team and we've lined up
several manufacturers now we need you
and the Kickstarter community to help us
put this together
like me use your phone to take a lot of
pictures and smartphones today have
great cameras but they have a blind spot
close-up photography and that's why I've
created these two lenses which will
instantly turn your phone or tablet into
a device capable of taking incredible
close-up photography instead of spending
a bunch of money on a fancy camera and
expensive lenses simply stick this lens
onto your phone and begin taking
beautiful macro photography right away
it's great for taking pictures of all
kinds of things take pictures of flowers
explore nature when you're done simply
pop the lens off stick it back in its
case and be on your way it's ultra
portable and great for taking on outdoor
adventures the stickiness of the lens
will last forever
it's scratch proof and it works with any
smartphone or tablet it's a great way to
increase the capability of your device's
camera to take your photography to a
whole new level so I hope you support
this campaign and please share it with
all the photographers in your life thank
you
you
we wanted to create a product that we
ourselves want to use every day so in
developing sky buds we've paid attention
to the things that people cared about
the most spit signal strength sound
quality and battery life the real
problem with wireless headphones is that
they always need to be charged charging
anything besides your phone on a day to
day basis is a real inconvenience but
with our patented case whenever you
charge your phone you charge your
earphones it's that simple there's no
need to carry around a separate charging
or storage device just for your earbuds
and so when you go to sleep at night and
you plug in your thump not only do you
wake up with a fully charged phone and
fully charged earbuds but we added an
extra battery in the back of the case
that provides additional power for both
your phone and earbuds throughout the
entire bag truly Wireless means no more
wires to get tangled on no more cords to
get ripped out of your ears and our
smart phone case allows an easy place
for you to put your sky buds in when
you're finished using them we also knew
that sky buds would have to be the
perfect companion for people with very
active lifestyles so yes sky buds are
sweat proof and to accommodate small
years like mine and much larger ears
like Jamie's we've developed
interchangeable bud tips in order to
make sure that sky buds fit everyone's
ears comfortably and securely
we studied tons of reports by ear
surgeons and tested and 3d mapped
literally hundreds of years not only our
sky buds gonna look sharp but they're
gonna sound great and the connection
quality is gonna be excellent we put
amazing speakers into both your buds and
use the process called nano plating to
make sure that all your sound is
uninterrupted
in terms of battery to last for three to
four hours of continuous play but
remember as soon as you put them back in
the case will start recharging we
converge four products into one device
you're truly wireless earbuds your
Bluetooth headset for calling smartphone
case an extra smartphone battery are all
compressed into a single totally
convenient solution that charges and
stores your earbuds
we've been living and breathing sky buds
for the past 14 months but we've taken
it as far as we can since we've put the
best components in sky buds mass
production is expensive
help us by supporting sky buds and
becoming early advocates of the product
we are super excited to bring sky buds
to you the Kickstarter community and we
hope you love sky buds just as much as
we do
but the jungle apps and contacts you
have on your phone nowadays you find
yourself scrolling around your device
just to do one thing we've decided to
hack this mini inconvenience with a
simple add-on called the air button that
allows you to access your favorite app
or feature with just a push of a button
simply assign phone functions such as
opening up your calendar and turning on
your music at the same time while you're
on your way to work or what a push of a
button
access your maps and Bluetooth functions
while driving or maybe call your
significant other immediately without
swiping through a list of contacts on
your cell phone
what makes the air button special is
that allows you to create workflows
where you can link features and
applications simultaneously this becomes
handy especially during meetings you can
even connect your Bluetooth earphones
and music while you're going out for a
quick run
we've engineered this tactile button to
be extremely thin yet super powerful in
fact it doesn't even require batteries
simply peel off the buttons at piece of
film and stick it on the back of your
android phone after enabling your
phone's NFC connectivity you can
customize each buttons functionality
using our proprietary app built in-house
no matter how you use your phone the
possibilities of using the air button
are endless
especially since we'll have single and
double versions available
it's truly an instant upgrade your phone
has been waiting for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
