iPad air and iPad pro amp transforms
your iPad into a portable entertainment
system

your kids in the backyard or a Sunday
afternoon Skype with Grandma where the
whole family can get involved
thanks to stereo sound the amp is all
about shared experiences and our design
tenants from the ground up have been
about what you need most our experts
have spent years researching engineering
and testing amp to make sure the final
product is perfect amp brings
exceptional audio quality with deeper
lows and crisper highs unlike other
Bluetooth speakers amp delivers true
stereo sound and spatial imaging with
amp your movies and music sound the way
they were always meant to be heard

there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product that would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution bring in a gym to you the
platform is strong the posts are spaced
evenly apart on both sides so you can
simulate any exercise movement and
quickly adjust difficulty the base is
made wide enough to stand comfortably
during your workout and we even added a
layer of non-slip material to assure you
stay in place the bands were customized
for this concept and can handle any
height
there's even cloth in the bands to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding provided you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
levels we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight padding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort
and sweat resistant to stay in place we
even added a door anchor so you can
increase the workout the body boss is
lightweight made of high-grade injection
molding and capable of handling hundreds
of pounds of force the underside has
non-slip feet for safe use on any
surface the adjustable posts make for
easy storage starting from day one you
can choose your color green pink you can
choose your package and choose how you
want to follow workouts live
reflect program all on your own
normally it costs to thousands of
dollars to buy or recreate all of this
equipment but by backing this
Kickstarter today you can get it for a
fraction of that price our hearts and
souls have developed the body boss 2.0
and we're making our first prototypes to
be able to produce the product and make
it available we'll need your support
together we can make this happen make
this a part of your lifestyle share this
video with a friend help us expand
practical lifelong fitness humans
exploration to ocean never ends but
oceans are still full of mysteries to
explore the yet unknown underwater world
we created the high quality ROV the CC
ROV it is equipped with four horizontal
and two vertical thrusters allowing a
high-precision control it can rotate on
five axes or stay still to offer the
best underwater experience
with his 4k camera CC ROV allows a
premium video footage and a lower cost
it is also ready to dive right out of
her backpack you can connect it to your
phone using the CC ROV app and then you
can see a live stream from under the
water it can even go up to 100 meters
deep and I think it's a lot of fun for
young people
CC ROV also serves a lot of purposes in
addition to taking underwater video and
pictures you can also control it from
your phone or the controller to follow
divers work checked inaccessible spots
the CCR Ovie's aluminum alloys sealed
compartment can resist high pressure up
to 100 metres into the ocean the for
camera tracking lights will lighten the
darkness and let you enjoy images of
things you wouldn't normally see along
with an fpv or a VR headset you can
enjoy an immersive underwater experience
from the design to development from the
material selection to equality basically
perfect our products and prepare for
every press work situation it may
encounter each CC ROV units will go
through a large number of production
processes with strict manufacturing
standards we aim for best and set our
standards to reach the highest one
we have conducted plenty of tests and
the biggest difficulty was the empty
water pressure test with an 88 a 100
with safe environment whether exact same
water 50 and the pressure to make sure
that our products can withstand the
extreme situation the first a batch of
prototypes is ready now we need your
help to bring our dream to life and
start the mass production thomas
supporters that sail away with the CC
ROV
to explore the underwater world
one sell me this pencil a rebar cane
we have successfully identified and
solved a number of issues with existing
pencils it's a pleasure to introduce to
you magna as design engineers is in our
nature to challenge and innovates
products we use every day
other products use a full release or
incremental action which dictates the
lead position our patent-pending
magnetic propulsion technology offers
finite controllability unlike other
pencils the secret to our revolutionary
invention is concealed within the core
of the pencil the outer sleeve
synchronizes its position to the inner
magnet shielded within the premium grade
aluminium body it works like magic
every detail has been considered whilst
it may not be visible to the naked eye
the ends of the pencil are slightly
larger in diameter to prevent the sleeve
from falling off
we have sourced our manufacturers pay
for tooling and have received our final
prototypes
so now we need your help to raise the
funds and hits and minimum order
quantities it really is the last piece
of the puzzle we want to make our dream
a reality and start shipping these
fantastic new products to your door we
strongly believe that making profits
should come second
great design therefore we price these
pencils an extremely affordable rate to
make them accessible to the wider
Kickstarter community a product with
this level of consideration really is a
tool for life and perfect as a gift for
your family and friends so now it's up
to you to help us bring the pencil into
the 21st century thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
