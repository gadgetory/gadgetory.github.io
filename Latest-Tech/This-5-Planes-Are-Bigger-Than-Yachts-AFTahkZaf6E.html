the 2000s Boeing found that it needed a
cargo plane with an enormous amount of
storage to transport components for the
787 Dreamliner which has parts made all
over the world the solution was to take
its biggest plane the 747 to build a
custom cargo hold around them at six to
five thousand cubic feet the dream
lifter has the largest cargo hold in the
world capable of Cairo three times a
volume for the favour
the fourth dream lifters Boeing made
also use the longest car the whole Road
whoa and can hold payloads up 225 times
number two in tone of an-124 ruslan
another monster designed and built by
the in tone of design during the USSR
the an-124 ruslan operated by the
russian air force is the largest
military aircraft in the world
for almost 30 years after its production
in 1984 the an-124 was the largest and
heaviest cargo aircraft in the world
other than the single a and 225 the 747
- 8 s overtook the an-124 in 2011 with a
reported payload capacity of 165 Thoms
the an-124 can hold even more than the
c5 galaxy though its range is not as
long a surviving engineering triumph of
the Soviets the an-124 continues to fly
air lifting missions for Russia
number three Boeing b-52 the beef of the
to enter service in 1955 and the first
b-52h the currently serving model was
introduced in 1961 b-52 bomber is the
grandfather of the air force aging but
still capable of delivering a serious
punch it can carry 70,000 pounds of
weapons from precision-guided
conventional bombs to nuclear warheads
while the b-2 stealth bomber and the b1
supersonic bomber could be retired when
the b21 is introduced the Air Force
wants to outfit the reliable b-52 with
new engines to improve efficiency and
range
while the giant bomber enters its sixth
decade of service the technology within
its hold is ever-evolving
as the Air Force is also planning to
equip the b-52 with the long-range
standoff missile a stealthy nuclear
cruise missile
number four airbus beluga the airbus
a300 600 super transporter
commonly called the beluga was designed
specifically to transport large and
awkward aircraft parts similar to the
freighter entering service in 1995 the
aircraft largely reclaimed the super
guppy serving European needs for large
air cargo different parts of the crop
were designed and build by Airbus
engineers across Europe and countries
including the UK Germany France and
Spain its 124 foot long payload Bay can
carry almost institutons
number-5 Strato lunch bowl Allen's
straddle launch has yet to fly so we
cannot say it dominates the skies just
yet but it certainly is a monster plane
the six engine twin fuselage aircraft
designed and built by Scaled Composites
has the longest wingspan in the world
385 feet from tip to tip if you play
straddle launch on a football field the
wings would extend through the goal
posts an extra 12 feet on both sides the
aircraft is designed to carry rockets up
into the stratosphere and drop them
where they would then launch to space
the alternative to conventional rocket
launches could conserve some of the fuel
needed to overcome all of Earth's
gravity from sea level into orbit and
launch small rockets at a rapid pace
straddle launch could carry as many as
three small launch vehicles at a time
straddle launch recently conducted
low-speed runway tests the first time it
moved under the power of its six pratt &amp;amp;
whitney turbofans high-speed runway
tests are next and when this plane
eventually takes to the skies it will be
the biggest monster of them all
