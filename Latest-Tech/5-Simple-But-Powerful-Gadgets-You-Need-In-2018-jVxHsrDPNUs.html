worry even if it's written in ink you
can still change it with the pilot
friction pen mistakes disappear like
magic but it's no trick its frictions
revolutionary erasable gel ink it allows
you to lift mistakes completely off the
page so there's no messy eraser crumbs
or damage to the paper just use the

the friction needed to make the ink and
your mistakes vanish

as they erase and offer an incredibly
smooth writing experience and with a new

Open Sesame
sesame is what's called a smartlock
which means you can unlock it using your
phone as the key I've tried other smart
laws they're way too big
their apps are confusing they take too
long to connect when they're hassle to
install I'm pretty handy Sesame's
different you can install it in seconds
literally no one screwing no replacing
sesame has a patented design that fits
any latch anywhere in the world the app
is handsome and intuitive but you can
open your door without it like this or
like this
sesame senses when my phone is nearby
and gets ready for my special knock
and I can get the optional Wi-Fi access
point it plugs into the wall nearby so
sesame is always on my home network and
it's linked to the access point with
Bluetooth which keeps it connected while
going easy on the batteries there with
no keys it's easy to let other people
into I can choose who has access and who
doesn't
I get notifications when my lock opens
and closes so I can always know what's
going on no matter where I am and it's
got military-grade encryption no one's
hacking this thing Open Sesame
Lubitz magnetic lacing solution makes
your own shoes incredibly easy to put on
and take off since our first campaign
tens of thousands of people have loved
their Zubaz because they no longer have
to fuss with tying laces squeezing into
shoes double knots ugly floppy bows or
laces coming undone with xue bits your
shoe is wide open
so you can easily slip in without
squeezing as if you had no laces at all
then just pull the magnets together and
that's it now go for a run or play
sports lubitz magnets are incredibly
strong we've taken the strongest
neodymium magnets and made them even
stronger with our patent-pending
magnetic array technology
to prove how strong they are we gave
some zoomits to our parkour friends and
bay area movement and they really put
them to the test
in two days of running and jumping off
buildings trees and playgrounds the
magnets only separated once so yuzu bits
on your daily run triathlons dance class
your gym class you triple unders at
CrossFit go mountain biking quickly put
on golf shoes
play basketball your hiking shoes can
double as slippers around the campsite
clean up casual shoes use the magnetic
force show off your Zubaz hang shoes on
your locker or conveniently organize the
whole family's shoes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
