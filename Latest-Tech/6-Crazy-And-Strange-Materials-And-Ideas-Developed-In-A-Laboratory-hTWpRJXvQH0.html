ideas developed in a laboratory number
one ultra hydrophobic material gentle
science has made some great progress in
the recent decades in the field of
hydrophobicity and opening a wide range
of applications ultra hydrophobic
surfaces are extremely difficult to wet
the contact angles of water droplets and
an ultra hydrophobic material exceed 150
degrees this is also referred to as the
Lotus effect this effect was discovered
in the 1970s from the microscopic
observations of the surface of a lotus
leaf a droplet impacting on hydrophobic
surfaces can fully rebound like an
elastic ball research in this field is
very advanced in focused and finding a
material with the highest level of water
repellency to achieve a material
extremely repellant which would be a
huge help for many industrial fields
ultra tech International has partnered
with Luna innovations to bring to market
a revolutionary new coating Gento is
able to achieve the best properties of
hydrophobic coatings through complex
chemical reactions a sol-gel is a liquid
solution that becomes a gel it has
flexibility and toughness at the same
time almost like a flexible ceramic on
the surface of super hydrophobic
coatings water will beat up but more
importantly water will shed off the
surface Gento is actually not super
hydrophobic but because of its low
sliding angle of less than 5 degrees it
sheds blood similarly super hydrophobic
s-- due to their structure don't stand
up too much abrasion Gento is unlike
traditional super hydrophobic coatings
with its unique ability not only to
repel water most oils and solvents but
also with its significant abrasion
resistance durability and flexibility
number 2 hydrogel hydrogel is a gel
polymer network that contains over
ninety percent water and the changes its
size under the influence of temperature
it's composed of small crystals that are
able to absorb water 30 to 60 times
their own volume the total absorbency in
swelling capacity are controlled by the
type
degree of cross linkers used to make the
gel thanks to its amazing water
absorption capacity hydro gels are used
in greenhouses agricultural nurseries
and they are the first biomaterials
designed for use in the human body
recently there have been several
important developments which have
broadened the applicability of hydrogel
materials the material is also commonly
used for medical purposes for tissue
engineering current research focuses on
the development of hydrogels for cardiac
repair chronic wound and burn dressings
and 3d bioprinting applications number
three nitinol nitinol is composed of
nickel and titanium and almost equal
proportions it has a special ability to
rebound to its original form even after
you mold it into different shapes the
phenomenon called the memory effect is
driven by heat exchanges it is able to
repeat this process many times without
losing the ability to regain its
original shape this material has a wide
range of applications in the fields of
electronics and mechanics it can also be
used in smartphones robotics and medical
industries number four methyl gallium
gallium metal is one of the least known
in the scientific field this strange
mysterious metal is very difficult to
understand for members of the scientific
community gallium is a soft metal which
is a brittle solid at low temperatures
and liquid at temperatures greater at
twenty nine point seven degrees Celsius
if you keep it in your palm for just a
few minutes your body heat will cause a
solid metal to gradually turn into
liquid this non-toxic metal is
definitely very interesting and has a
wide range of potentials but a certainly
lachchi 1-kilogram costs $3,000 number-5
aerogel
also known as liquid smoke aerogel is a
broad term referring to a special group
of materials its chemical structure is
similar to glass but its density is a
thousand times lower since it contains
99% air ingredients thanks to its
properties the aerogel is the lightest
solid material that exists today despite
its very low weight this material is
very strong its heat insulation
properties have been exploited by NASA
engineers NASA used this material in
most of its spacecraft to provide heat
protection from the Sun aerogel has been
used since the early 1960s in space
travel but scientists are now finding
multiple users such as detection of
nuclear radiation absorption of
long-lived nuclear waste thermal
insulation and detection of harmful
microorganisms number six magnetic
Thinking Putty like any other putty it
can be stretched bounced molded pot and
torn however when this but is in the
presence of a magnetic field
if exhibits fascinating properties this
truly amazing magnetic monster can be
created by simply adding ferric iron
oxide powder to regular silly putty and
then it becomes ferromagnetic the
unusual magnetic mass interacts with
other strong ferromagnetic magnets any
other powerful Ferro magnet that gets in
the range of the magnetic field of the
putty will experience a force that pulls
into a region of stronger magnetic
strength hit that like button if you
