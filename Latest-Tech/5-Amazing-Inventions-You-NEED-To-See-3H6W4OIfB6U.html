we love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go they help us plan our
day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us they even
support our work day but all these fun
functions come at a cost battery don't
you just hate it when your phone runs
out of battery our current solution
includes carrying around our power bank
plugs cables and everything else we need
to ensure we don't run out of juice
imagine if there was a smarter way to
save your precious phone battery from
running out all the time something
lightweight and easy to use say hello to
cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sing and
quit charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Hugh simply wrap it in
this tuck away slot you're good to go
how really does the cube work well it's
a simple concept just plug your cube
into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down hi my name
is question as every busy person I was
often on the road and almost every day
my form was running out of the battery
in the afternoon instead of messy wires
and power bank I want you to have only
one small device that can replace the
number of home accessories I have to
carry everything when we started to
think about the cube look at the
existing technology on the map
and we quickly notice that most of the
available devices were not complete and
lucky was a friend together with fear
our head designer we develop the cube we
went through several prototypes to find
the best design review a designer dish
elegans compact and practical it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a swollen
cool design with a significant battery
capacity it was something that had never
been done but we made it and we're so
proud and excited to bring it to you
cube is the world's first compact and
lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sink in quick charging
cable you also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
simply put it's an amazing piece of
technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world so
get yours now and be one of the first
few boulders

I want to call it with an engine on top
orange wheel this is an alien block 39
and away clean can I make a ballerina
her name is Christina it's my fam right
drag car I want to dance on wheel my
name is a south I've been designing toys
for the past ten years three years ago I
was invited to teach at a school in
Harlem as part of the city arts program
that marked the beginning of the toy ish
journey working with the kids on toy
building and witnessing the level of
creativity really inspired me I returned
to the studio with a new approach my
focus became on how to recreate that
feeling of accomplishment with each
child got the chance to express their
uniqueness after countless hours in the
studio brainstorming sketching and
modeling the idea for toy ish was born
playing with toys she's fun and
intuitive there's no right or wrong way
to play it enables kids to figure out
what they want to do make it happen and
then play with a very own toys creation
each storage kit is made out of four
elements a coloring playbook a clear
capsule think play part and a magnetic
character that locks it all together
this is how I make my ballerina yet a
coloring from the book any sheet
block you color it in you put the paper
inside the cup the legs next you put the
base the body and just spin it and
that's how you make your salary now have
a nice day the name of our product is an
extension of our philosophy the product
is like a toy it is toy ish it is not
really a toy until a kid makes it one
until they use their imagination and
bring it to life in the past year we've
tested toys with over 100 kids parents
and educators we have since won several
awards and are now ready for production
my hope is that more kids will play with
toys express their ideas gain confidence
and feel special
with your help we can launch toys and
make the first production round your
pledges will allow us to develop and
create more choices for kids to play
with we have so many exciting plans for
the future so please support this
journey share it with friends and let's
make it happen
