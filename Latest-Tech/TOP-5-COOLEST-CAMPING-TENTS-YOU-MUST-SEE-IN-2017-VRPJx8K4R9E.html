this
camping gives us amazing opportunity to
explore remote destinations climb new
heights make new friends and experience
epic festival but there's always been a
catch after sunrise tents are often too
hot or too bright so many of us don't
get enough sleep now imagine the
possibilities if we had all the rest we
needed we have more energy to explore
further be more adventurous and have
even more fun that's why we created the
siesta for a revolutionary new tent
engineered from the ground up to give
you the best possible sleep outdoors
even in blazing sunshine when the Sun
comes up our game-changing ultra
reflective fly fabrics blocks infrared
visible and ultraviolet lights
dramatically reducing the temperature
and brightness inside the tent
for extra comfort you can add our ultra
quiet 8-inch USB fan that zip right into
the custom vents drawing in fresh air
from outside the full-length fly
provides maximum protection from wind
and rain while the breathable inner tent
prevents condensation and closable mesh
keeps out dirt and cold drafts this
gives you incredible all-weather
versatility few of offers quick pitching
times of less than 2 minutes straight
out the bag and fully pitched
unlike other quick pitching tents in
fact like many other tents in the
camping world you can stand up in all of
our variations from the two men right
through to the format the cube isn't
easy to pack away as it is to set up and
it means you won't need to be an expert
in origami to try and get it back into
the bag when you're ready to come home
one of the major issues with standard
sense of being woken up by the Sun so
with the cube tent
we've added a black lining to our
material and this locks out the sunlight
our extensive ventilation system means
that a cool environment inside our tent
the material is PU coated and rake it to
our hydrostatic head ratings of 4000
meaning you'll be nice and dry even
under heavy rain conditions a heavy-duty
300d nylon material means this tent is
built to last for many years to come
the key to the cube is that they're easy
to erect and they offer you a great
space inside in addition we have a few
extras that we think will make this 10
in a faster design unlike other tent you
can connect them together the universal
tunnel system means you can build your
own bespoke set up of interconnected
tents on every cube you can connect to
every corner mean the possibilities to
join are absolutely endless
just imagine the planner group of mates
could have connecting together these at
a festival for instance
securing your very own party area we are
also adding some add-ons offering you a
solar panel that can be fixed inside the
window of the cube to store power and
the 13,000 milliamp battery pack this
practicar has a huge capacity why not
use it to use one of our ultra cool LED
lighting strips we're offering this LED
light strip in white or if you want your
ascent to be the party tent then you can
use the color-changing version
