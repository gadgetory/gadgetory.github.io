welcome to latest tech before we even
begin this video there's something we
need to tell you we reach 600,000
subscribers thank you so much for all
the support and we truly appreciate each
and every comment you guys leave every
opinion and every single thumbs up it
really helps us keep going and we
couldn't have done any of this without
you okay before we get too emotional
here are four monster machines built for
a very specific task with just a one
used expectation number one Large Hadron
Collider the world's largest particle
accelerator buried 328 feet below ground
at the European Organization for Nuclear
Research near Geneva Switzerland
the biggest particle hunting machine
that has ever been built the Large
Hadron Collider or LHC since protons are
iles to need the speed of light beyond
almost 17 mile long wave of
superconducting magnets in order to
potentially find new particles the Large
Hadron Collider recreates the conditions
that existed just after the Big Bang
it works a bit like a time machine the
health is that it could explain some of
the mysteries of how the universe was
formed number two Hughes Glomar Explorer
the 619 footlong Hughes Glomar Explorer
built in the 1970s was said to be for
the purpose of using the ship for a
deep-sea mining operation the truth was
the CIA commissioned the creation of the
massive ship in an effort to pick the
sunken Soviet key 29 nuclear submarine
and the information it contained of the
Pacific Ocean nor the plan relied on a
specially designed sling that would
cradled a 14 million pound submarine as
it would be slowly pulled to the surface
by high-powered winters on a heavily
modified ship during recovery the
lifting apparatus snapped at 9,000 feet
below the surface limiting the CIA's
recovery the ship was eventually big
Commission and used in the oil business
before eventually turning to scrap
number three
Trinity building bridges requires the
placement of concrete panels sometimes
constructed off-site and hauled to the
bridge and edit times cast in place with
moveable scaffolding systems or MSS that
essentially act as giant walls the
creation of the mercy gateway bridge in
England used in NSS McLean Trinity that
was designed specifically for the
project at 230 feet in length longer
than a traditional machine of its type
and larger than one ever seen in Europe
Trinity created over 2300 feet of bridge
deck before its 2017 dismantling that
required its 1,200 components 3,000
pieces and over 60,000 volts to all come
apart for either reuse or recycling
number 4 Big Bertha when it came time to
take a one-point 7 mile long tunnel
under downtown Seattle Washington State
Department of Transportation officials
turned to the world's largest tunnel
boring machine designed and built in
Japan specifically to handle Seattle
soil the 57 foot diameter machine dub
Bartha weighed nearly 8,000 tons and
trailed 326 beep in length Brenta was
designed for much more than to drill
moving forward at 35 feet of day it
cleaned up after itself then it
installed concrete panels building the
walls leaving a finished ton overhead
despite elastic breakdown and multi-year
bertha and the 700 cutting tools and the
cutter head face completed the boar in
2017 and was dissembled all sorry
