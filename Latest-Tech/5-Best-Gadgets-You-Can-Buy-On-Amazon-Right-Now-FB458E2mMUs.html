with the Nana leaf smarter kit now you
can
hey Siri turn the lights on in my
bedroom
okay the lights are turned on lighting
has been around for two million years
that's when our human asses actually
learn to control fire eventually evolved
into incandescent light we long with the
Industrial Revolution nowadays with oil
in with LED technology and of course the
human society has evolved rapidly along
with that you could say commands like
turn my lights down to 10% or you could
set scenes like snuggle time right when
you want to set the mood for something
it's not just a matter of function it's
it's so much more about how we actually
live our life what we do how we do it
when we do it we take our design very
seriously we work really hard to take a
lot of complex technology and put it
into the simplest form factor to be able
to create the simplest conveniences like
being able to turn off your kitchen
lights while you're lying in bed we
understand lighting in the two years
that we've been around we have won
multiple awards in categories for energy
efficiency as well as product design and
the light quality on the product we
design this product to be future proof
we do it by allowing software updates as
well as using open protocols and open
produce allows his product to work with
a range of other different products the
idea and the philosophy behind this is
that we don't want this product to end
up on the landfill name in the next one
year it's gonna be working with existing
technology with future technology for
the next 30 years at least and give you
great beautiful lights when we started
namma leaf our first goal was to create
the world's most energy-efficient light
bulb and our technology has evolved
lights on we believe this is the future
of lighting
