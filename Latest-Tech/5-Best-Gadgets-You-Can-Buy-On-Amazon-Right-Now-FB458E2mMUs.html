it's so much more about how we actually
live our life what we do how we do it

seriously we work really hard to take a
lot of complex technology and put it
into the simplest form factor to be able

understand lighting in the two years
that we've been around we have won
multiple awards in categories for energy
efficiency as well as product design and

well as using open protocols and open
produce allows his product to work with
a range of other different products the
idea and the philosophy behind this is
that we don't want this product to end
up on the landfill name in the next one
year it's gonna be working with existing
technology with future technology for
the next 30 years at least and give you
great beautiful lights when we started
