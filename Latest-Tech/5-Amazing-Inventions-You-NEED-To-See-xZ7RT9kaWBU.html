its extended arms or just hold it in the
palm of your hand to enjoy automatically
stitched videos on your VR headset

we've designed sphera camp to to be
unlike anything else out there but to
get it out there we need your help back
us on Kickstarter so we can put the best
spherical VR ready video camera in your
hands
hi I'm Gary and this is case Kay Kay
scam solves a problem that I think a lot
of a second sometimes when you want to
take a photo of yourself or group of
people there's never anyone around to
take the photo for you so the
photographer always ends up getting left
out the photo k scam is the world's most
compact I thought tripod it uses a
flip-out kickstand and a mirror embedded
imitates scene in order to reflect the
image in your iPhone's cameras enabling
you to take pictures or video without
having to hold up your phone the case
cam app is a delayed shot feature which
allows you to take group photos without
leaving the photographer out of the shot
now here's the really cool part using
another mobile device in a Wi-Fi
connection the case cam app lets you see
what the case cam sees allowing you to
frame the photo while you're in the
photo k scam works great for those who
love to travel take pictures with
friends and especially for those selfie
takers and video bloggers case cam is
made of rugged injection molded
polycarbonate to protect your iphone
just like a regular iphone case case cam
snaps on your iphone 5 or 5s and the
mirrored kickstand conveniently clicks
into place when you don't need it all of
the money raised during our kickstarter
campaign is going toward creating the
injection molding tooling needed to
bring case cam into production I can't
wait for you to join this journey with
us so please share us on Facebook tweet
about us tell all of your friends and
family and let's fund case him so that
we can bring everyone into the picture
you
when people stop seeing the camera you
really begin to see them
taking a great picture really you need
to blend into the world around you need
to really not be seen and not because
you're trying to be secretive but
because you want people to be who they
are when people realize that someone is
documenting them or something around
them they begin to shift and change the
way that they want you to perceive them
when Thomas first came to me with this
idea and we went through it and I
started looking for solutions there was
nothing available on the market and the
first prototype that we built with a
sliding lens was really exciting it was
like this is that this makes sense with
the cover lens in place you can now
point your camera directly at your
subject without having to hold it up and
be so obvious and take your picture in
order to make this whole thing as
compact as small as possible we needed
to stick with one lens one piece of
glass it took us almost eight months to
get to the lens that we have now
the successive cover isn't how many
cases we sell it's the great pictures
you make and we look forward to seeing
your images
and don't it feel good
am i down
you
yeah we checked out the sm one new
skidmark a phone case when skated around
hit a few spots tested out the lenses
and the durability of it and all around
how to get
overall my first impression was that it
was a really well made products very
sturdy got the job done did exactly what
was supposed to do and did it well the
case was really easy to use really easy
to put together filmmaker is really easy
the lenses were super good and I'm not
great at filming but I seem to actually
do a pretty good job with that lens i
got kept casey and the shots every
single time right here I mean it did a
great job protecting my father's really
heavy duty case like if it fell I don't
think it would be a problem at all three
days ago I slammed on my skateboard and
i ended up bending my phone think about
the sm one case on that this definitely
want to have happened i think it would
have actually protected it a lot better
than the case f right now the case is
really heavy duty the screen protector
worked great still use your phone the
thread to have a little bit of spacing
so the mini editing wasn't as harsh on
the fisheye but the fish eyes a little
bit wider so you don't lose any of that
fisheye effect
you
I think a step above of all the products
out there a case very functional still
be able to use your light everything
like that if you want a protective case
you don't have to switch cases for the
fisheye and it's just fact your normal
case to protect it like you have an
all-in-one protective case gives you all
functionality of the phone lightweight
durable it's not bulky at all it's a
very slim down a sleek case that just
fits easily in your pocket just pull it
out your pocket film put it back in your
pocket keep going to the next spot yeah
I definitely think would be easy useful
tool to have at all times definitely was
good for skateboarding I would
definitely buy one how much are they
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
