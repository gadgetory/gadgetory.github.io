marvel of flight never ceases to amaze
and the spectacle is so much more
unbelievable when the aircraft are
longer than Olympic pools heavier than
the biggest tanks and taller than
five-story buildings here are the most
monstrous planes flying today number one
an tonne of am 225 by most metrics the
antone of an-225 is the biggest plane in
the world only one of these monster
cargo aircraft was built by 10 tonne of
design bureau in the USSR in the 1980s
it was designed to carry the varan space
plane the Soviet version of a space
shuttle as well as rocket boosters but
the plane quickly found other airlifting
work after being refurbished following
the collapse of the Soviet space program
it is the heaviest aircraft ever built
with a maximum takeoff weight of 700
tonnes and tells the record for total
airlift of payload as well as air lifted
single item payload at 418 thousand
pounds it has the longest waistband of
any plane currently flying at 290 feet
this sixth engine beast is the
heavyweight champion
pounds
number two aerospace lines super guppy a
guppy might be prey but the super guppy
is a monster the bloated aircraft has
been retired by every institution in the
world save one NASA the u.s. space
agency finds the Guppies white
dimensions perfect for transporting
spacecraft and rocket components the
first super guppy was constructed from a
balloon fuselage taken from a Boeing C
97 strata fighter taking to the skies in
1965 the turboprop cargo plane was
replaced by the airbus beluga 4 large
and awkwardly shaped cargo delivery but
as long as NASA still has the use for
the super guppy it will continue to
baffle people in the sky and NASA loves
the super guppy
number three lockheed c-5 galaxy with a
payload capacity of almost 135 tonnes
the c5 galaxy is the largest aircraft
routinely operated by the US military
the Air Force announced that it was
reactivating the monster air flier in
May 2017 the c5 has enough cargo space
to carry two m1 Abrams tags 16 Humvees
three Black Hawks or a variety of other
vehicles without cargo the c5 can fly up
to 7,000 miles without refueling making
it the longest range military airlift
her in the world when the Air Force
needs a lot of tonnage move quickly
the c5 is what it turns to
number four McDonnell Douglas kc-10
extender the largest fuel capacity
tanker aircraft in the world entered
service in 1981 the KCT extender has a
total fuel capacity of 52,000 galleries
or about 175 tons of fuel it was
designed to provide a more capable
tanker than the Boeing kc-135 which was
about 25 years old at that point the Air
Force is in the process of acquiring the
new tanker the Boeing kc-46 Pegasus
which will be more efficient and
advanced than the kc-10 but the traget
extender will still have the Pegasus
feet on fuel capacity by about 70 tons
the kc-10 stores jet fuel in three main
wing tanks as well as large fuel tanks
under the cargo floor it can
alternatively be flown with a crew of 75
and 73 pounds of cargo or 85 tons of
cargo and all cargo configuration
