changed forever thanks to vertigo come
let me show you why huge thanks to our
Computex sponsors for sending us out
here shout out to nvidia fantex and c IX
and msi this my friends is not your
ordinary chair not your ordinary gaming
chair as you can see this is the trigger
to 75 by verdaguer 275 parts that go
into construction of this fantastic
channeling is fantastic because of
comfort modularity design so let's talk
about design first mesh breathable
underneath here those solids on the back
so that your back and your bite can
breathe we have nice leather accents
comes in five colors this is real
leather
the name behind the trigger are these
triggers we have this one controls the
angle of the backrest so you can go like
this and you can lock into place versus
having to reach down there and having to
adjust it and then here this one adjusts
the height we have a button on this side
this controls the seat depth so you
click it i'm right now extend it all the
way out there we go so if you want extra
length between the back seat and the
seat you know you can do something like
this either you you do you they have
nice aluminum alloy star here this is
also all metal we have a little bit of a
lumbar cushion not a christian a little
lumbar support but this one is there so
that you can also maneuver it up and
down depending on where you want the
little extra support on your back the
trigger 275 let's check out something
better well hello there i'm sitting on
the trigger 350 now and more advanced to
high end chair more premium features and
350 parts that go into construction on
this chair first we have these wonderful
new wheels more parts in the wheel
design so they are rolling ball bearing
so they are much quieter they're smooth
they're really good for hardwood
hardwood floors
they have 65 and 75 millimeter wheels so
a little extra height on these ones full
metal body on the the wheels as well so
the reason why this is a more premium
chair is big
has full metal frame as you can see
there's a lot more parts in the in the
body behind here versus the 275 you just
saw and the reason for that is because
of this wonderful lumbar support so not
only do we have this little pillow in
the front log cushion so it's going to
give you a little support in the back
that can change up and down and you can
also change the angle of the lumbar
press these two buttons depending on
your posture depending on your back
shape you can truly configure the way
the middle shape of the lumbar sits and
the height of the lumbar as well it
features all the same things as the 275
so something I didn't mention for the
275 are the height adjustable arm rests
that can also rotate in and out they
have seven positions on the eighth
position they reset so you can just
bring them down no buttons required
there is an optional headrest so let me
show you what that looks like now on a
very special chair and the last chair is
the trigger 350s II which stands for
special edition this one is very special
because of this gorgeous red color and
this paint on all this aluminum alloy so
the entire body here behind you is
painted in red as for the rest of chair
it has pretty much all the same features
as exactly the same features as the
trigger 350 but this one comes in this
red and this beautiful paint job that's
like the glossy feels absolutely
fantastic and this would be a little
headrest here it has a low angular
support here and also hight support let
me sit in this one more time for you
because I definitely going to miss it
they will have a 10 year warranty which
is a fantastic duration definitely gives
us confidence in the construction and
the feature set and the verdict gives
direction for the future support of
something economic and so modular and so
simple with this convenience triggers I
love it next let's talk about something
that you probably are familiar with
because we have taking a look at it on
the channel the L cell 5000 chair from
vertigo
they've done some modifications here is
the SL 5000 VR for all gamers out there
with VR coming to the mainstream you're
receiving your oculus and your HTC vibes
I'm jealous
here very Garrett is reaching towards
that market and give users that exact
functionality so here let me show you
the little cable management system that
the very gear has installed here so this
headset isn't sitting here randomly it's
actually rerouted here through low
zipper there's plenty of space in there
you can talk away all the cables that
goes through here goes onto the chair
plug it into your PC BAM lovely and by
the way check this out
you see this no more giant plastic cover
here the chair just simply slides into
the metal rails and you're ready to go
put on the screws super simple assembly
this is a fully modular system allows
you to install this plate in this plate
and different angles different heights
and three positions all around the chair
allows you to raise the height same
thing on this side so if you're doing
any flight simulator check this out this
is awesome this little thruster on this
side as well if you want to move any of
this stuff for a little helicopter
action you know when you have the
joystick in the middle that is also a
possibility plus plenty more these
little things will allow you to install
more support structures in front of the
chair and allow you to position you know
these support things for all your
accessories because they're on an angle
you can install a little racing wheel
they will be coming out with even longer
support beams that will support racing
pedals just like they have here so you
can set up a truly racing simulator with
pedals upside down in all types of
different positions obviously they've
thought about how the racing simulator
should should feel like and giving these
racing chairs actually pretty
comfortable when they're in the racing
position I feel like the SL 5000 is an
excellent choice also seeing as this is
geared towards V are having a lockable
gas lift is very important so it locks
the rotation of the chair you're not
moving around
you are doing a racing simulator you'll
feet are off the chair and off the
ground you're completely stuck in
position not moving anywhere and that
would conclude our verdict your tour
this will be available for $5.99 for the
trigger 275 $6.99 for trigger 350 and
the special edition will go for $8.99
availability will be next month guys
thanks so much for watching it we'll see
you in the next video you know you can
do things like this and just roll away
yes and also that's a good it's a good
chair trust me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
