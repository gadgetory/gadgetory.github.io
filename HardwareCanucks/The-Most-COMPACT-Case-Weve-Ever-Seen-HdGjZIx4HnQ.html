friend crap I forgot to put it in ah I
see it there it is
give me that all right people this one
should be fun in here we have these
smaller skis ever to pass through our
hands let's check it out alright the
contents are all here let's build right
after this finally an ultra slim body
keyboard with mechanical red or blue
switches designed and perfected for work
and play that the Sorrell Graham XS
evolved to fit right in check it out
below
damn right it's damn delicious and I
such instructions Wow look at this
motherboard tray bet you've never seen
any if you like it that's kind of like a
coaster too
so this is our 1200 north power supply
look at the beautiful detail you can see
right through so the airflow will come
through it's also fully modular so
that's appreciated nicely done here's
our cooler look at that beautiful fan
blades nice large heatsink yes obviously
can't have your system without your
storage we got five hard drives these
are 12 terabytes each plenty of storage
for a nice little server inside this
case and then we have our motherboard
it's nice that the motherboard standoffs
are already pre-installed so I can just
insert the cooler on top we have no
graphics card no maybe this is the
graphics card no this is a CPU only type
of system I'm ok with that bonus points
for anyone who can recognize what
motherboard this is based on the i/o
come on only two Ram slots must be old
you know it would not be a 2018 release
without the temporal glass panel nice
touch Coolermaster nice touch
alright so this is the entire component
breakdown let's build this beautiful
enclosure
so the tiny case is built its beautiful
the experience was flawless
lovely how all the components already
arrived however I am still missing a
graphics card but it is also missing one
flare element much better
all right people so that is how you
build a wooden prop case but in all
seriousness if you guys are actually
interested in compact systems wait until
I get to these guys so these are cool
masters new cue 300 lineup not exactly
sure what what's happening here but this
is the cue 300 P and then Q 300 L I
think they're both micro ATX cases and
you can like rotate them but look at
this filter design this is a dust filter
and look at that it's quite unique in
terms of how the front looks and I
absolutely love the law handles on this
one so yeah stay subscribed for the full
reviews and my experience to come very
soon alright people so I hope you
enjoyed this piece of content I
definitely enjoyed making it it's quite
unique shooting something so little but
so familiar at the same time so
definitely leave a like if you've never
seen it wouldn't assembly case before
