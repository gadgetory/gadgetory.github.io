and welcome to another video your view
XFX has gained a reputation for its
hardware and like EVGA is branching out
into other categories so today we're
looking at the very first chassis this
is the Bravo type on one and it is
released at an ambitious price of $130
now I say in Bish's because there are a
ton of excellent and already established
cases within that price range so let's
find out with how XFX did on their very
first case and I want to start off with
the size XFX is labeling this as a mid
tower but because the plastic exterior
bits the case turns out to be actually
quite large and here it is next to our
office full tower so I would certainly
put the Bravo case in the same category
design-wise XFX is slapping branding all
over the place with a cool-looking
aluminum piece that displays the model
and I can actually see this becoming
sort of a staple for their future cases
just maybe use some stronger glue next
time the case is elevated with the
rubberized feet and they are going to
that floating look allowing decent
enough space at the bottom for adequate
airflow which is totally fine but there
is two full inches that makes this case
unnecessary tall plus all the plastics
at the top at house on the ports and
actually quite convenient to carry the
case around all the connections are
placed at the top with audio jacks and
four USB ports two of which are USB 3
and right away because of the layout
it's not the most convenient especially
for ports going inward like that so
shall see placement may be limited power
and reset buttons are very discreet at
the front along with three hidden five
new quarter inch drive bays now removing
the front panel we find a detachable
dust filter and an included 200
millimeter intake that could also be
swapped for dual 120mm fans the fail
included here is a little bit surprising
as its thin profile makes it quiet but
questionable in terms of CFM performance
also it is heavily restricted by the
drive cage inside that is non removable
nothing unusual at the rear we get a 140
mm exhaust fan eight PCI slots what
clean grommets and the large duel dust
filter at the bottom at the top we also
find some ventilation that continues in
this very uniform style on both sides of
Bravo which are not dust proof so that's
really unfortunate the top house is a
single 120 or 140 millimeter fan that
must be installed from the inside with
the screws provided
now I'm a little surprised XFX emitted
dual fan mounting options here
considering how popular all-in-one 240
millimeter water coolers are becoming
you'd think for 2014 chassis this would
be taken into account it's the same
story for the side ventilation we get a
really cool uniform look and each panel
has the aluminum red plate showcasing
the model number and the mounting holes
for triple 120 millimeter fans
the side panel is actually two pieces
large plastic cover and metal side panel
underneath and that's because the alpha
version of the case will feature
aluminum panels and perhaps allow XFX to
reuse the internal frame with some new
and perhaps updated exterior design and
with both panels off let's check to see
how XFX did with the internal layout
first we have two lyst mechanisms for
your optical drive cage followed by an
array of eight drive caddies with SSD
support in the middle and the drive cage
is partially modular allowing to turn
this into a dedicated two and a half
inch drive cage with additional 5 SSD
brackets included now we've seen this
design to work really well for compact
enclosures but given how large the case
is I find it totally unfitting for
example there is already 12 inches of
clearance with a caged wall in the
standard position that expands to 13 and
a half inches with the SSD cage plus the
incredibly restrictive front air flow
caused by the frame now it's nice for
XFX to realize user flexibility is
important but an actual drive cage that
is totally removable to allow better
airflow would be more fitting in the
Bravo the power supply sits on stick on
rubber feet plus we get 120 and on 140
millimeter fan mount at the bottom
clearance of which would be the
by the length of your power supply
turning the case around the CPU card is
way too small for 2014 standards and I'd
love to see that enlarged however we do
get many cable timeouts
scattered all over Plus these that has
strange rubber grommets that fit with
the case design there isn't that much
clearance at the back enough for all
your cables to work but not enough for
those side panel fans and starting with
the assembly the large internal send
excellent cable cutouts around the
motherboard make rounding really easy
additional cutouts underneath the
motherboard are always helpful plus the
four large openings on the side of the
motherboard are excellent there is just
over two inches of clearance between the
top panel and our memory modules and
it's just really unfortunate we don't
have any dual fan placements for a
potential radiator and turning the case
around cable management is quite simple
there's plenty of room but what about
additional SSD brackets or fan hubs
these are all the features that we're
seeing more and more of and XFX really
need to take note as this is just not up
to 2014 standards but having said that
the case has a few good attributes like
unique aesthetics flexible drive cage
system and a pretty seamless assembly
routing process but I gotta say I'm
slightly disappointed at the lack
features for a 2014 case as the Bravo
type of one doesn't really bring
anything new to the market there's a
huge loss in airflow potential both in
the front and the top due to drive cage
system that is extremely restrictive and
the lack of dual fan support at the top
gets rid of any internal water cooling
options there are no dust filters either
on the side or the top and placement of
USB in the audio port is really limiting
there's just so many things XFX couldn't
have done differently and at this price
point it is hard to justify the list of
negatives especially since it misses on
key functionality points like internal
water cooling and unique features I want
to say it's a good first attempt from
XFX but given the incredibly competitive
nature of the enclosure market today we
need to see more focus on functionality
and uniqueness so guys let's give them
some critical feedback and you let us
know in the comments below
what features you'd want to see
incorporated into their next design
