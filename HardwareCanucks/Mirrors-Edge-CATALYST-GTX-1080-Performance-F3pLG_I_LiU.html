ox welcome to another other interrupted
gameplay video behind me were playing
Mirror's Edge catalyst to brand new
title and it's powered by the GTX stand
they found there's edition overclocked
to 2 gigahertz we'll see how the cart
performs and man this game is demanding
we're playing on the hyper setting so
2560 by 1440 P resolution and one thing
that I found out by changing the field
of view of the of the gameplay and
actually affects how the main thing the
title is so here's an example between
the minimum a field of view of 60 all
the way to 90 degrees and you can see
the frame rate difference is 5 fps
between minimum and maximum and so to
make this benchmark a little bit more
demanding we are playing at 90 field of
view also gives you a bit of extra
motion as you run so you feel like you
everything is kind of moving past you a
little bit quicker which I think adds a
little bit to the atmosphere of this
game so enjoy
these team laps is one of the taller
buildings you should see their logo on
the side
halfway there already let's see if you
can catch up
just reiterate faith to make your way to
the agricultural division that Elysium
use the shotgun on a terminal there and
then get out
yeah I hope so
the agricultural department occupies the
top floors fastest way up is to use the
elevators
once you find the elevators you can
climb one of the shafts or if we write
one of the cards
I said the request three days it will be
things do anything else absolutely yes
yesterday I happened on the project such
a situation something called the kingdom
some of the ethical implications of what
I found what goes on in
I was close over today and what I can't
be they're retreating
have you found a found a way it's
agricultural maybe Gabriel Krueger is
here what what we should avoid the run
hmm I'm finishing us all right like I
can stop enjoy vigorous keep us updated
on any changes outside faith you want to
find the offices next
I wonder what Gabriel courier is doing
in bed with the more town family in
Elysium the less we know about that the
better
information is power
what's the data we're grabbing again
sorry dead faith is driving while I
babysitter the new enzyme some sort of
nutritional enhancer Rapoza wants it be
of this area
all right you'll be better than me you
were right she was bad - right I'm gonna
stay she Kruger septum part it's true
that night you know it's time for you to
get some more rest in me I'm gonna check
on you again soon
at the double find me this real good
there's someone who's here but I'm gonna
check it
later on exit out of there
if I have been there good get back here
the other side of the beat Walt did you
back at the lair Kate the greatest on
fire whatever you did release there's a
nest face I've been telling you for
years
we don't your runs against Kruger say I
know what's the first thing you do when
you get out I don't know why I bother
cigarettes which is better
now just shake off the rest
so a few interesting characteristics
that we can take out from this gameplay
is that my average frame rates remained
in the high 70s so like a 78 to 80 FPS
and that is remaining outdoors if I went
inside my frame rate dropped the minimum
frame rate observed was like a low 50s
and that is when I was inside talking to
a certain character and just a strange
to see how demanding this game is
because on the visual side of things
here sure it's pretty but the textures
and things like that don't really reveal
themselves as being high quality unless
you're really close to those assets you
know if you're in distance and you see
an object like a person in a distance
they're there they're there
but everything the texture stuff doesn't
really come out unless you come really
close the memory usage for the GPU
remained under 6 GB however I did notice
in my gameplay a couple days ago when it
was at 7.4 I wish I recorded that
because I've tried to recreate it here
with playing the exact same settings but
I couldn't so 7.4 gigabytes of vram used
in this game that's just insane while in
my gameplay here we remained below 6
pretty much for the entire duration so
guys I hope you enjoyed this let us know
which game you'd like us to try next gtx
1070 is on the way to me so you can
leave me comments down below on what
games you'd like to try with that card
I'm Dimitri with her ex Knox thanks so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
