hello everyone this is dimitri with
Herick knucks and today in the review
table is a really exciting chassis I
feel like I say that with every fan
Tech's release but in this case it's a
special because the company is listening
to feedback from users and delivering
quickly on promises so this is the end
to evolve ATX priced at $179 you are
looking at an all aluminum exterior
frame and it looks fantastic with this
titanium gray coating it has a tiny
amount of sparkle due to sandblasted and
anodized process that actually
camouflage as any handling marks very
well plus I must mention that all the
edges on the chassis have been smoothed
out and refined so you don't end up
slashing your hand open and when
handling all the aluminum panels now the
design language feels familiar to the
Evolve line like the front LED strip
that adds a bit of character and can be
swapped for different colors from the
default white to blue red or green this
interesting looking front is found on
all the Evolve cases as well it has the
panel spaced out from the fans behind it
with cutouts on each side to allow
adequate air phone to enter behind we
find the removable dust filter spending
the entire potential intake area it's
very well attached so it doesn't
relocate if you pump a case it has also
a very fine mesh + dual 140 member fans
included with support for triple 120mm
fans and therefore radiators up to 360
millimeters will fit and front the
mounting strips will allow flexibility
for a fan placement and that's awesome
plus notice how the bottom fan delivers
air flow to the bottom chamber and the
main chamber and if needed you can lift
dual 140 mm fans higher as mounting
holes are available for extra intake all
into the main chamber the large side
panel window is awesome to showcase the
entire interior there is an incentive to
do a clean job and also reveals the
staple fantex logo install
and an optional SSD mount on the side
there plus each side panel sets on
hinges and can easily swivel out for
convenient access or simply lifted off
the case if needed and notice a foam
layer all around the frame of the panel
to avoid direct metal on aluminum
contact thus reducing any audible
vibrations and the panel might generate
the front i/o sets behind the cover and
here we only find dual USB 3.0 ports
audio jacks and the reset button and for
an ATX chassis I would have liked to see
four USBs here the power button is
located right above it does not
illuminate something I was expecting to
see but it's kind of discreet like this
with the top panel flat and only with
exhaust ports on each side that seems
kind of limiting but the top panel has
some height to it
thus any exhaust air should have enough
room to exit without rebounding back
into the chassis taking a look at the
back we have another 140 member fan
included sitting on mounting strips very
nice seven PCI slots with mounting
options for a reservoir right beside
there as fantex is always taking water
cooling seriously the case is somewhat
lifted with a good quality feet at the
bottom and the removal power supply
filter is included there as well and
finally let's take a look inside and see
what new features fantex has
incorporated here so first of all notice
how open the interior is your
conventional hard drive cage is nowhere
to be found allowing users to utilize
the front four radiators or just
unrestrictive airflow so instead the
drive cage has been moved to the
basement with two brackets compatible
with SSDs so the main chamber is
separated from the power supply below
but with ventilated floor to allow any
GPU to breathe if mounted in the bottom
PCI slots Plus grommeted cutout is
available for perhaps routing your PCI
Express cables now notice these plastic
brackets on the rear wall and fantex has
integrated a very clever drive mounting
system for users that don't want to
occupy the entire drive cage using the
following brackets you get three in
total there are SSD compatible with the
sidemount and they also are angled for
better structural support for mounting
you need to remove the plastic cover a
space that will be used for SATA
connections attach the bracket on clips
and secure with screws at the rear so
this way users have total flexibility on
where they want the drives either at the
bottom more spaced out to allow longer
GPUs to be installed and have better
clearance for front airflow that's
important and I think three brackets may
be limiting for some users but they can
be purchased separately at the back
notice the cover reveals the SATA
connections and this individual drive
system is awesome to not have any
unnecessary openings in the panel now
one of the best features I think the
evolved line is the removable top fan
mounting plate it is mounted via silver
coloured screws for easier distinction
for removal
it sits on rails and the bracket will
support dual 140 member fans or triple
120mm fans and their respective radiator
sizes all mounted on strips for better
flexibility and take a look behind the
motherboard tray the evolved ATX is very
well designed for cable management with
those familiar velcro straps allowing
you to spread the bundled cables the pwn
fan hub for six fans is awesome and made
sure to connect all the fans here to
keep the fan speed consistent throughout
the case and dual SSD brackets that are
super convenient to stash away two SSDs
with extra mounting spot on the shroud
in the front to showcase the SSD
branding with an appropriate cutout at
the bottom for sound and routing the
front portion of the floor is removable
this would allow users to mount the
radiator inside the frame given you
remove the entire drive cage underneath
but also notice it's got these strips
for mounting a bumper bracket for
example that is included I was also very
happy to see proper toolbox included to
store all your screws for easier
assembly and speaking of which the
entire setup was incredibly simple after
mounting in the hardware getting the top
radiator in place was a breeze just make
sure to align with the rails and tighten
with screws in the end the first boot
goes without problems and you can see
just how open the
theory is to allow various user
configurations for a super-clean system
thanks to well spaced out grommeted
cutouts all around the motherboard tray
the airflow is non restrictive because
you can move around the individual drive
brackets and it's really inviting for
installation of front radiators and the
top mounting bracket is really clever
it's a way to simplify the installation
process of fans or radiators means you
don't need to fill it around with the
top panel and instead secure everything
off the case for cable management and
the rear I literally did nothing because
the power supply chamber is closed off
and none of these cables are visible
from the front plus because you have so
much depth and this massive gap in front
and beside the power supply to stash all
your cables the evolved ATX is ready to
handle anything
cable intensive and finally closing the
panel we get a nice presentation of the
hardware and I was actually surprised at
how much sound the side panels blocked
off I really liked the swivel approach
minimizing the hassle of panel alignment
and the rear panel closed just as fine
and so the evolved ATX is a very
attractive option for those who want to
experience what fantex is all about all
the core features the company stands
behind and their foundation is presented
well throughout this case the price of
$180 is a reflection of outstanding
aluminum build quality the modularity
aspect of the drive mounts and the top
fan bracket and targeting the water
cooling crowd for an absolutely
enjoyable experience that have not
disappointed us in the slightest this is
a damn freakin good chassis and so that
concludes this review let us know what
you think of these individual Drive
brackets for the main chamber and we are
honestly quite impressed at how fan Tex
has taken all the feedback based on the
micro ATX version and seriously
perfected the involve line hit that like
button if you'd like to see more things
from fan tanks thanks so much for
watching and we'll see you in the neck
one
