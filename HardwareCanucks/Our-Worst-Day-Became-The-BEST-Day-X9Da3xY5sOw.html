coming outside from inside in Taipei we
were in air-conditioning is now 40
degrees outside can you see me
no absolutely yeah I do let him we just
stepped out a freezer
oh yeah you did so someone forgot to
bring their business card no all right
so something weird just happened it is
1:00 a.m. we were editing our stuff all
the lights just went off was kind of
creepy and it was very dark for a few
seconds yeah but we were afraid okay all
right back to editing a guess so here's
the situation we've had a little bit of
trouble with ubers laptop lately just
blue screens of death and we're losing
work we're re editing things because
things crashed in the middle of a save
we got a clutch will help from gigabyte
thing and that's notebook for for the
show so we can edit it with it and we
brought it home thinking like this is
going to be great and smooth and decide
to check it to see if it was
password-protected and this is what
happened oh no Eber this is for you I
don't know how you got this to work well
you know we didn't happen to have a one
so we didn't happen to have it drawn
we didn't happen to have a drive with
installation video on it we didn't
happen to have a notebook that was in
Taiwanese and we definitely didn't
reinstall windows on it we didn't we
hold on guys we forgot to unplug this oh
yeah we should have used so nothing this
is our second last morning together and
we
have some of the exciting coffee place
to visit
that is called HWC so the story behind
HWC is very simple we were walking
towards the meeting and we just happen
to find the store or the restaurant all
that me where well done it is incredibly
hard but it's also raining slightly so
it's got a little cooling effect going
on all right we found it Hurricane Ike
Roasters Mike was just joking around
that it's closed
make th epics offset delicious coffee
this is a fantastic coffee HWC Roasters
definitely check it out either
it's the best iced latte I've ever had
you got goosebumps when you do it's a
freakin amazing one of the best coffees
I've ever had we were just about to go
to the National Palace Museum when I've
never seen raindrops that big it's so
thick I mean you can see individual and
I'm surprised people are drawn the
scooter and the scooter is going and
that looks scared everybody everybody
down there's like no so it is our last
full day in Taipei and while it is
raining and the weather is not the best
we're still going to take a full
advantage of today go see the National
Palace Museum meet some other awesome
people in there
we have arrived just in time for the
beautiful weather looks like we just
missed the rain but there's a massive
cloud behind us hopefully we don't get
soaked but nice little time for a walk
in the park see the palace
you're a good day today good day and I
got an awesome day fantastic day you
know extra energy
I like the transition so this is what
the desk looks like after a full week of
production Taipei you have treated as
well thank you so much
you know you're doing the fish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
