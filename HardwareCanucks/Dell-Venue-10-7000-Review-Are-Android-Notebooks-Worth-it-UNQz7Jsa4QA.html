great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Harbor
Canucks and there is one particular
market segment within the mobile sphere
that isn't fully evolved yet or fully
explored I'm talking about Android
notebooks where you can take advantage
of the higher power efficiency of
Android over other operating systems and
also incredibly compact form factor to
accompany you where both weight and size
limitations are important so the Dell
Venue 10 7000 is one mouthful it is one
of those machines that satisfies the
criteria of being a proper Android
notebook first because of the
outstanding keyboard and form factor
that is both sort of large enough for a
comfortable operation but without
crossing into the bulky threshold the
price is not bad either at $4.99 for the
tablet only and 629 for the bundled
keyboard although without the keyboard
the tablet alone is far less functional
now on paper this thing is okay with a
quad-core until Atom CPU two gigs of ram
16 and 32 gigabyte capacities excellent
Wi-Fi antenna and promised 7 hour
battery life and so everyone should
appreciate what they've done with the
attachment mechanism it's partially
magnetic and also partially mechanical
with excellent hinges holding down this
two piece design the six thousand
milliamp hour battery is packed into
this device thanks to this circular
hinge and also front-facing speakers are
built in here with really clear and
fairly loud projection now you can
easily detach the tablet just by opening
it up past its maximum angle and since
the keyboard is bluetooth it instantly
recognized when the to merge the hinge
also allows for comfortable one-hand
operation especially for reading
articles in this portrait mode but it
goes to 600 grams the Venu 10 7000
becomes heavy really fast now despite
the incredibly thin in light frame of
the keyboard the balance is somehow
really
perfect you can still use touch without
tipping over the venue 10 even at
maximum angle and you can even carry the
entire thing by the keyboard alone
without worrying of the tablet popping
out while we are on the keyboard side of
things
it is beautifully backlit in white you
get full-sized low profile keys with all
the shortcuts for Android navigation
even the caps lock indicator which is
awesome now there's a surprising amount
of travel distance and the keys that is
both pleasing and is great for fast
typers once you get past the learning
curve you'll be just typing away
trackpad is also very smooth offers
smooth navigation light click that is
only in the bottom portion of the pad
and there's also excellent multi finger
support and scrolling even is better
than Windows the only negative point is
that you cannot change the sensitivity
of the trackpad for example if you find
it too sensitive or not sensitive enough
so there's nothing you can do and also
to keep such a thin profile the keyboard
does not have its own battery meaning
you won't be able to connect it to other
tablets while for 95% of my time I use
this as a notebook the keyboard can also
be sort of stashed away behind the
tablet or set up in this 10th mode in
which the keyboard is off which is
excellent so it does not consume any
battery and well let's finally talk
about the brains behind this operation
the display is 10.5 inches it is high
resolution at 2560 by 1600 viewing
angles are good and this is one of the
most vibrant displays that you can find
on the tablet which is excellent for
media consumption everything just pops
out but I find it a little bit to be
over the top and I would prefer to have
different presets of color to choose
from so it's not as vibrant and maybe
perhaps a little bit more accurate on
the side but you can't change any of the
display settings on the left side we
have a volume rocker and the power
button that are kwikki and easy to find
on the other side is a headphone /
microphone combo jack micro USB and the
microSD card slot for additional storage
the front-facing 2-megapixel camera is
just okay while the rear
megapixel camera still incorporates that
intel realsense depth camera that allows
capture of depth information but it is
one of the worst cameras both in terms
of quality and real use scenarios
seriously when would somebody be taking
pictures with a tablet in 2015 now the
camera quality aside the depth
information captured by the realsense
camera isn't accurate
here's a shot of a teapot and a very
well lit scenario despite of how
terrible this photo looks and we can go
ahead and change the depth of field but
look what happens when you try to blur
out the background the sensors can't
even recognize the full shape of the
teapot and you just have this mess also
measurements are not accurate in my
experience this fence here across my
balcony is not 18 feet in height but the
real question lies in the following is
there actually space for Android
notebooks with in the current market
sphere like the Dell Venue 10 7000 and I
would say absolutely and so I recently
went on a trip where my only luggage was
this backpack traveling this life meant
I could not bring my eurocom machine my
shield tablet just wouldn't cut it for
me for writing review scripts and
answering a ton of email while I'm out
of the office so this is really where
the venue 10 7000 really stepped up and
I was also as productive as I would on a
standard notebook the combination of
touchscreen and the excellent keyboard
really is appealing you can be doing all
your work like no problem and the
trackpad is excellent too I had
absolutely no hassle with this
combination as for battery life watching
movies on airplane mode I could easily
pass eight hours of on-screen time
however turn on browsing the web start
to use the keyboard because it also
consumes the battery and then you're
looking about six hours which I feel is
a bit limiting the majority of my time
was spent on Gmail Google Drive - the
office and Excel and also using Chrome
for the YouTube full desktop site just
because for some stupid reason the
YouTube studio app
doesn't work in landscape you do please
performance-wise
everything was snappy and I've
experienced no crashes but for some
reason the tablet takes its sweet time
of changing orientation sometimes not
even recognizing that it's upside down
right then one likely Dell is up-to-date
with Android so it is running lollipop
5.0.2 which is great but man it is not
optimized to utilize this type of screen
real estate for example bring down the
notifications they are dead center we
have all this wasted space on the sides
and so many apps do not support
landscape mode Instagram Adobe Photoshop
YouTube studio app but really that's not
the fault of the tablet but Android and
for conclusion what this device allows
me to do is perform my most common daily
tasks if I'm away from the office so I
can manage the YouTube channel I can
upload videos I can respond to comments
and you know have the proper
correspondence for email thanks for that
excellent physical keyboard which
without this keyboard the tablet would
just be another 10-inch tablet on the
market nothing special
but with a keyboard this is a proper
Android notebook and while it is an
expensive piece of tech for the combo
and $629 considering Android is still
fairly limited at what you can do with
it the selling point is the form factor
only thing I wish that del would remove
is that the rear send step camera
because it is quite pointless for this
foam factor maybe add in a SIM card slot
so you are more connected on the go and
maybe also lower the price just a tiny
bit for it to be more competitive
because I in that sense you're looking
at the perfect student machine and the
perfect travel machine as well and so
the bottom line there are limitations
with Android especially in landscape
mode however this is by far the best
Android notebook integration yet and
well that concludes this review leave us
