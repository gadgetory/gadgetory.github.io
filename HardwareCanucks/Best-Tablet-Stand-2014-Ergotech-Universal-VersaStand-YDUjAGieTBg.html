great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
haruka NOx and today we're going to take
a look at the potentially useful item if
you rely on your tablet for optimal
utilization of your desktop setup
tablets are perfect for social
interaction and provide that additional
screen real estate that might complement
your productivity for office or from
home and air katenka just the product
this is their universal tablet versus
stand and like with all their products
this is made to be flexible with
mounting as by design the bracket itself
can be attached complementing monitor
arms and it's not just limited to this
stand alone this two-piece stand will
set you back $30 that is roughly in the
ballpark how much your tablet cases will
cost so investing in quality stand
doesn't sound unreasonable and also
comparing this to competing tablet
stands the vs. stand seems to stand out
for many reasons the base station is
fully aluminum like with all a great X
products everything feels solid from the
three articulated joints through the
small feet and to the secure port while
not made entirely portable the stand
falls all the way in and included is a
carry pouch for scratch free
transportation the mounting bracket
itself is plastic with an aluminum
secure mechanism and also built-in
magnet there is a large rubber pad in
the center and two clamping edges that
are also rubberized for secure hold of
the device so the name Universal is
indicative of the size this will support
is any tablet with minimum of six inches
and maximum of eight inches in width is
supported by the vs. stain and this
covers a whole wide spectrum of devices
everything from your Samsung offerings
to the Nexus line and all the Apple
iPads and to mount the tablet you press
the side button to release the extended
bracket are just the size and tightly
press both sides squeeze the release
mechanism on the stand
align the magnetic backing of the
bracket and you're basically good to go
very simple and intuitive
there's also a large cutout at the
bottom of the bracket for routing your
power cables that is very thoughtful and
comes the best part the flexibility of
maneuver is quite versatile we first
have the full 360 degree rotation plus
any adjustment on the three articulating
joints for your reading mode typing mode
and align it with your computer screen
mode the only thing I think is missing
is the ability to lock the rotation as
it's not very resistive but other than
that our Nexus 7 was just a treat to
work with in this orientation plus you
can adjust the width of the feet
depending on how much space you have on
your desk without sacrificing the
stability of the entire system also I
would love to see the tablet bracket
gets smaller perhaps in future
iterations as one of the ends is
definitely not low-profile and is
actually quite bulky but I do have to
say the universal vs. name is truly
impressive and it really shows Agrotech
is serious with delivering the best on
the market with solid build quality
light and non intrusive form outstanding
flexibility for articulation and
variable tablet support the incorporated
cutout for cable routing for charging is
very useful and also incredible value
for just $30 that I think is a
no-brainer for those relying on tablets
for additional productivity at home or
office now there's one thing I would
love to see changed is to minimize the
form of the bracket itself to be as
minimal as possible especially at the
ends there that tends to stick out but
overall I'm happy to say this is one
damn good value tablet stand and for
those who constantly use their tablets
for social interaction and media would
you actually consider getting one of
these for your space let us know in the
comments below we'd love to hear what
you think and make sure to check out our
