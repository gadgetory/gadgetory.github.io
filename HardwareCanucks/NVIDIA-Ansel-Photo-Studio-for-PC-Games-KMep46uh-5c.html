economics I'm back in the office but the
Computex courage still continues we have
few videos lined up for you today we're
talking about in the video hardware
canucks is at another fantastic
computech show all thanks to nvidia
fantex NCIX and msi so aside from
showing off plenty of Awesome VR demos
all around the floor there vr village
and at first of its kind PC
configuration that I've seen with triple
gtx 1080 GPUs on a single system and I
just want to confirm or clarify that
this was running in two-way SLI and the
third graphics card was dedicated for
physx and the system was running fun
house with an HTC vive which was
showcasing all of the best of the pest
VR graphics for fluid simulation fire
shadows and all the good stuff now
talking about VR and try to explain what
that experience is like it was a lot
more challenging through text and video
then actually having to experience it
and that's why Nvidia had this large
room so that everybody could come in and
try out all the types of demos for
themselves so they could potentially be
those potential buyers but another super
cool thing that I'm excited about is
nvidia and soul so what the video Ansel
is it's a game image capture tool or
like a photo studio for pc game that
grants you freedom to pause the game
free roam the camera so you can move it
anywhere you want with the idea to
capture incredible in-game photography
and that is actually something more and
more people now becoming more interested
in and not really having the tools to do
it like what nvidia is trying to push
forward so you could potentially explore
your artistic direction of expression
through in-game photography with
capturing just the environment at your
end with all the assets and you know
game engines without the user Hut I
personally cannot wait to try Ansel and
see what type of images i can get with
my own creative mind but it's not as
easy as simply jumping into any game and
naval and console so first the supported
game list is very short with only seven
games supported at the moment and I
asked them why and it is based on the
relationship between Nvidia and the game
developer and how much freedom the
developer wants to give Nvidia since you
have pretty much all the controls on to
play around with on like the field of
view color and texture information you
have some special effects in there and
different types of capture format so
either just an image or a full
360-degree VR capable capture and so we
put it on the HTC vive and jump to
Witcher 3 and explore that game at the
moment of time when that frame was
captured and right now I think that
Nvidia answer would be the perfect
gateway developing that ecosystem for VR
capable capture with this free roam
camera perspective can't wait for that
one of the most important elements we
are told would be figuring out the right
LOD or the level of detail so for
example if you're capturing the
resolution of 20 X of the native
resolution of the game or you monitor
how much detail is preserved for distant
assets objects and textures and that
again comes back to the developer and
how much they communicate with NVIDIA so
that you can have either unlimited
access or some sort of you know the
bracket of all this information now a
few concerns regarding this program lie
in multiplayer and in the games like the
vision for example right now that is
supported how do you avoid players from
cheating from entering this free camera
movement system looking behind corners
gaining a bird's-eye view to see
encounters ahead of you so it becomes
like a balancing act between figuring
out the system so that people don't
abuse the system beyond what its tended
to do you know people would want one
make some awesome images but how do you
avoid from people trying to abuse the
system to gain advantage and game
especially in multiplayer this would be
a really cool thing to see how they
tackle that issue but this idea of
having a photo studio for a pc game is
so awesome you know explore your
creative direction if you're not under
this
or visual person you could potentially
try this and see express your creativity
through in game engines without HUD
create all types of beautiful images
can't wait to try this of course I want
to make them make this clear this being
in a video product it is locked to
nvidia gtx GPUs can't wait to get my
hands on it and we'll be doing a full
video on it so make sure to subscribe
guys thank you so much for watching what
do you think about nvidia on so are you
excited let us know in the comments down
below I'm Dimitri with Harbor canucks
thanks much for watching we'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
