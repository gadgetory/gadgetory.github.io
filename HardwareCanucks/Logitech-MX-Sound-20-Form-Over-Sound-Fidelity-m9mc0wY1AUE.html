reviewed a desktop speaker system
probably a really long time in fact the
one that comes to my mind right now is
the one I'm currently using as my daily
driver and that is the creative
soundblaster katana if you're interested
to learn more about that you can check
it out right over here
but basically I haven't looked into
upgrading my existing audio setup here
in my studio ever since I switch to the
katana because it was everything that
I've wanted in a compact package I'll be
it it is an expensive set coming in at
around $300 but I'd still say that it's
worth every penny because it sounds
amazing and I love listening to music
every day on this speaker system anyways
today we're checking out a set of
Bluetooth speakers from Logitech that's
geared towards a completely different
demographic not gamers like what the Sun
Blaster katana was for but for people
who just are into you know cleaner and
minimalist setups but also not having to
sacrifice on sound quality meet the
Logitech MX sound priced at $100 this is
their latest addition to the premium
Bluetooth speakers but it's also clearly
meant to complement a typical desktop
setup as well so let's check this out
right after this it's time to try
something new with the K 900 M
mechanical keyboard by Zalman with Cale
brown switches on board macro recordings
and absolutely gorgeous
RGB illumination with the white frame
even your dog will go nuts check it out
in the description below
alright let's address the obvious the
design it certainly does not look like a
typical 2.0 desktop speaker system if
you ask me but Logitech has been
redesigning products to complement an
elegant setup we've seen that with the
MX master 2's Mouse the Kraft keyboard
and now this the MX sound and it looks
quite unique I really like what Logitech
has done here though the circular
chassis is made out of hard plastic
materials and it feels rock solid in the
hands the silver accent rings also adds
a nice touch to the aesthetics and the
graphite color matches the master 2's
and the Kraft keyboard really well so if
you're looking for a unified setup this
is an excellent accessory the drivers
are covered in the soft fabric material
which again adds to that aesthetics that
I talked about earlier but I'm worried
about maintaining that in the long run
it could easily pick up dust or just
grease threw handling so keep that in
mind now this is a Bluetooth speaker
system as well so it doesn't have to be
paired with a desktop for it to fully
function you can add this to your living
room setup maybe your kitchen if you
like to listen to tunes while cooking so
from a setup standpoint it's fairly
simple because all you have to do is
plug in the AC cord connect the left and
right speakers and pair the system to
the device of your choice
speaking of connectivity the ports are
located at the right channel speaker we
have auxilary in and PCN that both use
the standard 3.5 millimeter connector
and RCA port for the left channel
speaker power N and a 3.5 millimeter
audio output to daisy-chain your
headphones for example this is a 2.0
speaker system so don't expect a
dedicated subwoofer to enhance the lower
end frequencies but Logitech has
integrated port tubes at the back of
each speaker to enhance the lower range
just a little bit and I'll talk about
that shortly with a total 24 watt peak
output and a 12 watt RMS expect a
balanced sound signature plus given
these slider 10 degree tilt on each
speaker the listener can position each
unit to better suit their sound staging
controlling the MX sound is pretty
intuitive the actions use a touch
interface and they light up when your
hands cross a certain perimeter so they
are motion sensitive you only have three
options to work with volume up or down
and bluetooth pairing speaking of
Bluetooth the system uses the 4.1
standard so you can connect up to two
devices and take advantage of logitech's
easy switch feature this basically lets
the users switch between different audio
sources seamlessly without having to
fiddle around with controls once you've
paired the two devices just pause the
audio playback on one device and press
play on the other it just works and if
you have the MX sound connected to a
computer via the 3.5 millimeter cable
the switch feature still functions
here's a quick demo that is the sound
that will make Fred happy
oh yeah
we're like friends
I am Chandler and Joey and Pam is Rachel
and Dwight is Kramer Wow here they are
guys wondering if I could get your help
for something I am looking for a new job
hey what's up guys I'm qHD here and
welcome to i phone
launch weekend I'm sure your
subscription box is doing just fine
alright enough about features let's cut
to the chase and discuss the sound
quality and you know what I had to
double check Logitech's pricing for the
AMEX sound because for $99 this thing
literally blew my expectations for a 2.0
desktop speakers setup I love listening
to music especially ones that emphasize
on a lot of vocals and the MX sound
delivers great detail in the high ends
with good stereo separation as well the
integrated woofers handles the lower
ends all right I mean it doesn't have
that punch when compared to the sound
blaster katana but that comparison
doesn't make any sense because both
speakers are priced differently but
thankfully I didn't notice distortions
and higher volumes on the MX sound so
that's nice I'll be it I wish I had a
subwoofer to complement this setup but
it is what it is for a 2.0 desktop
speaker system most of my testing was
done both in wired and wireless mode and
I was barely able to notice an equality
difference so that was great the
Bluetooth range is also fantastic I was
easily able to move around between my
office and my living room downstairs
without experiencing signal cuts so
that's awesome now can you actually get
away with some gaming probably but if
you're hardcore into that you'll be
disappointed with the way how it treats
the lower ends but casual users can
definitely take advantage of the clarity
in the detail that the MX sound brings
to the table here's a quick sound test
say goodbye to cables it's time to enjoy
wireless audio with the corsair void RGB
gaming headset with the light and
comfortable frame low profile mic on
headset volume control and mic mute +
dual side illumination check out the
void RGB by corsair the perfect way to
hear your game so to conclude the MX
sound is a fantastic 2.0 desktop
Bluetooth speaker setup for your desk at
$100 it's designed really well I really
love the clean and minimalist approach
here the fabric material is nice but be
mindful that it can easily pick up
grease and I'm kind of worried about
maintaining that in the long run but
that's ok if you take care of it
properly the easy switch feature is by
far my favorite part about this guy
because I can easily switch between my
iPad my blackberry and my desktop
without having to manually go through
controls and switch that and I really
wish that the feature was available with
the MX or with the Sound Blaster katana
you can only ask for much now when it
comes to sound quality I was really
surprised at what Logitech was able to
offer in a 2.0 desktop speaker system
this thing sounds great especially if
you're into musics that emphasize a lot
on vocals and you know if you're really
looking for a good stereo separation the
MX sound does a fantastic job in that
department
now this isn't targeted towards gamers
out there because it doesn't come with a
subwoofer and you won't be able to
experience the sound engine that's built
inside games that take advantage of the
lower ends to give you that immersive
experience it's just not gonna be
present with vmx sound but if you're
someone who's currently rockin say a 20
or $30 desktop speakers set up and if
you're looking to upgrade to something a
little bit better pick the MX sound you
will definitely not regret it well that
concludes my review of the MX sound from
Logitech I'd love to hear your thoughts
on this Bluetooth desktop speaker system
but most importantly what setup are you
guys currently rocking is it way to
high-end let's say you spend like $500
plus on your desktop speaker system or
are you looking to upgrade and do would
you consider this as an upgrade from
your existing setup let me know in the
