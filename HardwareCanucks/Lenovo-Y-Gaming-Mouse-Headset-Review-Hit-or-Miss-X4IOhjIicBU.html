with Hardware Canucks and a couple of
months back we checked out the Lenovo Y
gaming keyboard and mouse Lenovo's first
gaming peripherals back then we found
them competent but quite expensive
compared to the competition
now Lenovo is back with their second
wave adding the why gaming stereo
headset and a new optical mouse the
question is though are they any good
the kraken x61 liquid cooler by NZXT
features variable pump speed to high
static pressure 140 moomer fans and
beautiful user control through the cam
software click below to get crackin
we'll look at the why gaming stereo
headset thirst lenovo has priced it at
$49.99 an appealing price point for many
gamers looking for an entry-level
headset especially when it features
large 50 millimeter drivers the
competition here is pretty sparse with a
lot of junk filling the market it's
facing up against quite a lot of no-name
brands and console focused headsets like
the total beach X 12s however there is
some competition with the Logitech G 430
but it's certainly still a price point
which lacks a wide range of options
doing a physical tour we've got this red
and black color scheme which is
consistent with the rest of Lenovo
branded peripherals lenovo is opted for
a carbon fiber texture on the ear cups
and the headband which i think looks
great the plastic headband retracts for
size adjustment and the ear cups can
swivel flat on the ear covers we have
this plush and breathable foam while
it's not as soft or as comfortable as
velour it's much more breathable than
pleather on the right is our flexible
boom mic as well as a red and black
cable which terminates in a 3.5
millimeter connection I like this choice
as it allows for use with smartphones
and they include a Y splitter to have
separate headphone and mic connections
build quality is pretty average here
there's no standard issues but the Y
gaming headphones feel pretty light and
plasticky although that does lead to a
flexible headset and a lightweight at
only 270 grams that weight paired with
the breathable ear pads make these
fairly good for long gaming sessions
they're not super comfortable like my k7
xx's but at the same point they're not
uncomfortable after long years like many
cheaper headsets
sound quality is where I expected to get
let down but actually I ended up being
kind of impressed make no mistake these
aren't going to blow your mind at 50
bucks but they're pretty good
they're pleasing to listen to while the
mid-range can get a little muddy the
sound is pretty balanced and bass is
present while not being totally
overpowering sound stage is good too and
positional audio is clear and precise
the semi-closed back nature of the
headphones worked well in game and
overall I was happy with the sound they
produced
unfortunately the microphone on this
headset is pretty atrocious
it sounds pretty tinny pretty nicely
there's a fair bit of background hiss
when running into the PC that honestly
overall I've just been pretty
unimpressed with this microphone and
it's definitely a big letdown on a
headset like this it is a pretty
inexpensive headset but considering most
people are going to be wanting to use
the microphone in game it's pretty
disappointing and honestly if you're
looking for a good mic we'll probably
look elsewhere
overall the why gaming stereo headset is
a solid offering as long as you have
realistic expectations for $50.00 it
looks and sounds good and while it
sacrifices on build quality this headset
still makes a solid option at the price
and now we move on to the why gaming
optical mouse priced at $39.99 it's an
appealing price point but also one with
strong competition this mouse is
competing against mice like the
SteelSeries rival 100 dream machines dm1
pro and the Logitech G 303 all of these
are very solid performers so the
competition is fierce this also isn't
lenovo as first mouse as we've
previously looked at the original why
gaming mouse that Mouse came in at the
high price of $69.99 making this the
more budget-friendly option in their
lineup even though it has an optical
sensor versus the laser in the original
why gaming mouse this creates an
interesting dynamic with the cheaper of
the two mice being superior on paper but
let's see if it checks out the shape
that lenovo was chosen for this mouse is
almost excellent but fall short due to a
few weird choices it's using a variation
of a fairly classic shape a simple
curved body with sides that move inwards
to allow your fingers to rest naturally
however the mouse is a little too large
for my hands and the middle of the mouse
is too high
I'm sure gamers with slightly larger
hands won't have a problem but the shape
may still be a little uncomfortable the
bigger issue with the mouse's shape is
that it flares out at the top it's
normal for Mouse to flare out at the
bottom as most people's hands are wider
at the palm however your hand narrows at
the finger tips so having a mouse that
widens there makes
feels strange and a little uncomfortable
and it pushes my little finger out too
far the mouse weighs in at 95 grams
making it fairly light considering its
larger form the lighter weight is
appreciated as it makes faster movements
in game easier and for FPS gaming a
lighter weight is generally beneficial
however the way that lenovo is cut down
on the weight unfortunately sacrifices
on build quality the mouse feels light
and cheap with a resoundingly plastic
build the gripping surface is smooth
which is OK and the side texture does
the job but nothing feels great you
certainly don't feel like you're getting
a premium Mouse and it doesn't feel
Turab all the scroll wheel is too high
and too easy to move I'm not a fan side
buttons exhibit good feedback and the
primary clicks are merely ok they're not
as satisfying as on on switches the Y
gaming mouse is using in a vulgar 3050
optical sensor which I would call good
enough for a casual gamer it's an
entry-level optical sensor which is a
step up from a laser sensor but I could
definitely feel the difference in game
between that and a better sensor likely
33 10 or 30 360 it doesn't have any
resounding issues it can handle fast
movements and doesn't have any obvious
prediction or acceleration problems but
I just found I wasn't that impressed
with it overall especially when you can
get better mice with better senses at
the price lenovo has some rudimentary
accompanying software for the mouse but
it needs some serious work you've got
button remapping with custom macro
support and polling rates up to a
thousand Hertz however the issue comes
with dpi adjustment as lenovo has an
extremely weird way of handling it
instead of simply setting one DPI lenovo
has a weird two-stage system you can
adjust the DPI in increments of 250 up
to 4,000 but there's also a sensitivity
slider I assumed the sensitivity slider
would control the windows sensitivity
but it actually acts as a secondary dpi
adjustment this means you can't dial in
the exact DPI as you can't know what
your true sensitivity is Lenovo needs to
rework this and only have one means of
dpi adjustment it's time to come to
conclusions now the Y gaming headset
offers pretty good value at $50 with
good looks and a surprisingly capable
sound with the sacrifices made for the
sake of price being both logical and
acceptable however the Y gaming optical
mouse doesn't make sense when there are
far superior
on the market for the same money and you
should probably look elsewhere for a
better gaming mouse so thank you for
