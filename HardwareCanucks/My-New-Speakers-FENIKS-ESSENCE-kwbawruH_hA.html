myself to be a headphone only type of
user is because my ears have been
graciously spoiled by the fantastics
Anheuser HD 800 they are my daily driver
for music editing and even gaming with a
mod mic attachment and I didn't think
that I'd be satisfied with any set of
speakers until now
what's up guys I'm Dimitri with
hurricane axe and these are acclaimed
world's best speakers the Fenix essence
designed and produced in Switzerland the
company is set out to create a harmonic
cohesion between speaker design and
audio properties so let's first start
with the design it's available in a
variety of color combinations and the
entire exterior is metal with a matte
front surface and glossy sides but the
speaker form is quite unique in my
opinion it is a fairly compact set while
also having fairly large four and a half
inch coaxial drivers Phoenix prides in
delivering such a modern body language
for this set while also being totally
desk and small space friendly the main
housing is elevated with a built in
platform to create enough area for the
base port to breathe which can also be
seen here and this design helps to
tremendously improve the base signature
this is an active speaker set with a
24-bit 96k Hertz USB and post link DAC
inside of it which means all the audio
processing happens inside the speaker to
guarantee best quality for the digital
pass through all the main inputs and
outputs are on the right speaker that
house you power a mini XLR plug for the
left channel with a two meter cable
which tells you that the speakers are
designed to be you know for smaller
spaces not too far away but nobody said
anything about jumping whoo anyway the
speaker is also equipped with an
auxilary input 3.5 millimeter subwoofer
and headphone jacks a synchronous USB
type B with a cable included then toast
link optical input without the cable and
finally we have two buttons to switch
between input and mode which are
color-coordinated beside the volume
wheel on the top the light is submerged
inside the body a little bit so it's
hiding from being distracting and only
visible when you intend
to look at it nice touch the volume
wheel has a precise amount of resistance
allowing really fine adjustment the tie
in this whole conversation about the
fantastic build quality under the hood
the essence speaker offers diverse usage
scenarios as analog and digital signals
work in parallel so if you're running an
analog signal it is not converted to
digital which is really cool for
playback with turntables and stuff to
give you your true analog playback you
can also have your headphones plugged in
and just leave them there and just
switch between the inputs via the button
in the back without needing to replug
all the things and it seems that all the
basics have been covered really well
that sets the stage for a pleasant
working experience with the speakers
Auto a set lacks a remote control or a
mute function so now let's set them up
and I'll try my best to explain the
sonic experience and to my surprise the
speakers don't have to be too far apart
to create fantastic stereo imaging
having them a little over one meter
apart is enough to create this audio
projection that is right in front of you
left and right channels beautifully
merge to create this cohesive delivery
from not just left and right but almost
like a center channel you can almost
visualize all the audio being right in
front of you and not just coming from
left and right sources and after that
despite the speaker's not being angled
towards you and firing into your
midsection almost the sound feels to be
elevated to be much higher thus
eliminating the need to elevate or angle
the speaker's to fire into your ears
although they should be facing you for
best projection so now let me give you a
sound sample so you can at least hear
the difference between sort of the
built-in speakers on the macbook versus
the speaker's themselves
now as for sound properties I know based
on that sound sample it's kind of
difficult to tell because it's being
recorded with a microphone but these
have fantastic clarity throughout the
entire range the way they handle volume
increase reminds me very much of how the
HD 800 headphones handle that extra
amplification so you get louder output
without any frequency distortions or
disruptions the base region is
wonderfully deep and controlled without
any spill into the mid-range it's not
booming in any way and the bass doesn't
overpower either it's there when you
need it to give power to the the sound
to give the body and fullness to the
sound but also scales out of the way
when unnecessary
we have a wonderful processing for
vocals acoustic genres come through with
such reality the high-end region is well
controlled without harshness but with
superb clarity so piano and classical
were fantastic experiences I also listen
to a good chunk of trance EDM and house
and the very precise base hits resonated
very well in my space that I feel would
be totally fine in an even smaller room
to create not only drool-worthy imaging
but fill the room with enough volume for
best clubbing experience but not in a
club and I really enjoyed the essence
more than the HD 800 s because both of
them have fantastic control to the
entire frequency range and they have
fantastic clarity both of them but the
essence speakers have a bit more body to
the sound although they are not
forgiving when you play some lower
quality files the distortions start to
occur and the harshness isn't there but
the lower frequency stuff especially
with bad files but that is to be
expected and I've been so impressed by
the sound output that I haven't been
able to discover any flaws because the
sound signature especially coming from
my experience with the HD 800 is exactly
where I like it with the Phoenix essence
but one of the little rubber pads at the
bottom fell off and I lost it somewhere
and this slightly throws off the balance
of one of the speakers and
it's a little bit unfortunate because
they are adhesive and you know if you
don't find the right size for it then
the speaker might be a little bit
off-balance
but I think Phoenix are definitely onto
something here with this focus on
compact active powerful and clean
speakers that would live on a standard
desk to deliver an absolutely fantastic
listening experience and if you found
this design and like what you heard in
this review definitely check them out
