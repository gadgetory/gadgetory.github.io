brought to you by and say x-com
technology connected alright moving on
to audio here at Zaman booth at CES 2014
they are coming into the living room
with this sound bar system so it's it's
a very slim system probably be attached
either I guess yeah underneath your TV
it also comes with a subwoofer here the
sound bar in total is a hundred watt
system so it has 225 watt stereo
speakers in the sound bar itself and
this is a 50 watt sub so that's you know
we would provide you with a lot of power
in your sort of like home home
environment it impressive features about
this thing
aside from very nice aluminum
construction is very slim design I do
like this it has bluetooth enabled so
you can come home from your work you can
simply pair this up with a sound bar and
you can listen to your tunes that way
instead of just listening to your music
sort of in your conventional methods
this has NFC enabled which means you can
if you have an NFC enabled mobile phone
you can simply start up by simply
tapping the the center of the sound bar
and it will be automatically connected
so you're ready to go and you can start
listening to your tunes so a cool little
product here from Zaman the sound bar I
believe would be competition-wise the
Samsung and other companies produce
similar products but they do cost around
you know just under $1000 where we're
given around the $200 price tag for this
one so very excited to see what type of
sound quality we can get from this but
moving off to another one is this
bluetooth headphone so let's go around
here so we have both the black and a
white version so they're they're a
little very kind of low-profile nothing
flashy very simple design very elegant
so on the right side we have play pause
we can switch tracks we have audio sorry
volume rocker and there's also the LED
that flashes when pairing so a little
police car right on your on your side of
the year there's nothing on this side
there of course adjustable for the type
of size of your head and this sort of
one piece headband design I do like this
I have tried them on and they are very
comfortable actually so as you can see
they're very
profile and if I put them on they do
feel comfortable there there's not too
much sort of pressure on your ear so for
in-flight and sort of your for your
travel purposes this Bluetooth headset
will be very attractive and then listen
to it a little bit and they sound very
nice in the mint and the high-end the
bass is very kind of muddy and so but
you know what this is sort of expected
because this is a $69 product from Ana's
bluetooth so you're not really expected
the amazing sound quality but for again
portable purposes this is awesome one
more thing to mention guys so at the
bottom here this is a micro USB port for
charging and as you can see there's that
little microphone there so you can pick
up a call while wearing the headphone
all right Zaman is also known for making
cases and this is one of their newest
releases this is the Z 15 and it does
incorporate a few unique features that
we are gonna take a look in in a moment
so one of the first things that we of
course notice on the top here is this
sort of control system so we have three
fan control knobs controlling your front
rear and top fan speeds and we have
obviously USB 2 and USB 3 ports a
headphone jack recent power button but
very unique feature as you can see here
this is your temperature knob so there's
an actual sensor that is included with
the case that isn't actually installed
right now inside and we'll show you the
temperature of that note so you can sort
of monitor the temperature but this sort
of sensor is very useful because they
have this auto ventilation system
enabled and right now here it's set on
auto there's a little switch here that
you can switch to manual and what we'll
do is we'll open up two vents the top so
it will allow this air to escape so very
aggressive design from Zalman and you
also can while it's in manual mode you
can close it or you can open it but
while it's an auto if the internal
temperatures range 35 degrees this
actually will open up automatically so
you can set it up to 35 or 45 degrees to
open up to allow more air to to escape
so coming in through to sort of on to
the inside this is an ATX design so sort
of a very standard models we have in
your hard drive cages that are removable
fan fan fan mounts in the front ATX
board and now the fan the back dual dust
roasted at the bottom for your power
supply and optional fan mounts if you do
wants to remove the entire hard drive
cages to install some water cooling also
another thing that we want to mention
about the front is this fact so you can
push on this lever here and it will open
up a little bit extra clearance here for
that front fan so again giving us that
aggressive design unfortunately well
there is no dust filter but it is sort
of a mesh so it will prevent from sort
of dust buildup in a way but here this
is the z15 from Zalman very unique I do
like this innovative control feature and
auto ventilation system perhaps not as
not as in needed in the sense that you
know you could have a potentially open
design but with these guys closed it is
a more silent system so that's exactly
if you're going for that we have both
silent and air airflow options here with
a z15 okay guys so now we're gonna take
a look at some pretty cool little
options from Zalman that we haven't
really seen on the market and that's an
OD D enclosure now one of the really
cool things about this is that you can
load up your image files and select
which image you would like to put on to
your system and it would automatically
detect as if it was an actual physical
CD so you can have multiple different
images whether it's an OS movies and and
basically any type of software that you
want to install on the system you can
use this now the one right next to it is
the ve 400 which actually has an
encryption system in it which is why you
can see the number pad but you can
select which image you want to burn or
install using the directional buttons
over here now if we go a little bit to
the left we're going to take a look at
another really innovative product which
is the smart antenna for the iPhone 5 or
5s and the Samsung Galaxy s4 in order
for this to work it has to make direct
contact to the back of the phone but it
can improve signal performance by 30% as
well as reducing or increasing your
battery life because it doesn't actually
have to seek as hard for your signal so
this is a great little option and
actually does have some health impacts
haven't actually been verified yet but
I'm sure that it does have a reduces
radiation because the signal is there
the system or a year antenna is not
seeking or searching as hard for a
signal so the way that you actually
apply this antenna boosters by sticking
it onto the back of a case as they have
done here so it doesn't actually have to
stick on to your phone itself you can
remove the case if you want to buy
multiple of these so you could actually
have them in your different colors of
cases but it still improves performance
by making it like I said earlier direct
contact with the device that you're
using so next we have the wireless HDD
and power bank now there are other
Wireless HDD systems on the market this
isn't new but one of the competitive
advantages that Zalman has right now is
the fact that they have included a power
bank into the device so you can actually
have your data and images and files
shared amongst all your friends
wirelessly and you can also charge your
phone using the included power bank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
