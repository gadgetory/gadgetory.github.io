great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with Hard
Rock Canucks and I think we can all
agree that NZXT cases are highly
competitive that provide a wide spectrum
of offerings and one thing they've
managed to do well is spot-on pricing so
today we're taking a look at the latest
phantom edition this is the P 240 with
an attractive price of $69 and as I said
in the past NZXT loves their angular
design and you can spot and
differentiate their chassis from a mile
away but they're adding a bit of curves
in the mix and the p 240 feels more
ergonomic with a hint of the classical
phantom aesthetic with that angular
window now let's do our usual exterior
tour so the front and top shells are
plastic but I love that curvature that
gives this case character and that star
trooper feel they've also done a great
job with the actual white tones that are
almost identical between the plastic and
the steel side panels the front door
opens with this press to release hinge
that was actually quite loose on our
sample the door swivels just at 90
degrees that is limiting so just be
careful with that I'm behind in which we
get three optical base and behind the
front panel we get one fan included but
you can add the second intake fan for
improved thermals auto drive cage wall
is fairly restrictive plus the cutout on
the front panel isn't as open so expect
the top fan to be less effective and I
wish the front panel mesh was higher to
allow less resistive intake coming to
the top we have dual 120 and 140 mm
amounts and given how tall the top cover
is installing either defense or the
radius above the frame is an option
although there's no dedicated dust
filter here but instead a somewhat fine
mesh that will catch settling dust here
we also find two USB 3 ports audio jacks
PR buttons and the hard drive activity
LED at the rear we get an exhaust fan 7
PCI slots the P 240 stands on tall case
feet and while I really dislike these
type of dust filters at least they do
cover both the power supply intake and
the optional bottom fan slot that you
can still populate even with 100
power supply units so now let's get
inside and one thing to point out is the
angular side window and how revealing it
is I actually like this approach showing
off your storage compartment plus a
little bit of your power supply although
I wish the window was tinted inside we
find a totally white frame with a
removable top drive cage there are no
fan mounts on the internal wall however
instead holes to secure the drive
caddies so two thumb screws at the back
hold the top cage and the drives are
accessed exclusively from the rear as
well each cage gives us three slots and
one thing I was really disappointed to
see are these brackets they are back no
these are probably divorced drive
caddies ever so the amount of flex these
exhibit on all the joints is just
unbearable
they snap easily and don't securely sit
inside the case also once installed the
SSDs are further back so routing your
SATA cables may be challenging without
the top drive cage we get full clearance
and additional airflow for your graphics
but even with the cage in place we still
get 11 point 4 inches of clearance
coming around to the back we have an
abundance of cable type points and while
not a wide gap to work with and a pretty
small sleeve at the bottom for some
small cables the Phantom 240 was
actually surprisingly easy to work in
and once fully assembled it's actually
quite impressive at how well it cleans
up thanks to all the properly placed
cutouts around the motherboard just wish
we had rubber grommets to seal the deal
we still get plenty of clearance up top
as well so push and pull configurations
are not totally out of line thanks to
the tall top cover and as you can see
with a few zip ties and some quick
routing all the cables are flush to the
case so closing the panel doesn't
require you to stand on it now the
Phantom 240 feels like a finely polished
and ready $70 enclosure with all the
needed cooling potential top radiator
friendly module drive cage for a little
bit of flexibility and impressively
solid build quality without flexing
frame of course I would like to see
rubber grommets proper dust filters for
the bottom and please get rid of the
flimsy drive caddies but my major
complaint here would be the
oversight of front panel design that
almost completely covers the second fan
slot and I would love to see a front
panel open up with a bigger mesh but
other than that this is one damn good
value contender and NZXT has done it
again with a phantom line that you
should seriously consider if $70 is your
budget point of course if you are
willing to be flexible make sure to
check out the following options that
offer better value for just a little
more although if $69 is the spot check
out the and 400 from Coolermaster or the
200 are from Corsair as we realize this
phantom design may not tickle your fancy
but let us know how you feel about the P
240 and aside from the white and what
other colors you'd like to see as always
leave your comments down below thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
