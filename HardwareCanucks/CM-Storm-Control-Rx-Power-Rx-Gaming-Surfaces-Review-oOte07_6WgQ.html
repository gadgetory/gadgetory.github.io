looking at to gaming surfaces from
coolermaster these are part of their CM
storm series Dugger it specifically for
gamers now when it comes to gaming mats
some of the most important elements to
look for include tracking size and the
material and really whether you prefer a
hard PVC mat or a soft one is really up
to you now each mat is priced around $30
which is reasonable so let's first take
a look at the power rx and the first
thing you notice is the carrying case
it's a really nice addition for mobile
gamers but the mat might be a little bit
too large for compact spaces as it would
be considered to be extra large now for
big desks however this is sort of the
ideal size for large movements at lower
dpi sensitivity and the math is very
flexible and despite its large size it
remains completely flat without any
bumps and the power Rx is also very thin
besides that 2.5 millimeters which I
think will complement any gaming or
workstation and the bottom is completely
covered in the rubberized surface to
prevent the mat from sliding and it does
a really great job at keeping the mat
stable no one comes down to tracking I
personally prefer this type of surface
and because it's so thin it does not
depreciate the pressure so like some
other thicker mats and provides very
comfortable experience for Mouse
movement the rounded edges also get rid
of any irritation that might be caused
for long use and there were no visible
signs of wear after a few weeks of use
which is very refreshing for a mousepad
of this caliber now let's check out the
control rx mousepad which is
significantly thicker and isn't really
made to be mobile it does carry the same
exact dimensions as the power rx which
would be perfect for large spaces with
combination of low dpi sensitivity now
despite its 5 millimeter thickness
there's almost no depression and the
surface is a tab smoother with a lot to
find there
which slightly improves the gliding
speed this is where the mat gets the
name of control is you're able to
perform finer navigation for precise
aiming and the bottom of the mat is also
covered in a non-slip surface and it's
almost adhesive and your mat is not
going anywhere
also the edges are well rounded which
would mean less reps down the road but
also gets rid of that hard edge that
could irritate your arm so overall a
very comfortable mousepad to use on a
daily basis and of course after some
testing with gaming and editing both the
control and power are ex-service
excellent choices if you are in the
market for a new gaming surface both are
well-made and provide great tracking
comfort for your hand and a non-slip
surface the size may not be for everyone
and it would be nice to get some smaller
options but overall the controller X and
the power Rx are damn good products so
thanks guys for watching and we'll see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
