Rock Canucks and Corsair is really
pushing hard within the enclosure market
as they try to cover all angles from
price to aesthetics and in coarser
fashion without disturbing the internals
that are almost always extremely easy to
work in the latest addition to the
graphite series is the 760 T and there
are actually multiple revisions so the
arctic white is what we have here is
just shy of $200
the fully black version of 760 is $10
less while the 730 t that doesn't
incorporate the transparent acrylic
window is an additional $40 shaved now
of course the main selling feature is
the full sized tinted and transparent
side window that lets you admire all
your cable work and screams for proper
lighting installation and all the sexy
hardware inside the rear panel is piano
gloss I was surprised it's not a
fingerprint magnet but of course dust
particles will be visible this panel is
not transparent as you can see which
makes sense to hide all the cable mess
in the back the 760 is a full tower it's
actually quite large with a fairly wide
body and stands tall on these
cool-looking case feet that fit in with
the design and starting with the front
we get a removable dust filter with two
ones 40 millimeter blue LED fans with
mounting holes for one twenty number
fans as well and I love the resistance
free front intake for direct airflow
delivery there are three optical slots
with a hidden Bay cover included that
you can replace on your optical drive so
that's very considered from Corsair for
connections up top we have four USB
ports two of which are USB 3 Auto jacks
PR buttons in the two speed controller
for the front fans which is not going to
be included on the 730 T coming to the
top a very surprised Corsair decided to
go this route so we have this magnetic
cover that completely blocks the area it
would be useful for perhaps isolating
some of the noise and making sure the
case looks clean but given we have
triple fan support up top that's most
likely to be utilized the top of the
case is left to collect the dust a dust
filter like we saw on the 450d would
have
more appropriate or perhaps extra
spacing between the cover and the frame
to allow some exhaust to get through at
the back we get plenty of ventilation
another 140 millimeter exhaust fan nine
PCI brackets oh hello AE ATX support and
the removable power supply dust filter
now let's talk a little more about the
new acrylic side panels for one I'm very
happy that finger marks are almost
invisible but they are extremely
flexible now it shouldn't cause any
concern over build quality but does take
away from enormous $200 price tag so I
would have preferred more stiff panels
the handle releases the hold on the door
it's what was in the right direction so
you have easy access to the internals
the panels are also removable requires
only about 40 degree swivel to lift the
panel off the latches so that's very
consider it again for tighter spaces and
finally let's get inside and take a look
at the internals of the 760 at first
glance it doesn't look that much
different from the Obsidian 750d and in
fact the internal layout is identical
with the 760 t having a slighter higher
bottom frame so we get the two Drive
cages very spacious interior and this
certainly feels like a coarser case the
default drive cage position allows
direct front airflow without any
resistance there's also plenty of room
for your power supply so that's not a
problem plus appropriate carrots at the
rear for all the cable routing it does
holder block the 2 PCI brackets but
these cages are made to be modular so
the cage is screwed onto the base but
because the slightly higher frame at the
bottom it doesn't allow direct access to
those screws so you have to remove the
entire base from the bottom it's slight
oversight it's not a big deal especially
since the base will have to be removed
anyway
if you plan to relocate the drive cage
this would open up a spot for an
additional intake fan to help with
cooling although there's no dust filter
here and you can slide the drive cage on
top of the other or relocate it
underneath the Optical bay and still
have over 13 inches for GPU clearance
the front cage is also removable that
would open up clearance for a beefy 240
or a 280 million radiator in push-pull
at the front as over 5 inches is
available
between the panel and the second drive
gauge you probably notice these brackets
at the rear for assault state drives and
these are completely tools for mounting
and populating simply insert the SSD in
and these are designed to show off your
drives with the cutout facing internals
for thinner units like this five
millimeter Seagate SSD the brackets have
mounting holes so the drive doesn't
wobble and once in place you can further
secure the bracket the case with an
additional screw knowing coarser cable
management is definitely something of
their speciality with a full inch of
clearance in the back we have many cable
timeouts spread around with quality
rubber grommets and all black cables and
starting with the build the seven sixty
t comes with pre-installed motherboard
standoffs which is a nice addition for
that smooth assembly and they also
notice the motherboard tray does exhibit
a lot of flex while this shouldn't cause
any concern over the case falling apart
or something I'll be nicely thicken the
steel for a more rigid build quality and
taking a look at the system it looks
superb with clean cable work and just so
much room to work with so any
enthusiasts would be pleased larger
motherboards are of course taken into
account with this full hour with EA TX
and XL ATX compatibility although they
might cover those rubber grommets on the
side completely a couple of things I
really like is the offset cutouts and
from the power supply allowing you to
properly separate exiting cables and the
SSD brackets that really do show off
your speedy drives obviously triple fan
support up top is an excellent incentive
for water cooling especially since we
have just under four inches of clearance
till the memory modules but again it's
very disappointing that the top panel
completely chokes the area and no dust
filter is included now causing the side
panel you can tell that coursers focused
with this enclosure was to allow users
to fully appreciate all the hardware
adding a few LED strips in there and the
760 T is for sure to stand out if you
are after that futuristic yet clean
frame it was also a very quick
five-minute routing job if even and this
is one of the aspects of coarser cases
that I have
she ate and we strongly recommend for
any novice builder if you're looking for
hassle-free assembly
now the 760 is mainly a frame upgrade
with the addition of that beautiful
full-sized acrylic window we also have
the module drive cage non-restrictive
front intake for excellent airflow with
a variety of water cooling options
convenient SSD brackets that there are
the way and the interior that's an
absolute breeze and joy to work with my
major complaint with the 760 T would be
the top cover it just doesn't make sense
that the dust filter is not included
especially it almost $200 considering
the 750 d that utilizes the exact same
frame design has a dust filter and even
their latest 450 d that's almost half
the price includes a top dust filter so
the 760 misses in the word for this
exact reason but what do you guys think
of this latest graphite addition is the
extra premium worth the acrylic side
