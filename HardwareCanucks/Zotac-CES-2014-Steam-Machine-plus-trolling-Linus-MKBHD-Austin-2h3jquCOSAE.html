brought to you by and say XCOM
technology connect CES 2014 is seeming
to become exposing a lot to what steam
machine is going to be available what
type of specifications whatever form
factor and we've seen a lot of sort of
very compact and small form factor
computing that are going to be dedicated
where the steamos labeled a machine
zotac is of course branching out into
the gaming world the zotac has been
making their small small form-factor
computers like that for a while now and
what we have here this is their steam
machine they're going to be announced
now that we can't comment about
specifications but what we can tell you
is the fact that obviously this won't
practice where you're familiar we get
this orange ring there it's going to
have passive cooling but specifications
wise if we turn around on to this side
and this is their zotac gaming machine
so they're actually moving away from the
consumer level and we got some troll
over here somewhere where is he oh I
can't see yes this does everybody want
to get into you if you turn around we
get actually we have they're all hiding
well there is a PhD but anyway the
specification for the steam machine are
going to be higher than what is behind
me this is pushing 4k content in a very
compact package actually thought about
this this could be a very good rendering
solution for you know if you're doing
something coverage like this if you're
working from the laptop and having
something like that so this is a
five-hundred-dollar price point it's
running 765m junior bytes of the vram
graphics card is running an i5 and this
got I believe 4 gigabytes of memory so
it has a very compact a very powerful
package in this small form factor
running 4k 4k gaming it's were loaded
with windows 8 so steam machine what's
coming around here steam machine is
going to be that it's going to be more
powerful than what we just saw is going
to be able to push that 4k content and
it's going to be running steam OS so
zotac is definitely running jumping on
this steam machine bandwagon like
everybody else we've seen here at CES
anything that the important features to
mention is the fact that all the steam
machine
the the selling point would be of course
the price the specification is going to
be very similar especially with iris
coming out and it's going to be the form
factor like how do you want do you want
like an orange circle do you want
something green from alienware that that
perform factor is going to be the
determining factor whether or not you
choose a certain steam machine that's my
personal opinion but what do you guys
think grease what do you think would be
the number one selling point and the
significant choosing factor when you
decide to go with a steam machine so
guys this has been our coverage here at
zotac booth at CES 2014 don't forget to
subscribe to see the rest of our awesome
content and coverage from Las Vegas and
we'll see you in a next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
