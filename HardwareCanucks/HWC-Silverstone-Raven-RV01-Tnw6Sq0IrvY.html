Canucks product showcase in this episode
we're gonna be taking a look at a case
by silverstone the raven RV oh one the
case features a unique design fashioned
after the notorious stealth jets and
it's this that really sets it apart from
the other block style cases on the
market the part of the Wow is what is
claimed to be a revolutionary new design
in chassis cooling completely flipping
around the traditional idea behind air
flow design like many of the Silverstone
cases there is a rather large price tag
attached where the case promises to be
worth every penny the raven certainly
suits its description as a full tower
which is 11 inches wide 24 inches tall
and over 26 inches long weighing in at a
hefty 33 pounds
in a new approach to front panel doors
the drive bays are hidden behind the
sliding door which locks in position at
the bottom and can easily be returned to
the top
in keeping with the style of the case
the external front ports are also hidden
by a clippable cover the ports are
simple with only firewire audio and USB
top also hosts the power and reset
buttons on the windowed model the
outside panel is a window centered over
the motherboard tray and on the bottom
styled vents to allow air into the power
supply chamber the backside is a mirror
of the front without the window on the
basic Edition the front and back panels
are both the simple black the raven is a
bottom mounted power supply chassis and
has an easy to remove and underneath the
power supply area part of the unique
design of the raven is a 90-degree
rotation of the motherboard this
transforms your typical back panel into
more of a top panel at the back of the
top is a locked and vented cover which
allows access to the side panel release
and the peripheral connectors the side
panel removes easily and we're greeted
by a nearly pure black interior that
looks like nothing you've seen before
the side panels are by no means flimsy
and lack scented with plastic bits the
solid construction is sure to keep the
interior noise well dampened the vents
at the bottom are well shored up with a
dense metal mesh allowing only the
finest of dust particles to sneak
through as we meander on to the interior
the bottom of the case is home to the
power supply providing ample room for
any sized unit while still being able to
stow cables there is also a second dust
filter near the front of the case which
can easily be removed for cleaning at
the top of the chamber that separates
the power supply and the other
components are 280 millimeter fans these
are crucial to the Ravens airflow and
positive pressure design these fans been
in a quiet 700 rpm producing only 18
decibels there are six hard drive bays
featuring easy load rack system and five
ROM bays sporting a tool list design
across the motherboard area we see this
strange metal bar held down by two thumb
screws which begs the question what is
it and how does it work the motherboard
tray is definitely one of the more
confusing aspects of this already
perplexing case it supports any TX ATX
EA TX SS CB and SS EDD all of which have
been rotated to accommodate the new
design and if you don't know what the
last two form factors are and don't
worry you're not alone you will also
notice that on the motherboard tray
there are four holes near the top and
the bottom of where the motherboard
would sit this is for cables running up
the back of the tray and out to the
front there are also four clamp type
things which are used to keep the cables
tidy in the back as a part of the Ravens
revolutionary new cooling silverstone
has brought science and a little bit of
common sense to the airflow designer
following the basic law of
thermodynamics they flip the motherboard
on a 90 degree angle so that fresh air
from the two massive bottom fans will
pass up over the components and exit up
the top harnessing the natural
occurrence of heat rising theoretically
with the board rotated at this angle the
cool air passes over the warmest parts
of the system equally whereas with the
traditional orientation there would be
air passing over the video card and then
or the CPU in theory this design should
be incredibly efficient as much of the
Ravens attraction is attributed to the
airflow and cooling wiring as a critical
aspect of the case silverstone has
really done a great job in covering all
the angles when it comes to cleaning up
the clutter the bottom has more than
enough room to fit a rat's nest of
cables and with the motherboard flip
most of the connectors such as the 24
pin ATX sit close enough to the bottom
of the tray that they remain relatively
inconspicuous most of the other
connections can be run up the back and
out through spaces here at the top on
the back the cable clips help to keep
wires organized and there's a good
amount of space when putting the side
panel
to allow for fairly thick wire clusters
installation of the wrong drives is a
completely tool-less and surprisingly
sturdy operation merely inserting the
drive and clicking the lock into place
the hard drive bay uses a simple rack
style adapter for fitting the hard
drives in securely this allows for
better airflow from the fan underneath
and also allows users to utilize the
Silverstone hot swappable adapter the
case comes standard with a single
adapter in the first Bay but others can
be purchased separately and added in for
the other drives the drive slide and
easy and can be removed just as quickly
and so after everything is installed we
finally see the purpose of the bar
across the front of the motherboard tray
the tabs at the end are intended to
secure some of the rather hefty video
cards found in today's system and
prevent them for the negative effects of
gravity the tabs have soft rubber feet
so they won't damage the components and
lock into place and keep things snug
lastly we look at the water cooling
capabilities of the Raven and taking the
rather jagged piece of plastic off the
rear there's a surprisingly flat area of
metal on which to comfortably attach up
to a triple radiator and as is becoming
the standard with most cases there are
two two poles to easily accommodate 1/2
inch tubing Silverstone includes custom
mounting brackets so as to pull the
radiator away from the back of the case
and encourage healthy air flow and as we
put it all back together a final
question is answered with all the
peripheral connectors hooked up the vent
cover for the top panel fits on just
fine even with the thicker DVI cable
there was no trickery or extreme bends
necessary while they may not have read
in read into the wheel silverstone has
made some tremendous advancements in the
world of cases and cooling the design of
the raven is definitely a love it or
hate it style but there is no denying
that the features and planning that have
been packed into this chassis set a new
precedent for other enclosures our full
written review at triple W Carver
canucks com takes an in-depth look at
some of the features of the raven
including the performance of the
redesigned cooling thanks for watching
