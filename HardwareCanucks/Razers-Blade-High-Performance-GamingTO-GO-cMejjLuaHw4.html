powerful portable platforms for both
work and play offering the ability to
play every turn game at high settings
without sacrificing size it's targeted
towards people who are willing to spend
more than 1,800 dollars on a gaming
laptop and he played half these necks to
back it up what you might ask well unit
we have here has a core i7 quad core 8
threaded processor 16 gigabytes of ddr4
Ram a 256 gigabyte and vme SSD a 14 inch
1080p display and a fully fledged GTX
1060 inside a beautifully crafted CNC
aluminum chassis that's just a point
seven inches thick there are also
options for more storage capacity and a
4k screen but as you can imagine both of
those choices will bump up the blades
cost significantly you might look at the
competition and start arguing that there
are less expensive alternatives with
better specs outperform the blade so why
would someone think of this machine as
an option well before I move on we need
to roll an ad so let's do that and come
back to answer that question
introducing the new o2 zvx 500 all state
drives from Toshiba it offers great
well-balanced speeds build with mlc nand
flash for superior endurance and is also
backed by five year advanced warranty
program learn more about the VX 500 at
OTG com
the blade is a remarkable work of art
and manufacturing position that really
highlights the hours of research that
were put into creating it I just can't
stop looking at this thing it looks like
a blacked out 13-inch MacBook Pro from
the outside no really I'm not kidding it
could just be me but hey that's a
compliment I will admit that the
exterior attracts a lot of finger prints
but I love the LED backlit logo on the
outside and the 14 inch matte 1080p
display is just perfect for the size
what really got me interested in the
blade was how thin and light it really
is just look at it in comparison to a
typical Asus gaming notebook at about 4
pounds and 3/4 inches thick I'm
constantly amazed with how much
technology waser was able to cram into
such a compact form factor the lighting
on the keyboard is quite amazing to
raise it causes the
I'm a keyboard you can customize it with
16.8 million colors and the lighting
effects on it just look amazing people
have actually worked on developing
custom SDKs to take advantage of the
lighting for example there's an audio
visualizer program that reacts with your
music on the keyboard and the level of
customizability on that is endless I
loved writing scripts and emails on the
keyboard too and I've done a lot of them
since this was my workhorse during CES
2017 the keys are well spaced out and
they exhibit just the right amount of
travel distance given their excellent
tactile feedback you just can't ask for
more
actually there is an issue I desperately
need laser to address in their next
revision if you pay close attention to
their backlighting you'll notice that
these special characters and secondary
functions aren't illuminated which is a
problem if you're someone like me that
uses them often eventually I had to
memorize the function keys but still
it's really unusual to find such a flaw
on an expensive gaming notebook the
track that is one of the best I've ever
tried on a windows-based laptop these
surfaces really smooth for your fingers
to navigate around and I never
experienced skips or stutters throughout
my usage the primary left and right
buttons are responsive and tactile but I
would have liked for them to have them
integrated within the trackpad what do
you guys think do you prefer integrated
or physical trackpad leave a comment
down below let's talk about pricing for
the Razer Blade notebook the model I
have here costs eighteen hundred dollars
and that comes with an i7 6700 h-cubed
quad core processor clocked at 2.6
gigahertz sixteen gigabytes of RAM a 256
gigabyte nvme SSD and a 1080p IPS matte
display you can configure this notebook
with up to one terabytes of storage
capacity and a qhd+ display with a
resolution of 3200 by 1800 that will run
you just under three thousand dollars
which is a steep price to pay for a
gaming notebook unfortunately the ramp
isn't upgradeable but the SSD can be
swapped out for a much faster drive
which is what I would recommend since
that would save you some cash also the
blade only supports a single nvme drive
so if you're thinking about loading your
entire game library onto this notebook
you might have to upgrade your storage
game
also note that Razer will be updating
their blades with Intel's latest Kubelik
processors
performance doesn't increase by that
much but battery life is supposed to
improve by up to 25 percent after the
display you might ask is in the qhd+
Excel panel a lot better than the 1080p
IPS screen technically yes but you see
the GTX 1060 is the hallmark for 1080p
gaming pushing that resolution even
higher would result in lower frame rates
and unfortunately Razer has neglect
their panels with Nvidia g-sync
technology plus the high resolution
display with theoretically result in
shorter battery life now if you
desperately need better performance say
at 1440p or even 4k the Thunderbolt 3
type C port on the white side of the
notebook has a little trick up its
sleeve if you would like to spend an
extra $500 on an external GP docking
solution called the laser core it would
extend the graphics performance of the
blade by about 80 to 95 percent
depending on the GPU of choice which by
the way isn't included with the package
ideally you'd be looking at a gtx 1070
or 1080 as an upgrade but I'm warning
you it's going to cost you somewhere
between 800 to $1500 on top of the cost
for the blade notebook while the type C
port can send and receive data through
compatible devices it does not accept
power so for example if the blade is
running low on battery I can't use my
power bank to charge it up oddly enough
from doing a little bit of research I
found out that the core is the only
device that can send power and data to
the notebook isn't that weird
I'm sure Razer can fix this with a
driver update but it's not acceptable as
a right now because competing notebooks
from the likes of Dell Apple and many
others support this feature taking a
look at the i/o you'll find a power jack
2 USB 3.0 ports and a headphone / mac
input on the left side switching to the
right there's a Kensington lock HDMI 1.4
port and extra USB 3.0 port and the type
C port we talked about earlier the lack
of an SD card reader is frustrating
especially since I'm a Content waiter
but third party adapters are inexpensive
so I'm slowly getting used to it it is
an extra thing to carry around and if I
lose it during travel especially for
events like CES and Computex I might be
in trouble
speaking of events most of our CES 2017
coverage was edited and rendered on the
razorblade notebook
laptop performed extremely well cutting
my c100 footage and adding an adjustment
layer with llama tree did not choke the
machine do note that I was working with
1080p files and the GTX 960 with its
Buddhist support for Premiere Pro did
fantastic chopping 4k files from
Dimitri's Panasonic g7 resulted in
slight performance hits but turning the
playback resolution down to a half solve
the issue
now just for benchmarking purposes I
compared the blades render times to the
recently tested and massive ACS G 750 to
be OC gaming notebook and here are the
results what you're seeing here
shouldn't be a surprise because Premiere
Pro export times solely rely on the CPU
and partially the GPU in this case the
6820 HQ on the ACS notebook is 100
megahertz faster than the 6700 HQ on the
blade but the difference between the two
is quite interesting stressing it even
higher I exported a five-minute 4k video
on both laptops and interestingly enough
the blade outperformed the g7 52 by
about three minutes which might raise a
lot of questions but I think I have the
answer to those UC Premiere Pro was
utilizing the blade CPU by about 80 to
90 percent whereas on the ROG notebook
it was only consuming 60 to 70 percent
this could be due to software
prioritization or a potential hardware
bottleneck somewhere within the Asus
notebook and I tried running these tests
multiple times which yielded me the same
results battery life was surprisingly
good on the blade even with a fully
fledged gtx 1060 inside i was easily
able to get 5 to 6 hours of use
performing light tasks under heavy use
expect about 3 to 4 hours now onto some
gaming tests starting with battlefield 1
at 1080p set to high settings the 1070
almost doubles this performance compared
to the 1060 on the blade battlefield 1
is a demanding title on both GPUs and
I'm happy how the 1060 capped well over
60 frames per second when we onto all
watch a slightly less demanding title
the 1060 and the 1070 are almost neck to
neck averaging over 100 frames per
second this is likely a result of the
processor becoming a bottleneck on the
more powerful gtx 1070 our last test is
doom at 1080p set to high settings and
once again the 1060 does not disappoint
and as I mentioned earlier this card is
a great option for
viii gaming that being said the gtx 1070
on the asus notebook held up pretty
strong during my tests and i wouldn't
have stayed talking up a qhd+ monitor to
it temperatures on both pascal cards
surprised me as you can see the 1060 ran
just a degree hotter than the GTX 970
and you have to keep in mind the asus
notebook supposed a much beefier
heatsink than the blade that being said
Razer has done a fantastic job cooling
the 1060 that's housed inside a super
thin chassis CTO temperatures were
respectable I was rendering a 4k video
while evaluating the temperatures and
just as expected the Asus double
performed better than the blade and that
should be obvious given how much space
the larger notebook has for its cooling
assembly but if you take a closer look
at the idle temps the blade does a much
better job cooling the 6700 HQ processor
and there's a reason for that
during our all depends inside the
notebook we're a lot louder than
expected which was a problem especially
when recording voiceovers
Razer has a quiet mode integrated
through these lab software but that
didn't do the trick either let's take a
listen
so what can I say about the laser blade
it's beautiful
selfie appearance is exactly what many
people are looking for in their
notebooks these days it's a combination
of portability alongside great
performance is high on your list of
priorities then this should be near the
top of your list we build quality stool
my attention from day one but be careful
it's a fingerprint magnet the 1080p
display is just perfect for the size and
it produces great colors with fantastic
viewing angles the chroma lighting on
the keyboard looks amazing but the lack
of lighting on the secondary keys and
special characters is a deal-breaker for
me personally but hey at least the
trackpad is one of the best I've tried
on a Windows laptop battery life was
pretty good and I've witnessed that
during my long stage of the airport
emailing scripting and editing videos
gaming performance was just as expected
keeping razor as planned a GTX 1060
inside without sacrificing temperature
or performance however the bends do get
loud both under idle and low situations
so I would highly recommend headphones
for gaming so should you spend $2,000 on
this notebook I would wait for this
year's release because rays are still
have to update their models with the
newly announced cabling processors and
if they address the issues that I
mentioned above go for it but as of
right now I would hold off to an almost
perfect premium gaming laptop amiibo
with hard connects thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one
