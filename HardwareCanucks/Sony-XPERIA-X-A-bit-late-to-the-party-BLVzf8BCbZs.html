axe and when you're out there looking to
invest into a smartphone there is quite
a lot of research that needs to be done
especially if your budget is over $500
this year we've seen plenty of fantastic
releases but should you stop looking for
one the Kraken x61 liquid cooler by NZXT
features a variable pump speed to high
static pressure 140 member fans and
beautiful user control through the cam
software click below to get crackin sony
has announced a new device into the
market and it's this the Xperia X its
price five hundred and fifty dollars I
have to give credit to Sony for the
amazing build quality of the Xperia X
the whole body is crafted in aluminum
the sides are strong and rigid and every
time I pick up this phone I get a sense
of using a premium device the screen is
curved a little bit towards the edges
and I just love holding it in one hand
the screen is a 5-inch 1080p display
that is IPS it was a weird transition
for me personally coming from the Nexus
6p that houses a 5.7 inch display I'm
not gonna complain about why Sony skip
DQ HD mark 1080p just looks great on the
screen given the size viewing angles are
excellent with great color reproduction
you won't have any trouble viewing the
screen outdoors the icing on top of this
is the inclusion of dual front-facing
speakers and all of us consume content
on smart phone these days and what
better way to enhance the audio
experience let's take a listen
if you're an audio enthusiast
you'll love this as well the built-in
DAC sounds phenomenal the audio output
is balanced without any extra emphasis
on bass or the high in frequencies and
you won't have any trouble driving high
in headphones there are a few settings
within the phone personally I wasn't
able to differentiate between dsee HX
and clear Audio plus but the ability to
manually tweak eq is always a welcome
feature and overall if I were to
describe the audio experience from the
Xperia X in two words it's clean and
awesome the phone's memory can also be
expanded via microSD and that's located
within the SIM card tray it's a great
way to store all your music and media
there's a fingerprint reader integrated
into the power button on the right side
of the phone it worked fine for me but
what's really disappointing is that Sony
decided to disable the fingerprint
scanner for the US market just like they
did with the z5 line this alone is a
deal breaking feature too many customers
who like the convenience of fingerprint
sensors plus the price is not a
reflection of omitted features right
below the power button is where you'll
find the volume adjust buttons they are
clicky and the buttons don't shuffle but
the placement seems a bit odd it's just
an annoyance now to adjust volume and
Sony seriously needs to reconsider body
design for the future
next to volume adjust sits a camera
shutter button when half pressed users
can focus on to a subject and when fully
pressed it captures a shot this allows
to steady the phone and have better
focus control do note that shooting
portrait you are better off using the
touchscreen buttons but during landscape
it feels like an actual point-and-shoot
camera that my friend is taking
smartphone photography to the next level
only if the camera was good you see it's
a 23 megapixel sensor with an F 2.0
aperture and while on paper that looks
great it's what I would call moderate
the volume buttons that I mentioned
earlier acts as a zooming feature but
again due to awkward placement so close
to the shutter button they are left
use the pictures that you see here are
taken on manual mode which oddly enough
only lets you to fiddle around with
exposure and specific white balance
presents and judging by the results the
detail is present if you're taking
pictures in daylight or any well-lit
environment but you won't be satisfied
taking pictures in low light also every
time when I pointed the sensor into a
bright light source this weird green
flare shows up you won't find any raw
shooting options and even if you were
shooting auto sometimes the sensor
misses the right exposure and it
frequently shifts on white balance it's
so unfortunate for Sony to mess up the
camera especially when compared to the
6p that uses a 12 megapixel Sony sensor
that gives much more detail and dynamic
range compared to the xperia x a bit
ironic you can shoot 1080p video at 30
and 60 frames per second from my test 60
P looked more noisier than 30 P so I'd
stick with that setting but for phone
that costs more than $500 it's
completely unacceptable to not feature
4k recording Sony steady shot
stabilization works well here without
cropping in under the native resolution
remember it's digital not optical so let
me know what you guys think about the
quality of the footage the phone runs
the latest version of Android in this
case version 6.0.1 marshmallow Sony's
custom skin on top looks really good
actually and fair it's light without any
unwanted blow player and with the help
of Qualcomm's power efficient snapdragon
650 cpu and 3 gigabytes of ram apps open
up very fast memory management was
excellent you might notice occasional
frame drops when gaming but on the other
hand I never experienced any signs of
overheating and overall I really like
using this phone
although specs wise for an Android
device seems underwhelming when 6
gigabytes of RAM an 800 series processor
exists on cheaper phones battery life
was really good on the Xperia X I was
able to average around four and a half
to five hours of screen on time which
from my perspective is awesome there are
two types of power saving features
stamina mode and ultra stamina mode
stamina mode gets activated depending on
the percentage setting you have enabled
in my case 15% seemed reasonable
this disables animations
is brightness and cuts down some
background process now when you enable
the ultra stamina mode the phone
restructures the operating system in
order for you to make calls message
access music and some other basic stuff
data is completely disabled plus you
won't be able to access any other apps
and on top of that the battery life gets
extended significantly I really
appreciate this feature as this in come
in very handy during low battery
emergency situations ok so what are my
concluding thoughts on the Sony Xperia X
it's an OK phone with the few deal
breaking disadvantages like the
fingerprint reader not enabled for US
customers as well as the poor camera
performance when compared to cheaper
phones and price the actual phone
experience is great with nice sized good
display fantastic audio capabilities and
lasting battery but we can't look at
this product in a vacuum since the 1
plus 3 is a thing the 6p the Samsung
Galaxy s6 and the LG g5 all have an
upper hand over the Xperia X in one way
or another so what do you guys think
about the sony xperia x is it worth $550
