is brought to you by NCIX technology
connected alright so we here at the LG
booth at CES 2014 I think this is the
central hall I kind of lost track of
exactly where the hell we were but one
of the things that I want to talk to you
guys about was when we first entered
this booth we saw what I'm going to step
out and actually say that this was the
best 3d that I have ever seen that
includes 3d that I've seen in theaters
this is the first one that actually
doesn't hurt my eyes and make me feel
sick it was vibrant the colors were
fantastic and I felt like it was like
right in front of my face there's a
point where there's a tiger paw coming
right at you and it felt really really
sweet because it was like right there
you could see it like the hair moving a
little bit it was very very very well
done so moving on from the 3d that we
saw today we also saw some pretty
innovative and I didn't actually think
was possible but a flexible Oh LED IPS
panel so basically depending on what the
situation is a viewing situation is in
your home you can adjust the panel to
either be curved for a few people so
that the viewing angles are very direct
or you can flatten the panel out so you
can have much more wide viewing angles
if let's say you're having a superbowl
party or something like that but
everybody else wants to be able to view
the content so it's a very flexible TV
and it's able to be flexible which is
really really really cool another
release me thing that we've seen today
is the web OS now this is a very
functional operating system for a TV and
something that we haven't seen before
but if you think webos you might
recognize the name and it used to be the
HP tablet software but when HP decided
that they were going nowhere with it
they made it basically open source LG
picked it up and actually made it into
something very special be able to
navigate through your OS using this air
mouse or an air controller which
basically just acts like a pointer you
can connect it to the internet and it
has an on-screen display that allows you
to switch between apps
the TV and multiple different things all
in real time without actually having any
type of a stutter or any type of a
change at all whatsoever it's very
intuitive it's very quick and its really
really really efficient another really
awesome thing that we've seen here today
is well basically another mobile and
wearable tech option it's called the
life and now this band is actually one
of the ones that I'm really excited for
it's probably gonna be out in March at
some point price points were not
announced but it is one of those type of
bands that has additional features and a
lot of different options options that
are interesting to the average consumer
it's not only a fitness tracker but it's
also a life tracker in the way that you
can basically just customize your use of
the band based on what you need so music
you can read text messages you can see
incoming calls so it has a lot of
different options and use abilities so
it won't just be a basic pedometer or
fitness tracker like we saw from one of
LG's competitors now there is one more
awesome piece of tech that we saw here
and it's a finger gesture system which
will basically allow you to control your
TV by doing this and this so you're able
to basically mute your TV like this how
did you make it louder if you wanted to
raise the the audio of your TV if you
wanted to raise the volume you would
gesture your finger over to the volume
button and you're basically just pinch
on it so people out it would allow the
TV's volume to race if you wanted to
mute you would shush it and it would
basically act on those commands as well
it also includes a pretty innovative
voice commands you could say find me
Simpsons and it would go and find
Simpsons wherever it's playing on your
cable or on the air network as long as
it's plugged into the TV so guys thank
