a lot of hype for good reasons I've also
been really wanted to work in something
like this and put in as many fans and
here as possible and build like an
airflow focus system because with the
dynamic while it was you know beautiful
and received a lot of good attention for
good reasons make sure to check out all
the content that we made out over here
it was mainly like you put in the
radiator system in there maybe a custom
loop while the air in the name obviously
indicates its particular focus for
airflow focus systems air flow focused
air focused too many focus air but I am
concerned because while the chassis is
pretty wide to accommodate for that dual
chamber design the main chamber where
the system sits is pretty slim and we
only have a hundred and fifty five
millimeters of CPU tower clearance that
means many enthusiast air coolers will
not fit in here like noctus NHD u14 many
be quiet tower coolers like the dark
crock pro 4 and just for one because
they are slightly taller at 160
millimeters and so having a little of 5
millimeters would really accommodate for
that enthusiast airflow market but now
you have a bit of a compromise here
because you have to look for slightly
shorter CPU tower and just to clarify
the dynamic and the air are basically
the exact same case so any limitations
that we're talking about today about the
CPU cooler height also applies with the
dynamic because it's an indent called
internal structure only the exterior
differences plus we have the additional
fans at the front there and you can
check out our full review for dynamic
right over here
where we go a lot more in depth about
everything else that we might not cover
in this video so make sure to check it
out and now it all makes sense while Ian
Lee sent over the cry rig h7 because
none of the coolers that I have would
fit and this does it's only 145
millimeters because initially I'm air
cooling my 87
kaor rising cpu obviously want to use
something beefier like this dark rock
pro 4 it's nice but it's just way too
tall for the case that's unfortunate so
let us analyze right after this evolve
with the times
consider nvme storage today the new RC
100 brings affordable nvme storage into
your hands with various capacities in
this super compact form factor that
plugs directly into your motherboard
it's extremely powerful and utilizes the
Sheba's advanced 3d flash memory for
awesome speeds so you can be a happy
user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme
drive to consider check it out below
alright so the O 11 air comes in two
variants the standard model that comes
with two 120mm fans it goes for $129
which is the exact same price as the
dynamic so there is no compromise of
which one you want to choose if you want
to go with something but more airflow
focused versus something bored more
elegant with the dynamic this is your
pick but then there's the second version
the RGB one that comes with three 120mm
fans that are RGB that have this
aluminum frame these are the be our
light 120 so the RGB version is $149
which is a $20 premium for three other
snow fans for a total of five which is
awesome because you can mount those
three fans potentially in the front to
have that nice glow or the top or the
side or the bottom and still have two
additional fans that you can mount
anywhere else in the case it's a pretty
decent deal for a total of five fans but
I have something else in mind and we yes
those fans cost more than the case
itself but when you focus his airflow
you got to go with knock door now from a
design perspective it is warming up to
me but I was hoping for a slightly more
color variation in the in the entire
body because it's all black and there is
a bit of a discrepancy between the matte
black plastic and the slightly shiny
metal it would be awesome to have like
darker gray grilles over here so that it
has a little bit of extra pop and
potentially emphasize that airflow angle
but you are paying the exact same price
of 129 for the dynamic or the air so
there is no
you know price incentive to choose one
over the other however with the air
while you do get additional plastic here
while you get metal on the glass on the
dynamic you do have additional fans at
the front while the dynamic has no fans
at all but the two cases share the exact
same internal structure which is awesome
so no surprises there aside from the air
having a new bracket at the front to
support those front fans and so you know
dual chamber design the main motherboard
area has a ATX motherboard support I do
love those angle or rubber grommets on
the side so if you have sleeve cable
extensions the 24 pin cable you know
angle can look really good there and
there's plenty of space above the
motherboard for radiator and set of fans
plus the rubber grommet throughout any
cables that you need there at the back
we have a power supply that is angled
towards the side panel you can also
remove the hard drive to accommodate for
a second power supply the cable cover
can support additional storage and also
cover all your cables there they have
added additional holes for the back of
the case to mount 80 millimeter fans you
can mount two of them so you can have
additional exhaust and overall this case
is really meant to have this like
playground of airflow and how you want
to mount and where you want to mount
those fans so front intake the side
intake or exhaust top intake or exhaust
bottom most likely intake and the rear
exhaust as well and so this means that
all sides the top the front the bottom
and the side support a 3/16 other
radiator and you can mount a two eighty
rather the top or the front so airflow
options are plenty and in my dynamic
configuration i mounted nine fans you
can check out the results of the
temperatures there but with the air we
have three additional intake so you can
mount 12 fans total plus two additional
80 mm vents in the back that is pretty
insane so now it's time to build my
ultimate airflow system windows not to
us
all right so the build is finished and I
think the system looks absolutely
awesome
with these Noctua fans I don't mind the
color variation between the brown plants
and the rest of the system because I'm
not adding any RGB strips in there so
you know having that additional like one
component from a hardware that kind of
stands out it's nice because they're all
uniform and stuff and I even disabled
the LED RGB on the cooler because it
just didn't make sense I then used came
Awad sleeved extensions to demonstrate
that beautiful Bend from the side rubber
grommets because we're not adding any
lighting and these extensions just add
that one extra premium element I love it
but if you are going for some form of
like RGB element through fans keep in
mind that illumination will be hidden
from the angle and so when I installed
my inner max tbh RGB fans because of
that beautiful ring illumination
they shine right through the front which
is awesome so just keep that in mind
when you know assembly in your own
system and potentially adding RGB
lighting or fans and you can check out
cable mod extensions and the inner max
RGB fans and down description below now
just to come back to this whole
conversation about CPU tower
compatibility with the O 11 air and
mounted my pure rock from be quiet it's
a really good tower it's supposed to be
a hundred and fifty five millimeters in
height which is perfect for this case
however I was still having issues with
the glass panel interfering with the top
heat pipe stoppers which got me thinking
is pure rock or be quiet advertising
there spec wrong is the CPU tower
actually taller than 155 millimetres or
is liam lee in the wrong by not
including exact dimensions for their CPU
tower height compatibility so after
measuring the CPU tower it is in fact D
quiets fault they are not advertising
their correct spec for the pure rock but
actually many other coolers who knows
but the top of the heat pipe is what
goes beyond the hundred fifty five
millimeters and that is an issue because
it's misleading customers it does not
advertise the true height of the coolers
and moving forward where cases are
getting smaller you
need that precision and I'm quite
disappointed that it's not coming from
be quiet who are known for German
engineering and this got me thinking
because my smaller crying age 7 cooler
that actually fits inside the enclosure
it cannot adequately cool my overclocked
8700 K and therefore we have to
compromise so I have to speed up by fans
to full speed about 2,000 rpm and I have
to lower my clock speeds on the CPU my
system becomes quiet loud now granted it
is a $35 cooler it is pretty affordable
purchase links are in description below
but it is only one of the few that
actually fits inside this enclosure so
you might have to re-strategize
potentially going with all-in-one
coolers or a custom loop inside the 11
air now as for air flow testing Steve
from gamers Nexus pointed out that the
dust filter was a choking point for
airflow and I've experienced the same
thing you know you can see the CPU and
GPU temperatures are higher when the
dust filter is installed and this is
running at full speed with those
beautiful amazing Noctua fans so the
difference it will definitely be higher
you know the delta between the CPU and
GPU temperatures with lower quality fans
when the dust filter is installed so
keep that in mind and so if you do have
the edge for the 11th series the air is
a fantastic option just have to keep in
mind with the CPU cooler tower height
limitations and the additional front
intake definitely could be used for
radiators or an all-in-one cooler that
could deliver that there's no fresh air
that we do not see with the dynamic
version now one last thing I want to
mention with the front panel is that the
pegs that are attached to the actual
frame are pretty short so actually
attaching the front panel is a little
bit more difficult and also the front IO
which has a type C port gen 2 which is
awesome they'll get also stuck in
between the frame and the plastic so you
have to align them properly and also be
careful not to turn the system on when
doing so and so to conclude I think I
got all really excited about the all of
an air thinking that's going to be like
the next unique airflow enclosure and
while it is you just have to approach it
with those limitations in mind but see
you cannot mount any of the most popular
even like mid-range air coolers inside
here what is the point then you have to
reconsider go with an all-in-one cooler
and that take advantage of that
additional front intake I still love
this dual chamber layout and hopefully
see more like it and just how much
cooling it can house in such a tiny
enclosure but guys I'm Dimitri thanks

out this other relevant content let me
know what you think of the 11 air and
how you know potentially you want go
with that or the dynamic yeah see you
