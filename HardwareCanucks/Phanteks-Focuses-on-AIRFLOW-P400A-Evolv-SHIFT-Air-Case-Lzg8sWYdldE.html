speakers they're amazing thank you
it all started with an April Fool's joke
but now apparently there's going to be
an actual product from Phanteks expanding
him to audio apparently this thing is
actually pretty cute actually so it's
sound good for the for the size the
whole RGB illumination and it's kind of
like marketing for for the kid for the
of all cases speaking over the evolv
cases you guys know the evolv X and
I've done a dual system configuration in
it and it's kind of cool how they're
showing its case in action
so all dual systems we have one gaming
PC at the bottom one streaming PC at the
top and you can see the dual monitor
setup that showcased that exact scenario
by the way Eber you're not very good at
this game you know I know I'm terrible
I'm just kind of oh you're you're in the
training yeah because because it's not
online I'm just gonna peace out and
again huge thanks to Phanteks and
SteelSeries for making our computex
possible and they also would like to go
over some other changes regarding to Phanteks
products including the eclipse line
new power supplies new shift enclosure
and some metallic gear stuff so let's
begin with the Eclipse p360X so it's a
$69 case and they've improved airflow
and integrated LED elements into the
front panel which was inspired by the
automotive industry because of the
three-dimensional look of how this LED
strip looks from each angle so it might
look slightly more ambient and soft when
the front or more harsh because you can
actually see the LED strip from the
45-degree angle or at a 90 degree angle
it again looks like different so I get
what they're trying to do but not a fan
of the esthetic from the three sides I
prefer something a bit more soft and
ambient like what they've done with
previous cases but at least they've
improved on the airflow because on the
original p350X which is still around
by the way I'm guessing it was slightly
bit more challenging as with the Eclipse
p400a a stands for air flow where the
done here is replaced a solid panel with
a one that has more air flow so that
whole front panel is full metal body
which is awesome it also
the dust filter and based on their own
testing airflow has significantly
improved and the P400 series we are
told has been really popular for Phanteks
and them adding an airflow version into
the mix is awesome plus they're doing
digital RGB fans version which is $89
and will include three fans on the front
which are digital RGB with awesome
effects while the $69 case will have two
fans which are not RGB and two color
options two glossy white or matte black
and both a 360X and the P400a will be
out-of-the-box compatible with the
vertical GPU bracket that Phanteks also
sells for $39 with a riser cable by the
way so it's not just the bracket itself
so you can go with a nice vertical
orientation that is spaced out pretty
far away from the side panel to have
sufficient airflow and moving on to the
evolve shift the vertical case which I
absolutely love the aesthetics of now
they're finally adding the airflow side
panels and the cool thing about this
story is that they found a speaker
Factory and they're using them to
manufacture the side panels with this
high airflow fabric and therefore
they're trying to target the whole HTPC
market whereas the case now looks pretty
modern not with glass but with fabric
that is both slightly transparent so you
can actually see the components and
anything that's lit up behind it and
it's acting as a dust filter that you
can easily vacuum it's not going to rip
and three the whole thing is about
airflow so it will allow that whole
vertical and horizontal airflow channel
for both the CPU and the GPU and Max are
excited to check out where the
temperatures will be like with glass
panel when it's completely closed when
everything is just a little album inside
versus when the high airflow mesh our
panels are installed and since this is
exactly the same chassis the panels will
be backwards compatible with the
original evolv shift and of course you
can create this hybrid solution with the
mesh on one side ntg on the other and
that's for power supplies they have a
new series called amp again they've
partnered with C Sonic like they have
with revolt X units and this one is a
slightly lower more mainstream targets
so 80-plus
certification and 550 650 and 750 watt
power supplies ranging from $89 to $99
two hundred and nine dollars as for the
size they are pretty compact at 140 by
150 millimeters they are fully modular
with black and flat cables we have a
hybrid mode that stops the fans from
spinning if your power supply is under
30 percent load they're using cable free
interior for efficiency purposes and the
main thing to take away from the amp
series is there a hundred percent
certified to work with the revolt ex
power supplies which means that you can
connect the amp power a power supply to
the revolt X power supply route that
power directly into that to expand your
power capacity for more enthusiast
systems so that means they are rated for
reliability stability and connectivity
to work within the whole ecosystem of
what the revolt X power supplies try to
do between either splitting power or
adding more power supplies to create
this massive pool of power so to say and
that's pretty awesome for enthusiast
guys and the last thing for Phanteks I
promise you would be the metallic gear
updates so this is a their separate
brand that there's more lower tier and
these cases range from $49 to $89 and
Neil v2 line up which has been more
refined and almost finalized and I'm
excited to see what they can do with
such budget enclosures so stay tuned for
our sort of experience with metallic
gear as a brand hopefully we'll get to
see one of the Neo V twos in the studio
soon all right guys I'm Dmitri thanks
much for watching and stick around with
this make sure to check out this other
relevant content subscribe for more and
yeah I'll talk to you in next video 12m
perfect have time to edit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
