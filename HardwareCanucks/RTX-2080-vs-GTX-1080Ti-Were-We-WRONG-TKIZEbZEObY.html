posted our review of the r-tx 2080 and
2080 TI and a lot of you guys brought up
the fact that some cards we used we're
necessarily representative of what was
available to buy basically we ended up
showcasing the reference based cards and
what they were able to accomplish
against one another with the founders
edition gtx 980ti squaring off against
the RT X GPUs the tested methodologies
were perfectly in line with the ones
we've been doing for the past 15 years
on both the hard work Nets website and
here on YouTube now using a reference
based GPU basically allows us to
establish a baseline performance whereas
using custom aftermarket GPUs and
comparing them against the founders
Edition or aim DS reference based cards
usually stacks the deck against anything
reference spec notice I said usually
there guys well the problem is the r-tx
founders edition cards on running at
invidious baseline spec at all nor are
they priced like regular cards either
they're pre overclocked premium priced
monsters that cost a ton of money
meanwhile literally all of the gtx 980ti
cards available are non-reference cards
that have awesome heat sinks and come
with higher clock speeds that means a
lot of you guys were right in holding
our feet to the fire about the cards we
chose particularly when we compared the
RT x 2080 founders edition I think more
fitting comparison would have been using
a custom cooled gtx 980ti and that's
exactly what we decided to find out
since we didn't have one at the time of
making that video so we ended up
grabbing an overclocked EVGA GTX 10 80
TI superclocked Black Edition gaming for
seven hundred and seventy dollars
however by the time you're watching this
video this card may be more or less
expensive personally I think this card
is an excellent representation of what
invidious board partners still have
available and it doesn't carry a huge
premium over the gtx 980ti starting
price of about
$700 right away I threw out the
possibility of using something like the
Asus GTX 10 80 TI Strix OC or zou tax
and the core Extreme Edition in this
video since right now both of those
actually cost more than the Arctic's
2080 founders Edition which right away
makes them a pretty poor value so using
them to compare value and other factors
wouldn't have worked maybe a look into
those a little bit later but for now I
wanted to include a card like the super
clocked Black Edition since it combines
pricing with pre overclocked goodness
it's time to play with light with fine
things digital RGB star kit that
includes two LED strips and all the
appropriate cables the main hub is
magnetic velcro tape is available with
three digital channels for LED strips or
halos Lux fan frames that display a ton
of lighting effects and they're
absolutely gorgeous
check out the kit down below so let's
start off with a little test one of the
issues with the GTX 1080i founder's
Edition is that it uses a blower style
heatsink on the positive side this means
a lot of the hot air is exhausted
outside your case but at the same time
downdraft coolers are typically more
efficient so with Nvidia's boosts
outdoor them allowing for higher overall
clock speeds under cooler temperatures
our initial gtx 1080i results could have
been lowered due to increased core temps
there's no mistaking that Nvidia's r-tx
2080 founders Edition runs incredibly
cool given the size of the heat output
of the TA 104 core however take a look
at the gtx 980ti founders Edition as it
hits 84 C which happens to be right near
its thermal limit in stock form and that
could lead to some throttling as the
boosts algorithm tries to balance
temperature fan noise and power input
compare that to EVGA superclocked Black
Edition and the difference is massive
evie J's cooler capped temperatures at
an amazing 68 degree Celsius which
should give plenty of clock speed
Headroom but what actually happens when
we look at frequencies well here you go
remember in order to give you guys an
accurate idea of how GPUs performed
while you are gaming we put them under
load for a few minutes before each
benchmark so here you can see exactly
why we do that both Nvidia and AMD cards
can paddle after a little while and if
we would jump from one benchmark to
another leaving
car to cool down between each run our
results wouldn't show what you guys
would actually experience in this case
the gtx 980ti founders edition goes from
a respectful 1820 megahertz in the first
few minutes all the way down to about 16
80 megahertz around the four-minute mark
due to invidious and boost algorithm
trying to balance things out that's a
pretty big delta when he compared to evj
superclocked Black Edition which
remained around 1900 megahertz
throughout testing and that's pretty
amazing so it looks like some of our
initial results comparing the r-tx 2080
and gtx 980ti were negatively influenced
by the founders edition heat sink which
caused lower frequencies but that
doesn't mean that they were wrong since
for the last 5 years or so our testing
methodology has been specifically set up
to show gaming conditions rather than an
optimal environment that avoids
throttling now that evj car results are
really eye-opening though so let's see
if those higher frequencies really allow
it to close the gap with the RT x 2080
i'm gonna roll these benchmarks without
any commentary until the end feel free
to pause the video if you want to have a
bit more time to check them out
so there you have it guys and I have to
say that I'm actually really impressed
with these results the EVGA superclocked
Black Edition really showcase some
impressive performance across the board
and that's likely due to its consistent
clock speeds compared to the founders
edition in some cases it was able to
match or even slightly beat the r-tx
2080 founders Edition and I think that
that's pretty awesome for the price that
you pay for this card but in the end how
do these numbers average out across all
these tests as you can see the Arctic's
2080 is still able to very narrowly beat
the EVGA card when every game is taken
into account but only by around four
percent at 1440p basically the r-tx is
noticeably better in dx12 and Vulcan
whereas pre overclocked GTX tends to
perform extremely well in older api's
moving on to 4k and this is where the 11
gigabyte gtx 1080i ends up winning all
day
once again the margin isn't huge but in
some titles the Arctic's 2080s frame
buffer can be a limitation like I said
and launched a review that's a big
worrying since the lasting is an $800
GPU shouldn't be choking itself out at
new HD resolutions with this in our back
pocket we can now look at the actual
value as well at 1440p the Arctic's 2080
and EVGA gtx 980ti superclocked are
pretty much tied from a value
perspective but before you all keyboard
warriors start typing hate in the
comments there's something important
here based on how good a reference gtx
980ti does if you can find it custom one
for less than $750 it'll be an excellent
value but that's getting harder and
harder without going into the used
market since the GTX series is selling
out quickly moving up to 4k and the r-tx
2080 gets its butt kicked from a value
perspective due to its memory
limitations the EVGA card is far out in
the lead something else interesting is
that due to its huge performance numbers
in 4k games the r-tx 2080 Ti has closed
the gap a bit too
despite its ridiculous $1,200 price tag
that's something to take into account if
you have the money to burn so with all
these new numbers has our opinion
changed about the RT X 2080
yes and no you see it's amazing to see
what a custom she takes to neotec and
make a difference especially with the
results and honestly we should have
included one from the very beginning
since it would have given a more
balanced perspective with those taken in
the equation the founders Edition r-tx
2080 becomes a lower value and a less
step towards stepping up to a 4k display
compared to a gtx 980ti
then again I have to wonder how well
something like these $750 EVG r-tx 20 80
XC would do since it is $50 less than
the founders Edition but has very
similar frequencies that's another
question for another video I guess since
we've had the time to digest what the
market is doing now our perspectives
have changed a bit too folks are
frustrated at in video since those
starting at $699 r-tx 2080s have failed
to appear and honestly the more I look
at it the $800 RTX 2080 could be a
brilliant but underhanded mood to clear
out stocks of their discontinued pascal
cards if that was a plan it worked
pretty well but in no way to the benefit
gamers it's actually pretty hard to find
a GTX series cards at reasonable prices
or even at stock and I wouldn't be
surprised if we start to see the $699
r-tx 2080 magically appear once the gtx
980ti cards are flushed out speaking of
1080 T eyes remember when I said if you
find that card for less than $750 it
would be a good deal well I actually
found this ZOTAC an for under $700 which
i think is an absolute steal at the time
of making this video I'm not even sure
if this card will be around by the time
you're seeing this video but if it is
I'll make sure to link it down below
just be aware that these kinds of deals
are getting rarer and rarer these days
the new mark 2 coursers tray and k70
keyboards are fully loaded with custom
illumination convenient media buttons
USB pass-through extra set of key camps
and ergonomic wrist rest for each
keyboard so you can type or game
comfortably with a variety of MX
switches available so you can check out
which keyboard suits you best in the
description below
coming back to RTX and I think the main
problem with our TX cards is a lot of
their price is based on nothing more
than a promise of right tracing and AI
that'll be a huge or I guess a big thing
for
Gaming at least that's what nvidia is
trying to convince us so I'm going to
repeat the exact same thing that I said
foot since day one of this our text
lunch and that is if you don't
absolutely need a graphics card right
now waiting to see how things will look
in the next few months but with the EVGA
gtx 1080i super clocked in the charts
it's obvious that depending on the price
a Pascal based GPU can be a phenomenal
value just don't pay well more than 750
dollars for one because about that price
point you're looking into an area of
diminishing returns for your money
