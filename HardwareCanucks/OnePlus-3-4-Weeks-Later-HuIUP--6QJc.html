axe and the way oneplus has built this
reputation is quite fascinating now
removing the flagship killer branding
with the latest launch of the oneplus 3
effectively placing this smartphone to
be the best device within its price
class however oneplus has done such a
great job of sort of meandering itself
into the high tier market that the
oneplus 2 do right now is being compared
to phones twice its price so the s7
lines the HTC 10 the iPhone success and
that is both awesome in nature and
detrimental or could be detrimental to
the success of the oneplus 3 the z9
neo-byzantine
the right features on a budget with a
large window side panel 5 included fans
and the excellent interior layout with
super simple cable management get it now
link in the description below
so I've been using the 1+3 for a month
now and man it's such a fantastic
upgrade over the oneplus 2 its slider
it's been there it's more beautiful and
most importantly it's still affordable
no invite needed I love that we only
have a 64 gigabyte model but with only
fifty three gigabytes available it's a
bit misleading but that's become the
expectation of expecting about 80 to 85%
of available capacity for storage the
rest of the specs are pretty awesome and
everyone was wowed by the six gigabytes
of RAM only to be disappointed by poor
RAM management and some issues that
arise there but I could run 14 apps at
the same time without needing to reload
them and I'm totally ok with that and
you should be too now quality user
experience with the device should not
come from the materials alone it's a
little bit too slippery for me unless I
put a case which by the way covers the
fairly large lens bump it doesn't bother
me physically but it is a popular thing
to hate on but there is merit of needing
to be extra careful not to crack the
fairly large lens the buttons have
improved drastically over the oneplus 2
without any rattle now very clicky
registration and the alert slider is
resistant enough with locking
confidently in all three positions and I
wish more Android phones had this
feature I put a twos the silent mode
when going to bed and priority when I
don't want to be disturbed the dual nano
SIM tray is just for Sims everybody's
kind of set about having no additional
storage with micro sd here but we have
64 gigabytes so that should be enough
the fingerprint sensor is faster than my
s7 sitting in between two lovely elegant
capacitive buttons that can be swapped
or enabled on screen buttons for easier
control for smaller hands now the major
update for me here is the display which
is still too
but now an amyloid so contrast is
brilliant and side by side to my s7 I
honestly cannot tell the difference in
color reproduction with the latest
update you can now enable sRGB color
space with more accurate but less
vibrant colors so they're a little bit
more natural plus we have a temperature
adjustment on the fly and night mode to
get rid of blue light before you sleep
however oneplus isn't hot waters for
using a pentile panel which effectively
reduces the resolution from 1080p
acceleration of text on screen you know
if you look like this or if you have a
really sharp eye and comparing this
screen to my s7 absolutely the
difference is there you could say it's
pretty major especially if you look at
text thumbnails on YouTube it's one of
those technical drawbacks that yes
should be mention but in my daily user
experience it wasn't really noticeable
the brightness range is good phone
speaker is clear and most importantly
when you talk on speakerphone you no
longer experience the disgusting echo
that we had on the oneplus 2 the USBC
connection at the bottom is only for the
interface it's quite convenient but it
is USB 2.0 transfer speed but now we
have this - charging which is actually
super awesome to charge your phone sixty
percent of the battery in just 30
minutes while keeping the heat away from
the phone since the charger is now
handling the power management and I'm
curious to see how this will impact
battery life in six months because as of
now it's pretty awesome full day no
problem with a quick juice up in the
evening if you're pulling an all-nighter
I like the four camera you can launch it
through double tapping the home button
or the power button plus the app is good
to adjust incremental exposure you have
raw support which is actually quite
awesome to recover some of those
highlights
since this camera tends to overexpose
and also work with an uncompressed image
if your internet the video detail in 4k
is actually good but stabilization
bitrate and focus are just disappointing
all around you can check out our video
here while the front selfie cam is
actually not bad and so as a three $99
smartphone the one plus three is better
than expected if I then flash out the
money on the
seven I would have stuck with the e1
plus 3 as my daily driver
the only real disappointment here for me
is the lack of 60 frames per second
playback on YouTube as that plays at
480p maximum the standard 1080p video
plays just fine but if you're going over
30 frames per second playing back this
cannot handle it for some reason when
other Snapdragon 820 s and similar SPECT
phones can handle it no problem so I
know there's everybody's complaining
about that and perhaps oneplus will roll
out a software update and so this month
has been a real treat with the 1+3
better than expected all the familiar
features that I've come to know from the
oneplus 2 has carried over like the
clean OS and a bunch of customization
you can do in OS without having to
rooted without having to install any you
know custom launchers and whatever and
the 1+3 is a damn good phone and so that
is my experience with a1 plus 3 if
you're on the fence of picking one up
let's have a conversation down below and
with the beech tree with hurricane axe
thanks so much for watching we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
