showcase of CES and it comes from Razer
was likely showing us some of the
coolest stuff at the show this year
unlike other years the products will be
taking a look at today will be available
this year rather than just being a
proof-of-concept like last year's crazy
triple screen gaming notebook the first
thing that popped out at the razor suite
was this say hello to the Razer Raptor a
monitor that has been designed to
provide the ultimate gaming experience
or more like the ultimate Razer gaming
experience now I know some of you might
be thinking oh no another gaming monitor
but there's something really exciting
about this particular one that I'll get
to in a minute but before that I'd like
to thank our show sponsors Razer fantex
MSI thermaltake and Corsair because
without them this coverage would not
have been possible okay so back to the
Raptor the first thing that I wanted to
mention is that this isn't a final
production sample but rather an early
design face model we will see the Raptor
on sale a bit later this year and I
wouldn't be surprised if the final
version is unveiled at Computex so this
is a 27-inch monitor that's the first
razor has designed and produced from
ground up
they've also collaborated with other
manufacturers to rebrand monitors but
this one is completely different now
usually I'll be talking about panel
specs right now but that'll wait till
later because what caught our eyes is
the exterior design
I think Razer is one of the first
companies to really think about the
monitors cable management and back panel
design and it's actually pretty
brilliant while the overall design looks
a lot like an iMac the back plate has
this cool blend of brushed matte black
metal and this black fabric material
which looks pretty cool not only that
but the base is made out of forced
aluminum and five CNC mill channels that
are used for easy cable management the
solution is absolutely brilliant
especially when you use the green razor
cables that are included when you buy
the Raptor personally and I love the
fact that Razer went with this level to
ensure cable clutter is out of the way
and it properly managed of course
there's also subtle integrated chroma
RGB lining that can be controlled
through the snaps three application and
will color coordinate with the other you
know Razer peripherals even though the
base doesn't swivel the raptor has full
height adjustment along with this little
trick so the entire panel can pivot 90
degrees
for super easy access to the i/o ports I
think this is just pure genius the other
thing that really jumped out is just how
thin the rafters bezels are and only 2.3
millimeters if you can afford three of
them it would make a perfect
multi-monitor setup all right so now on
to the specs and they're pretty much on
par with what you would expect on a
gaming monitor these days the raptor has
a 1440p IPS panel that's rated at 144
Hertz and incorporates freesync and HDR
it also has a one millisecond response
time if the special motion blur
reduction is used but without that it
enables or rewards to a typical seven
millisecond or four millisecond with
overdrive enabled according to razor
they'll be factory calibrating every
Raptor to deliver optimal color and
gaming performance right out of the box
ask for input connectors it's pretty
decent with hdmi 2.0 a DisplayPort 1.4
connector a USB C and two USB 3.0 pass
reports that USB C supports the
DisplayPort 1.4 protocol and can act as
a power delivery port to charge your
mobile device Razer has also implemented
true picture in picture and picture by
picture modes which can allow images
from multiple inputs that can be
displayed at the same time this would be
great for productivity but I think it
will be a more useful feature on larger
format displays rather than just 27
inches now at this point I'm sure you're
all wondering about the price since this
is a pretty high-end display and it's
from Razer so I'm just gonna come out
and say it
the Raptor will go for around $700 us
and will be available in the US and
Canada later now that's a pretty big
chunk of money when you consider the
competition and the fact that it doesn't
even have g-sync but there are still
some awesome features here so what do
you guys think about the Razer Raptor
does it deliver what you want from a
20-19 gaming display and more
importantly do you think it's too
expensive let us know in the comments
