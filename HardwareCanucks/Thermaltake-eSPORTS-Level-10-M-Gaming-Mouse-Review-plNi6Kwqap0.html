level 10 gaming series as thermal techs
gaming branch the tte Sports has
partnered up with BMW design works USA
to come up with something unique for
gamers now the level 10m does carry sort
of a race card design and you get to
choose from four colors the black the
military green glossy white and the
special edition glossy red now it will
leave a hefty dent in your wallet for
$100 so let's check out if it's worth
your money now the main selling points
of the smells are the height and tilt
adjustments air through ventilation and
excellent 8200 dpi laser sensor and
great build quality but nowhere does it
mention anything mount comfort or finger
support but more on that later now the
mouse weights end at 185 grams so it's
actually quite heavy we have a really
solid aluminum chassis which sort of
rubberized plastic bits for the top
exterior so the overall construction is
top-notch for the level 10 except for
that front bit that came off on the
first day now it doesn't affect
functionality of the mouse but it might
leave a bad taste in your mouth after
having dropped $100 on it now there's no
option to customize the weights
unfortunately so only those with large
hands and prefer the mouse a bit on the
heavy side will find a level 10m
suitable now personally I didn't have
any issues with the size but the weight
is definitely something you need time
getting used to so the left and right
clicks are very responsive but have
different pressure points along the
button the LED rectangle on the left
click is sort of where you want to press
for in the minimum pressure and the
right button shows the four levels of
sensitivities and the mouse wheel also
provide sensory feedback and has great
textured surface we also get extra macro
keys on each side the left side features
a five-way sort of a joystick control
that allows on-the-fly profile switch it
is definitely useful but the placement
is questionable it sits right underneath
the middle of your thumb and many times
I found myself accidentally hitting it
and it just feels out of place and it
does not allow a tight
the a and B buttons are your forward and
backward clicks they're easy to reach
but I wish button a was as large as B
just because it takes a little more
pressure to press the smaller button now
the right size has a similar scene with
buttons D and C they're actually quite
difficult to recognize with your pinky
and feel completely out of place for a
gaming mouse now we also get this fancy
lighting which is fully customizable for
each of the LEDs this is just extra
icing that doesn't hurt to be included
for a gaming product now my initial
thoughts on the ergonomics were a little
skeptical the level-10 seemed fairly
large and where's the support for your
thumb and your pinky it seems basic such
as finger support and comfort we're left
out during the design process now the
hand rest is customizable you can
slightly raise it and angle it by about
5 degrees on either side with the slow
tool provided now this little
customization may look minor but it does
significantly change the feel of the
mouse and you can still tweak the
position of the hand wrist based on your
preference now I still really wish they
included some customizable weights for
example and at least support for your
thumb for the level 10m to be gaming
ready now one awesome consideration that
went into the design was this air
through ventilation you can see the
mouse is somewhat open and there are
cutouts on the left side of the mouse
which are probably there to show off the
LED below but it might sound like a
gimmick but my hand didn't sweat as much
just because any heat absorbed by the
chassis would be dissipated quicker than
your standard Mouse alright so all the
features considered how did it perform
as a gaming mouse well there's only one
way to test it with some awesome titles
and here's the verdict now the absence
of finger support was kind of a
deal-breaker my response time was
reduced because I couldn't aim as well
as I usually do and that's because I
couldn't find a comfortable way to hold
the mouse during gaming I eventually
disabled the joystick button completely
because I constantly was hitting it with
my thumb as I try to get a tougher grip
but the mouse eventually grew on me just
not in a gaming scene but a regular
desktop use for example because of its
heavier body it does allow a little bit
more
trol and at lower sensitivities this is
the mouse I choose for video editing now
the sensor included with the level 10 is
outstanding no complaints at that
department we have plenty of headroom
with that 8200 dpi sensitivity although
probably not many will utilize this
option for daily use alright so when it
comes to the software there's really
nothing to complain about in that
department it's quite easy to use for
example you can customize the color of
the LEDs for each of the light sources
except the for sensitivity LEDs that
they always stay red now you do have the
option to record your own macros this is
very helpful since the mouse has 8
programmable buttons for example I mean
clicking the scroll wheel to save as and
some other functions that I constantly
use while editing my videos now the
individual buttons are highlighted as
you mouse over them so it's quite easy
to select the button you want to
configure the performance tab lets you
configure the DPI levels change the X&amp;amp;Y
sensitivities independently adjust the
scroll wheel speed which may be useful
and we also get 1000 Hertz for the
falling rate which means 1 millisecond
response time excellent stuff for gaming
now the whole idea of having different
profiles of course is for different use
one for gaming one for desktop so that's
pretty standard to be included with this
mouse and by default you also have a few
options for the programmable buttons but
they are quite limited and you can also
use any button to launch a certain
program so for my video editing profile
buttons dnc open premiere and After
Effects so the level 10m Gaming Mouse
does carry a few good traits that we
want to see such as on the fly dpi
change different color LEDs responsive
left and right clicks and great build
quality it's always nice to see aluminum
on gaming products and lastly the height
and tilt customization to fit your style
however I feel this product is missing
one of the most important elements when
it comes to gaming and that's finger
support even after a couple of weeks I
still couldn't bring the smiles onto
battlefield and the poor button
placement of the side buttons feel out
of place and
drop so dropping $100 is something that
is only partially functional as a gaming
mouse may be hard to just fight
considering the abundance of other
gaming mice that offer better hand
support and include the weight system
and are actually more affordable so the
level 10m does bring style to the table
but I found it lacks functionality in
gaming it would be awesome if TT eSports
focused on designing something more
comfortable and less emphasis on its
appearance so thanks guys for watching I
hope you enjoyed the review and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
