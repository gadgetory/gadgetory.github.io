and this is the Aero 15X from
gigabyte a very popular notebook among
content creators and gamers who are
looking to get the most out of a
notebook in a thin and light form factor
now the Aero lineup of notebooks was
introduced when Nvidia rolled out the
GTX 10 series max-q designs and gigabyte
has continued to develop upon that
foundation now this is the updated
version that comes with the RTX 2070
max-q GPU so let's find out how it
actually performs and how well can a
finit like notebook can properly cool an RTX GPU because yeah it's that's
quite something so let's get into that
right after message from our sponsor the
new razer blade still defines
portability without compromising on
performance featuring Intel's latest
agent CPU and NVIDIA MX150 GPU up to 16
gigabytes of memory and up to 13 hours
of battery life experienced some of the
most popular games wherever you are
learn more about the blade stealth down
below alright so if you're familiar with
previous Aero 15X notebooks nothing
really has changed here in terms of
design with this new model gigabyte has
still stuck with the same chassis that's
built with a few aluminium components
there's also the same gigabyte glowing
logo on the front lid it's nowhere
closer to what you would get with the
Razer Blade 15 notebook the keyboard
layout still remains the same with perky
RGB lighting and a few handful of
lighting effects the trackpad has
improved significantly this time because
it now features Windows position drivers
so you can take advantage of all the
gesture controls baked into Windows 10
I'm glad that gigabyte listened although
I will be honest coming from my blade 15
base model featuring a glass touchpad
the responsiveness is definitely
noticeable coming to the Aero 15X it's
just not as smooth as would you'd find
on the blade notebook I just feel like
I'm just boy
by the blade dammit the one thing that I
really wish to keep I did was to
reposition the nose cam to a an actual
proper location because it's still where
it is and it's super weird I mean the
quality is also pretty terrible port
selection remains the same as well and
honestly I have nothing to complain
about it especially in 2019
since we're seeing no good manufacturers
eliminating the important ones so on the
right hand side you get your Kensington
lock power in two USB 3.1 gen2
a thunderbolt type-c connector and a
fast UHS card reader guys this is a big
deal because you know personally as a
content creator I shoot a lot of video
especially in 4k and if I want to
transfer footage when I'm in trade shows
like CES that card reader can come in
super beneficial because a it's fast and
it's also built into the notebook so I
don't have to carry external adapters
everything like that Thank You Gigabyte I
think this is probably one of the
reasons why content creators will would
look into a Windows notebook especially
like the Aero 15X because it's it's got
everything I mean you can say no to that
switching over to the left we have an
rj45 port another USB 3.1 gen2 port HDMI
to PI know a USB C port that carries a
DisplayPort 1.4 signal and a headphone /
mic jack moving on to the display and
this in my opinion is a significant
upgrade from the previous generation
it's a 1080p IPS screen with a refresh
rate of 144 Hertz this panel is made by
LG and it features the Pantone
certification and the colors look
fabulous on the screen I'd say it's a
tad better and brighter than my blade 15
base model if you're a content creator
you'll absolutely love color correcting
and colored waiting of footage on the
Aero 15X because it's just so good I
don't think I have anything to complain
about this display and when you pair
that up with 144 its refresh rate it's
definitely something that you don't want
to miss especially in 2019
because gaming on it as well is a
fantastic experience I mean once you go
144 Hertz it's really hard to go back to
a 60 Hertz screen which is why I'm very
hesitant to go back to my blade 15 base
model because that notebook has 60 Hertz
displays so 144 hurts man the cursus
wheel specs wise this notebook features
a core i7 8750
six core 12 thread processor it's got 16
gigabytes of memory clocked at 26 66
megahertz there's also a one terabyte
Intel 760 P nvme SSD that rocks read
speeds above 2.8 gigabytes per second
and writes around 1.4 gigabytes per
second so pretty fast and star the shows
of course the RTX 2070 Max-q when you
get inside this notebook you can easily
get access to the internal components so
for instance the memory is easily
accessible you can actually max it out
to 64 gigabytes which is kind of insane
and there's also an extra nbme m2 slot
that you can populate so you can have a
dual storage configuration which is
quite nice
and there's also a 94 kilowatt hour
battery that is pretty good especially
when it comes to light load test I mean
you need to consider that this notebook
features a 144 to refresh rate so I was
able to get just a little over 6 hours
of use with my light load test which can
consist of you know refreshing a Chrome
web page for about 15 seconds and under
a heavy load it's definitely gonna
reduce especially when you're gaming on
it I wouldn't expect you know all the
battery life with this notebook but it's
very respectable considering that the
specs that it features alright so I
guess the last thing to discuss here is
performance but before I get into the
numbers I do want to talk about the
specs on the RTX 2070 because it
actually ranges on the type of cooling
design that gnomic manufacturers have
in-house inside a thin and light chassis
so it depends from brand to brand and if
you look at videos website it's actually
funny enough because suspects on the
Arctic's 20 70 states that the clock
speeds the boost clock speeds can range
anywhere between 1100 megahertz to 1440
megahertz and you know it's funny enough
when you look at the RTX 2080 the
delta in terms of frequency is 500
megahertz and that's insane so it's up
to the number of manufacturers to kind
of find and tweak what the speed sweet
spot is so I really had to monitor clock
speeds to make sure that I was getting
what was what was actually listed on the
India's site so let's talk about that
kicking things off with some synthetic
tests the six core 12 third CPU is a
strong performer for Wren
if you're an architect or designer or
even a content creator this thing will
do an amazing job I took this 13-minute
4k project exported it to the YouTube 4k
preset and this notebook took 15 minutes
and 17 seconds to render now I do need
to point out that if you're coming from
a notebook featuring gtx 1070 or gtx
1018 max-q
GPU then there's absolutely no reason to
upgrade to the rtx
notebook because the difference in
performance especially for rendering is
really not that big gaming on the other
hand was a fantastic experience and pair
that up with a 144 it's refresh rate
display this thing flies you can easily
push over a hundred frames per second in
most triple-a titles at the highest
preset except for Metro Exodus and
battlefield once and say are a bit
demanding now when you turn on RTX on
Metro Exodus it's definitely gonna take
a dip in performance taking a look at
temperatures on a full synthetic load
using either 64 the CPU did get quite
toasty around 89 C and the clock speeds
were hovering around 2.8 gigahertz which
is pretty respectable for casual tasks
the CPU was easily able to hit 4
gigahertz that's nice the rtx 2070 did
max out at 86 C and the clock speeds
were shifting back and forth between
1300 and 1410 megahertz which does align
really well with an Nvidia spec sheet
fan noise is something to consider what
the Aero 15X as it's not a quiet machine
especially when you enable gaming mode
within gigabytes own utilities software
speaking of gaming mode they're actually
three modes built inside this PC on
utility software so there's quiet normal
and gaming I did all my testing with
gaming mode enable to get the best out
of the system but if you decide to use a
normal mode it's going to take a slight
dip in performance not significant
because the clock speeds kind of vary
between 1200 and 1300 megahertz versus
thirteen hundred and fourteen hundred
megahertz when you enable gaming mode
and when you enable quiet mode it does
it does tune tone down the fans just a
little bit but it also takes a little
bit of a hit in terms of performance
okay so I guess this brings us to the
conclusion and I want to kick things off
by clearing some misconceptions I've
been floating around the internet
you see a lot of people think that the
new rtx notebooks are ridiculously
expensive and to an extent I can agree
because they're not cheap but you need
to understand it when if you kind of go
back a couple of years ago when Nvidia
rolled out GTX 10 series masks you
designs those notebooks were priced
similarly to what the RTX notebooks
are right now I mean a good example
would be this exact same Aero 15X
notebook that I looked at a while back
featuring a gtx 1070 max-q GPU that
thing cost around 2200 dollars and when
he compared to something like this
featuring an RTX 2070 GPU it's $200
more expensive but that's totally
justifiable for the performance that
you're getting in gaming and I get it if
you are on a budget trying to save some
money you're actually much better off
looking into a notebook featuring a GTX
10 series design but if you really want
me absolute best in terms of performance
RTX notebooks are here and it's kind of
amazing to see brands pack so much power
in a notebook that's easily portable I
mean you can take this with you I mean
anywhere you go if you're trapped if
you're going for shows or doing coverage
and stuff like that it's it's there for
you the performance is there I don't
think you'll ever be disappointed
whatsoever so coming back to the Aero 15X
should you buy this notebook well the
answer really depends on what you're
looking for in a notebook if you want
the absolute best performance in a
relatively thin aligned chassis then
this is the way to go except mind you
this notebook in particular does run a
little warm and the fan noise is also
quite loud so if you're gaming on it I
highly recommend pairing you know maybe
throwing on some headphones to eliminate
that also the speakers on these are
absolutely they're not really that great
it's not fun facing they're kind of
bottom facing as well so it really
doesn't sound that great compared to
something like the Razer blade 15 the
book quality is also not on par with
that and that's about it that's the only
complaint I have about the Aero 15X so
yeah that's pretty much it guys let me
know what you guys think about this
notebook I mean you know considering
that it cost around $2,400 sure you can
build a gaming PC the arguments always
there but I'd love to know your thoughts
about RTX on a notebook what do you
think about it is it something that
you'll consider looking
- also I'm really looking forward to
Nvidia rolling out the GTX 1660 Ti into
notebooks I mean that would be kind of
Awesome I just can't wait for that to
happen so anyways that's been it thank
you so much for watching make sure to
