truck you never know what's exciting or
a gaming notebook under eight hundred
fifty dollars that is actually worth it
now they're just pretending man well
these guys aren't find out why right
after this ninja coolermaster master
keys keyboard line-up is now available
and three sizes to fit within your space
with large medium and small boards with
either beautiful RGB or pure white LED
illumination a little something for
everyone make it yours with the master
keys Pro by Cooler Master so what's up
guys I'm Dimitri with our connection
today we're reviewing or comparing two
very exciting notebooks the Dell
Inspiron 15 7000 the new version and the
Acer VX 15 let's get started so first
let's start with the price the Acer
costs $7.99 and the Dell at 850 us the
difference in price is not too much but
the high price on the Dell is warranted
with a better GPU and overall more
elegant body but the Acer has a few
advantages I believe that make it it's
solid alternative and it's finally safe
to say that powerful gaming notebooks
are available for the mainstream because
both machines feature a pretty decent I
5 CPU that goes up to 3.5 gigahertz it
is not hyper threaded but it has four
cores there's a gigabytes of RAM that is
upgradeable to 32 gigabytes and the
storage is limited that I would say is
the weakest point on both computers you
can either have an SSD or a hard drive
but not a combination of both when
choosing your configuration for GPU the
Acer has a gtx 1050 and a gtx 1050 TI on
the dell aligning gaming performance to
much more expensive units like the XPS
15 but at a much lower price the dell
machine also has a bigger battery and
both have a pretty compact battery bank
to the screen is 1080p at 60 Hertz on
both machines they are matte displays
but Acer takes to win easy with an IPS
panel that looks great when compared to
the dell which is equipped for the TN
panel that loses contrast and just shift
colors with any slight angle change it's
absolutely terrible and this is the
worst cost-cutting decision they've made
and choosing an IPS option is a $50
premium that is totally needed otherwise
Sheen is not really worth it with the
default garbage panel both machines
exhibit some screenflex but the Acer
feels a little bit better with a stiffer
shell but I preferred the hinge
mechanism on the Dell but smooth one
hand opening whereas the hinge on the
Acer is a bit stiffer and picks up the
bass when you open the screen it's fine
but not as good as a Dell and I was
talking about form and design between
these two machines and they look quite
different so let us know what you prefer
I definitely love the Dell more because
of this beautiful red body which is
quite loud but it's not obnoxious in any
way with very nice smooth and rubbery
surface with these great accents in the
back that manages to hide finger marks
very well the ventilation ports at the
rear are pretty awesome-looking with
nice grill design in the front as well
and overall it's one of the prettiest
gaming notebooks around that is a mix of
gaming and business casual it is also
available in black by the way the
interior is matte black that requires a
little bit of cleaning after handling
but the surface finish here is cohesive
with the overall exterior design the AC
on the other hand feels more
traditionally gaming with design with
minor red accents on the lid and with
this brushed plastic which looks okay
but it's graduates easily and it also
picks up finger marks so you got to
clean that often the exhaust vents are
styled to complement a more angular
structure of the whole body and I
actually don't mind the full appearance
it looks gay Marie but preserved you
know a little bit simple - when it comes
to upgradability the Dell is extremely
simple one screw on the panel to access
the bottom where you have to Ram slots
one and two slots and one empty two and
a half inch slot that you can upgrade
right away from more storage capacity
it's not the most space efficient layout
as you can see but it works very well
and I love how you can access without
voiding your warranty I'm grading the
Acer on the other hand you have to
remove 14 screws that is 13 to many in
order to access the dual Ram slots and
the m-dot two drives so basically it is
all the same thing as on the Dell but
here you need to request the two and a
half inch bracket and the cable from
Acer in order to add your own storage in
this blanket of empty space it's
inconvenient but it's free of charge I
will leave a link in description for
that request page but it's good that ASA
recognized the air and are compensating
it with this free bracket both keyboards
are backlit with red illumination and
the slightly deeper body on the Dell
gives a more comfortable typing
experience with smoother edges while
it's still good on the Acer but the
edges are a little bit sharper the
keyboard differences however are pretty
significant despite having a similar
thickness profile the Acer keyboard
lights off the walls area better have
excellent travel distance and just feel
awesome when the keys bottomed out for
example there's slight softness that
feels really satisfying when typing fast
the Dell keyboard in comparison is so
disappointing with less travel distance
the activation point seems to vary
between the keys and the transparent
nature of the red lettering on the keys
means poor visibility and I mean really
poor in well-lit spaces the Acer
keyboards wins major points here the
trackpad on the V x-15 is also better
with smoother surface feels very much
like glass but the built-in buttons are
not so good to use the Dell trackpad on
the other hand has dedicated buttons
which are great but the surface doesn't
have a nice texture for precise
movements you win some and you lose some
apparently poor selection is decent on
both machines with SD card reader
headphone / Mike combo jack three years
B ports Ethernet and HDMI plus the Acer
has a USB type-c gen one port that is
super convenient and impressive on an
$800 machine the speaker placement is
different here bass is not very evident
on either but the Dell is louder and
offers better projection with cleaner
detail let's have a listen
so let's now get into the bread and
butter the meat and potatoes of these
two notebooks gaming performance and
general benchmarks now we know that Dell
has a better GPU but how does that
impact frame rates and the general
productivity aspect so let's get into
that so first for CPU tests all of these
are basically identical because they
should be they're using the same CPU
very respectable results on a notebook
at this price point both SSDs also
perform in proximity of each other with
slightly better memory results on the
Dell machine but when we get into the
GPU benchmarks this is where that better
1050 Ti really shows the full potential
and the Dell notebook distances itself
quite far from Acer the difference in
performance is actually pretty
significant on these frame rates and on
average you get around 19 percent better
score in games on the Dell for only that
50 dollar premium temperatures on both
machines were also very comfortable
slightly harder on Acer but not by much
with much quieter operation though so
both machines have fantastic cooling
layout to not compromise on the
acoustics the battery life on the Dell
is significantly better for work
scenarios clocking over 4 hours thanks
to that larger battery and over an hour
for gaming which is not bad at all and
so for conclusion this comparison
between these two notebooks perfectly
highlights the nature of the current
notebook space as so many elements are
just inconsistent between brands but
both machines offer great value for
performance with many proper elements
like super easy upgrade ability on the
Dell find cooling on both the keyboard
is fantastic on the Acer the Inspiron
looks better the vxf team has better
default display and the 1050 TI is about
20% faster versus the GTX 1050
so both machines bring such a refresh to
the market because of that sub $850
price point and we're giving them the
harbor connects damn good value award
because 1080p highest settings gaming is
finally mainstream and achieved with
affordable machines we have exclusive
discounts for the Graham spectrum
keyboard by Tesoro it has new agile
switches low profile key caps and RGB
lighting user our promo codes for $20
off on amazon.com and $40 off for
Canadians and ncx comm per

is it for this comparison thanks much

to the camera by the Acer guys by the
age of Eric do you agree with uber let
me know in comments down below which all
