great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hardware canucks
and Corsair has really proven to us that
they are very eager to dominate the
enclosure market with the expansion of
affordable offerings so today we're take
a look at the graphite enclosure this is
the 230 T a mid tower with a splash of
color
priced at $90 for the orange and the
gray and $10 shaved for the standard
black this price point is definitely a
sweet spot for the mid-range builds and
Corsair is smart to recognize the
essential features that most users would
need and incorporate them into the 230 t
the color is an attractive option with
great coating without any signs of
peeling that might be just the way to
spice up your build this arrow-like side
window is awesome to reveal the
internals and the side panel is actually
just secured by a single thumb screw at
the back and removed by pulling the
panel forward I don't mind this process
plus the angular dent adds a bit of
character to the chassis
this is also seen up top to keep things
consistent where dual 120 and 140 ml or
fan mounts are available with small
rubber grommets for the fans but no dust
filter which I'm not surprised about and
I really hope courser starts to include
top dust filters on every single case
and not just the Obsidian line front
panel connections are basic with just 2
USB 3 ports audio jacks and PR buttons
that were very difficult to press on our
sample removing the front panel we have
a built-in mesh to catch the dust and to
intake fans included notice how they are
on a different plane sort of the top fan
mounted more forward so this means no
front water cooling options and take a
look at the back we have the standard
scene with an exhaust fan 7 PCI slots
and the removal dust filter for the
power supply plus an additional bottom
intake slot that is exposed to those
dust particles that Corsair loves so
much apparently and with power supplies
up to 180 millimeters both fan sizes are
supported in the bottom the 230 T stands
on these very tiny adhesive rubber feet
that do provide some level of stability
but even for $80 we would need to still
see proper case feet so coursers
internal frame hasn't changed all that
much as is actually pretty good
and even the accessory box included is
from the 200 our case that has an
identical frame with just a few things
changed on the 230 t so first of all the
drive cage is new they've gone ahead
with the completely tools approach with
four SSD slots
facing them on the board and four
standard mechanical slots there are
cutouts on the SSD cage to secure the
drives inside so that's considerate and
you can also appreciate the simplicity
of assembly but yeah we'll have to work
around the cabling for those SSDs
especially since they're facing inside
the spacing between each slot isn't much
so populating both top and bottom was a
bit problematic in our scenario plus the
entire cage goes as high as the bottom
four PCI slots so GPU clearance will be
limited to about 11 inches
due to SATA cables for those bottom
expansion slots and plenty of clearance
for the top three PCI slots Plus this
opening will allow direct pooling for
the GPU and the rest of your components
now for $80 I was expecting to see
rubber grommets on the cutouts and also
build quality on the frame is not
impressive with a lot of flex and
everything is riveted and yes this is
$80 case so we aren't expecting to see
outstanding construction but the coarser
quality has definitely seen degradation
over time
now on a good note coarser has made sure
to pre install motherboard standoffs and
all black cables so that's very much
appreciated coming around to the back
there's plenty of room for cable
management plus you can tuck the cables
at this bottom sleeve and there are some
cable time outs also strangely none in
the center so I would definitely like to
see that changed and with the build
assembled those SATA cables definitely
need some cleaning work but in the end
the 230 key can handle perfectly well a
mid-range system with long GPU and
overall clean routing there isn't that
much room up top for a water cooler but
the 120 millimeter holes are offset
closer to the windowed side panel to
avoid
issues with any of the cabling
especially that a thin CPU cable all the
routing in the back looks like it should
and Corsa has always been great with
making sure there's enough room to work
with and closing the side panel the 230
t looks pretty great and the orange
color scheme makes for one unique piece
within your computer space so now the
things that we liked are the totally
tools approach towards Drive mounts both
SSDs and mechanical drives excellent
paint job without any orange scuffs on
the black portions on the frame and both
front fans are included so airflow out
of the box should be sufficient however
the lack of rubber grommets missing top
and bottom dust filters poor frame
quality that feels really bendy and the
somewhat awkward wiring for those SSDs
with tight spacing between them are just
a few things that we're starting to see
more and more from coarser and what the
230 T is not a bad case for someone
wanting something basic and perhaps you
have the almost $100 to spare it would
have been a totally killer chassis if
they brought back the features the date
themselves sometimes ago were at the
forefront of pushing within the
enclosure market like excellent build
quality rubber grommets and unique
features but how do you feel about the
230 t and its drawbacks let us know in
