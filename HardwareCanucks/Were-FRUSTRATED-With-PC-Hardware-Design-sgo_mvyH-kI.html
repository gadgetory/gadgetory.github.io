let's talk about the topic that's been
bugging me forever the color
coordination of components is absolutely
terrible so if you want to approach a
build with a particular color theme in
mind you potentially might go the route
of like just sticking to RGB lighting
because that might be an easier route to
get like a satisfying look from your
components because trying to color match
your hardware your graphics card with
the motherboard with the memory with the
cooler you know it is all over the place
color wise although the same can be said
about RGB implementation you can watch
our discussion on it here but am I the
only one frustrated with this stuff
especially when you want to build
something beautiful that reflects your
color coordination and strategy so it's
like a beautiful piece of art that's not
only functional but also looks nice and
reflects what you're all about hardware
wise so let's discuss more on that after
this the new master liquid ml ai a
liquid coolers from Coolermaster come in
both 120 and 240 millimeter variants now
with addressable RGB LEDs both the fans
and the pump that can be controlled via
this hub with options to adjust the
lighting effects and speed along with
the ability to control them through the
respective motherboard software check
out the ML 120 and ML 240 ra iOS down
below now so this whole dissatisfaction
began with my original skylight system
where the motherboard at the time had
this little tiny orange LED strip that
was supposed to highlight the audio
components and that little tiny LED
strip literally dictated my color scheme
that is ridiculous
I later swapped out the motherboard for
the asus motherboard that had this tiny
red triangle that also dictated how I
went about my color scheme with black
and red and then I added the purple
lighting I had blue on the SSD and green
on the graphics card so it was all over
the place and one of the comments was
just saying that the color clash is just
insane and I agree my next build was x
99 that had a white and blue motherboard
so obviously that dictated what color
scheme I was going for next I added
white LED fans and white LED memory
modules that were not synced up color
wise
or they're both from Corsair but they
look different and just the whole thing
was kind of a mess in terms of color
coordination so the whole thing looked
totally mismatched and I just said
whatever I'm going full black color
scheme you know dark black matte
motherboard components and CPU cooler
because I just didn't want to deal with
that color coordination mess that was
there before and yes that I achieved
with my Rison system it was matte black
was beautiful no color accents anywhere
those were the good times
ohyeah but then I decided to do a white
themed build what a mistake that was
which was the whole inspiration behind
this video so I got the NZXT n7
motherboard in white the VM EP Co 11
dynamic and white the galaxy gtx 1070 TI
sniper white the Corsair Vengeance white
Ram and I even wanted to use the Vardar
ek white fans for my radiator but I
stopped as soon as all the components
were kind of like in proximity of each
other you realize just how mismatched
they are in color and all together they
would look absolutely terrible some are
cooler whites I'm a warmer white and
just that's not the way to go when
you're trying to build something around
a particular color theme so the keys for
example is this cool white the
motherboard is more of an eggshell white
although it does match their white cases
so that's good
the galaxy card looks like it's been
sitting in a smoke room despite having
this pure white shroud in pictures and
seriously the galaxy card looks pretty
bad in the real life that is it right
there it's yellow where's the white it
is yellow and the more components I
received over time that had some white
elements the more I realized just how
difficult it is to build a colored
unified system especially in this whole
white space because they're all
mismatched nothing just links you know
they definitely look off and they don't
look good together so my Z 370 asus
motherboard is gorgeous with this cool
white black and aluminum pieces but it
still does not match any of my white
cases and even this g.skill memory with
a bit of white on the heatsink is still
slightly off now many people will not
care about color coordination for your
components that's totally fine you know
potentially have a black and red
GPU like my sapphire pulse Vega 56 my
first Vega Kurt thank you very much
inside a totally white system with the
white motherboard and white case you
know it's it's hardware it's there to be
functional but the visual element I
would say is secondary to many people
for example I'll be using naktu as
latest fans in my airflow system coming
up I don't care what they look like and
there is no hardware that you can match
with those fans because of that color
scheme that is so unique it's good for
product recognition it's not good for
visual representation if you're trying
to color match but for functionality the
visuals on the Noctua side are obviously
secondary but what about the other camp
who want to satisfy that color h and
potentially want the GPU shroud that
matches their motherboard and have that
color uniformity and coordination so I
have two solutions to throw into that
paint bucket so for the first one the
white interiors of a case reflect RGB
lighting beautifully so if you have any
other white Hardware inside the system
it will bounce to light equally and hide
those imperfections in the color
mismatch so that is one solution but
number two is a bit more technical and
that for each product that is whatever
color for the brand or the manufacturer
to actually give us the color value or
the hex code values for those colors so
you can look it up and actually see what
the real color is instead of just seeing
marketing images that are most likely
not true to life so for this Galax card
I was not expecting it to be so smokey
white and if I had the color value I
could look it up I could potentially
color match to other hardware that I'm
buying
so like the corsair cases are more
similar to the NZXT stuff while the
Leanne Lee is more cooler white the in
one case here is bit more in this in the
center it's more like pure white that
matches my desk and so having that code
value will not only give us a bit more
transparency from the brand to the
consumer but also allow you to plan your
build accordingly without the hardware
it would also definitely eliminate any
surprises like you're opening up the
NZXT motherboard and seeing that it's
also a little bit more Excel white and
not
white like you see on their website and
so I would love to hear any solutions
that you might have for this whole color
coordination dilemma in this PC space so
if you have anything any suggestions
leave them in the comments below join
the wireless club with Corsairs new dark
core Mouse play the way you want with
nine programmable buttons aligned in the
comfortable shape and fantastic sensor
you can trust and crazy-good wireless
performance + qi wireless charging
built-in focus on the game the dark core
will do the rest
so i'm going to leave this conversation
going because I feel like friends need
to hear that this is some form of a
dilemma that I hope will not just grow
out of proportions and we can contain
what type of colors we see from hardware
and maybe potentially some form of
collaboration between partners so that
if you buy a corsair enclosure and a
galaxy pu that are both white you have
some form of you know communication
there and they're not totally mismatched
and in that space so that would be the
future that i would love to see but yeah
let me know to think on this whole topic
check out this other relevant content
and we'll see you next video make sure
to check out our new boot sequence
