canucks and last month we've teamed up
with pc / to do a massive giveaway as a
thank you to our subscribers to our
viewers to continue to support us to
continue to watch our content and
allowing us to hit that milestone of
150,000 subscribers so upon the giveaway
closing on marks 30 first we draw three
random winners from all the comments
based on our comments on our video on
based on all the comments on PC purse
video and we contacted winners through
YouTube messaging app and google
hangouts and we also try to reach out on
people through Twitter if they had
anything that linked was linked to their
Google+ account and unfortunately we had
not heard back from those three people
so we continue to redraw the winners for
these prizes at 48 in 48 hour intervals
and pc / contacted no less than 15
people to take this hardware away from
us now out of those 15 people only two
people responded please people check
your messages for future giveaways like
this one of those persons was not within
the US and Canada region therefore it
was not deemed a valid entry but we only
have one winner that has claimed the
grand prize that means we have two other
prize packs that we are still that are
still up for grabs and instead of
reaching out to people through the
YouTube messaging app that apparently
people are not checking and Google
Hangouts will be doing this slightly
differently and using gleamed IO page
that allows direct communication with
the winners that are chosen so apologies
for this repost however we still have so
much hardware to give away and we would
appreciate that you take it away from us
and please understand that we did
everything in our powers to get in
contact with the winners that we've
chosen previously but unfortunately
that's the situation that we found
ourselves in so the gleam that I Oh page
is linked right in the description below
for that you don't have to do any
commenting or anything like that you
still have to be subscribed to pc / and
hardware canucks and the the page at the
gleam dot io will verify that you are
subscribed
and then you just input your name and
your email address so that we can
contact you so you can take this
Hardware away from us so the two price
packs that are still up for grabs are
the following so the first prize is the
EVGA gtx 960 a CX two point O GPU asus
maximus seven formula motherboard asus

terabyte SSD fantex cooler and a few
fans the second prize is the EVGA gtx
960 a CX to point no GPU and the asus
