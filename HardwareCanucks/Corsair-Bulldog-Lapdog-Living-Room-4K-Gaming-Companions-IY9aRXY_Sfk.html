possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX without them we wouldn't be
here companies are realizing that 4k
gaming fourth living room is a hot
market one that comes with plenty of
challenges to build a perfect and silent
4k companion back at Computex we took a
look at Corsairs bulldog which has now
been refined and ready for retail this
would be a totally new category for
Corsair and could prove risky the DIY
version of the Bulldog costs four
hundred dollars and for that you get the
chassis itself a 600 watt SFX power
supply a Hydra series h5 small 4 factor
liquid CPU cooler which is an attractive
and very slim solution that we hope will
be integrated into more slim tower like
cases the last piece of the kit is a
z170 mini ITX motherboard so the user
will be left to populate the rest of the
hardware and as mentioned earlier
combining a liquid-cooled CPU and GPU
inside the Bulldog will contribute to
good temperatures but more importantly
delivers quite acoustics as well the
shape of the case is an unusual choice
because even though it's targeted for
gamers
it'll be on display in your living room
so we would have preferred something
less edgy but perhaps this is one of the
strategies in attracting the right
target audience to complement the
Bulldog Corsair has also announced a lab
dog which is a keyboard dock and a 7 by
11 inch mouse mat which has plenty of
surface area for a comfortable movement
the memory form underneath is very
comfortable and it would last you well
enough for longer gaming sessions the
standalone station is set to be priced
at $90 and the complete set with the
keyboard with money around $200 the only
weird thing of this combination is
needing to keep the lap dog balanced
flat as otherwise any angle would tip
the mouse and you'll have to hold a
mouse in place instead of resting it in
place the Bulldog and the lap dog are in
their final stages and we think it would
complement the shift towards living room
gaming but we would love a more elegant
and sleek exterior shell for the Bulldog
to appeal to a different demographic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
