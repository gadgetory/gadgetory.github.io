Corsair this is unlike anything we've
gotten our hands on so it should be
pretty interesting to see what this new
air 540 can do now the name is sort of
the giveaway of the focus of the case
and that's obviously airflow released at
$139 many will find this appropriately
priced given this a score sir but let's
first analyze that how well this case is
designed before jumping to any
conclusions
so this cube case utilizes this dual
chamber design where components that do
not require active cooling are moved to
the back so your SSDs power supply that
can cool itself and of course optical
drives leaving more room in the actively
cool chamber I think that side panel
window is very much needed for such an
interesting case as you'll most likely
want to show off what you've done with
the internals the side panels do not
impress us and it's surprising to see
such poor quality on such a premium
product the rest of the construction is
mainly steel with plastic front and top
panels that are slightly rubberized to
give off quality feel to the touch
due to unconventional layout to optical
base have been rotated with front panel
connectors right underneath with a pair
of USB 3 ports chrome-plated audio jacks
and your power and reset buttons the
case is elevated with large rubberized
feet for scratch-free floors and provide
stability for such a wide case now
looking in the back extra venting is
located at the top followed by exhaust
fan and eight PCI expansion slots the
side chamber is where you install your
power supply and there's some additional
venting holes to the top the power
supply is rotated so you'll be pulling
air from the side but notice there's no
dust filter and I think this is the
first case we've seen from Corsair that
does not include a power supply dust
filter and then such a high price tag
that's unacceptable removing both mesh
panels is really simple this gives you
access to your fans and to the magnetic
dust filter for your main intake there's
no dust filter for the top panel and
even though I'll most likely be used for
exhaust it's disappointing to see the
air 540 being short on to dust filters
on the bright side however a total of
three
140mm your friends are included with two
in the front and one in the back so are
pretty decent pooling configuration at
its default state now the front supports
triple 120-millimeter fans as well
making the air 540 a very good candidate
for air cooling now let's check out how
this dual chamber design is executed
first thing we notice is clearance no
more drive cages hogging the airflow the
two front fans delivered direct cooling
to all your components and that's the
selling point of the air 540 to 3.5 inch
drive caddies are kept at the bottom
with some opening right underneath for
the drives to breathe and these are also
hot swappable drives which makes future
upkeep very convenient both the front
and top support 240 and 280 millimeter
radiators and even the 360 millimetre
rad can be installed in the front now we
have over three and a half inches of
clearance at the top for a push and pull
radiator setup and fourteen and a half
inches of horizontal clearance so you
can still install a radiator as long as
your GPU allows now looking in the back
the optical drive cage used to last
melting very welcome sight here and the
entire cage can also be removed if
needed
now the power supply sits on the
platform which you can adjust in length
with maximum supported units of 200
millimeters this provides extra security
that your power supply won't be moving
around during shipping now on top of
your power supply sets the SSD cage
which is completely to us and very
convenient to work with it supports up
to 4 as these with now appropriate
spacing added for right angled SATA and
your power cables
so fully assembled we get an idea of the
type of airflow you can expect front
fans blow directly over your graphics
card memory and the CPU area making this
ideal for air coat systems however water
cooling is also sort of the main selling
point here as large rubber grommets
allow tubing to pass through into the
other chamber however coming around to
the back since all your cables are
concentrated into one spot it might be
difficult finding room to mount your
pump or the reservoir also do obey
reservoirs will not be compatible as the
optical drive gauge is rotated so it
might be very tricky refilling your
reservoir also the rear chamber is not
designed all that efficiently as there
is unused room above the SSD cage that
could potentially house additional 3.5
inch drives so in reality only the
all-in-all water cooling systems will
work with the air 540 with potential for
a real water cooling loop only if user
modified so to sum things up the air 540
utilizes a dual chamber designed for
more direct airflow for all your
actively cooled components and it does
that very well with the front intake and
plenty of exhaust the entire assembly is
pretty much a breeze with toolless SSD
caged and hot swappable 3.5 inch drives
plus you don't even have to worry about
cable management as that is out of sight
out of mind
now on the flip side of the coin no dust
filter for your power supply north to
the top panel and on the market where
even $35 cases have power supply filters
it's a big question mark while the dual
chamber works very well I feel the rear
chamber is not optimized and could
potentially include more drive storage
and lastly both side panels are quite
flimsy and while we know the windowed
panel is mostly acrylic thicker steel
would make us happier in that regard
especially for such a price tag so
Corsairs additions to the combat series
with the air 540 leaves much to be
desired from future revisions but until
then users are going to have to be
satisfied with its air flow capabilities
as long as you can live with its
limitations so thanks guys for watching
let us know what you think of the air
540 and exactly how you'd optimize the
rear chamber to be more effective leave
