Computex the GTX 1080 Strix is out we
know all about it
so let's talk about that down huge
thanks to our Computex sponsors for
sending us out here shoutout to Nvidia
fantex
and cix and msi one of the most
important things we found out about the
gtx 1080 here is that the MSRP is
actually lower than the founders Edition
imagine that that's so awesome
so it features a metal shroud so unlike
the previous Strix editions which were
all red or some derivative of red here
it's a black shroud with RGB accents
which means we have a fool or a lighting
control a suit is known for that and
you'll be able to come up with a
cohesive lighting solution through your
you know or a motherboard and the RGB
logo on the back plate of the card and
on the front shroud speaking of the
shroud it is metal we have five heat
pipes underneath there which four of
them are eight millimeter one of them is
six millimeter so dr.xu three cooling
solution with triple 92 millimeter fans
we have dual four pin connections in the
back of the card which you can connect
two systems for so this will be
controlled by the GPU temperatures which
is awesome so you allows you to connect
two fans inside your case that are going
to be dedicated for GPU cooling and
that's awesome for power we have six
plus eight pins and eight plus two power
phase we have dual HDMI and dual display
port and the DVI to HDMI is awesome
because we are applications you can run
one VR headset and one HDMI monitor
without compromising on any of the ports
one of the surprising things we found
out is the overclock mode which was
right on our paper so the overclock mode
is 1936 megahertz and the game mode is
1898 which is awesome because usually we
ask them about clock speeds and
everything like that and there's zero
information from all the vendors it's
awesome to see that the the Strix
Edition is we have the actual overclock
megahertz
moving on a very cool project they're
showing off here today is the RG Avalon
the first thing that when I saw it to
remind me of project Christine a couple
years ago from Razer the whole module
aspect of removing parts everything is
sort of proprietary and modular so that
you can configure your PC just the way
you want it so this one is in a similar
category of modularity and then the open
ecosystem they tell us so that there is
the zero wires everything is connected
with PCI Express Lanes so the whole idea
about this project is to begin the
conversation do you like this modular
cable-less design it may attract a
specific audience and you know maybe
perhaps increase the DIY market I'm not
sure how people feel about this
proprietary case design also proprietary
motherboard design which is motherboard
sort of built in on top of the frame but
we are told maybe we'll see more SKUs
for a gaming edition or a workstation
edition case wise and motherboard wise
as well
there is unrestricted access to the card
on the left side the case there's
modular IO with MDOT 2 in there so
potentially we can see higher-end audio
components if you want to see that the
back of the O is modular for different
uses not exactly sure how the lower end
like the for USB and like just simple
audio jacks would would fare well if
you're going towards the modular out
aren't you supposed to be targeting the
enthusiast community and not really the
lower and stuff I don't know we are told
that engineering of these single modules
is much easier than the full motherboard
and that's that gives us a little bit of
hope that potentially will see a wide a
range of different il ports so that you
can choose what you want without
compromising on the cost the whole idea
here would be to find that perfect
gradient between modularity and cost and
also flexibility without compromising on
sort of usability and expansion in the
future it does use an SFX power supply
and we have two 120mm fans on the right
side but it's not without issues so we
have no tol CPU tower support because
the top frame is very short so you won't
be able to attach anything longer than
this very low-profile cooler and if you
have any cooler that uses a backplate
you can't
the back of the motherboard so no
coolers they require backplate support
right now no SLI support of course that
is discussed to expand in the future but
I'm sure that will be determined by the
initial interest in this idea in the
first place and we only have two and a
half inch drive support at the front
which is awesome you can take them out
and stuff but where is our three and a
half inch drive
I guess if they're talking about the
workstation stuff perhaps we'll see an
expanded bracket
maybe hot swappable they'll be lovely I
think the biggest thing it comes down to
is if you were to go the module route
for a lower-end system why not go for
something that's already established I'm
sure that going the modular approach
will be a lot more expensive then in
reality this concept is awesome but not
seeing the full execution and full
potential what is available is
disappointing because on paper any
concept in terms of modularity and how
flexible it is sounds awesome but if we
don't see the tangible sort of support
behind it it's just gonna fail this
whole concept is being approached from
an open ecosystem perspective which I
don't think is truly correct since a
suits will be the one providing the
board and all their little modular
pieces so you as an end-user will be
able to just substitute the GPU the RAM
the CPU the the drives and the power
supply and the fans but the board itself
the foundation of your PC will be locked
to a sous Romeo to buy like modules from
gigabyte or MSI and all that stuff so it
doesn't really make it truly an open
ecosystem but at least they're
approaching it from the modular aspect
fully capable as system and I think
that's pretty cool so unlike the project
Christine a couple years ago that was a
very ambitious project five to ten years
ahead of us
ahead of its time whereas this one we're
told the Avalon is more of a two-year
project so hopefully in two years
Computex 2018 will see a belong fully in
development day one feedback is super
important here leave your comments down
below become a keyboard warrior as I've
said in the past throwing all types of
suggestions I'm sure they will love it
bad the good and the extremes guys I'm
Dimitri with Huracan axe thanks so much
for watching and we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
