oMG I am so on time supposed to be here
at 9:00
it is 901 plus check out this view
alright so I'm back at fantex because
they are launching a new sub brand of
Fanta called metal gear metallic gear
metallic you metallic gear
how do you say metallic gear by the way
this is boon he's the lead designer for
fantex so all the love that the evolve X
has been received it's because of this
guy so he's also be able to be over
looking in the metallic gear design
direction so yeah this should be good so
yeah I'm really excited about the
roadmap you guys are going to love what
we're going to do because so the new
lineups are neo and neo G let's check
them out uber presence I'll get a new
your president yeah kami okay alright so
the three cases we have on display today
are the Neo the Neo micro and the Neo
mini they all have the same exterior
design language with aluminum front and
top panels elegant curvature on the
corners is simple power button and
recent buttons up top and some former
blackout pattern on the glass side
panels does filtration for the bottom
and front is present and the black and
silver color schemes are pretty standard
it's not a loud case and we even get an
RGB LED firing down below the front
panel I do like how consistent this
whole lineup is but let me know what you
think of the design so let's start with
the Neill it is an ATX enclosure it
comes with two fans and it's priced at
$99 which is the top ceiling for their
pricing structure since the plan is to
really go down in price and to like
trickle down all those features from
this like premium lineup into something
a little bit more value oriented the
power supply shroud is exposed so you
can see the power supply and the hard
drive cage underneath but we do have
that nice chamber separation weather to
eighty millimeter radiator support at
the front with only silent elation
available on both sides so this isn't
per to
for super high airflow ei TX motherboard
compatibility is present and I do like
the super easy cable management section
with this cover and this deeper area at
the front and for storage we have two
SSD brackets and a dual drive cage at
the bottom moving on to the next
enclosure is the Neo micro so this one's
a micro ATX enclosure it's only a tiny
bit shorter versus the ATX model it
comes with one fan and it's priced at 84
dollars and I always appreciate more
micro text options in the market and
having fantasy influenced will
definitely help metallic gear in this
space I like the dual SSD caddies on the
power supply shroud for that showcase of
your drives keel management should be
easy with velcro straps up top and this
large front gap and lastly closing the
size loop for this new Neil lineup we
have the Neo mini which actually is the
case that I'm most excited about so it
is an ITX frame for 69 bucks there's
actually quite capable and despite the
larger size it's a nice balance between
hardware support and user friendly
assembly so ATX power supplies are
supported up top
along with thirteen and a half inch GPUs
cooling is adequate as well we have the
front and the rear mounts plus the side
fan exhaust for dual 120mm fans so if
you want to have that area for exhaust
that's an option with appropriate
exhaust ventilation on the rear side
panel or you can cover it up with these
like black or silver panels and use it
for drive capacity at the back the
bottom is fully ventilated for the GPU
to breathe but the many G version of
this case comes equipped with the
vertical GPU mount and double glass side
panels for that showcase PC and because
the vertical orientation for those PCI
slots we have four of those so you could
potentially mount more than one graphics
card and overall I like the simplicity
of this new neo lineup and I'm excited
to see how far they can bring down the
price without eliminating too many
features to really you know meet those
like $39 price points and I think the
new lineup is going to be quite popular
in the future and the only thing to
think about right now is almost like
competition between metallic gear and
fantex because fantex has current lineup
you know under $80 is fantastic
so it's almost competing together of
course they are almost targeting
different
markets with you know fantex being on
the performance side while metallic gear
from the visual aesthetics is totally
different so that's you know also
catering to different user alright guys
so what do you think of this whole neo
lineup and fantex is a direction to
branch out into this new brand to design
cost-effective
chass√© ease that will eventually trickle
down into the $40.00 territory
that is the goal and I think we
definitely need to have more of those
value oriented cases in the space
because from the looks of it I think
when we started with a good quality
frame trickling it down to something a
little bit more budget-friendly is going
to be awesome
all right guys some three tree boon is
over here with me and we'll see you in
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
