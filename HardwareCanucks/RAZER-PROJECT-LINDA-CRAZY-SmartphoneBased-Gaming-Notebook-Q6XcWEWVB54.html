razor is on the horizon look who we
found a friend of Frank P say hello to
the audience what's going on guys we got
Eber here and giving us the smiles and
the very front I'm just gonna give you
the handshake mysterious Mike
so we are here at Razer just walked in
and look who we found oh it's our boy
Austin hey guys this is Austin oh you
did that for us awesome thank you nice
to see you got a beautiful lighting set
up kind of like what we do all right I'm
gonna I'm gonna just stop so you can do
your thing now
so every year Razer has some really cool
things to show and this time is no
different we've got the project Linda
hopefully this one doesn't get stolen
and this show coverage is brought to you
by fan tech schoolmaster and Corsair so
it's a thin and light gaming and
productivity notebook that actually
integrates razors amazing new android
smartphone in a very unique way while
companies like Samsung and LG have tried
smartphone / notebook hybrids before
this feels like one of the first times
someone has got it right and like with
many of razors other projects this one
is simply a proof of concept but I
wouldn't be surprised to see it in
production very soon it really does feel
almost complete basically what the razor
has done this create that clean 13.3
inch notebook that acts as a dock for
their newest smartphone the chassis is
built from unibody cnc aluminum and is
really thin to adjust 15 millimeters and
it weighs under 3 pounds when the phone
is docked the screen is pretty
impressive too since it has a quad HD
non-touchscreen
120 hertz refresh rate so 120 hertz
refresh it is really nice to see there's
also 200 gigabytes of internal storage
built in 3.5 millimeter audio jack USB a
port and a USB C charging port the
speakers on this entire contraption
actually from the razor phone and you
can also switch between what selfie
camera use but the most interesting part
about this notebook is what happens when
the razor phone is added since without
it the dock is basically just a
paperweight
so the smartphone sits where the
trackpad normally would and it's locked
with this extremely satisfying mounting
mechanism that could potentially also be
a common point of failure so it can
either act as a touchpad or a second
screen if you choose to either plug-in
the mouse or use the main screen for
interaction its Snapdragon 835 and eight
years of RAM ensures basically awesome
performance regardless of whether your
gaming
or using regular productivity apps right
now the Linda concept features a 53.6
what our internal battery which can
actually charge the docked phone to full
capacity over three times while away
from the AC power and we weren't able to
test the full battery performance of
course but I would not be surprised to
see a notebook like this get over eight
hours of on-screen time and while
calling this a gaming notebook is a bit
of a stretch it's important to remember
that Android gaming ecosystem is
expanding at a rapid pace and not only
that but the mobile processors like the
835 are now capable of delivering some
amazing visuals at reasonable frame
rates - honestly guys I think project
Linda is super cool and also very
practical for on-the-go mobile users who
want a bit more from their expensive
smartphones unfortunately it cannot run
Windows applications but Razer has shown
that creating a well-integrated
smartphone / notebook Hybrid can be done
without a feeling incomplete provided
the combined cost of the phone and dock
don't exceed the price of like an apple
or a windows-based thinner like platform
I can see it being pretty successful and
so we actually used it for a while and
really does feel like it's ready for
production right now the full-size
keyboard was spacious the keys felt good
and using the smartphone as a second
screen and that I'm being pretty helpful
to many applications
I still cannot find many android games
that I'd want to play on a regular basis
but I've actually used project Lynda as
an adaptive script writing machine that
saves on some weight and long trips and
that 200 gigabytes of internal storage
would also come in handy when on
vacation and photos need to be backed up
okay guys so the project Linda is quite
the unique as is Austin Evans behind the
screen but project Linda from Razer
certainly a unique thing no pricing
availability but as soon as this comes
out I think this be very popular
approach towards having a smartphone and
a larger enclosure to expand your
experience with this beautiful set of
speakers and I'm wondering there is no
webcam actually there is a webcam here
damn it but it'd be cool if they could
implement something so that you could
see something from this one too but yeah
subscribe for more content thank you so
much pasta or your appearance and we'll
see you and more
his courage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
