christmas is on though according to the
Sears Christmas catalog every suit back
in August I am about four months too
late anyways you've probably noticed the
regular case videos it kind of slowed
down before the holiday season we do
have a few more plans but for now we're
going to be taking a look at this little
segment and what we have in front of me
basically what it is is we want to make
sure that you have the right stuff on
your holiday list if you're planning to
do say a computer build or upgrade or
you want to give your family some ideas
now if you aren't familiar with the
retailer ncx calm please be sure to
check them out because they have been
kind enough to help make this little
segment possible so here's what sit in
front of me I have a few things that I
have scoped out for myself we have the
logitech g19 keyboard and the western
digital TV live so we're gonna take a
look at the G 19 first and make sure
that it is something worth purchasing
alright so I know some of you are
probably saying all the g19 it's so it's
so gimmicky with its LCD screen and it's
overpriced well you know what if there's
going to be my first keyboard in about
four years now I want to make sure I I
do it right so I really don't need to
show you the box though I do kind of
like their little tagline here stay
informed while you game so great you're
going to be running CNN titles while I
am fragging somebody and left for dead
anyways what we have is start off with
the with the keyboard it's completely
black and it does have the sort of what
sets it apart is this little LCD screen
up on top if you've seen the g15 or the
g11 I don't think the g11 comes with
screen the g15 on the other hand has a
screen as well but it is not full LCD we
have a sort of a power adapter here you
have the bottom wrist rest and
underneath it all we have just our
drivers it's pretty slim packaging but
that's a okay because all it is is a
keyboard here's the thing about
peripherals like a keyboard is a very
very personal thing so what is good for
somebody may not always be good for
somebody else but we're going to go over
the features and you can sort of decide
for yourself so the first thing I liked
about the Logitech keyboard is the fact
that it has the raised keys I've been
using like I said a microsoft keyboard
that has flushed keys i just find it
harder to type
not a big notebook sort of keyboard
style of guy so I just liked it it's
very easy to type on I find that the
keys are well separated and they have
enough click I guess you could say they
respond very well they're soft to the
touch and it just feels nice when you're
actually being able to type on it we
have 12 programmable keys on the side as
well as sort of three set keys I guess
you could call them so effectively you
have up to 36 programmable macro keys on
this keyboard you have the typical
keyboard layout including the number pad
on the side here then you have your
volume adjustment as well as your other
media keys mute button etc and then up
at the top there is all the LCD control
and of course the most prominent feature
on the unit is the LCD there alright so
here's the deal I'm going to be using a
laptop to test this keyboard out mainly
because I don't wanna have to set up my
whole computer up on the desk here
here's the thing that is a little
different with this keyboard it actually
is going to require a separate power
connector just to power that LCD we will
go over here and plug in the regular
power and we have our screen boot up
here and you will have to install the
logitech software onto the keyboard
beforehand I've already gone through
that is they're very very simple they
also give you the option to set up
profiles for your for popular games such
as World of Warcraft there is ventrilo
set up and I believe they even have
adobe acrobat alright so here's kind of
the hot deal with keyword is this LCD
screen it can show things such as your
basic you're basically date and time
stopwatch stuff now can actually show
videos on here which is pretty cool
under your my videos folder the other
cool thing can do is browse YouTube
because you always want to be on YouTube
let's take a look at the most popular
here what do we have that is exciting
and interesting and isn't going to get
me banned for copy protection anyway our
let's look at a game here a sports game
and you know what the colors aren't half
bad surprisingly the audio actually
plays out of your computer speakers so
you can adjust it from there football
game here and the viewing angle on it
isn't bad either I'm looking at it
straight on right now the camera is
slightly angled and it's surprisingly
good now it's a little small your
looking at a you know a
two-and-a-half-inch 3-inch LCD screen so
it's going to be a little difficult to
senior likely not going to be watching
something on here when you have a
computer monitor in front of you so that
feature is probably a little useless
unless you're a very good multitasker
you have a performance monitor which
will monitor CPU usage on your computer
you can browse pictures straight from
here and we're back here the other thing
you can do is it also has support for a
whole ton of popular games some of the
latest things you know it's going to be
able to show your ammo or your stats or
whatever and others are all sort of
extra things that when you actually
install the game and play it it will be
able to do so now here's the real deal
about it this keyboard retails for about
two hundred and twenty dollars now the
second generation g15 I believe it goes
for under 100 so you're paying quite the
premium in order to have this little LCD
is it worth it that's sort of a tough
one I really like this little LCD I
could see myself using it I tend to
multitask a bit you know watch youtube
videos while I'm playing games or
something up and just the ability to
have it is pretty cool you get the
functionality of the g-series keyboards
from Logitech with all of their macro
keys I love the feel of the keys they're
soft very easy to type on you know
that's not a mechanical keyboard in
terms of the response but they've done a
very good job with the with the rubber
style I believe it is and otherwise I
really don't have any complaints aside
from the price that you wind up paying
for the added extras so if the LCD is
something that you're into you think
you'd get a lot of use out of it or you
find it pretty gimmicky or you have
extra money and you want to impress your
friends it's a great little tool
otherwise something like the g15 or the
g11 is going to give you the same feel
on the same functionality aside from
maybe these little volume extras here
it's going to be the same sort of
experience without the higher cost so if
you're looking for a great keyboard
highly recommend so far the Logitech G
Series keyboards and the g 19 in
particular alright so I lied we're
actually taking a look at the western
digital TV live on Friday that's in a
couple of days so be sure to check back
