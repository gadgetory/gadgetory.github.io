NOx and welcome to another video in the
past we have done a few filming
tutorials giving you a few tips and
techniques of how our videos are
produced you know using the camera and
using gear and stuff like that but in
this episode we'll be talking about
post-production and what goes into
behind the editing process of it it
won't be super tactical but I will be
giving you guys the concepts and ideas
to take away from it so that you can
apply to your own workflow regardless if
you use the same Adobe CC 2016 suite or
not let's get started but first the
sponsor for this video video blocks comm
they have a ton of good quality footage
motion backgrounds and After Effects
templates for you to use which is very
well categorized you get a 7 day free
trial with 143 downloads if you use our
link to sign up everything is royalty
free to use in your future personal or
commercial projects alright so the first
thing that I'm going to talk to you
about is organization and backup
organization is important because it
improves efficiency and the satisfaction
of your workflow and backup is so that
you don't get stuck with lost data and
costly recovery and may potentially
fully lost information so the way I work
now is I have three vector 180 SSDs one
of them is dedicated for video projects
that are currently working on so all my
source information goes there my cache
to drive is the backup for the video
project so these are kind of kind of
linked together so anytime I'm working
on projects here they are sort of backed
up or cloned onto this drive so that I
have two spots in case any of them sort
of fails in my cache for vector 180 SSD
drive which is your for my scratch disks
and just adobe cache so this is the
video projects SSD this is where all the
current projects are happening I'll be
using NZXT monta as the example for this
video so we open that up and this is
where all the source files are located
but basically as soon as those files are
imported onto the SS
I copy that folder onto a separate SSD
which is you can see right here and in
case anything happens with this is the
number one everything is sort of still
backed up now once as soon as the review
is finished it's going to go into our
western digital my cloud mirror which is
an 8 terabyte raid 1 array basically
going to here go into this volume
harbour connects video backup which is
our archives going to my name and I
would cut the pool completed and 60
Montevideo into here so that I can
access leave access it later on if
needed without it occupying space on any
of my SSDs so this local area network
connected nass is very nice for
archiving stuff and I can access it
anytime I want all right the next thing
and we can talk about is templates and
you know once we're happy with folder
organization outside of the you know
video editing software we have to worry
about organization inside of it so first
I have sort of a created a template for
each single video review in which this
type of folder organization doesn't
change from video to video it maintains
the same so at my video list which is
all my b-roll it's kind of
self-explanatory you can see it here I
have another folder for on camera so if
I'm doing something on camera it's going
to go there because I record audio on an
external voice recorder so that when I
drop all those files in there I can
easily just align them too and know
where those files are because that's the
best thing you don't want be looking for
files you want to be working with files
extra footage is where I place anything
that I shoot extra after the review or
the initial b-roll thing is finished so
for example if I'm working with a you
know one video and I see all one shot is
missing I would shoot that shot and I
would put it in here so that I can sort
of navigate to the extra footage folder
in case I need to access later
music self-explanatory everything is
organized by genre very nice and easy
in case I want to have some common
background or hip-hop stuff
it's right over here titles is where
place my text easily so it's not like
just floating around anywhere here and
pre-rolls our pre-roll spots that I
would create would go here and can be
accessed easily in the future so coming
back to the idea of templates it's very
important to create this sort of you
know flow structure so like folder stuff
inside the video editing software so
that you follow the same structure for
all future videos now I want talk about
storyboarding storyboarding it's very
very efficient to do it inside premiere
and I do it inside my b-roll folder
because you can you know drag footage
around and you can place it in order
that you want to be you know the video
to flow the awesome thing is that you
can sort of scrub through the video in
order to see what's happening within the
frame and that's very important because
you can basically compile your entire
video structure before dropping it into
the timeline and something very
important for my Adobe friends here
let's enter another sequence here let's
say I want to select all my footage and
drop it into the timeline below me I
would do the following I would select
all the footage automate the sequence
once this pops up I would ignore audio
because we don't want any of the audio
files coming up here I would leave this
in this type of file format click OK and
it would insert all these files in the
way that I order them so all I have to
go do now is basically go in and cut
them out you know shorten them and trim
everything and work in this type of
workflow with footage already aligned in
the order that it would be in the final
review it's a big time-saver because
once you storyboard inside your video
list folder it allows you to basically
get in here and quickly cut it cut the
review without having to worry about the
placement and the order of each file
alright let's move on to a few workflow
tricks and tips that I can give you guys
everybody's asking me about the
adjustment layer and what the hell is it
and why it's there and what type of
things you have on it so the adjustment
layer applies any
that is applied to it for anything that
is underneath it so right now a few
adjustment layers because I wanted to
create different color effects for each
of these sequences inside the timeline
but right now this adjustment layer
spans the entire portion of the filmed
review video which is basically allows
me to color correct and make sure that
everything looks good and one single go
i do not touch that this adjustment
layer because i film with basically
exactly the same settings throughout the
you know every single video and
therefore i don't need to tweak it i do
have color adjustment applied to it so
just some toning stuff you know
increasing my contrast use some shadows
crushing the blacks a little bit I do
not touch the white balance because
that's saved in the camera inside the
creative I do add a bit of faded film
sharpening no touching of the shadow or
highlight hints don't touch the curves
either and I go into color wheels and I
bring up the highlights into the oranjee
portions a little bit and my mid-tones
into the blue and purples so that you
know you have a bit of a filmic look
where the black cannot exactly black but
there they have a bit of a bluish
purplish highlight tone to it so this is
with and without with and without so
that is it for my adjustment layer next
is I follow the audio cues so this is my
voiceover layer right below it I wrote
it and I recorded it and I pretty I have
a pretty good idea of what are we
talking about in the beginning and in
the end so this is a good representation
of when using a break let's see there's
that tiny break in the audio to
transition to another to another shot
BAM and there's another one where I talk
about something else and BAM hello
transition another little break here and
BAM obviously I don't use these breaks
as the only cue and when to cut the
video but it does help when I edit you
also want to be careful not to apply too
many transitions too many crossfade
transitions
too many hard cuts so this example of a
hard cut BAM see how there's no
transition
it just goes to another shot and this is
a transition of a crossfade so both
shots have a bit of motion in them bit
of rotation and motion and I thought it
was appropriate for this crossfade to
appear here and and you there's no rule
of thumb you know you just have to
follow what looks natural and what looks
the most balanced here's a little tip
when I type in wipe it brings up my wipe
transitions and this is the one I use
the most you notice that the transition
follows the same lines of the
composition of the video this is
important because you don't want to be
creating sort of a vertical transition
on something that maybe has a lot of
lines or circles obviously and not this
not in all situations but you have to be
aware of the composition of the
background track before applying a wipe
transition but the cool thing is you can
change the location of where the wipe is
coming from in the bottom from the angle
from which angle and it's cool to have
that transition then it works because we
have nice straight lines and you have to
look into what makes sense and what
looks natural next thing everybody's
asking about audio and what are the
levels like volume is not the same as
love okay volume is based on the
amplification of your source through
your headphones or your speakers
levels are these things so the actual
levels it's like a meter of what the
audio is actually like will be across
the board the rule of thumb for the
vocals is to be anywhere between minus 6
and minus 12 peaking you don't want it
to be like too harsh closer to 0 so
minus 6 and minus 12 for vocals while
the background track let me mute the
mute mute my vocals this is my audio
right now which is right here this will
mean the music in the background and
it's peaking around minus 24 between
minus 30 minus 24 so that gives you the
best balance between hearing your stuff
in the foreground so your vocals versus
having a nice soothing background music
in the background so that it's not
overpowering the vocals so though
- 6db for vocals and - 30 - 24 for the
background track and the last one is
work I use this all the time - just
stabilize the footage just a tiny bit
and giving it that extra level of
smoothness especially for shots where
I'm sliding and when I'm rotating so
this one is a little bit trickier to
achieve - to 100% perfection in camera
so that you apply a little bit of
stabilization in Premiere and it looks
beautiful very buttery smooth I have
actually created a preset so that when I
type in warp it's right there I drag it
and drop it onto the the footage and I
analyze it and I have a 30 and 30% for
smoothness and cropping less and the
last one is export settings ctrl M bring
up your export window so here I first
rename my stuff so I going to here I use
the first one as 4k as resolution NZXT
monta revision and revision is important
in case you have to do any changes you
know which video export is the latest
one if I'm doing anything with 1080p I
would type in 1080p and I would also put
in my framerate at 4k I don't do it
because it's an only 30p framerate for
me my 1080p 60 is a good representation
of the frame rate and resolution typing
the name of the project and then
revision number so afterwards I use the
exact same settings for every single
video in terms of resolution and it
matches my sequence settings in terms of
framerate I do a VBR one pass variable
bitrate one pass I don't do two passes
because that just takes extra time
double time actually 30 40 and maximum
render quality and maximum depth that's
the settings ma'am that's don't have
anything else in terms of what I change
these are the settings that I'm happy
with and I always make sure that my work
area is actually the one that I've want
to complete I don't change it in here
actually that is changed by setting my
in and out points for the review like
this
and like this so if we go back to export
and choose sequence in and out BAM so
the entire review will be rendered based
on those in and out points i would do q
and I use Adobe Media encoder simply
because while that's rendering out the
video I can still use Premiere you know
maybe compiling footage for the other
projects and stuff or something like
that
but we use CUDA acceleration because of
our NVIDIA GPUs and if you have an AMD
GPU you can also enable GPU acceleration
with OpenCL and if you don't well CPU
only and just as a reminder on how you
could potentially utilize video blocks
comm footage assets backgrounds and
After Effects compositions in your own
creative work I've compiled this little
composition on how I would personally
utilize those assets in a video
introduction to say my camera gear here
this
all right so I hope you guys enjoyed
this behind the scenes in the
post-production process I hope it was
helpful to you and for any video editors
watching maybe you can take away some of
the concepts to improve your own
workflow or if you have any ideas and
suggestions on how I can improve mine
leave them in the comments down below
and also a few things to take away from
this video
to recap organization important inside
the software and outside for data
management backup very important we
recently had our rain zero loss and you
know data wasn't backed up and
unfortunately we lost a lot of video
files and number three it's very
important that you create your own
templates templates are important to
streamline that video editing process so
you don't have to redo multiple things
that are already created that work best
for you so storyboarding inside the
software before you drop your video
footage onto the timeline for me ah the
Montevideo took me 45 minutes to edit
once the footage was dropped into the
timeline of course there's a lot of work
that goes into the preparation stage
before you actually start to cut think
of things inside the timeline like
storyboarding you know making sure that
the order is correct
what files goal goes after what the
voiceovers and the scripting stuff
obviously that goes into the preparation
stage as well but as long as you have
that streamline and you know what
process goes after what it will
drastically improve your productivity
when it comes to video editing so that
is it for the post-production editing
process I hope you guys enjoyed it I'm
Dimitri with harbor Canucks thanks so
much for watching we'll see you next
