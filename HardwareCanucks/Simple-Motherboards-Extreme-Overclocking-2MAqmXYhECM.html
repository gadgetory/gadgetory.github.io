CES was certainly an interesting one for
gigabyte not only we were shown their
rise in motherboards behind closed doors
make sure to check out that video but
there were also a ton of other products
on display too that were really cool and
we were immediately drawn to two
never-before-seen z2 70 motherboards and
one very unique graphics card the show
coverage is possible thanks to Nvidia
gigabyte fantex and NCIX
so let's start with an ITX form factor
and while many of you may be drawn
towards larger form factor motherboards
for their expanded feature sets
gigabytes upcoming z2 70 n gaming 5 may
be one of the best-looking mini ITX
motherboards we've seen in a long time
it has a simple yet effective black and
orange color scheme but what lies
beneath the surface is what will define
this board for its intended market it
was designed from the ground up for
overclocking enthusiasts so not only is
the bias supposed to hold a ton of
advanced options for people running
liquid nitrogen or ultra high and water
cooling stuff but there's also a 6 plus
- all digital PWM and memory slots that
support extreme memory speeds
since this board and the bias are not
complete yet a lot of its high-level
specifications like officially supported
memory frequencies are not known yet but
expect that information and the full
review coming soon of course there are
usual features like reinforced PCIe
slots USB 3.1 gen2 connectivity and an
integrated Wi-Fi module and the rear
mounted MDOT to slot the biggest
standout however for this little board
is its compatibility with gigabytes new
OC touch control panel the secondary PCB
connects to the gaming 5i TX via a
proprietary slot and when installed it
sits at a 90 degree angle to the board
itself it actually houses many what's
high-end overclocking functions normally
found on gigabytes larger super
overclocked motherboards but makes them
accessible on this very compact form
factor so it's crammed full of goodies
like six extra pwm fan headers buttons
for power reset CMOS reset and a battery
Clear button that will surely come in
handy
they're also manual hard-wired controls
for B clock tuning ratio selectors
gigabytes ocg R auto overclocking and
toggle switches for CPU mode among other
things
and finally along the bottom edge is a
massive selection of voltage readout
points unfortunately a pose
code readout seems to be missing here
and this is all powered by a molex power
connector and if you are looking for
high overclocks our of a small
motherboard it is very difficult to
think of anything else that would beat
this the other motherboard which really
caught our eyes was the Z 270x gaming
SOC or super overclocked this series has
an ongoing tradition for being one of
the best motherboards on the market for
extreme overclockers there are four PCIe
x16 slots - m dot two slots one of which
is Intel opting compatible and a few
other overclock and friendly features
like a postcode readout and an
integrated OC touch buttons you may also
have noticed there are two USB 3 ports
in an odd location right near the SATA
connectors and those are actually
perfect when using this board outside of
the case within a professional
overclocking environment this board is
also compatible with the OC touch panel
that we talked about earlier for
additional overclocking control another
interesting move for gigabyte was their
introduction of Oris branded products
outside of their traditional notebook
space the plan here is to position or is
branded motherboards graphics cards and
notebooks and peripherals also as their
premium offerings much like Asus has
done with their very successful Republic
of gamers lineup meanwhile their more
basic gaming series will loosely aligned
with the Asus Strix series and from what
we saw at CES the Auris motherboards
look really good with plenty of high-end
features and some interesting
capabilities too and expect the reviews
of all of them very very soon but there
is one more thing on display this is
gigabytes new Oris GPU which is based
upon gigabytes extreme design but
incorporates a few minor cosmetic
changes now I say new because the actual
graphics core and here is so new we
can't even tell you what it is let's
just say it will be launching from
Nvidia very soon and the positioning of
Voris as a premium high-end brand
matches perfectly with this course
target market it will certainly be an
interesting springtime at Harbour
Canucks offices so that's it from
gigabyte at CES 2017 and as we start to
wrap out our coverage stay tuned for
just a little bit more and I'll see you
in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
