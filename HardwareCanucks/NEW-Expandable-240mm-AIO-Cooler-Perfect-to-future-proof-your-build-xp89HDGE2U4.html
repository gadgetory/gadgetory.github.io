a fairly decent budget you probably
consider going for an all-in-one cooling
solution for your CPU there are so many
good ones out there but there's a new
kid on the block that you might want to
check out the z9 neo buys all the right
features on a budget with a large
windows side panel five included fans
and the excellent interior layout with
super simple cable management get it now
link in the description below this is
the Alpha cool Ice Bear 240 you guessed
it it's a 240 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooler and it's priced at $130
which I would say is very much in line
with the competition but there's a twist
to this unlike some other pre-built
coolers alpha cool is not only looking
towards high performance cooling but
also expandability with this AI oh
that's an interesting approach
considering the price if you recall our
last a i/o review was the predator 240
from ek water blocks and while it did
leave us with a solid impression on
performance there were some quirks
around installing that ginormous
radiator inside my PC check it out in
the link below also the price of $200
was a bit extreme even though it's
cooling potential was simply awesome the
ice bear 240 shouldn't have any of those
problems because for one its radiator is
only thirty millimeters thick and
installing the CPU block on an ex 79
board shouldn't cause any clearance
issues but I'll go in-depth about it
shortly the physical aspects of this
cooler are very simple you get a fairly
decent Icewind stock fans spinning at up
to 1,700 rpms and a custom water block
reservoir combination nothing too
different from the offerings from
corsair NZXT and a host of others the
Ice Bear doesn't use any aluminum
radiator yet instead it uses a copper
based next SAS unit which has been
painted in jet black to give it elbow
profile look looking at different angles
you can spot the copper sheen from the
fins inside alpha cool has implemented
their own 11 millimeter hf PVC tubing
for both its tight bend radius and its
UV stability it looks pretty good but
clear tubing would have been simplified
finding any air bubbles within the loop
the water block reservoir is huge and
features a clear window so finding and
removing those bubbles we are the full
is easy I would actually recommend
running this unit outside the case for a
few minutes while paying close attention
to the reservoir to spot any air bubbles
as the process of removing them would be
less stressful when the system is inside
the case the ice bear uses a DC LT pump
which is surprisingly quiet considering
it spins at 26,000 rpm what's even more
impressive is that this pump is capable
of pushing 70 litres of fluid per hour
with minimal pump head pressure this 3
pin pump backstopped by an actual
reservoir of coolant blows the doors off
any closed loop AIO on the marketplace
in my opinion remember how I talked
about the company approaching
expandability with the I spare 240 if
you notice there's a large quick
disconnect coupling within the tubing
this allows the user to add another
radiator reservoir or an entire second
loop like a GPU cooling solution this
eliminates the need to first drain and
refill the system expect a minor amount
of fluid and air leakage when you
disconnect and quickly connect the
coupler the installation process was an
interesting and very different
experience for me make sure you have the
instruction manual beside because I had
to refer to that a lot once you attach
the mounting bracket to the water block
move on to installing the itty-bitty
parts since I'm installing it on an x79
board I don't have to worry about the
we're supporting bracket as you can see
the screws have to go through the
springs and the washers have to be
attached to the other side of the
bracket getting everything in place is
also a lesson in futility since the
stick tubing tries its hardest to yank
the block out of its place it's a
tedious process at best and I think that
alpha goo
should have boards some of this process
from other brands my H 100 I was a lot
easier to install than this even with
the block being large you won't have to
worry about interference with the DIMMs
of any motherboard that supports the
Intel CPU sockets though I wouldn't
recommend you install the iceburg 240 in
a Mini ITX case make sure the mounting
holds inside your case supports 15
millimeter spacing - thankfully
installing on my entha luxe was a
no-brainer considering the wide variety
of configuration it supports now all
that's left is installing the fans but
unfortunately there's no built-in fan
controller offical expects users to use
their motherboard
to all the fans but since they use a
simple three pin setup the ability to
control them is minimal they really
should have included four pan PWM
capable fans so how does it perform
let's take a look these results are
pretty impressive for a relatively small
and compact water-based CPU cooling
solution it's right up there competing
with dual 140 millimeter radiator based
solutions in terms of noise the drawback
was the two fans were not that powerful
nor that fast
don't get me wrong the I spare 240 is an
excellent cooler and very quiet but you
can't unleash its true performance
potential with those too slow stock fans
on the acoustic side of things this is
by far the quietest a ieo solution we've
come across the ice bear 240 from alpha
cool brings some interesting features to
the table for one it's literally made up
entirely of alpha cools premium products
combined together in one simple
relatively easy to install kit
everything from the radiator to the pump
has been designed for water cooling
enthusiasts and the best part is that it
comes in a relatively simple and clean
package
I will admit the installation procedure
was tedious plus the inclusion of stock
fans that do not support the PWM
standard is a bummer and that
significantly hits performance too
the quickest fix to this would obviously
be opting for a better faster and more
efficient fans but that will add to the
overall cost so what do you guys think
about this new AIO cooler from alpha
cool definitely share your thoughts down

I need more with hurricane X thank you
so much for watching I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
