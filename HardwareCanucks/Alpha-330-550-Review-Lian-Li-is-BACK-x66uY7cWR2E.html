species was observed in this odd state
with fancy new markings to attract
curious spectators this is a very
unusual sight as this family prepares to
feed on the hardware after the evolution
of its distinct features this particular
alpha is to roam into the wild
reflecting anything in its path the
species is unlike anything from the only
family the bone structure is no longer
aluminum and we're about to witness one
of the great phenomena with the return
of Lee and Lee back into its natural
habitat this alpha will need to feed to
survive let's study the species to
determine its fate right after this
choose be quiet to join the silent
revolution designed and tested in
Germany their meticulous passion for
quiet PC components ranges from premium
power supplies CPU coolers and fans and
innovative PC cases all of which aim to
achieve one thing is this thing even on
that's right
totally quiet power supplies even under
load silent Lynx fans deliver awesome
airflow with noise that doesn't reach
your ears all enclosed in the package
designed to be quiet
so guys I'm extremely excited to finally
check out something different from Liam
Lee there are new mid tower cases the
Alpha 330 and 550 the price ports are
fine considering all the glass and
modern interiors but it is strange how
there is nothing aluminium on these
cases which has been the staple for Lily
for so long and despite the good built
quality of the frame they feel almost
generic but I am so happy they have
simplified their naming schemes and not
the usual PC - random numbers and
letters and I'm hoping this trend will
continue now as part of their
restructuring of the brand we have a new
logo that is recognizable at all it does
remind me a little bit of the Fantastic
Four but I like the subtle integration
of the logo on the front panel and on
the interior so the frame when these two
is basically identical it's a good
direction because buying the cheaper
model doesn't mean worse assembly
process there's a large bottom dust
filter it's removable from the side and
it's built into the case feet which is
why they look so ugly there are dual
vertical PCI brackets which are pretty
close to the side panel with no riser
card nor
mounting accessories included on either
model the right side panel is blacked
out to hide the power supply area while
letting you showcase all those drives
and the cable work above and the
interiors are identical in every way so
what exactly is different so the 550 has
extra paneling on the front and the top
with side ventilation whereas the 330
doesn't so top radiator options on the
smaller version are less ideal for
example the 330 has a dust filter up top
with triple 120 or dual 140 mm or a fan
support which are centered so it's not
really good for radiators whereas on the
550 because that additional top panel we
have a little bit more height and have a
dedicated fan bracket so you can install
a 280 millimeter or a 360 moment
radiator
without interior interference and
because the i/o is shifted to the front
to triple 140 millimeter fans can be
installed here now I say shifted because
the i/o on the 330 is right at the top
with a type C port that needs to be
present on more cases so very happy to
see that here with Lea and Lea whereas
on the 550 the i/o is hidden behind this
front cover making room for that top fan
bracket and the cover is angled and
doesn't fold all the way down but one of
the reasons why I love me a type C port
is because of that lower profile
motherboard connector
now unfortunately Liam Lea got on board
with the whole temper glass movement
without acknowledging our concerns with
air flow and how front glass panels
really choke the fans so that's what we
have on both cases the spacing between
the panel and the fans is way too short
and while I appreciate the look of the
reflective yet see-through nature of
glass
I prefer better cooling instead for the
front and both cases are actually well
equipped for fans
so the 550 comes with three 120
millimeter RGB fans mounted on the
removable bracket and each case has a
black exhaust fan it's like they're
trying to get rid of piles of crappy
fans because these have molex connectors
for power something's not right
while the three RGB fans on the 550 are
connected to a dedicated controller hub
that also requires a molex connection
for power with the PWM connector that
you need to pull away and route to your
motherboard for actual fans
control because the hub is only for
color granted the illumination is quite
nice with many colors and effects but
instead of software control we get a
remote and so none of the colors match
on the color selection so it's best to
just cycle until you find something you
like
now the ambient strip below the i/o is
pretty cool but there is no individual
LED control so they're all on or there's
nothing the fans also have a proprietary
connection to the hub which kind of
sucks you cannot connect them to your
motherboard for example and so because
of that I would actually gravitate
towards the cheaper 330 and fill it with
my own fans and lighting also two of the
three stickers are misaligned in the
center which really bugs me and I don't
know about you guys but the frame on the
dust filter is quite distracting it's
not really clean with those lines
especially more visible on the white
model and with regards to that white
model I wish they only would go the
accent route instead of having the
entire frame and white it would help to
camouflage those black cables better and
I think the best example here is the new
h7 100 I from NZXT that still allows
that color coordination for your white
frame but not just going full white but
the interior layout is actually pretty
great
borrowing many elements from the
mainstream like the cable covered the
front with the reservoir support there
is a pump bracket at the front and
there's no 45 millimeters of clearance
for a front radiator and a nice long
cutout on the shroud for GPU cables that
you can maneuver based on the length of
your card and more cable cutouts right
below the motherboard and storage wise
it's excellent with three brackets in
the back there are two forces these or
hard drives there are two more in the
bottom chamber that are completely
removable and then there's this a swivel
bracket that can house three additional
SSDs and actually has secondary purpose
to hide cables entering into that main
chamber they're also velcro straps
available and this bracket is easily
removable for drive installation all in
all they only has put out a fantastic
frame on both sides and so it's time to
build
all right so first of all the rear
section is super wide this is just in
case you decide to install those three
and a half inch drives on those brackets
and this makes cable cleanup super easy
with the panel closed you could light up
this area for some creative showcase but
even with a bit of a cable mess that
I've created here it doesn't look
terrible I have absolutely nothing bad
to say about the interior and I love the
light spill from the fans and the
multiple entrances on top of the
motherboard for cable routing but as
usual this is an oversized mid Tower to
accommodate water cooling because with
this simple setup that I have here
it just feels empty I would love a more
compact frame like the mesh fic because
even with an AO either at the front or
the top the case still would feel too
long okay so for my conclusion I want to
say that I'm pretty happy with leonie's
reintroduction into the mainstream I
think they have a really fantastic frame
on their hands that I hope that they
develop a little bit more and evolve the
exterior so that we have better air flow
options on the exterior so you're not
choking the front airflow constantly I
want to see more airflow priorities and
you know we can lower down the TG sort
of addiction from the case manufacturers
because I think people want to see more
airflow options and not more glass
options please now there are GP
integration with a 550 feels like an
afterthought because everyone's moving
towards a software integration and
especially tying at the RGB illumination
of your case and fans to your
motherboard so you can match everything
up but with the remote that feels a
little bit not as high-quality or
premium as you would expect for this
price point and I really want to hear
what you guys think about my comment
about this being just a way too large
case for the regular consumer if you're
not doing dual radiators then what's the
point of having such a large Tower and I
would love for companies to start to
compact things because it seems like
we're ballooning back out this is not a
mid Tower this is definitely a full
Tower category based on its full support
and just the size - I would love to see
more compact towers and let me know
if you guys agree and so those are my
thoughts on the new alpha species from
Lee and Lee let me know what you think
do you think this will survive in the
wild
let me know in the comments below thanks
