went to the evolved ATX by fantex and
I've been using it for my workstation PC
and absolutely loved it
the building experience is fantastic
cable management is super simple and
those two lists opening side panels have
become one of my favorite features for
swapping Hardware in and out my
workstation build is nothing complex but
with extra Flair like the cable mount
RGB lighting on the left side and black
red cables to complement RAM and
motherboard colors but today the case
gets an upgrade this is the fan --tx
evolved 80 xt g or tempered glass
Edition priced at $180 which is really
interesting because it's only a $10
premium over the original so there are a
few minor updates that include a built
in RGB lighting hub that illuminates the
front LED strip and the power button up
top and also if you connect an optional
fantex LED strip that will all match the
color sync there's also a breathing mode
and a color cycle mode built in but the
star element of this upgrade are the
tempered glass side panels on both sides
which means you definitely have to bring
your a-game for cable management at the
back now we've worked with tempered
glass in the past and there's really
something so awesome about those
reflections and the evolved ATX T G or
tempered glass Edition is no different
the sad part about this new addition the
side panels are not compatible with the
original evolved ATX so if you just
picked one up in thinking oh man the
side panels are so sweet you cannot
replace the swivel ones with the glass
ones due to the nature of the mount so
there are 4 thumb screws that hold the
panel in place and it's less convenient
to get inside the case and you have to
be also extremely careful as tempered
glass is a total extra cleanup if broken
the panels are tinted just to write them
out so you can still see all the
hardware inside and to create an
isolating seal around the panel we have
some padding that limits audible
vibrations although I think the system
is just a tiny bit louder with glass
panels versus the original which could
be just my placebo effect because from
where I sit it doesn't really look like
the case has a panel at all color wise I
decided to try something new with a dark
tone this is the gray Edition which
creates a really awesome stark
difference between the glass and
aluminum and notice the blacked-out
edges around the perimeter of the panel
that hides the interior frame and also
helps to hide LED strips which I have
positioned around the perimeter of the
frame overall the new edition looks
really awesome but truth be told I was
expecting a more convenient mounting
method for the panels after all this is
fan Tech's who have gained the
reputation for pushing that standard so
now come along with me as I migrate my
system from the Evolve ATX into the
tempered glass Edition enjoy
so I seriously love working inside the
Evolve
it's such a simple assembly nothing has
changed in my system but I've added
lighting strips on the backside panel
since that will also be visible I will
have to take some time to do the back
cable management right at some point but
you get the idea of how rewarding it
might be seeing this all cleaned up plus
if you install lighting on both sides we
have extra ambient lighting shooting out
around the enclosure that might be you
know the sweet effect to play around
with obviously what glass fingerprints
are a total pain especially with
interior illumination and you just have
to also be careful with airflow pressure
to avoid dust accumulation on the inside
and that is all I have to say the best
case of last year just got better
I only wish that we had a swap wall
panel considering the tempered glass
addition is only a $10 premium over the
original of all ATX so that concludes
our little migration system I hope you
enjoyed it the last thing to do is put
the plant where it belongs on top of my
power button I'm going to me tree with
our Canucks thanks much for watching
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
