the usual ridiculous unboxing embargoes
and other teases it's finally review day
for the $700 AMD Radeon 7 GP you
honestly this launch had stretched out
way too far but at least we're here now
now if you're looking for a bit more
information on the underlying
architecture of this GPU you can
actually check out our explain video
right over here because this video is
gonna be primarily focused on the
benchmark results for both gaming and
productivity and now that md's NDA is
lifted we can actually share a little
bit more information about this new GPU
so let's say let's get into it right
after this welcome the entire H series
from NZXT we're in the most elegant case
lineups with the premium construction
you'll appreciate and the little details
like purple USB ports / fresh routes
floor and the iconic cable cover we've
got an ITX option the H 200 your
standard ATX mid tower at age 500 and
the big guns the H 700 all available
with a smart device for RGB illumination
and fan control or the standard
variations with a smart interior to
complement an easy assembly the H series
is Hardware canucks approved and is
something for everyone check it out
below
so the Radeon 7 is a great-looking
graphics card I love the overall look
the triple fan setup should hopefully
keep temperatures under control while
also offering much lower noise than the
reference Vegas 64 notice I said should
well stay tuned because this card is not
quiet there's also a dual 8 pin power
setup since this card is supposed to
consume about 300 watts at full load one
thing that's been removed is crossfire
support either with an external
connector or through the PCI bus instead
AMD is counting on DX 12 and Vulcan
multi-gpu configurations
that's pretty disappointing but it
basically follows industry trends to
move away from supporting multi-gpu
configurations in drivers now having
spoken to board partners almost all of
them are not planning on launching
upgraded versions of the 7 and that's
just too bad but I hope things could
change later down the road
now when we posted our last video a lot
of you guys did ask us about rumors
regarding
availability first of all in North
America aimed he's planning to sell the
way on 7 on their website kind of like
what NVIDIA does with their founder
certain GPUs although what partners will
have reference designs it's just that
you know they've told us that their
stocks will be limited so we're just
going to wait and see how this all plays
out in the upcoming days all right so
let's quickly recap what the Radeon 7 is
all about basically aim D has used a
modified version of Vega core that was
originally used on the Vega 64 this time
it has a slightly updated architecture
uses the 7 90-minute manufacturing
process and houses a huge 16 gigabyte of
HP m2 memory even though it has less
course and texture units than the
previous gen this new GPU is able to hit
much higher sustained clock speeds that
along with other core improvements
should technically allow 3m7 to
outperform the Vega 64 by a big margin
now there are a few other things that I
wanted to talk about first and foremost
a lot of people think that this card is
targeted towards professionals more than
it does gamers because the price of the
GPU is around $700 personally I think
the Radeon 7 is more of a dual use card
that can fit both sides equally well
though keep in mind that 16 gigabytes of
onboard memory does make it feel like
something that would interest content
creators who use high-level you know
programs or 3d programs like a Maya or
3ds max now another thing that should
also be mentioned is how AMD is planning
to position the seven against Nvidia you
see most of us were hoping for an
affordable alternative to the RT X cards
and technically that's not going to
happen because the RT X 2080 and the way
m7 are priced at $700 at least on paper
now AMD will have a fight on their hands
because there's been an increase in
availability of $700 RT x 2080 cards
back at lunch finding one of those was
almost impossible but that's been
changing some still hit $775 and above
though I'm looking at you ASIS now we're
testing we chose a card that's right in
the middle of everything the gigabyte RT
x 2088 gigabyte OC which usually is
between 750 and 760 dollars but
sometimes it goes for sale for as little
as seven times
thirty dollars so here's the rest of the
test system but we're also going to be
doing things a bit differently this time
AMD is making some big claims about how
well the way and Semin does in creative
focus applications that means a few
additional productivity tests will be
added after the gaming benchmarks so
let's get on to things because this is
going to be interesting and I wanted to
kick things off with an annoying point
about the Radeon seven and that's this
so yeah even though that it has three
fans this is a very loud card that's
really disappointing since Vegas 64 had
the exact same issue and I was hoping
for something better this time around
now on paper at least the Radeon seven
is quieter than the Vega card but it is
also much louder than any of the Nvidia
cards even the most powerful card here
the r-tx 28 ATI is almost silent in
comparison we actually talked to AMD
about this and they're very honest about
sound levels being an issue with Radeon
7 GPU and they're looking to address
that in future driver releases now one
of the challenges that they're having
right now is the second generation Vega
core uses a network of 64 thermal
sensors and uses the the maximum
temperature across that to determine
frequencies and fan speeds this is
called Junction temperature the problem
with the junction temperature
determining performance in acoustics is
that when the GPU is under load it's
typically 20 to 30 degrees or more about
what's reported as a traditional core
temp for example here the GP temperature
was read 75 degrees while the junction
temperature ended up hitting 103 degrees
as a result the fans started spinning up
to make sure that the court didn't
throttle so with that taken into account
Indy told us that working on adding a
quiet mode later on but that would
eventually cause a cheap you to hit
lower performance numbers so for now
we're gonna be getting Radeon seven
performance numbers but with higher
noise levels anyways speaking of
performance on to that part and feel
free to pause here at any time since
we're gonna be going through these quite
a bit faster as you're going through
these results you'll notice that the
Radeon seven does manage to tie or beat
the Arctic's twenty eighty a few times
at 1440p but it typically sits somewhere
between the twenty eighty and the twenty
seventy that's certainly not what gamers
had hoped for a given these $700 price
point
moving on to 4k in each game and things
don't really change all that much with
away on seven still losing in games
where it was behind in 1440p but there
are some places where the larger memory
pool makes a slight difference a good
example of that is far Prive what this
shows is that a lot of today's games
aren't bottlenecked by memory but rather
by the graphics core itself maybe things
will change
8k ever becomes a thing but window still
has issues getting 4k to work properly
and they're nowhere near 8 kos
compatibility so adoption for beyond 4k
displays for anything but professionals
is probably years away and now on to
some productivity benchmarks remember
how AMD claimed that the Radeon seven
was really geared towards a real-time 8k
acceleration and rendering performance
in Adobe Premiere and DaVinci Resolve
well I decided to put that to testing
and the results were definitely
interesting now one thing to keep in
mind is and I limited the amount of GPUs
in this case because I really didn't
have the time to test everything so I
used four cards in total gtx 980ti r-tx
2080 vegas 64 and of course the Radeon 7
so i'ma kick things off with a 12-minute
4k timeline it's completely edited it's
a full project that we published a block
a while back and I exported to the
YouTube 40% and interestingly enough
there wasn't a major difference between
all four cards whatsoever
every GP rendered the exact same project
in less than 10 minutes now I took a
one-minute 8k project and I exported to
the h.265 8k preset using Adobe Media
encoder and once again there wasn't a
significant difference between all four
GPUs but there was something interesting
that I noticed after or while testing
the Nvidia cards and the AMD GPUs and
that is real-time playback performance
as I was playing this 8k footage in real
time I noticed said both the Vegas 64
and the Rhian 7 struggle to keep up with
the frame rates while I was just playing
back this one-minute time line and
that's something that I wasn't able to
notice with the r-tx GPU and the gtx
980ti which was definitely interesting
because you might have framedrops with
the AMD GPUs were on thousand versus you
know 500 on the gtx cards so if you're
thinking about you know creating a work
station based pc i would slightly lean
towards the nvidia series GPU is because
codec solution seems to happen more
optimized for that which brings me to my
last test using DaVinci Resolve I took
this 13-minute 4k timeline exported it
to the YouTube 4k high preset with in
resolved and
all four GPUs completed that task in
right under seven minutes so it's
definitely faster than Premiere that's
something that I noticed with both these
graphics cards but it really proves that
there isn't really a significant
improvement with the Radeon 7gp you even
though that it has 16 gigabytes of
onboard memory it's just basically
performing identically to the GTX and
the archaic series cards now on to
blender and for this one we're using a
bill that's been recompiled to properly
utilize our TX cards as soon as the main
versions of this application
don't hit support invidiously latest
architecture even in its unsupported
form the Arctic's 2080 still beats the
way and 7 by 16 seconds on a pretty
simple render performance in v-ray for
Sketchup shows the 2080 beating the
Radeon seven again but this time by a
larger margin than in blender
alright so finally let's move on to the
last benchmark and that's power
consumption so this is a pleasant
surprise since AMD has obviously made
huge strides in the performance per watt
area versus the Vega 64 but this also
makes it apparent how far behind Nvidia
they are right now while the Radeon 7 is
on an efficient seven anime
manufacturing process it still requires
35 watts more than the r-tx 28 so that's
about the benchmarks and I think it's
time to conclude this review so I'm
gonna start with a few basic numbers the
Radeon seven has improved or the Vega 64
by roughly 28% in 1440p and a whopping
31% in 4k and that is impressive
considering that this car consumes less
power now when you put it up against the
r-tx 2080
that's where AMD is gonna face a bit of
a problem because that's where this car
Falls pretty short in both 1440p and 4k
not only that but having tested this
card in productivity as well it just
couldn't cash the nvidia gpus because
you know the performance difference is
barely anything and not also also to
mention this card is loud as hell and
it's also one of the most power hungry
GPS that we've ever tested so far even
compared to the RTX 2080
now normally we could overlook all of
this if AMD
at least competitive on their price but
at $700 the waiting on seven just
doesn't look like a good value even
again see $750 gigabyte ocv used it
falls short in the price to performance
bracket that's really not a position
where used to weigh down cards being in
since they typically offer some awesome
value so guys there you have it I mean
this launch really feels like AMD needed
to absolutely stay in the GPU news cycle
and compete against what NV is offering
because they have to stay irrelevant
right but at this point in time the way
m7 is just too expensive it's too loud
and power-hungry and I just really can't
recommend this GPU at the moment that's
pretty much from me let me know what you
guys think about performance results and
what your what where your expectations
for the weigh down seven are you
surprised
are you disappointed I wanna know your
thoughts in the comments I mean both
