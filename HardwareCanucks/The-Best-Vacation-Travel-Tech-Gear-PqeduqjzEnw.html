asked about what's in my travel backpack
gear wise so let me show you
welcome to your new tea board train
first attach the magnetic wrist rest it
simply pops in don't forget about the
USB pass-through port and the headphone
jack to simplify your connectivity you
and the boss of the meeting control
which is right over here
fiery red tea caps are included because
it is a gaming product with RGB / key
elimination and under the hood we've got
cherry MX silver speed and blue switches
for those legit actuations and finally
don't forget about the voice control
enjoy your new x1 by thermaltake check
it out in the description below
alright people so in front of me is my
super compact travel gear accessory kit
you know all these items are little
they're inexpensive you can buy them in
description below thank you very much it
helps us out all the affiliation is down
the description below but you know
potentially highlight some things that
you might want or need for your next
trip or your everyday life so first
let's begin with the spout something
that I didn't used to travel with but
now this goes with me everywhere it's
awesome because you know backpacks have
pockets and stuff like that but those
things can you know little things can
get lost and this is awesome because all
this tech pretty much aside from the
bigger stuff goes inside here and I know
where to access you know though USB
drives little velcro straps whatever
everything goes inside it opens up nice
and wide it has these tightening bands
on the interior different pockets so you
can reorganize
however you want for little items or
larger items everything just sits nicely
inside this bag it also has an exterior
pocket for easy access which I love they
come in different colors too and
basically just a pocket that's super
handy for your tech or whatever else you
might put inside but now moving onto the
necessities I never travel without a
flashlight sure our smartphones have one
but these guys are actually super
inexpensive the batteries already are
included it's waterproof and it's also a
lot more powerful than any smartphone
flashlights so in India for example I
lost something in the grass and
definitely was in search of a flashlight
but luckily you know found some stuff
and this is why I carry
a designated flashlight with me now the
cool thing about this one is that it has
an expandable light beam so you can
narrow the beam if you have if you want
a longer light output or you can widen
the beam to cover a larger surface area
it's awesome too for light painting so
if you're doing photography night
photography especially and want to paint
something in the shot a flashlight
definitely will do the trick now moving
on they never travel without a battery
bank I used to travel with like very
small capacity of milliamps but they
would just drain way too quickly so I
picked up a twenty thousand milliamp
hour capacity battery bank it is a bit
on the heavy side and the charge is
super slow but once this is charged you
can last you for a couple days
definitely without you needing to plug
anything into the wall this is awesome
make sure to check out you know a bunch
of their capacity this is by the way
from Ankur yeah love this thing super
handy now for wireless audio I decide to
go with the Bose Soundlink micro simply
because this thing is tiny it sounds
fantastic for its size has a really good
bass output at the bottom it is
waterproof it's tough as well we have
full controls for buttons on the actual
speaker it has a little strap at the
back that you can put on your backpack
so when you were hiking or something you
can listen to all your music I just
wanted something that was compact
sounded great and the only thing is that
the firmware update is over bluetooth
which takes forever but I'm pretty happy
with this guy it is a little bit on the
expensive side at $100 but I didn't want
to cheap out on a Bluetooth speaker
because I wanted something compact and
sounded good and there are not many
options that that satisfy that criteria
yeah so this speaker is awesome for
headphones though I'm rocking this son
Heiser momentum Wireless I've had these
for like four or five years they sound
amazing the sound isolation on here it
is active so it actually cancels out all
the background noise is just incredible
I take a lot of pictures on my trips
which is why I have these two guys for
all my storage needs the Silverstone so9
enclosure which I put in my own MDOT -
SSD in there make sure to check out our
video on that here and the HyperX savage
drive - it's 128 gigabytes which is
awesome so I can offload my entire SD
card on here and have that backup now
moving up to the smartphone territory
I've been using the oneplus 6 myself as
a daily driver but the red Edition
recently came out it is absolutely
gorgeous on camera it looks just as good
as it does in real life the fingerprint
scanner has a slightly different tone of
red which you know if you like to pick
out certain details you will
it also doesn't pick up fingerprints as
much as the black version because
there's so much color and vibrancy is
happening on here it kind of hides the
finger marks they're still visible
because it is still glass but I'm
definitely going to be rocking the 1 + 6
red edition from now on I mean look at
this thing it's absolutely gorgeous
well done oneplus well done and to
complement my smartphone photography I
picked up these clip-on lenses for your
smartphone the good thing about these
because they're clipped on they can be
attached to any smartphone and so I
picked up the kid that has the super
wide the fisheye and the macro lens I
don't use the fisheye because the super
wide already has the effect like that so
the super wide is awesome the optics are
not fantastic like you can have
distortion but it's a really unique way
to kind of experiment with your
photography that expands your field of
view and I'm definitely looking forward
to using these on my upcoming trip now
the good thing about the macro lens is
it's super sharp and you have to be
really close to your subject and the
smartphone photos look absolutely
amazing and yeah it just gives you a
different perspective for smartphone
photography when you travel
and because they're so compact and
actually super cheap - you don't have to
have a particular case for it these are
just clip-on lenses for your you know
onto your smartphone
you don't need additional accessories to
use them they're awesome and so much fun
to use and to clean the screen of the
smartphone we have eye rollers they come
in two different sizes like mini one and
the standard one and these are amazing
so you just roll them on your screen to
clean all the fingerprints they actually
remove bacteria which is great so it's
for hygienic purposes and for visual
purposes then the good thing about these
is once they get all clogged up with a
little gunk and like little particles on
the actual rubber bit you just wash this
with warm water let it air dry and boom
you're ready to go it still has a lot of
the adhesive onto the the rubber thing
I've been using this for about a year
and it still as basically just works as
new so i rollers definitely recommended
for my tripod needs because I'm taking
my Sony a7 three for the vacation I had
the Joby I think this one's for like the
mirrorless one so it's the medium size
which can support the the Sony camera
the GH 5 no problem to that you can
position anywhere but I also have this
tiny Manfrotto one which is great for
handheld stuff and just over time the
legs have loosened up quite a bit I've
had this for two years but it still is
going pretty good and the last few
things include this aperture m9 night
it's awesome because it is super compact
I think it can last for like an hour and
a half at maximum brightness so it you
know it recharges via its own battery it
has gel so you can color your scene
either with this blue or orange which is
awesome and this thing definitely could
come in handy anywhere if you need a
little additional light for your
photography or video and just like stash
it anywhere else for a little kick or
actually even fill as well the aperture
m9 these are awesome and the last little
thing are these gear ties so these are
awesome because they can be used for any
type of situation they are reusable
rubber zip ties basically they have nice
stiff
this they can be used to lock your
zipper on the backpack so if you in case
you travel you know you're you have a
little extra peace of mind you can fix
your shoe in case your laces are broken
because they're pretty thin they can
pass through anything and whatever you
need to tie for example my tripod boom
so the legs don't open now this is
around there that's awesome and just you
can use them for absolutely anything
low gear ties they're super inexpensive
but so handy to have when you need them
and now my first ever drone the maverick
air this thing is amazing
not only because it captures 4k 30fps
video but it's a stable it's super fast
it's easy to actually you know kind of
learn how to fly a drone I was very
nervous in the beginning but after a few
flights you kind of get accustomed to it
and you can you know perform some
maneuvers this thing is awesome to
capture things that you normally would
not be able to do on vacation and I
picked up the fly more combo which comes
with three batteries a remote controller
little bag so everything can just like
compactly fit into this one little
package that then goes into into my
backpack this thing is awesome and they
also have the ND filters for the camera
for the drone because if you want to
achieve that nice cinematic motion
effects so that the shutter speed on
this thing is low enough so you get
motion blur these things are really
handy and really bright and sunny
situations which are most likely are
wherever you go on vacation alright so
that is my travel accessory pack I hope
you found some of these items useful
potentially for your next trip and I'm
super excited to use these wide-angle
lenses because just I know the
distortion is there and they're not
super clear in detail but it's like a
new effect of you can achieve capturing
so much area that you normally would not
be able to do so yeah that is it thanks
for watching let me know if I'm missing
something and if there is a particular
piece of tech gear that you travel with
