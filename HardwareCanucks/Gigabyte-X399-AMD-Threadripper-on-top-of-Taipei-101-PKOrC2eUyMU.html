time before in these thread repair
availability that have already been a
bunch of sightings of the ex tween and
motherboards Computex a since asrock and
other vendors had boards on display and
we can now add gigabyte to the list
let's take a closer look at this beast
right after message from our sponsor our
coffee leg strip is brought to you by
fan tech schoolmaster and MSI now even
though this may look like a fish start
product ready to hit the socials like
all of the other X clean online
motherboards we have seen so far
gigabyte the first product to support
aim DS TR for socket is still a work in
progress the layout isn't final and
actually using the heat sinks from other
boards in their AMD and Intel lineups
but with that being said let's go over
the obvious things that we can decipher
from the layout and what we know about
the Ripper to begin with these
processors we will have up to an
incredible 60 PCIe lanes at the disposal
plus an additional four from the chipset
gigabyte has equipped the oars board
with five mechanical 16x slots which are
each reinforced against possible flex
from heavy graphics cards how these
lanes will eventually be divided between
the slots remains to be seen but it's
possible that up to 48 can be dedicated
towards graphics along with other 12
being routed towards onboard
connectivity like nvme and USB 3.1 gen2
devices speak if MDOT to this particular
board has three slots and all of them
support the nvme protocol there's also
eight SATA 6 gigabits per second ports
since Red River will run on a quad
channel memory there are two dim banks
for total of eight slots we can also see
gigabyte has installed a secondary four
pin CPU connector which is likely there
to support the current need when
overclocking one of these massive
processors much like gigabytes other
Orr's gaming notebooks this one comes
with a complete high-end integrated
audio subsystem it has a real tech ELC
1120 Kodak and upgradeable op-amps but
there's no word on whether or not the
final product will get the full
treatment with the ESF sabre deck and
other audiophile components the only
other thing we can infer from our short
time of the X 399 board was at the rear
i/o area has eight USB 3.0 ports a
single USB 3.1 gen2 type a character and
a single USB 3.1 gen2 Tex
deport hopefully this won't change
before launch since a motherboard of
this caliber should receive a few more
secret one gen 2 ports it should also be
interesting to see how gigabyte allows
this board to evolve between now and
Amy's official launch the other word we
saw was a tiny BP 50 ITX prototype for
aim these rising processors which will
eventually be called the a B 30 50 n
gaming Wi-Fi meter you can see is
actually a perfect fit for the rising I
t's board since it doesn't give up
anything to the xb-70 in terms of
functionality in such a small space as
usual there's a single TCI x16 slot and
space for a pair of memory modules this
version will also have an incorporated
wireless AC module and should also
actually be a pretty competitive
overclocker 2 pricing hasn't been set
yet and we would expect it to be very
affordable and it could become a great
platform onto which you can build a
solid IP exit system so that wraps up
our tour on gigabytes upcoming AMD
motherboards and we're sure to see more
from them in the near future as usual
make sure you stay tuned to the channel
for more coverage from copy text 2017
amiibo with Harbor connects thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
