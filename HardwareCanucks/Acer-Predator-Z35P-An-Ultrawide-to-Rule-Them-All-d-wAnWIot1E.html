and this is the Acer predator Z 35 P now
you may recall was taking a look at its
older brother at the Z 35 that featured
a 2560 by 1080 resolution support for
g-sync plus it was using a VA panel
instead of an IPS panel but most
importantly I was easily able to
overclock that panel to 200 Hertz which
was awesome at that time actually it's
still awesome by today's standards now
one of my main concerns with that
monitor was its resolution a 35 inch
display with a 2560 by 1080 resolution
just didn't make any sense for me
personally because ultra whites were
known for having the best horizontal
screen real estate and 1080p just didn't
cut it so I think 1440p was a sweet spot
but it was a gaming monitor so Acer's
priority was to achieve the highest
possible refresh rate with the given
resolution but it was also easier to
drive those pixels with the hardware
that we had at the time so fast forward
about a year later and we have this the
Z 35 P this is a 35 inch 20 on by 9
ultra wide gaming monitor featuring a 34
40 by 1440 resolution with an 1800 art
curved display and all the bells and
whistles that you'd expect from a
high-end gaming monitor so let's dive in
right after this cool master master keys
keyboard lineup is now available in
three sizes to fit within your space
with large medium and small boards with
either beautiful RGB or pure white LED
illumination a little something for
everyone make it yours with a master
keys pro by Cooler Master alright so
let's talk about pricing for this new
monitor it retails for $1,100 so that's
$200 cheaper than the flagship x34
monitor but what's interesting as that
acer has shaved $150 off the older z35
monitor in order to accommodate be newer
to Z 35 P specs wise this panel is using
the same VA technology found on the
original Z 35 as well as the same for
mon second response time but as
mentioned earlier it's high res and
comes out of the box with a hundred
Hertz refresh rate from a physical
perspective this is by no means geared
towards an office professional
is a sir has been always a little
aggressive with their design language on
their predator series of monitors so it
won't fit in with a simple and elegant
death set up however gamers might enjoy
these red and black accents and I think
would perfectly blend in with a red and
black themed PC since this is a curved
monitor it only offers 130 millimetres
of height adjustment and about 40
degrees of tilt swivel adjust is roughly
20 degrees so overall there is a good
amount of adjustment options for the end
user the Z 35 P is also basic compatible
and it uses the standard 100 by 100
millimeter configuration so you can
throw it on a wall mount or mount it on
a third party monitor arm the aluminum
base is rock-solid so you don't have to
worry about tipping over the panel given
how heavy it is on the downside it takes
up a lot of space on the desk so I'd
recommend getting a larger desk to
accommodate the monitor Plus you'd have
more room for other accessories in terms
of i/o we have four USB 3.0 ports and a
single USB 3.0 upstream port I like the
location of this hub because it's easier
to access rather than having all of them
at the bottom with the rest of the i/o
speaking of the bottom we have power in
DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI 1.4 and an audio
output respectively unfortunately they
are a little too difficult to access
especially with the power connector I
had to spend quite the time to connect
that thing because these sharp edges on
the monitor we're sort of getting in the
way so I wonder why Acer desire to
include a 90 degree connector rather
than a straight one also this unit is
only functional with an external power
supply rather than the standard
three-pin power plug so if cable
management is one of your priorities
well this is something that you'll need
to add to that list all right so let's
spend some time and talk about the
display because it is the centerpiece
for any monitor regardless of its design
or the extra set of features I
thoroughly enjoyed my time with the Z 35
P the resolution is just perfect for the
size in fact if you're planning on using
this for productivity you're absolutely
going to love it having so much
horizontal screen real estate is so
refreshing especially when editing
videos you can get a good glimpse of
your timeline and you can arrange the
windows to the way your desire Plus as a
bonus you can get to experience native
21 by 9 content if
debating about switching to an
ultra-wide monitor I would highly
recommend you check out Dimitri's take
on ultra whites versus 4k vs. 144 Hertz
monitors he did a fantastic job breaking
it down into different categories so
it's a good reference guide if you're in
the market for a new monitor the Z 35 P
is strictly geared towards gamers who
are looking for a more immersive
experience without sacrificing refresh
rate most modern ultra wide monitors
have a maximum refresh rate up to 75
Hertz and they typically come with free
sync which only works well with an AMD
GPU for a tear-free experience high-end
gaming monitors featuring g-sync
can go as far as 200 Hertz which is what
we saw with the older Z 35 this guy can
be overclocked as far as a 120 Hertz
which is still pretty fast considering
the 34 40 by 1440 resolution and given
its a VA panel if my memory serves well
the flagship x 34 featuring the same
resolution and an IPS panel can go only
as far as a hundred Hertz so the price
difference between the two monitors are
primarily due to their panel technology
VA vs. IPS with that being said don't
underestimate the VA panel inside the Z
35 P it's actually very close to what
IPS panels offer I would say it bridges
the gap between a TN and IPS panel
colors on this display look pretty
vibrant especially after enabling the
srgb mode viewing angles are respectable
but not great compared to IPs there is a
little bit of contrast shift as you see
but it's much better than a traditional
TN panel
I wouldn't recommend this for serious
content creators though since IPS offers
the best experience in terms of color
accuracy but for casual use the VA panel
should be sufficient so my gaming
experience was just amazing on this
ultrawide monitor do note that driving
this display at 120 Hertz requires some
serious GPU horsepower in my case I was
comfortably able to play battlefield 1
at Ultra settings using a GTX 1080 so
make sure you have proper hardware to
backup the $1,100 investment the
inclusion of g-sync is so awesome that
it makes me not want to go back to a
traditional 60 Hertz
non g-sync display my camera is not
going to do any justice here showcasing
this game
session has its shot in 24p but trust me
guys when you start gaming on it in
person
it's a one-of-a-kind experience there
are no signs of tearing or flickering
even with the overdrive enabled but
backlight bleed was also non-existent on
my unit what you're seeing right now is
with my camera set to 320 ISO cranking
that all the way up to 8,000 makes it
fairly evident at the centre but in real
world use I did not notice it whatsoever
say goodbye to cables it's time to enjoy
wireless audio with the corsair void RGB
gaming headset with the light and
comfortable frame low profile mic on
headset volume control and mic mute +
dual side illumination check out the
void RGB by corsair the perfect way to
hear your game so there you have guys my
take on the new Predator Z 35 P from
acer this has definitely been an
interesting experience especially since
it's been a long time since I've tested
out an ultra wide monitor because I've
been using my dual monitor setup for a
really long time but this certainly you
know refresh my memory on what ultra
whites look like and how immersive they
are when you're gaming but most
importantly it helps with productivity
like a lot in fact I wrote this script
watched a few videos and you know did
pretty much most of my proactive tasks
for last week on this guy and I
thoroughly enjoyed my experience now I
wouldn't recommend this for content
creators so because I mean I'm a content
creator and that's I'm speaking for
myself but also for folks who are
looking for a panel that can be used for
concentration so where does this leave
35 P stand in the market as of right now
well I think if you're a straight gamer
and if you're looking for an ultra wide
experience especially at 1440p and also
given you know you're looking for
features like g-sync i think this would
be an excellent option because the x34
is twelve two hundred dollars more
expensive than this so this would be an
excellent sweet spot if you're looking
for a high-end gaming monitor but again
if you really care about IPS and if you
really want the best viewing angles and
color accuracy
you should probably step things up to
the X study four because that comes with
the same resolution IPS panel and of
course it comes with G sync and you can
also overclock it to 100 Hertz so I
guess that would be an all run package
but if you really don't care about IPS
if you want a really decent panel for
gaming this is it let me know what you
guys think of the Z 35p from Acer would
you consider this over the x34 given its
$200 cheaper
let me know I'm even with hurricane axe
