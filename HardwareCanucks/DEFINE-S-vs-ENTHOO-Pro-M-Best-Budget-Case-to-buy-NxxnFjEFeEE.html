calm / HWC to get started
happy sleeping hello everyone I'm
Dimitri with Harbor Canucks and by
request in this video we'll be doing a
full showdown between two really popular
cases that define s from practical
design and the m2 Pro M from fan tax now
the reason for the showdown lies in the
similarity of the target audience the
feature set and the price you're looking
at $79 for the pro M ANDed finest teen
on windowed version and it's a $10
premium for the windowed side panel
which is totally worth it they are both
in towers that offer kick-ass internal
layout but is one better than the other
let's find out
so I'm going to start this showdown with
the exterior run down the define as
follows in the footsteps of simple black
box design the track of design has not
changed in ages it's clearly not trying
to compensate for anything if you know
what I mean because it is a popular
preference I like to brush plastic front
panel and the i/o at the top the Pro M
on the other hand has a little extra
character with a front panel it's got a
single v in the quarter inch drive bay
and the I always move to the side but
both are simple enough without any
aggressive gamer e characteristics and I
like that I like the window cut out on
the define s more just because it spans
a better chunk of the interior that
you'd want to show off while the window
on the pro-am is a bit too narrow the
viewing angles are limited but the looks
are all subjective so let us know in the
comments which you prefer however the
side panel rigidity goes to the define s
with good quality and heavy panels and
thumb screws that are attached on the
panel which is awesome and the solid
panels do compensate though for the
wobbly interior because there is no
internal frame support the N through Pro
M is kind of the opposite the side
panels are very thin and flimsy plus to
top it off the mounting mechanism relies
on hinges that are difficult to align
however the internal frame is totally
solid with absolutely zero flex on the
frame unfortunately both side panels
fail the nail scratch test I don't have
votary nails like some people have
mentioned in the comments and I apply
only a little bit of pressure so be
careful when working with the two but
we've heard from fantex that they are
strengthening the window to be more
clear and more durable against scratches
so I can say the nail scratch test
despite of how many windows I've
destroyed can be seen as a success when
it comes down to dust proofing the pro M
has all ports covered there's a large
magnetic filter at the top which I love
a power supply filter at the bottom and
the filter on the front panel however
the side ventilation ports at the front
or B
find the filter making this intake prone
to dust you could cover it somehow but
that's not the point
and it's unfortunate to see this
overlooked the define s has a large
filter spanning the front intake with
deep enough ventilation openings between
the panel there's a removal power supply
filter and coming to the top this is
where we find the Majin system that
allows you to remove only the needed
portions for your specific fan
configuration the fan mounts are offset
closer to the panel for better rad
clearance but there is no dust filter
here and fractal design really needs to
figure out a way to give us proper dust
proofing at the top please coming inside
the define S comes with two excellent
140 member fans so you get proper
exhaust and some intake out of the box
with one of the best airflow designs on
the market the cooling potential with
triple 120 or 140 member fans at the
front and the top as well makes this a
really popular candidate for water
cooling this is because the traditional
drive cage is now gone so the interior
is just open for your imagination know
what I mean water cooling mostly though
keep it PG please plus the rail system
is built-in to help with the reservoir
mounting which is awesome coming inside
the pro m and it's clear that people are
demanding this type of open interior
layouts that would optimize air flow and
maximize the convenience of any water
cooling inside we find only a single 140
moment or exhaust so you will need to
populate it with fans for proper cooling
and this was one of the critiques a lot
of you guys commented on the review
because at $79 you were expecting to
have at least a second fan at the front
you can set up trip 120mm fans or dual
140 millimeters because of this chamber
separation the floor to the front can be
removed to accommodate for longer than
240 known the radiators now the pro M
has one of the best top fan mounting
solutions it's a simple removable
bracket for triple 120 or dual 140
member fans it's a really awesome way to
allow users to mount things outside of
the case and slide it back in during
assembly both cases have outstanding air
flow but the
- takes this one for sure with more fan
spots and better water quality support
for storage I also love practice
approach here with three brackets in the
back for three and a half inch drives
that are backwards compatible with two
and a half inch drives as well and we
have dual SSD brackets for excellent
storage potential considering the drive
cage is gone the enthu pro m on the
other hand has a cage in the bottom
chamber with two Drive caddies so one
less than the defined s plus only a
single SSD bracket that is modular by
the way so you can move it around and
even bring it to the side of the case to
show it off but if only the window panel
extended to that portion
however the pro M has this unique
optional mounting system in place using
these brackets to attach more drives on
the interior chamber with mounting
flexibility within these five spots
depending on your system the unfortunate
part is that no brackets are included
and they are $10 apiece so if you need
more storage space than that you
actually better look elsewhere as for
the assembly process both fractal and
fantex managed to create a complete new
proof interior for run the easiest
systems to put together our reference
test system fits in place very well
absolutely no hiccups the spacious
chamber on each case just looks awesome
I love the chamber division on the
pro-am tow especially because the power
supply is moved closer to the panel and
we have extra clearance on the other
side to stash away any extra cables and
both cases actually utilize these velcro
straps to let you easily collect and
clean up all the cables so both cases
have fantastic cable management and so
in conclusion which one is better I
think that the finance is a bit more
versatile in the cooling department
especially with the added fan included
there's extra drive support out of the
box side panel presentation is better
while the enter Pro M features an
outstanding internal frame and a
different aesthetic on the inside too
with that bottom chamber plus you have
that five the quarter inch drive slot
which is important to some people and is
missing on the define s my main negative
point on the define s is the top margin
system that has
no does filter my main negative point on
the pro-am are no front intake fans
included and side panels are really
really flimsy but looking fast that both
cases are extremely satisfying to build
in and at this price point sort of set
the benchmark of what we should expect
from new cases released in this price
bracket the de Finance is a clear winner
if you are looking for the best water
cooling customization right now while
the pro m is an awesome alternative for
a simple gaming build where you don't
mind the limited drive options but want
the proper user friendly building
experience and so guys this concludes
this the case showdown between the
define s and the enthu Pro M leave your
thoughts on which two enclosures we
should compare or compete in the future
showdown thank you so much for watching
let us know which one of these you
prefer more and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
