here at Computex we stop by gigabyte to
conclude our coverage and the main
highlight of the show was of course the
refreshed aero 15 which is not to be
confused with the aero 15X or the
aero 15 classic I know there's a lot
going on it's certainly confusing but
allow me to walk you through some of the
details but first huge shout out to fan
texts and SteelSeries for sponsoring our
Computex 2019 coverage so there are two
lineups of the aero series for the rest
of 2019 it's the regular aero 15
classic and the aero 15 which is their
flagship lineup of notebooks that come
with new designs and whatnot now if you
keep things off with the aero 15
classic nothing really has changed in
terms of the design compared to the
previous generation so you get the same
you know unibody metal construction with
a little bit of plastic build here and
there the keyboard layout on the
trackpad layout are identical you still
get RGB lining you know there's also the
i/o situations pretty much identical
same battery size like I said pretty
much the same on the exterior but you do
get a little bit of a spec refresh so
for starters TCP configuration starts
with the core i7 9750 h6 chord 1230
processor and it can be upgraded all the
way up to the core I9 9880HK 8 for 16
threaded monster the GP configuration
starts with a gtx 1660 TI which is not a
max q design or you can also go for an
RTX 2060 RTX 2070 max Q and an RTX 2080
Emacs q GP configs
so really good options overall for both
what gigabytes offering with the aero 15
classic and I feel like it's a good way
for people who really want to get into
that premium ultra-thin gaming laptops
it's I think the 1660 has a great start
they're also gonna be offering to
display options on the aero 15 classic so
you can either go for a 15.6 inch 1080p
144 display which is IPS and that's
provided by LG or you can opt for a
1080p 240 Hertz display which is an
egg's openal
and that's provided by sharp and that is
just crazy 240 Hertz on a 15.6 inch
screen I think it's the ultimate gamers
dream alright so moving on to the Aero
15 and this is their flagship offering
so there are some subtle design changes
for instance the logo at the front now
says aero instead of gigabyte there are
front-facing speakers finally that is a
welcoming addition for sure
and so it's definitely gonna give you a
better sound projection I'm definitely
curious to see how well it sounds
compared to the Razer Blade 15 when I
get my hands on one of these models the
IO still remains the same although they
have shuffled a bit of that on the left
and right do the front speaker
integration the webcam for some reason
is located at an even odd location so
they've shifted it from the bottom of
the screen to the main chassis right
above the power button with a privacy
shield feature now this makes things
even worse because it's at a stationary
spot and even lower compared to when it
was originally on the aero 15X and one
of the things again at least having to
have webcam place at the bottom is that
as you're shifting your screen you could
sort of position yourself at a different
angle although I guess it's a nose cam
angle that you're getting from a bottom
facing webcam this implementation is
really really odd and I just feel like
it's gonna be even worse
when you're looking at it unfortunately
I get a chance to actually look at that
when I was in the show floor but I know
for a fact that it's it's not gonna tell
her that great the keyboard and trackpad
remained the same although after
spending a short amount of time with it
I felt like the keys were a bit mushy er
compared to the previous aero 15x CP
options again start with the core i7
9750 h and you can obviously configure
it up to the core I nine eight core 16
threaded offering GPU offerings are also
pretty much the exact same as the Aero
15 classic so you can start up with a 16
60 TI and go all the way up to a 20 80
max q GPU and these new aero 15 notebooks
come pre-loaded with invidious studio
drivers because it's really geared
towards content readers gigabyte also
mentioned that they've upgraded the
cooling system on the Aero 15 and they
claim that it's 15 to 20 percent better
than the previous generation which is
pretty interesting I mean they call it
the wind force cooling system and it
takes design elements from their GPU
coolers and adapted to their notebooks
and I'm really curious to test that out
once I get my hands on one of these
models but the main highlight of this
lineup is the display gigabyte has
actually partnered up with Samsung to
integrate 4k AMOLED displays except for
the base cube that comes with a 1080p X
0 240 Hertz panel it comes in both
matte and glossy panels the 4k screens
are individually calibrated with XY
Pantone certification now AMOLED is
considered a softer panel technology so
the lid was reinforced significantly to
avoid damage burnin avoidance is done
through pixel shifting but it could
still be an issue now the battery
capacity still remains the same at
around 94 watt hours so if you spec this
thing with a core i7 processor and a gtx
1660 TI which is you know a really good
power efficient combination you can
easily get some amazing battery life out
of this notebook especially considering
that it's probably one of the only
notebooks thin and light notebook
relatively thin unlike notebook
featuring a really big battery now
pricing for the Aero 15 starts at 1699
and goes all the way up to three
thousand nine hundred ninety nine
dollars the catch is that the base model
only comes with single channel memory so
it's definitely gonna hit out of the box
performance significantly but that's
nothing that a quick memory upgrade can
fix now I also want to mention that
gigabyte will be offering a special
white edition which is a limited edition
of the aero 15 and just taking a quick
look at that the show floor it looked
absolutely gorgeous
I would certainly Rock one with the 4k
AMOLED screen because I mean you know it
certainly is a different look for the
inner lineup and yeah I mean I mean I'd
love to know your thoughts about that in
the comments down below alright so
there's one more thing that I want to
talk about and that is kick bite will be
coming out with a 17 inch version of the
Aero notebook so it's gonna feature a 17
inch 4k display with basically the same
specs as the aero 15 classic and the Aero
15 so you know processors start with the
core i7
9750 h2 the core I 998 a thk 8 core
processor a core 16 thread processor
also you can configure the GPU from 16
series all the way up to the r-tx 20
series so overall it looks like it's a
pretty good product stack up for the
rest of 2019 so that about wraps up my
coverage here at Computex 2019
especially here the gigabyte booth let
me know what you guys think about the
updated refresh for the Aero lineup of
series or the Aero series of notebooks
for the rest of 2019 you know would you
consider something like this for your
workflow if you're a greater gamer I
would love to know your thoughts about
that in the comments and if you're
interested in a particular SKU that you
wanted us to test down
definitely hit us up in the comment
