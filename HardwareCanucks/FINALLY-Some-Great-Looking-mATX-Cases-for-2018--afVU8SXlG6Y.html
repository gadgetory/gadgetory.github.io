economics here at Silverstone booth and
I am so happy to see more micro ATX
options available in the market and
these guys are coming very soon in 2018
so before we get into that this trip is
sponsored by fan tech school master and
Corsair all right so what we're looking
at here are the new lucid line the LD o
one the bottom here and the LD o - so
they've done some major changes based on
what we saw at Computex and actually a
lot of the feedback that you guys
provided to to them in the comments was
taken into account when designing this
so the LD L 1 is the more premium out of
the two which has a dual tempered glass
side panel and as you can see this very
beautiful stainless steel corners there
like those little perimeter around the
glass that makes the case really stand
out but it's not just a little
full-frame thing inside it's actually
part of the side panel so it's not there
just for aesthetics it's actually there
for structural purposes - the tempered
glass panel is blacked out
I actually prefer this look so it's not
completely transparent and if you're
going for that elegant approach in the
first place you wouldn't want to be
showing off your entire interior so this
type of thing with some interior
illumination allows you to basically
showcase just your only the most
important components so the LDO one as
you can see at the front is glass and
the only sort of Air Flow Intake is at
the top and the bottom so you are a
little bit compromised on the airflow
but with a focus on building a more
beautiful system so just keep that into
account when deciding on how to cool
your interior and that's for the LDO -
the design structure is a little bit
different on the exterior we might have
a tempered glass on the side but the
front panel still has tempered glass
with more airflow options with the
ventilation on both sides with this
really unique sort of kind of open frame
that is white I like this it's a little
bit different so the glass doesn't spend
the entire panel and then has that nice
kind of industrial design and so the
most important thing about this
enclosure is its micro ATX layout and
it's pretty compact
and allows for sort of future expansions
if Silverstone decides to
go that route because on both cases we
have a 240 millimeter all in one support
at the front and a five and a quarter
inch drive Bay that on these model is
currently not occupied but potentially
we'll see something in a future that
will take advantage of that slot
they are dust proof as you can see
that's removable of course there's a
dust filter at the back behind the power
supply and a magnetic filter at the top
the i/o fits the 2018 standard with dual
USB threes and a type C port that is
connected via the USB 19 pin so the
older standard but you will get gen 2
speeds from a Gen 2 compatible source if
your motherboard supports it so the
interior layout is quite interesting
because we have this inverted layout
with a power supply shroud at the bottom
that underneath houses a drive cage for
three three-and-a-half inch drives or
SSDs and we also have the dual SSD caddy
at the back and they're also
experimenting with GPU support brackets
because the graphics card will be
mounted at the top so it's nice to have
a little bit of support and because the
graphics card will be inverted the GPU
support bracket will make contact with
the PCB instead the motherboard is
recessed which helps with Ko measurement
and they will have rubber grommets so
that's awesome
you can move the hard drive cage a
little bit further away from the front
panel to accommodate the radiator there
the cutouts look ok here and I'm
guessing the only thing that you would
need to kind of take into account is the
height of your GPU and its proximity to
the top panel because you can install
dual 140 or dual 120 Miller fans and so
just take into account on how close they
are to the GPU for that extra airflow
now the one thing that they're still
unsure about is the branding on the
power supply shroud so we've had a
little conversation none of us liked it
from the hardwork Knox crew but they are
discussing on how to make this a little
bit more attractive so let us know what
you guys think about this branding and
how you'd like to see it changed and in
terms of the price so we're looking
about 70 to 80 dollars for the LDO - so
the slightly less fancy version and then
about a hundred dollars for the micro
text version of the LD oh one which is
the more premium black out temper glass
panels the stainless steel edges I
absolutely love this thing and I loved
they went with a squared approach that
makes the cases look so elegant and so
2018 and another interesting case that I
didn't think I would get excited about
is the cs3 81 so this is taking a
storage approach to the next level and
kind of like the story nadir whole thing
where you can build your own nas you can
build your own server you can build your
own you a security system device and so
this is the cs3 81 C S stands for case
storage I might add 381 because you can
fit three and a half inch x eight and
the one is because it's the first of its
kind so this is a micro ATX motherboard
layout as well just like the other cases
but we have eight hot-swappable three
and half inch drives we have a nice lock
of the front you can also lock the power
button so you don't accidentally press
it for example if you're using it as an
ass I think that's brilliant we have
dual SSD caddies up top so probably most
likely using that for your OS in terms
of cooling so we're looking at dual
120mm fans so you can round a 240
all-in-one cooler for your motherboard
of course there's very little height
between the motherboard and these
driving closures so that means that you
can mount water cooling which is awesome
we have four PCI slots and more room
above them for 120 millimeter fans so
you can mount some extra cooling here if
you're using like a long rate card which
you'll probably need to use for the hot
swappable drives here in terms of power
so this case is designed specifically
for sfx power supplies only because if
they were to design it with an ATX power
supply it would have been much longer
and taller so this is going for that
really compact and space-efficient
enclosure so the only sort of space that
isn't occupied properly would be in
front the power supply but you can use
that space for cable management for
cables so they don't have to be like
cramped in and overall this micro ATX
direction looks very promising and
overall I think it's a very good
direction for them to expand their case
offerings because they have an ITX
system that can house eight hots Popple
drives now a micro ATX system and of
course an ATX system as well so this
thing is awesome the CS 381 let us know
if this is something you guys are
interested in and we
can obviously check it out there alright
guys so that's all for the new cases
from silverstone let us know what you
think of this layout and the micro-atx
direction i know we've covered as rocks
new micro ATX motherboards so this is
very fitting in terms of silverstone is
listening to the market and i'm hoping
that we see more of these types of cases
in the future
thanks so much for watching I'm Dimitri
with hurricane XM we'll see you in next
