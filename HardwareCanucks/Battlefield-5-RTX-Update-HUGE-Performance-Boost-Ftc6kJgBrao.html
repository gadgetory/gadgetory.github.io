week we published our r-tx experience
with balloted five looking at the visual
analysis between the ultra settings too
low and I feel like this shirt is not
really appropriate there we go that's
better
RTX and since then both dice Nvidia have
confirmed there were bugs with his
current r-tx implementation at the ultra
setting so NVIDIA rolled out updates so
that's great and NVIDIA promises over
50% which is great and now let's update
might be a 5 games so we can see what
type of performance improvement we can
get dice please luckily the delay wasn't
that long my game has been updated let's
see if the promised performance
improvements are there and hopefully no
visual compromises when our TX is set to
ultra alright let's analyze rottenness
the new inner mac slick tech TR for AI a
liquid CPU cooler now features this
beautifully diffused RGB lining around
the CPU block that can be customized via
this control box or through your
motherboard
it covers 100% of the IHS plus it comes
in two forty to eighty and three sixty
millimeter variants learn more in the
description down below alright so let's
go over my settings quickly I'm running
at 1440p because it's 4k with DXR it's
basically unplayable I disabled those
unnecessary visual effects at the bottom
but as for the important stuff I have
everything set to ultra and including
the DX our reflections and what you're
about to see a performance numbers using
invidious latest drivers so the before
column that is before the game has been
patched but using latest drivers from
Nvidia and after the game has been
patched
just to clarify those two and I'm
running this on the RT X xx atti duke
from msi and the 9900 k alright so
jumping into the first four scene we
immediately see about the 20 FPS boost
with frame rate dropping below 40 before
the update while staying comfortably
above 60 after the update also keep your
eyes on the VRAM usage because after the
update I'm seeing significantly higher
vm consumption and the static scene with
the fire visually to me they are
identical but the FPS on the right has
almost doubled with almost two extra
gigabytes of VRAM usage after the update
the same behavior is observed by looking
into the forest solid 60 + fps
after the update as promised without any
quality difference that I can see and
what I'm really happy to see toe is FPS
not tanking while you're aiming down
sights that was pretty terrible before
the latest update and so I'm sure you're
starting to see the pattern here DX are
on ultra settings after the update
delivers between ten to thirty higher
FPS throughout multiple scenes
whenever the reflections are quite heavy
the sniper gameplay before Nvidia
drivers was absolutely terrible but
after updating drivers and via five you
can see we're close to eighty and that
is absolutely playable basically
whenever the scene is wet and full
reflections and muddy we notice a
substantial boost in FPS without those
reflections becoming less detailed or
grainy but there are sections in the
game where FPS difference is minor like
in the desert tank battle since
reflections are only visible on part of
the tank despite still seeing a much
higher VRAM usage going up in the sky
fps is pretty much the same with before
and after the update because there not
many assets with reflective surfaces now
skiing down the mountain this is the
only instance where vrm usage after the
update is not that much higher but with
slightly better FPS and during
explosions the FPS dip is about the same
so throughout the game after the update
we get playable frame rates at ultra
settings as was promised with the RT x
20 80 TI at 60 FPS plus at 1440p so
performance basically matches what it
was at DX r on low settings before the
update and so if you want to squeeze
more performance with the latest update
and still have all those ray-traced
reflections in your game i recommend
leaving DX r on low because that is an
additional 10 FPS gained versus ultra
now what about multiplayer because
previously it was just a nightmare with
the XR on Ultra setting but now with all
the eye candy it is actually playable
with pretty consistent 60 Plus FPS but
setting DX are setting too low gives me
around 80 to 100 FPS and multiplayer
that is much better for my personal
enjoyment of the game online and this
brings me to some concluding thoughts
the whole launch of ray tracing patch
was absolutely rushed seeing how much
better performance we get with the
latest update on the game and Nvidia
drivers so why couldn't dice just have
waited a few weeks to roll out a working
RT
version of the game like we have now
instead of delivering this terrible
performance with the initial version
with the XR and this whole trend of
incomplete launches within the video
game industry is just so frustrating
because we clearly received a beta
version of r-tx and then they're now
rolling out bits and pieces that should
have been there from the start but let
me know how you feel about this whole
situation obviously performance
improvement is there it's quite
significant it's all in the positive and
I'm not really noticing any visual
differences so that's a good thing
but I am noticing a significantly higher
veeram usage with the latest update and
the 2080 TI has 11 gigabytes of vram
while the 2080 and the 2070 have 8 but
if I'm seeing over 9 gigabytes of VRAM
usage with all the ray tracing enabled
everything in ultra how will that impact
performance on the lower
RTX cards it is good to that we finally
have a playable version with RT x on at
Ultra settings in VF 5 and I'm guessing
it will just pave the way forward for
future games and I'm really excited to
see how RT X and ray tracing is going to
be implemented in future games because
if it's anything like would be a 5 then
it's going to be a rocky start and I'm
hoping that other game developers learn
from this experience all right guys I'm
