competitive gaming is no less intense
compared to competitive racing and
gamers need the most convenient and
efficient way to adjust their seating
position for the ultimate comfort with
the trigger controls users can adjust
their seat height and tilt angle within
0.32 seconds which is eight times faster
than normal chairs guys there's a
there's a funny spelling error in the
user manual but obviously it is read
it's a read gaming chair because it goes
faster but the quick disclaimer before
we move on to the review verdaguer is an
ad partner with hardware canucks however
opinions expressed in this video reflect
solely on the product quality and mike's
my experience with it and not our
relationship with Vertica themselves so
now that's clear a quick message from
our sponsor the new NZXT air RGB fans
can be daisy chained together for
awesome lighting cohesion in your build
with vibrant and accurate color
illumination all easily controlled
through the hue plus via cam software
full details in the description below so
in my previous gaming chair review video
from noble chairs I said the following
but please please please to fix the
backrest back support so it's not a
single flat piece but we have nice lower
back support like a built-in lumbar
cushion that has actual support for
economics and I'm very happy that at
least one gaming chair brand is
following in the footsteps of trying to
be ahead and trying to create truly
economic frame designs that are really
important if you sit in front of your
computer for more than an hour and while
this is part of their gaming series it
is an office chair in disguise which is
a very smart move from vertigo to expand
their already established gaming
demographic the naming scheme here
revolves around two triggers on each
handle that are easily accessible and
have internal cabling connected to the
main mechanism module I have the trigger
350s II which is the most expensive in
the trigger line at $899 while the
trigger 350 is $100 less so the premium
on the special edition includes these
red accents of the leather and the
beautiful paint job of the aluminum
frame past a larger 75 million
wheels that are super quiet and perfect
for hardwood floors Auto no problem with
carpet either and users will have the
options to install wheel Stoppers on the
special edition also and then there's a
trigger 275 which is a more basic model
starting at $5.99 and available in four
colors so price-wise the trigger series
is on the higher end of the spectrum but
they do have 10 year warranty and for
comparison I configure the Herman Miller
Aaron chair which came worth over $1000
to match the specifications of the
trigger 350 that is $7.99 and while this
may seem like a price advantage of
verdaguer is still fairly new new market
however with the overshadowing gaming
reputation it might actually benefit
beginning with the assembly all trigger
chairs arrive pre-built due to the
complicated nature of tooling and
cabling that connects the side triggers
so you just need to connect the wheels
and insert the gas lift and simply place
the chair on top of that the headrest is
removable comes with an appropriate tool
for installation
I left mine off as I don't find it to
add anything to comfort but verdaguer is
actually redesigning this headrest to be
bigger and more comfortable so this
thing will be replaced for the consumer
version one of the best elements on the
chair aside from the beautiful aluminum
frame is the mesh material on the seat
and the backrest it's using dupont TPE
mesh that has no heat concentration upon
contact it's breathable which is so
refreshing coming from a real leather
seat but most importantly the fibers are
capable of withstanding long-term
flexing without losing original
elasticity so this mesh is incredibly
strong with satisfying flexibility given
there's nothing underneath it and the
only imprint you will notice is along
the foam edge at the front that's normal
nothing to worry about as for the skin
to mesh contact it feels fine quite
smooth complemented by incredibly soft
calfskin leather on the edges of the
chair with light verdaguer imprints for
brand recognition and as a whole package
I love what they've done with the color
accents the chair is simply beautiful
and it's only marketed as a gaming chair
because that's where the market is hot
right now so moving on to the frame
customization the right trigger controls
the height that gives you three and a
half inches of extra height so I can
still touch the ground with my feet with
the gas lift at its maximum but for my
height and the standard desk I keep the
chair at its lowest position the left
trigger controls the tilt with 33
degrees available so it's not suitable
to sleep on like on some of the racing
seat designs but it's still
appropriately flexible with a locking
option available there's also a tilt
tension adjustment so whether you prefer
the backrest to tilt easy or require
more force and this would depend on your
build the armrests can rotate in and out
+7 height positions this is particularly
useful if you cross your legs and rotate
the handles out to have more room or
rotate them in for the elbows to rest on
something the click in high positions
are easily distinguishable and the last
setting resets the height to the lowest
position my favorite adjustment however
has to be the lumber control and the
seat location adjustment first of all
the backrest is perfectly contort for
optimal support that can be easily
extended and while this may look
visually insignificant the ability to
fine-tune that angle of the entire back
frame is fantastic on top of that the
lumber cushion is not intrusive it's
fairly thin but can be moved up and down
to fit in that perfect spot for your
lower back then the seat itself can also
be moved forward slightly with a press
of a button that means you have full
customization on how the chair feels and
whether or not you have proper posture
with a seat fully extended in my example
my back is completely supported but with
a seat closer to the back look at my
shoulders they are curved in and I'm
leaning in which is not the correct
posture and this level of customization
is incredible because it's a one size
fits all type of solution that after
configuring to my own body it's the most
comfortable chair I've used for a
prolonged period of time look at my
posture difference between a typical
racing seat design that relies on that
single lumbar cushion in the middle for
back support versus the complete
economic frame of the trigger line and
this was a very important thing for
vertigo to get right which they did to
separate themselves from the rest of the
gaming chair brands
while still offering the market common
racing style seats themselves the
premium price for this level of comfort
has merit in my opinion but vertically R
is almost entering the competition with
the likes of Herman Miller and steel
case with its $5.99 and Knapp dollar
price point while the triggers are
convenient I feel the entire package
encompasses comfort very well at its
core and prioritizes on comfort which is
so awesome so regardless if you're a
gamer if you spend any time in front of
your computer
proper posture is very important and
will avoid back problems later it's
especially true for me coming from
personal example on fitting so much at a
desk writing the script for four hours
editing this video for three hours rinse
repeat something that is solely
unpleasant on the racing style seat and
over the last 30 days I've sat on this
chair for 200 plus hours so I got to
know chair very well and a few things
that I noticed I no longer experience
back strain versus when I was sitting on
the racing style seat because on the
racing style seat I noticed my shoulders
were too far too much forward because of
poor lumbar support but not here the
lumbar support is fantastic and let's
say when I'm going to sleep after an
evening editing session I'm no longer
feeling my back sort of throbbing
something that I unfortunately
experience quite often you know but in
the last year while using a racing style
seat and so because of that because of
this comfort improvement the damn good a
word returns for the trigger 350 so
thank you so much for watching let us
know your thoughts on this introduction
of proper ergonomic chairs within the
gaming realm is verdict you're asking
too much money from gamers for something
of this caliber looking forward to
reading all your comments I'm Dimitri
with our economics thanks so much for
watching we'll see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
