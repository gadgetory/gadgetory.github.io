another day let's go to nan gang but we
have a little surprise so today I'm
Dimitri for the day so I'm gonna be
covering all the cases and I will be
Michael so I'll be taking all the notes
actually I take also notes we can be a
hybrid will be a hybrid even what are
you gonna be he's gonna go check out
lenses all over the place
probably let's go check it out by huge
thanks to Phanteks and SteelSeries for
sponsoring our complex visit
what's up guys I'm Dmitry and this is
Alice Alice my friends is a new
enclosure series that Inwin is launching
not only do they have one unique element
that is the fabric that is the skirt
that is the the coat of the enclosure it
is also made entirely of plastic ok
entirely plastic as the frame itself but
the metal pieces are the motherboard
tray and a power supply / hard drive
cage that is a concept that's so bizarre
to me a plastic enclosure but were they
thinking
but it's $39 so it's an expensive and
they're almost like trying to compete
with IKEA lights it's kind of big
you can populate a light bulb in there
that they actually did that they put a
light bulb inside this case there's like
a light bulb mount inside of it that's
guys cool we're thinking how awesome
would it be to have something like this
beside your nightstand or in your living
room and especially because the fabric
customization is kind of cool so they
will ship with one pattern but the whole
Japanese flowers and different unique
colors solid colors different textures
different like the possibilities are
really cool and you're able to just buy
one frame it comes available and like
blue orange red white this kind of
wooden color we were hoping there was
really something more premium like
aluminum frame itself or maybe wood
parts somewhere else but I guess they're
trying to see if the whole fabric scene
will stick and I'm really hoping that it
will we got to do the selfie so what do
you guys think of Alice is this a
concept that you would actually buy
yourself the thing is when you look at
something like that and the wood I put
it on my desk beside my fancy monitor
beside all my gaming gear probably not
and that's maybe not exactly what this
case is designed for especially at the
lower price point cheaper materials but
the whole attractive point is that
fabric customization were you able to
choose something that suits your
interior or something like that
still supports a 360 at the bottom and
120 at the top and a standard ATX
motherboard and you can make it look
pretty clean like the whole thing is
exposed
all these sections and the only button
would be the power button everything
else in terms of the i/o is accessible
by the motherboard so there is no like
additional USB ports you plug in so yeah
that is Alice let us know if you think
this concept is cool ridiculous would
you buy something like it I would like
to hear well well hello there again wow
these angles are real cool now this my
friends this is what we're here to see
every time at Computex or CES Inwin's
like here's our new signature chassis
that is very expensive and accessible to
everybody and it's always very unique
but this time if the fabric thing was
cool this is and on a completely next
level so what you see here in front of
me are 3d printed models of cases
whoo-hoo who knew so these are like
miniatures so why don't we move over to
the purple one that looks absolutely
amazing in winds really going with
plastic this year we were hoping to see
aluminum but plastic first of all it
looks amazing
based on the paint job and allows you to
actually 3d print something that is
completely unique so really cool what
they're showing a demo behind us of like
you'll be able to go into the software
customize the color and the shape to be
able to drag some sliders and the the
shell will warp into something else and
you can have yourself a completely
completely unique frame
it's what anyone's known for like that
signature look the catch all right the
catch is there it's $4,000 no big deal
right $4,000 but you have something that
like I would totally rock this purple
color so this is another example of like
different color customization and the
actual shape and I really like this
approach even though this is not
something that I'll ever be able to
purchase or ever actually need but as a
as a centerpiece for your hardware and
just doing something different within
the industry I really appreciate what
Inwin's doing with the signature
chassis especially this year where's
Lyle today I don't know
thank God yeah exactly he's probably you
know I don't know defiling my sheets
what do you think of the this thing that
you can
I think it it looks scary I feel like in
my saw it in my house in the middle of
the night with very low lighting it
would freak me out and I'd call the cops
but in pure light it looks really
interesting I think it's definitely a
statement piece what I told Johnny the
rep was that it looks like something
that you would see in like
multi-billionaires house yeah like this
is what a multi-billionaire it stills it
you you get it and you want to just
troll all your friends so you put an ITX
motherboard in there and be like who
cares about the hardware the case cost
more like when you open up like like a
clam and there's like very little meat
inside that would be like the perfect
perfect analogy and now my friends we
got something totally different so this
is the Inwin 309 we originally saw this
at CES and that was kind of like a mess
with a white plastic piece now that's
changed it to black so all the colors
really pop and it's a tempered glass
which is awesome now the whole idea
behind this is to just give you
customization options on the exterior
illumination and I appreciate that
they're doing something different and we
haven't really seen anything like it
from other case brands this is the Inman
309 the bad thing is that it's $230 the
enclosure itself it's based on the three
years three Chasse and unfortunately the
front panel is not compatible with a
three or three because the mounting
holes are different but here you can set
it to like night light candlelight here
I'm gonna I'm gonna move out of the way
so you can notice so it came to light so
nice little actually I think this is a
microphone based we have the sky so
little pixels moved here and there gives
you a bit of a unique perspective on
that front panel you really wouldn't
know that this is an enclosure if you're
looking from the front but we have music
it's based on whatever it's playing you
got some vertex so that is cool how
about how about check this out there are
no games unfortunately but we got
twinkle Time Tunnel yeah that is awesome
like see the color that pops my friends
we have easy EGC okay that is cool
bounce oh nice and we should really wrap
it up before G.Skill really can
believe things over the audio and I lose
my voice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
