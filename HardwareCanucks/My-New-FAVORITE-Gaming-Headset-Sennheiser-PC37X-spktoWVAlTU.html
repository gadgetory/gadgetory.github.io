today let's talk about my favorite pair
what's happening haircut time ha I think
that's better
but guys today we're talking about my
favorite gaming headset now in all black
roll the intro alright people so if
you're looking for a gaming headset
don't wanna be spending too much money
on it and want something that has a good
balance of features in terms of build
quality sound quality microphone and
comfort you of my friend have come to
the right place because I have my
favorite new pair of a gaming headset to
show you this is the master up plus
sanitizer PC 3/7 X now this thing is so
easy to recommend and in fact I've been
recommending the game one pair to
everybody who's been asking like what's
the best gaming headset for $150 and now
you have something identical because the
bc3 7x is based on the game one body
design and a driver design but is now
thirty dollars cheaper let's check it
out the new Toshiba XS 700 external SSD
comes in this beautiful and minimalistic
design its ultra portable form factor is
perfect for creative professionals on
the go and with blazing-fast USB 3 gen 2
transfer speeds and Toshiba's excellent
three-year warranty reliability
shouldn't be a concern
check out the X's 700 from Toshiba down
below so first let's start with comfort
The Game one or the PC three 7x is by
far the most comfortable gaming headset
I've ever tried you know the clamping
force is just right it collapses to
pretty compact pair if you have a
smaller head and they expand also quite
large to accommodate for larger heads
they are plastic but nothing is creaking
and I have gone through only a single
pair in four years so I had to replace
my game one pair because something was
happening with the volume wheel on the
right side but as far as like the build
quality concern you know nothing is
broken on this thing and I just had to
get the volume wheel repaired but
otherwise this thing will last you for
years even if you
supercareful you know the GSP 500 for
example is built like a tank but it is
heavier the clamping force is not as
good as on the the pc3 7x and one of the
reasons why I still prefer this pair or
the much more expensive $220 GSP 500 now
I really appreciate master UPS
collaboration with Sam Heiser and trying
to cut the cost down one of which is I
think the lack of any color on the
headset which i think contributes to
better looks you know despite this being
a gaming headset it's not loud it's
simple it's minimal you know there are
no red color accents like on pretty much
every other gaming headset now nothing
physically has changed so we still get
the volume wheel on the right side it
does not fully mute the headsets or you
can still hear a little bit when it's in
the lowest position the microphone is
muted when it's in the upright position
and you can definitely hear the distinct
click it has a little bit of motion and
yeah overall I just I don't know I think
it offers such a good balance between
like style sound quality feature set and
the microphone quality too and I love
how slim profile they are on your head
they're not completely sticking out and
so you know Sun highs are going towards
the route of like the GSP lineup which
definitely has that different appeal
that you can tell our gaming pair I'm
glad that the pc3 7x for that original
suite in terms of looking super simple
like the game series so what you're
hearing now is the microphone from the
PC 3 7 X it is identical to the game one
lots of body good detail no compression
applied anywhere you know it sounds
natural you could definitely stream with
this let me put on the game one so you
can hear they are identical so now I've
got the game 1 on it sounds just as good
as the PC 3 7x lots of detail good body
one of the best microphones in this
class especially for this price point
now the velour earpads are extremely
comfortable not only to the touch when
they're against your skin but also the
clamping force is just perfect and
despite them being such a low-profile
headset your ears do not make contact
with the interior driver which is
awesome and the wall of the driver is
angled for better sound direction the
are removable
if you want to give them a little bit of
clean because the velour does attract a
lot of lint and hair and skin particles
so that's something to keep in mind the
cable is removable which is awesome
because sometimes that could be a point
of failure so replacement is not an
issue but it is braided so it does kink
easily and it also does pick up quite a
lot of cable noise from when it's
brushing hasty body but it does split
into dual 3.5 millimeter jacks so really
the main selling point for these aside
from the price comfortable quality
microphone quality is the sound quality
and these things sound fantastic in my
opinion the most balanced gaming headset
that you can receive that doesn't sound
muddy not overly bass heavy you have a
lot of detail still it's not overly
harsh it's like a really good sound
signature that definitely deserves the
Sun Heiser name so this pair is an
open-back headset which means you can
hear everything that's happening in your
environment and that is beneficial for
me for multiple reasons number one I
don't miss any packages so if there's
somebody at the door they're knocking or
they're calling me I can hear what's
happening in my physical environment
number two I use the microphone a lot
for phone calls and for game chat which
means I can hear what I'm saying which
is awesome because I hate the feeling of
speaking into the microphone and not
hearing myself I just I don't know I
lose what I'm trying to say when I
cannot concentrate on hearing myself and
obviously the audio advantage of an open
back design is a much wider soundstage
so that your audio environment inside
the game is expanded you can pinpoint
where things are coming from you know
audio has not closed off it's more
expanded so it sounds like you're
listening to something from larger
speakers in the distance which is a
great feeling if you're playing any
open-world games that has you know just
an open environment and you can like
physically feel how distance certain
sounds elements are inside the game now
one thing I will say about the bass it's
deep enough you know it doesn't have to
be like really punchy like on other
gaming headsets and that might be kind
of a negative for you when you receive
this pair put them on jump into your
favorite game and you might be thinking
hey where's my bass and that could be
the
a side effect of your previous pair
being like really muddy and overly
powerful in the bass department that
really muffles out the rest of the
mid-range or the the higher-end treble
stuff whereas with these it's just
balanced enough you can feel the bass
but it doesn't overpower any of the
other frequencies so treble here is
detailed enough as well and it's not
harsh the mid-range is awesome and
overall the combination of like you know
good bass good treble with mid-range and
a really awesome fantastic soundstage is
just like a really good recipe for an
enjoyable experience alright guys so if
you're in the market for a good gaming
headset the p3 7x is hard not to
recommend because it just meets so many
boxes and just over $100 is a fantastic
deal make sure to check it out in the
description below and if you want a
little bit color accent the game one is
still an option for $30 more but why not
save yourself a little bit of money and
go with something like this this is my
new favorite gaming headset guaranteed
thanks for watching we'll see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
