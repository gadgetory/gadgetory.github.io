right now I'm with Ebers place this
would be the first time I shoot a case
review in your area
I'd also learn a lot more of our cases
and perhaps I could do case reviews new
future yes yes to that for sure but also
a second side of first is this review
will be shot entirely on the Sony system
now instead of my Panasonic stuff
alongside Ebers 80 so this is a lot of
room to maneuver you know I can do my
thing over here on this table
not this track Eber while he's doing his
own thing so let's go get the case how
do you carry this up there Eber this is
definitely a workout whoo Ebru cleaning
up the space for me over there even what
you're doing while I'm rolling up this
mouse mat but what's really odd is that
these guys have a weird odor so yeah if
you guys experience the same let us know
in the comments down below
it is actually pretty convenient how
these cases arrive inside a bag I can
see it oh it's a piece of glass it
arrives detached I wonder if like a mesh
version is installed by default wow it's
like gunmetal it's like beautiful it's
like charcoal almost it slightly darker
than the original gunmetal and yes I was
right the mesh is pre-installed by
default so this is the first time
Eber would peel the film it's exciting
let's do it what are you thoughts
it's amazing dude check out that guys
I'm just wait though man this thing can
be a huge fingerprint magnet you see I
mean all right so the HR 400m I feel
like represents kun masters current
direction within the case industry make
sure they cram as many features as
possible make sure that they listen to
as many community members as possible to
so that they could create almost the
perfect case and avoid the you know the
the negative feedback they received from
the H 500 P and so I'm really excited to
build in this thing and actually see
what you know what they've changed with
this new model so uber shooting into
place introduces two challenges one
shooting out on the carpet so all the
tripod is not stable everything is a
little bit shaky and - he does not have
Fred instead we've got George that's
your plan this is my plan but it's so
fake I don't Fred fake friends fake yeah
friends more beautiful yeah cuz you know
that's just George's from Ikea where's
Fred definite my cue fred is unique you
can never buy friend dammit alright
people so the H 500 M let's start with
the price it is a hundred and ninety
nine dollars so it's fifty dollars more
versus the latest age 500 P match case
so what does the fifty dollar premium
gets yeah so here with the HTML hundred
and we have four glass side panels the
front and the top and both side panels
so you have to be a little bit extra
careful with cable management so that
because that of course will be visible
and obviously on the left side that is
kind of standard but I really do like
the side panel mount they've kept the
original one with a secure hold you can
unlock it with a coin or something and
this secondary swivel point which makes
reinstallation and removal of the side
panels so much easier I do like their
new color scheme going on
it's no longer gunmetal gray it's much
darker I would call it like charcoal
gray
it looks fantastic with this new front
panel design - and how the ventilation
wraps around it but there are now more
glossy elements that are annoying to
deal with especially with that front
panel yo that is just full gloss which
has four USB 3 ports and a Type C Gen 2
port the cable for which is really short
and will not reach anything beyond your
24-pin connector obviously the staple
for the H 500 series are the dual 200
millimeter fans where on this case they
are now digital RGB fans which look
fantastic and they move the entire
volume of air of this case per second so
cooling is definitely on point
now the illumination for the fans looks
beautiful there are plenty of effects to
cycle through the solid colors however
our only red green and blue you cannot
choose anything in the middle so we have
all these effects and only three solid
colors which is disappointing unless you
connect a 5 volt addressable RGB header
into your motherboard and have full
software control then but it is a closed
illumination system meaning you cannot
add RGB strips to the controller and
have all them synced up together if you
are water cooling a 360 rad can be
installed at the front as long as you
remove the front shroud piece that gives
us three inches of space but as you can
see the drive cage underneath sticks out
an extra half an inch so keep that in
mind and it can be removed also for more
space and you can also rearrange the 200
mm of fans up top if you wish now I
really appreciate ku masters approach
with this dual paneling design and I
think the m in the model name has dual
meeting modular mesh so you can replace
the mesh with the glass panel that looks
a little bit more elegant or keep the
mesh that also has the clear master logo
and obviously gives you the most airflow
however I don't particularly like the
mounting approach I don't understand why
we have eight screws and individual
rubber washers per screw that falls out
and I think I've already lost a few why
not just have a simple clip system that
you know obviously it would be a lot
more convenient for installation of
course if you are replacing one it's
probably a little bit more permanent so
I get that you have to go through the
hassle only once
however the clip system would be more
convenient
and then our CPU low test with thread
ripper 1950 x at stock settings we are
two degrees cooler with the mesh side
panel the front instead of glass so the
deeper front panel actually makes sense
allows for more cooling despite having a
solid front panel if you decide to go in
the glass one it looks a little bit more
elegant than the mesh but with the mesh
it is definitely cooler the top panel is
glass and now with taller side
ventilation you can also do a 360 right
up here put flexible fan mounts either
closer to the side or the center with a
removable fan bracket for easier
installation outside of the case now I
appreciate the removable top bracket so
you can install your fans and radiator
outside the case however there are no
particular clips to actually mount the
bracket to the actual frame so if it
fits something super heavy and try to
bring it down you'll have to be careful
to make sure to align the mounting
locations to where they're supposed to
be and there are no other aides like
little clips where the bracket kind of
actually sits in place and that's a
little bit unfortunate however the good
thing is the fan bracket is symmetrical
so orientation of it does not matter
when it comes back down now the interior
space is different from previous cases
so we now have a pump bracket installed
by default not sure why since this case
is very much targeted for air cooling
but still nice to have we also have a
GPU support swivel clip that can be
moved on these three rails so you can
have height adjustment and also the
power supply shroud is now angled in
three pieces so the power supply shoud
as with previous cases is modular so
this front section comes out and behind
it we find a drive cage for two Drive
caddies so it can be removed if needed
but look at this angle or section for
the other power supply shroud it's a
little bit unconventional it doesn't
really fit the design and the style of
the interior but my concern is at the
back
and that is because the spacing between
this panel and the actual frame is so
little I don't even know how you can
pass you know a 24 pin cable in here and
the rest of your cables all the way
through here to the main chamber without
potentially impacting this spacing here
because I don't know why this is angled
need to be so closed off and they could
have definitely made this bracket a
little bit more open so routing and
cables will not be such a hassle and so
it looks like Coolermaster heard our
feedback about more plating beside the
power supply to cover up this area
because it's fully exposed and so it's
actually quite cool to have no side
panel on which is what I did with my H
500 P mesh build but this new metal
cover is actually not cable management
friendly and makes the process more
difficult also the RGB controller is
located here it's well hidden and that's
where the reset switch is located but
these stock cables are not routed by
default at all and it's kind of a big
mess that you'd want to cover up
immediately which is where this large
front cover is important that is now on
the spool joint so reinstalling it and
compressing the cables underneath it is
much easier alright so I appreciate
cooler masters approach towards the
modularity of the frame especially when
the power supply shroud you can remove
the front you can remove the drive cage
you can remove the the other part of the
shroud but in order to access this
little panel that has the cooler master
a little cutout here you know I don't
particularly like it I don't I don't
like how it fits in with the design and
so I wanted to remove it potentially
revealing my power supply however this
is on another screw so in order to
access this little panel and this little
screw here you have to remove at least
nine screws to get to this point and
it's a little bit quite unfortunate how
much work you have to do in order to do
something as simple as removing a panel
on a power supply shroud that you don't
enjoy all right so this thing is out and
so far with the H 500 M dealing with the
whole power supply shroud it's like a
screw removing simulator there's just
way too many screws on here but I do
appreciate that at least almost all of
them are consistent so you know you know
when you have to go repopulate things
all the paneling pack you don't have to
like miss play certain screws because
almost all of them are the same alright
people so let's build a system
we're designed to go in an e ATX
motherboard this gigantic beautiful Zema
thing the zenith is
the zenith extreme because the case is
pretty large and we are air cooling
which is most likely what this case is
targeted for because of those giant 200
millimeter fans and because the case is
pretty long I wanted to go with an ATX
motherboard so we at least occupy some
that space internally so ATX
inside the H 500 M let's see how stacks
up
now because we are using an ATX
motherboard you can see over here that
this entire section on the right side of
the motherboard is completely blocked
off because the motherboard covers our
rubber grommets so I cannot pass any of
the cables so we have to remove this
entire section here in order to actually
have space to route our cables now one
unfortunate turn of events when we start
to do our cable management is there are
no cable tie openings underneath the
motherboard so if you have to route
anything to the left side of the
motherboard it has to cross this entire
section at the bottom because when the
power supply shroud is on top this whole
area becomes inaccessible and yeah
routing cables at the bottom the
motherboard becomes super inconvenient
now here I am building a system and I'm
thinking wait a second coolermaster
forgot to include SSD caddies inside a
super expensive case but no we have
these pegs that insert into the SSD and
then for each of the SSD mounts we have
these rubber grommets and you simply
insert the SSD like this now the case is
beautiful and is obviously targeted for
RGB showcase which is why we added the
TB RGB fans from Animax that are
beautifully glowing with those ring
illumination that looks absolutely
fantastic I can control the lighting
with the remote control which is nice
and nice and simple and I can also
connect them to the motherboard to have
that full control and after I assemble
the system I realized that I don't
particularly like to reveal the power
supply so in order to install back that
little piece I would have to remove the
entire shroud install it back with a
screw and then populate the whole thing
back which is annoying and you know I
just wish it was like a simple clip-on
little piece that will go on the shroud
for convenience now in regards to cable
management coolermaster have added this
additional piece beside the power supply
it makes sense and this is something
that I've been asking for ever since the
release of the original because now we
have a tempered glass side panel and a
total obviously makes sense to make sure
to cover as much of the cable mess as
possible and the only complaint here I
have is that the because of this new
addition the cutouts underneath the
motherboard are no longer present so
they're missing and that means that you
have to route all your cables from this
side that needs to go underneath and
that's kind of
kind of an issue but to my surprise
despite the small area that allows your
ody cables to exit further from the
power supply shroud no issues there they
all pass through and now this little
door has a little hinge so it can stay
like this it can swivel to open and so
you still have to compress it quite
heavily in order to make sure that it is
closed but with some tweaking and
spending a little bit more time on cable
management you can definitely make sure
that this whole area looks pristine and
even though if you put the tempered
glass side panel on here it will
actually look pretty beautiful alright
Eber so now that you've witnessed the
case review process what do you think of
the H 500 m to be honest the whole
process of building was a little bit
difficult especially with the power
supply shout it was very difficult for
us to actually manage the cables at the
back into the motherboard and the other
thing is of course considering the e-atx
compatibility that's something to keep
in mind because although this case
supports EA TX routing cables could be a
challenge especially if you especially
with the 24 pin connector you might not
be able to fit that that panel or
whatever that is properly so those are
some of the things that you need to keep
in mind but overall I have mixed
feelings about the H 500 M and so as
Eber said with our ei TX set up the side
bracket cannot be installed back into
the case because it is simply not tall
enough for the cables to bend properly
and so the HR foundered M once the
system is assembled gives me mixed
feelings because I love the exterior
design direction I think this is the
best looking H 500 series case so far
also the modular front plate is a
brilliant idea I definitely want to see
more like it but I don't know if the
interior changes were necessary like the
angled power supply shroud that to me
does not match the interior design I do
like the departure from the SSD carries
to a toolless mount but the two spots on
top the shroud are a complete painter
out because you need to remove the power
supply completely and for $199 case I
feel like I should not have to fight it
in order to simply pre route my IO
cables and for you know an ATX
motherboard you have to remove an
integral part of the interior to have
the system complete
I don't think that should happen and
throughout my experience with the Asia
funded P the mesh and now this I have
not had a consistent experience and I
actually prefer the shroud design on the
H of hundred P match and of course you
can build a beautiful system inside the
H 500 M I feel like it's been designed
to be this beautiful showcase piece with
glass slightly darker color the new
ventilation pattern that looks really
kind of recipe yet elegant and I would
not have any issues having this beside
my table but I feel like the interior
modularity is not exactly where it needs
to be to be completely user friendly and
I feel like I'm constantly trying to
fight the case in order to remove some
panel in order to route some cables
where they need to be and this is like
for the default configuration and yes we
are using an e ATX motherboard but I
feel like the case of this caliber and
this size should accommodate an e ATX
system without any compromises but let
me know what you guys think about the
$200 aged 500 M in the comments below
