all-new redeveloped hybrid full tower
that is bound to have plenty of people
excited with this new switch 8/10 reason
being the new a10 rings in at $169 and
with an overflowing list of
specifications it seems as if NZXT
did not miss anything on the chassis or
did they well let's find out
first the exterior all around has a
piano gloss finish which isn't really an
issue but you will have to clean from
fingerprints
however the fingerprints should be less
of a concern for the white version and
here you have the virtual 360-degree
tour of our studio and the case is
elevated but we found to be quite
unstable just because it's quite light
with all these plastic parts the power
button is singled out and placed on the
top with the rest of the front panel
connectors hidden behind the cover with
your USB 2 and USB 3 ports an SD card
reader something we haven't seen in the
while your headphone jacks and reset an
LED button that controls the lights at
the back the USB 3 ports connector
internal 20 pin cable and no USB 3
adapter is included next up are the
optical base which can be removed from
the front with an included hot-swap
docking station with support for 3.5 and
2.5 inch drives below that a removable
cover with a built-in dust filter with
support for do 120 or 140 Milner fans
and another dust filter right underneath
for the bottom intake fans which we'll
take a look at a bit later the side
window is a nice addition no fan mounts
here just a nice simple looking panel
that adds the view of everything that's
important on the inside at the back the
rear exhaust fan can be moved up or down
depending on your internal configuration
on your area 9 PCI slots with enlarged
water cooling holes and they bottom out
the power supply with a removable dust
filter the top panel has this open
closed ventilation design either for
extra airflow or sound isolation which
can be opened using this sliding
mechanism but over use may definitely
cause damage as it's all made of plastic
it would have been nice to see sometimes
dust filter when the ventilation is open
just
to minimize the dust buildup and since
the case is specifically designed for
water cooling triple and even quadrats
are supported at the top with both 120
and hundred forty member fans and
cushion pool configuration and cut outs
are available for wiring for the top
fans now the native triple rod support
that has plenty of room for a push and
pull configuration is quite rare at this
price point and this is one of those
features that make the chassis more
competitive and appealing to a larger
market finally let's get inside the case
and take a look at what it has to offer
first the side panels are held in by
three thumb screws and the middle must
be first loosened up and pushed down to
unlock the side panel and starting with
the CPU cutout it is spacious and will
support motherboards with high CPU
placement then we have an abundance of
quality rubber grommets spread out
through the entire motherboard tray to
compensate for different motherboard
sizes and power supply lengths and the
power supply is elevated by a rubber
feet moving on the other side three
optical drive base use the toolless
mounting system with the thumb screws
provided to secure the other side and
hot-swap SATA and power connections are
not discrete but should be fairly easy
to wire through now the two hard drive
cages are removable and support three
drives using an tools bracket with SSD
support and in case the system is in
transit you can lock the drives in place
with screws the drives can only be
accessed from the back which means only
the backside panel must be removed if
you need to get access to the drives and
each of the hard drive cages support 120
140 millimeter fan which you can
actually angle towards your graphics
cards and generally into that
motherboard area for a more direct
airflow and not just into your power
supply now the bottom supports do 120
140 millimeter fans and then the bottom
of hard drive cage is removed a dual
route can be installed and this is where
the front dust filter is crucial to keep
a dust free interior so have you lost a
fan cam gear let's summarize the airflow
possibilities for this chassis first the
top can do a push and pull configuration
with three fans on either side that is
six panes in total for the top we have a
rear exhaust and dual front intake do a
hard drive cage fan mouth
and one can be installed for the bottom
intake as long as the cage fan is angled
and orders the bottom intake fan that
has plenty of clearance from our long
power supply unlike some cases that
don't have clearance or very tight
fitted with longer power supplies and if
the bottom hard drive cage is removed
dual bottom and thick fans can be
installed whose sole purpose is for
water cooling and notice every single
fan mount supports both 120 140 million
fans which is perfect as they have
become the standard and they're really
common on most enclosures now installing
a triple right at the top is possible
but you must remove a couple of things
first and that is the walls on each side
of the chassis which is quite a tedious
process with removal of 14 screws in
total and it doesn't seem like NZXT
thought this through as the cat out on
the wall is closed in with all the front
panel connectors passing through meaning
you cannot remove the panel without
first backing up all the cables and the
word of caution make sure to do this
before you begin your build let's take a
quick look at the back we have plenty of
room to work with and the rubber
grommets that are wide and strong enough
for all the cable management and we have
many cables and mounting scattered
around that should come in handy during
installation and also something really
simple but unique is a three pin fan hub
which can house seven fans all powered
by one morgg's connector this is an
excellent way to clean up all the fan
cables and since it's attached with
Velcro the user can be flexible with
mounting of this unit and since this is
a full Tower the length of your 8 pin
CPU connector could definitely be of a
concern and NZXT provides a sleeved
extension for your Athan cable now we've
seen extensions be provided for some
full towers mostly in high price range
that were not sleet so definitely a big
plus to n64 including this as part of
the accessories and starting off with
the assembly the bracket for the 3.5
inch drive is fine but mounting SSDs may
become a bit tricky that's because the
mounting holes for SSDs are pushed in
with little clearance for your SATA
power cable as you need to use the end
SATA power cable on your power supply or
use an adapter as otherwise it won't
have clear
another minded but potentially
frustrating air that should not be
overlooked in future designs and fully
assembled the switch 8/10 show keys is
the glory of spacious and tidy interior
which is absolutely a breeze to work
with and is actually enjoyable the
graphics cards in length of 14 inches
are supported with the hard drive cage
installed so currently every graphics
card on the market is supported and with
the side panel closed the chassis shows
off all the hardware that should be
pleasant sight for any configuration I
know there's been a lengthy one so let's
wrap this up quickly
the switch 810 is one unique chassis
that incorporates absolutely everything
be seen to GS need and that is full
dustproof enclosure water clean support
choose your pick for any radiator size
future-proof with any hardware support
either your GPU or CPU cooler size
storage needs with seven drives
absolutely brilliant airflow options
with 10 fans and a very simple and clean
cable management and all that in a sweet
spot of $169 it brings it all together
and the value that consumers will
appreciate of course those who want to
utilize most of the available functions
however while you are getting a lot for
such a price it comes at a cost of
quality since the top and front panels
are made entirely of plastic the build
quality is compromised and we find the
removal process for the sidewalls for
the radiator in big awkward and it
should have been made easier but NZXT
really impressed us with this new switch
810 and honestly surpassed our
expectations with the total package and
the chassis deserves the damn good
innovative award and possibly settling
in some new standards for the enclosure
market take guys for watching and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
