starting to become popular among gamers
these days not only are they compact and
portable for gamers on the go but
they're also designed for consumers who
have a lot less space on their desk to
work with I've been using the white box
for about seven months now and I love
using it every single day everything
from the build quality to the switches
to the design stole my heart from day
one but recently I've been spoiled by
another ting keyless keyboard from
Logitech and I have to admit it's
perfect for what I mean check this out
the fans XP 400s which is one of the
best miss hours on the market get a sexy
upgrade now with the tempered glass side
panel with a comfortable rubberized
mount to show off the gorgeous system
with an RGB LED strip included get your
glass on with the fans XP 400s plans not
included so this is what I was talking
about the Logitech G pro mechanical
gaming keyboard now you may ask yourself
isn't this a g8 and gaming keyboard
without a numeric pad and to answer that
question it is indeed a mini version of
the flagship g8n mechanical keyboard but
you're not losing a lot feature wise you
see Logitech has designed the G pro for
professional eSports and people who are
accustomed to the romaji switches but in
a 10 kilos mechanical keyboard design it
does not come cheap though priced at
$130 this will certainly hit your wallet
plus there are competitive mechanical
keyboards that offer a few extra goodies
that disk doesn't so let's dive in to
find out what made up my mind to switch
to the G pro as my daily driver first
and foremost it's the size I mean just
look at it the G Pro comes with a
functional layout that just works well
for my tasks that may not be the same
for you since peripherals are highly
subjective category there are no
dedicated macro buttons and no any
separate media playback keys it's
designed with simplicity in mind and
that's what I love about the G Pro the
build quality is great which is due to
the steel backplate that's hidden within
the chassis and as you can see it barely
flexes no matter how hard I push it with
this there's a little chance it'll Bend
when someone decides to bring
with them to a land party or on a trip
the top panel is made out of a hard
plastic material that comes in a matte
finish which doesn't attract finger
prints although the sides of the
keyboard are glossy so keep that in mind
unfortunately logitech does not include
a detachable wrist rest to complement
the cheap pro for $130 I expected this
as an addition but the g8n shares the
exact same problem so if you're looking
for a keyboard with a wrist rest you
might have to look elsewhere on the
other hand the lack other wrist rest
does keep the compact nature of the GE
pro the lack of dedicated macro buttons
could be a deal-breaker for some but
Logitech has smartly implemented
programmable commands through the
function keys and this can be configured
through the driver software
and while you do lose the native
function commands you can create a
different profile through the software
and keep those default settings intact
plus you can cycle through those four
files with this button so that's
convenient the cable is grated and it's
fairly thick not Corsair k95 big but
flexibility is minimal I had no issues
writing it from my PC to the keyboard
which brings me to my next point
it's removable and it uses a micro USB
port for power and data this was
primarily designed for easier packing
and long-term durability plus the
connector features extra reinforcements
to keep the cable nice intact so that's
awesome the bottom comes with five
rubber pads to prevent the chassis from
sliding and it works perfectly you also
get three step angle adjustments to
angle the keyboard at your desired
setting the start of attraction with
every Logitech mechanical gaming
keyboard is their custom design romaji
switch which incorporates lighting right
at the center of the stem and in turn it
outputs a uniform and consistent
lighting per key so it avoids the
brightness gradient found on standard
Cherry MX switches the end result is
just stunning to look at the
backlighting is bright and it doesn't
spill underneath which I love plus with
the RGB integration you can play around
with different colors and effects
through the gaming software the romaji
switch mount is not something you'd find
on a typical MX switch so finding
replacement key caps could be a
challenge but let's talk about that
switch for a moment it's not a
derivative of a typical MX switch and
it's not meant for everyone
actuation is at 1.5 millimeters and it
only requires 45 grams of force to
register
there's a slight tactile bump when you
press a key and it's fast but not overly
so if I were to compare it to a much
faster switch like the cherry MX speed
switches found on the K 95 platinum the
almighty takes second place while these
switches are nice and tactile the lets
out force is non-existent and that's due
to the shallow depth of the switch
whereas an MX which has that physical
element at the center followed by a
spring to give you that rebound it does
take time getting used to and I highly
recommend you try it out at a store
before pulling the trigger let's have a
listen to how they sound gaming of the
Roma G switch felt a little awkward at
first since I transitioned from the MX
speed switches on the K 95 platinum it
took me some time to get through
battlefield 1 and overwatch and I
definitely notice the lack of the
liftoff force that I mentioned earlier
on a positive note these switches are
lighter so finger fatigue is completely
out of question Logitech has also
implemented a highly optimized micro
control unit for faster signal
processing it's essentially a
complicated way of saying that since the
Roma G switches are designed for high
quality and position the internal logic
board can process input a lot faster
than a traditional keyboard it doesn't
really matter in full practice but let's
say over a competitive csgo seasoned
gamers will save some latency time and
the last thing to cover here is the
software experience and I cannot
emphasize this enough Logitech has one
of the best driver software's in the
market if you only a logitech gaming
peripheral this would just be a plug and
play method for you because it's a
unified software for all of their
peripherals in my case I'm greeted with
a physical overview of the keyboard and
you can easily assign macro commands to
the function keys through f12 Logitech
has also pre-programmed a handful of
commands that users can take advantage
of which is cool you can create profiles
and play around with the lighting
speaking of lighting each key can be
customized to a particular color and
are six different lighting effects to
choose from including static breathing
star effect color cycle color wheel and
key press since this is a unified
software the RGB colors can be synced
across all Logitech G Series devices on
your system meanwhile Logitech allows
for one single RGB profile to be saved
in the keyboards onboard memory going a
bit deeper into the software there's a
possibility of customizing profiles for
every game in your collection while
running in the background
the software will auto detect which game
is being used and automatically switch
over to that profile it's really well
done
so to conclude the G Pro from Logitech
delivers an interesting take on being a
10 keyless keyboard the build quality is
great the simple design is very
appealing to me and the lighting is just
amazing features like a removable cable
excellent software and a fast logic port
are nice additions especially for
competitive gamers the Roma G switches
do take a while to get used to if
they're coming from an MX chary
experience but they're fast and don't
require a lot of force to actuate and
the last thing to address here is the
price and $130 it is an expensive
investment and you have to be careful in
terms of what you're getting for that
price personally I would buy it
but as usual I'd recommend you check out
one in person to see if the one woody
switches are to your liking so what are
your thoughts on the new Logitech G Pro
mechanical gaming keyboard does the 10
kilos design interest you would you
consider giving the romaji switch as a
try let us know in the comments down
