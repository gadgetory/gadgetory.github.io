claimed to be this multitasking monster
very appealing for creators and I can
finally attest to that claim and I am so
happy I switched to the eight core
sixteen thread 1700 X CPU for my main
workstation PC find out why right after
this investment stores that makes a
difference choose toshiba Rd 400 and vme
SSDs that are incredibly fast and
reliable
backed by advanced warranty programs so
you can focus on what matters
Rd 400 check it out from the description
below
so goodbye 67 100k you have certainly
very well and remember I started using
the skylake machine because it was
rendering videos faster than my previous
6ko workstation machine so in this video
we'll talk about my experience with the
79 X how it handles not just video
editing but other intensive tasks for my
everyday life you know in front of the
computer so we're not just exporting
videos but we're doing exporting videos
while playing games
exporting videos while doing many other
things in the background and it
absolutely crushes the 6700 K I'm sorry
it's not me to you I want to do one of
the things while I'm exporting a video
I'm going to see 12 CPU utilization bars
and we'll just eight we've had a good
run but really I just want to try
something new
Raisa maybe let's see if it was a cool
case after all
and
so I'm very excited about the new
motherboard I went from the Z 270
Maximus 8 hero alpha to the crosshair 6
hero and absolutely loved the rear i/o
so many USB ports plus that type c41
that eventually catches up I am only
using 32 gigabytes of RAM instead of the
64 I had on a static machine but I gotta
be honest it's very refreshing to have
an AMD CPU once again right now I'm only
assembling a test system inside the s3
40 and I'm still waiting on a case very
excited to show you guys what I'll be
using plus taking a whole different
approach on cooling so subscribe to not
miss that upcoming video and in order to
properly test the 79 3 X in my personal
sort of workflow environment I had to
design a few benchmarks to explore its
full potential so I said to the few
sympathetic benchmarks multiple render
tests with Adobe Premiere and 4k 1080p
and 1080p 60 and for my multi stress
environment I had a game downloading and
steam I was watching a 4k video
refreshing a webpage every 10 seconds
while exporting a video which is a very
common scenario in my day life and then
for the last test I was rendering the
video in the background while playing
overwatch and recording frame times and
exporting times to see which CPU was
faster and for the GPU I'm sticking with
a GTX 980 from EVGA the FTW edition it
has served me very well it's a super
quiet card and I can overclock it
through easily to gigahertz without
breaking a sweat
so the first deal business was to update
the BIOS on the motherboard as the
system was constantly crash if I
tinctures it with any of the overclock
settings but damn seeing all 16 threads
occupied at full load that is a happy
feeling my friends now let's get on with
the benchmarks and up first is the fire
strike benchmark that scores less on AMD
about 7% loss that we don't see anymore
with the fire strike ultra with the DX
12 times pi benchmark the AMD system on
the CPU side scores significantly higher
and again in this multi-threaded
workflow like Cinebench r15 my
overclocked 1700 X gets a 40% better
score versus the overclocked 6700 K
moving on to premiere this is the most
important for my daily use exporting a
one-minute 4k file on the right
is much faster although I am curious why
we don't see a difference in encoding
times with in stock and overclock on a
17 100x the same story continues by
exporting in 1080p file again the
overclock on the 1700 X doesn't seem to
matter but it is faster versus the
static machine where I did notice
difference and faster render times is
with a nine-minute 1080p60 export with a
1700 X completing the task much faster
saving us over three minutes when both
CPUs are overclocked but what I was most
surprised about is the multitasking
benchmark in which I had that 4k video
playing in the background a webpage
refreshing downloading a game and
rendering that nine-minute vlog it seems
that the extra threads on the 1700 X
really help to export that video much
faster in comparison was only a 6%
increase on export times versus nothing
in the background while the socratic
machine took a 16% hit on export times
more interestingly though when I try to
gain while exporting a video in the
background here my encoding times again
the 79 you expose far ahead but
surprisingly in comparison to the
control point of rendering the video
without playing the game it took 30%
more time to render the video on the
overclocked 1700 X versus only 22% more
time at stock settings I'm not sure why
this is happening in comparison to the
control point but still we are exporting
faster when we are overclocked but
seeing that 30 versus 20% difference to
the control point is interesting and
will have to be explored as far as the
gameplay goes on a skaldak machine over
watch was totally unplayable a lot of
micro Sutter it was very hard to aim
very unpleasant while a totally
different experience on the 1700 X with
much smoother aim still not super
comfortable but a lot more playable with
actually higher fps and much stronger 99
percentile framerate so you would not
dip as low or as often as on the 6700 K
I also performed warp stabilizer which I
use quite often so the skylight chip
takes to win here but my editing
workflow revolves around proxies
rendering a low resolution file with
which you edit and it's much smoother
playback on the timeline
but when
so exporting is you're using the full 4k
resolution files so exporting those
proxies on the 79 recs again was a much
faster experience versus uh skylake chip
oh hey there NCI XCOM is Canada's
leading a tailor for anything your mind
desires just keep within those
categories which are plenty and get
tempted by the weekly deals visit ncx
comm for all them sweet deals so what I
gotta say I'm impressed I was not
expecting the 1700 X to be much faster
with those render times I thought that
the 67 100k and the 4.5 gigahertz
because of those higher frequencies
would be you know just like a clear win
in Adobe Premiere because other we love
the clock speeds but with the eight core
16 threads it seems to you know give
that that balance even though we have a
much lower frequency so I can save time
on exporting and can comfortably do
things in the background so let's say
creating my thumbnails and Photoshop or
watching a 4k video without having that
significant hit on the encoding times
that we saw with the skylit machine so
in this video I want to show the
performance metrics that matter to me so
if you want to see the full gaming
benchmarks I'll link our full review
down in description below so what I'd
like to do now is get that case for me
and also replace the beefier cooler so
that we can get those temperatures under
control and see how far we can push it
if the four gigahertz mark gives us any
extra performance so make sure to
subscribe for all that so guys let me
know if you're as impressed with the
performance of the 1700 XS I am and also
stay tuned for all the updates that are
coming up very soon I'm Dimitri when I
recognize thanks so much for watching
we'll see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
