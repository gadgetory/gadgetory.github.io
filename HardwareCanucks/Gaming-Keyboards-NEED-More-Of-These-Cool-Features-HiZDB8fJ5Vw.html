gathered Computex I also have this one
from ducky good times good times
well hello good people I'm Dimitri and
our trip to Taipei for Computex had
really opened up our eyes about
keyboards in general we weren't really
into this whole boutique / premium /
affordable brands like ducky Leopold or
Vermeil oh but now it got us thinking
that the gaming keyboard scene is
becoming a bit stale so brands like
Corsair Logitech SteelSeries Razer ASUS
have fantastic gaming reputation in the
keyboard space but they all have
basically the same keyboard with slight
design variations although I will
appreciate the different variations of
mechanical switches that basically is
what the deterrent of maybe you picking
a steelseries keyboard / Logitech one
and so on today's video I would like to
discuss my favorite keyboard features
that I would love to see expanded into
the gaming keyboard market because let's
face it the fact is that gaming
keyboards now are becoming way too
boring
the masterfan series from Coolermaster
has now received a fresh new look with a
square frame designed to generate high
pressure airflow and silent operation
the fans feature this beautiful
addressable RGB illumination and you can
pick it up in 120 240 and 360 millimetre
variants learn more in the description
down below alright so one of the latest
keyboards I have landed here in the
studio is the ROG Strix scope and it's
actually the keyboard that inspired this
whole conversation I would love your
input and all the points that are to
follow so this one in particular has two
unique elements one is the oversized
control key that is the same width as
the North American layout Shift key and
they've literally received an innovation
of the word for this control key alone
now is it actually anything special as a
crouch key actually yes so if you play
with your keyboard angled like this the
pinky finger doesn't have to reach to
avoid the Windows key and thus it's
really awesome for FPS gamers larger
control key more area for your pinky to
make mistakes and therefore you will
still press it without needing to reach
for a tiny control instead this
non-traditional layout also pushes the
spacebar to the right giving you
more comfortable reach to the Alt key
but that is something that I had to
train because I'm not really used to
using my thumb for anything other than
the spacebar which by the way on the
scope is also slightly shorter the
second cool element on the scope is the
privacy key that minimizes your desktop
and mutes the audio of course you can do
this yourself with windows d to go into
the desktop however that does not
include the mute functionality so it's
cool that Asus is thinking about ways to
integrate some sort of this Universal
shortcut that I will probably use once
in a while and you will to and love to
hear what you think about different
macros that you use on daily basis that
would be really cool to have on a gaming
keyboard so will share your thoughts in
the comments we've also seen plenty of
secondary wheel integrations on
keyboards that could replace several
macro keys I like what Drevo has done
with this low profile easy to access
wheel on the side it's not just the
volume wheel I like what SteelSeries is
doing with the new apex line that
there's not intrusive and hold multiple
functionalities now I appreciate the
effort of including additional key caps
most of the time they are just wast keys
in different color like the silver ones
for the scope keyboard or different
texture and contours with the Corsair
keyboards but what about unique Escape
keys or different graphics on the space
bars or just spreading out a little
design flares here and there that isn't
too much but shows you that your brand
cares about sort of this whole brand
building and recognition there are some
really insanely detailed key caps
available from companies like dwarf
Factory or hot keys project and I'm not
advocating $30 per key caps I just hope
that brands gaming brands use that for
inspiration for example I got this key
cap from gamers storm and they don't
even make keyboards that I use on my
Escape key looks pretty cool and I would
love to see a few ROG themed key caps on
future gaming keyboards or some cool
low-profile ones from Logitech it
doesn't have to be super fancy or
expensive just has to align with the
brand
imagine having a really cool Escape key
that has little texture or different
graphic on it or maybe the same thing
with the Enter key or the spacebar it
would definitely elevate that gaming
brand keyboard above the rest because we
haven't seen anything like it
in the gaming market we've seen so many
of those
the enthusiasts keyboard market where
you buy key caps and you swap them out
but having something that's standardized
on the gaming space would be really cool
and I'm not even talking about PBT
double shot key caps which feel amazing
and that really premium and only a few
handful of keyboards actually have PBT
key caps like the Corsair k70 mark 2 RGB
and I know this isn't for everybody but
I would love to have this verge of of
gaming keyboards merging with this whole
like enthusiast community of keyboards
are / mechanic keyboards is a really
fantastic place to explore all types of
ideas but gaming brands I'm hoping are
taking note but what's under the key cap
is even more important like quality
stabilizers and you know there's more to
mechanical switches that MX cherry and I
love the trend of companies making their
own like putting with liquor switches
large tech with romaji steel series with
a new omni point switch and even HyperX
is making their own switch taking
chances to set the keyboard apart from
the rest is one trend that I appreciate
most with gaming brands also it would be
great to have full height adjustability
and not just the two levels that we see
on most 99% keyboards high customization
is something that's very important for
typists and so that leaves us with the
cable I personally love a removable and
non braided light cable like on the
driver Blademaster te and if you guys
recall my Onix had a coiled cable on the
way keyboard that looked really awesome
and most of the time now all we have are
hard non removable braided cables with
the only advantage of having cable
routing built into the bottom of the
keyboard like with the scope and Corsair
keyboards - but coarser keyboards have
the built-in USB pass-through on many of
them which makes the cable really thick
and the last thing I will say is the
font on majority of gaming keyboards
just pisses me off why does it have to
be this ugly aggressive bulky stretchy
weird font on majority of keyboards that
come from all these gaming brands why
can't be simple clean letters and
numbers that you can appreciate that
still looks fine in this aggressively
aluminum body and so my perfect vision
of future gaming keyboards lies in this
like Hybrid territory where you can tell
it's a gaming keyboard maybe by
certain keyboard switches like the
spacebar the the Escape key or the enter
but the rested body remains clean and
almost minimal but still has a bit of
character as to what the brand tries to
achieve and tries to deliver with the
combination of that law sweet sweet
diversity of mechanical switches and I
know I'm not the only one frustrated
with gaming keyboards every single new
one that comes out it's like what is new
it's the same thing that we've seen for
the last five years but with a slightly
different body and maybe some little
tiny little features here and there but
none that have come out that says hey
I'm a perfect hybrid here by me for our
canadian audience memory Express is your
place for all types of electronics and
hardware goodies with fantastic prices
great customer service and uber price
guaranteed with stores in BC Alberta
Manitoba and the new Saskatoon location
everything is linked below thank you
very much all right guys I'm Dimitri
thanks much for watching let me know
what you think about this whole
discussion have you found your perfect
keyboard yet for the hybrid
functionality gaming productivity typing
whatever whatever let us know in the
comments thanks much for watching check
out this other relevant content and I'll
talk to you in next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
