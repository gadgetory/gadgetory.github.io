showcase in this pilot episode we're
gonna be taking a spin around a case
designed by manufacturer in media the HD
PC 1000 B the 1000 B is designed for
home theater use and has a great set of
features that really help it to stand
out it comes in both silver and black
however for today we're only going to be
demoing the black model the case is
available at a number of online Canadian
retailers for roughly 125 dollars so
let's take a look first off we're gonna
take a quick look at the dimensions and
we see that this case is well suited for
a media environment it's gonna fit in
really nicely with your other home
theater equipment it is 17 inches wide
stands 5.4 inches tall with the optional
feet and is sixteen point three inches
in length
zooming down to the front panel we see
it's constructed of a very clean-looking
anodized aluminum this gives it a modern
brushed appearance the clean look is
continued by hiding both the dvd-rom and
front ports behind hinge doors the
lettering and logos used subtle colors
and texturing and only the reflective
silver reset and power buttons appear to
stand out the 1000 B looks great it's
got class but it doesn't steal the show
the front panel also has a 20 by 2 inch
area which is used to display the
optional LCD a feature we're going to
take a look at later as we check out the
front ports we have a full assortment in
the first cluster audio and microphone
jacks eSATA USB and firewire and to the
right a seven and one card reader and
another USB port rotating now to the
back we see that there has been effort
in ensuring decent ventilation in the
case something that's often overlooked
on most media cases we have well
ventilated side panels as well as vents
on the top and over the CPU one of the
best features about the 1000 d is that
has support for full ATX power supplies
as you can see here by the mounting area
on the back there's also the i/o space
and 260 millimeter exhaust fans as the
case is intended for M ATX motherboards
there are only four expansion Bay slots
however these are full height expansion
slots and not nearly half fight so no
adapters required and as we pull away
the top panel is held down by two thumb
screws which makes it really easy to get
into and mess around on the left side
panel another example of the efforts put
into ventilation an air intake port with
a 92 millimeter fan opening things up to
the interior of the case we have our M
ATX motherboard tray with mounting
screws already in place an up top
there's plenty of room for a regular ATX
power supply this isn't gonna fit any
thousand watt behemoths but it is gonna
work for most reasonably sized power
supplies and for those who haven't yet
invested in a modular power supply
there's plenty of room underneath the
drive bays to stow cables and keep
things clean again we see our 60
millimeter exhaust fans which are
described as silent a little interesting
note and media decided to go with a
molex connector instead of a typical
three
pin fan connector that plugs directly
into the motherboard this means that the
hardware installer is gonna have to run
the cable across the face of the
motherboard or up and around to plug it
into the power supply instead of just
being able to put it straight into a
motherboard fan header the drive tray is
a solid unit for all the drives so it
easily slides out but it takes all the
drives with it
there is a single five and a quarter
inch bay and for three and a half inch
bays the two on the top and the two
sitting sideways underneath now
strangely the two bottom trays both have
rubber grommets so as to reduce
vibration from the hard drive however
you don't see them on either of the top
two next we take a look at air flow a
critical component of any case
especially media cases with their
smaller form factors and often cramped
interiors the 1000 B has a simple
concept it pulls fresh air through the
front and expels the warm air of the
back as we saw earlier the case is well
ventilated and with some clean wiring
each should not be a problem as we've
touched a few times on the ability to
cleanly wire the case let's take a look
at things when fully assembled all the
cables fit nicely underneath the drive
bays which keeps the area over the
components clean and clutter-free and
while adding drives to the bottom two
trays will decrease the amount of room
there still should be plenty of space
another important issue with many media
cases is the options available for
aftermarket coolers and video cards
unfortunately the 1000 B was not all
that friendly with aftermarket coolers
in testing with an average-sized
aftermarket cooler that stood 5 inches
tall there was still a little more than
an inch that stood above the top coolers
are going to have to be less than 4
inches tall in order to make the cut and
while it appears that our 4 inch tall
4870 video card is a bit too tall for
the case and the top panel is slid on
there's a hairsbreadth of space between
there's also enough length for 9 inch
video cards with 10 inches of space
enough for the video card and rear
position power plugs
finally we jump back to the front panel
and the LCD one thing to keep in mind is
that the LCD is not included with the
case it is an optional feature that must
be purchased separately and while it is
a bit of a gimmick it is definitely a
fun gadget the coloration makes it
perfect to work in both light and dark
situations it has a dark green or black
background with light green lettering
the LCD in software integrate with just
about everything it supports both Vista
and XP media centers and monitors a
whole host of other features from system
to networking and even email updates and
for those feeling a little adventurous
or just bored you can even design your
own screen so as we wrap up our product
showcase on the N media HD PC 1000 B
there are a few notes that we'd like to
quickly recap the 1000 B is a great case
for a home theater it has the size and
the style to fit perfectly the base unit
also rings in at a very reasonable price
point making it even more of an
attractive option and the interior is
simple but well designed on the flip
side while it is nice to have the choice
of an optional LCD it does increase cost
and hassle in having to track it down as
well the case is limited in aftermarket
cooling solutions and with that thank
you for watching this episode of the
