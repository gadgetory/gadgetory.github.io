video says but I want to sit down and
have a heart-to-heart talk about the
r-tx 2080 and the r-tx 20 atti lunch
don't worry I will talk about the
Arctic's 2070 a little bit later around
the video but I want to dial back a few
days or I just want down back and talk
about this particular launch that took
place a few days ago now that day was
certainly interesting for us here I
reckon X and to be honest with you we
really appreciate your feedback both
positive and negative in fact smart
folks say that people learn from
criticisms rather than compliments and
everyone here the team takes them to
heart so about the RT X 2080 and the RT
X xx atti video we still stand by our
results and conclusions 100% but but
before you start going crazy all over
the comments we realized that there's
still more room for information and
additional perspectives now there's been
a lot of questions from our audience
about how well the custom G tick stand
nati cards from board partners stack up
to the RT X 2080 it actually got me and
the rest of the team wondering if moving
outside the founders edition spec would
change the results well we're gonna find
out but not with something like the gtx
980ti Strix OC or ZOTAC amp Edition GPU
since both of those cost even more than
the r-tx 2080 founders Edition on new
egg and Amazon right now they also
represent the absolute highest pre
overclocked spec of a previous
generation design and using those would
just serve to stack the deck both
positively and negatively so what we did
is order a more affordable custom and
prio o'clock EVGA GTX 10 ATT add that
will be compared against the RT X 2080
it will be interesting to see how the
two cards stack up when both have
downdraft coolers anyways that's the end
of this public message you spoke we
listened and as usual we really
appreciate your feedback so now on to
the RT X 2070 and to be honest I think
it's gonna have a tough time competing
against last gen card so let's dive into
that right after this the new master
keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic rest rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection cooler master
doing it
right check it out below okay so back
when Nvidia first announced the RT X 20
ATT I am VRTX 2080
there was another little surprise the RT
X 2070 this is actually the first time
that there were three different GPUs at
20 different price points that were
announced and it showed in video was
ready to replace their entire high-end
GP lineup not only that but they were
replacing them with products that are
much much more expensive that's a pretty
big problem since it automatically sets
expectations based on what looks like
inflated prices rather than the merits
of the GPUs themselves let's quickly go
through the RT X 2070 specifications
since they will set the stage for the
rest of this video this is what Nvidia
is calling their tu 106 core and right
away people will make an association
with the GP 106 core that was used in
the GTX 1060 back then the GTX 1070 and
1070 t I used a cut-down GP 104 core
from the GTX 280 but this time around
Nvidia decided to build a brand new
design for the RT X 2070 in this case it
means that the RT X 2070 will get a
fully enabled tu 106 core with 2,300 for
cuda cores 140 for textual units 64 ro
PS and a 256-bit wide memory bus in many
ways this looks like a gtx 2080 core
that simply been cut in half but with
memory controllers l3 cache and ROP s
remaining intact for the bigger GPU I
can't say this for certain but it looks
like the main reason Nvidia designed a
new chip for the RT X 2070 was power
efficiency instead of needing to use the
power-hungry 215 watt tu-104 as a
baseline the standard RT x 2070 will
consume about 175 watts
okay so before again to the specs of the
baseline RTX 2070 GPU
I do want to mention that you should
take pricing on these GPS with a huge
bucket of salt because with the RT X
2080 and the RT X 28 ETI the pricing on
those GPUs just make me feel frustrated
and currently with the pricing I mean
you really can't pick up those GPS at
the starting price that Nvidia is
claiming which is definitely frustrating
and disappointing so you know while the
RT X 27 is supposed to start at $500 I'm
gonna call BS on that because I don't
think you'll be able to pick
a GPU at that price during launch in
October and honestly I would hope I hope
to be proven wrong but with the current
state of our TX pricing eight it really
makes me feel angry and like I said my
original review you are paying for a
bunch of promises that are supposed to
happen sometime in the near future but
there is no guarantee to that so here
are the specs that I've been talking
about and on paper at least it looks
like nvidia is keeping a good separation
between the RT x 27 t the 20 80 and the
20 80 TI with between $200 and $300 gap
between them you can also see that
despite having less course the RT x 2070
keeps the 256 bit 8 gigabyte memory
interface which may be a key point for
4k gameplay whether or not it will have
enough physical processing course to
backup that interface is another matter
though now if we end the GT x 1080 and
the gtx 1070 series you can see where
this RT x 2070 may get into a bit of
trouble while the gtx 1080 launched
around $550 most custom and pre
overclocked board partner versions
currently go for 482 510 dollars
meanwhile it has more cores more texture
units and faster clock speeds than the
identically priced RT X 2070 and again
I'm saying identically price because I'm
certain it'll almost be impossible to
find a $500 RT x 2070 on launch day what
will probably be even more interesting
to see is how this new card lines up
against the north gtx 1070 TI for its
current price of between 420 and for $60
that card is an absolute beast in
benchmarks so here's a bigger potential
problem the RT x 2070 founders edition
costs another hundred dollars or 20% on
top of the finer dollars in videos
asking us to pay let me say that again
my friends the RT annex 2070 founders
Edition is $600 now maybe this card will
surprises with its performance but I
think we can actually see what the
challenge of adding RT x features looks
like in cards that are supposed to be
more affordable those features at die
space and doesn't increase production
cost for the whole lineup I also have to
wonder at what point does adding RT and
tensor functionality to lower end course
like the T 106 become a matter of
diminishing which
at some point in time I'm sure there
just won't be enough of those
specialized course on a chip to properly
process ai and ray-tracing
I'd also like to mention that we've
entered an acht I'm in the GPU market
because people really don't care about
the dye size or the transistor counts
what they did see is the current or the
new line up costing significantly higher
than previous generations specifically
the founders Edition GPUs and what's
really interesting is I guess the bigger
problem to this whole launch is that
even though the 20 or the 2000 series
offer impressive performance at 4k it
just doesn't promise or it doesn't
deliver the r-tx features that they do
claim to be so like I said my original
view you are paying for something that
just is not reality and if NVIDIA fails
to promise or if they fail to deliver
RTX is true potential then then there's
gonna be hell to pay
so the r-tx 2070 founders edition is a
much shorter card than the r-tx 2080
series but it still has the downdraft
style cooler in this case everything
looks shrunken down to a smaller scale
there's still plenty of high-end
finishing and a glowing GeForce logo
just like those other cards I think this
one looks pretty good and that doesn't
mean it's worth the hundred dollar
premium
one major difference is the location of
the power connector on this example even
though the card is shorter which could
make it an eventual solution for small
form-factor systems and medium made the
weird decision to put it around the back
that just adds to its length and limits
compatibility so I think it's a very odd
move from Nvidia there's another missing
element on this backplate and I'll give
you five seconds to figure out what it
is
all right so time's up and if you know
the answer well here it is
there's no env link connector to pass an
SLI signal between two graphics cards
that's because the Tia 106 core doesn't
support multi card configurations now
you may be able to use DX twelves
explicit multi-gpu technology in some
instances but that's just a workaround
and it doesn't cut to the heart of this
problem this could be another big miss
for NVIDIA in my opinion with every
generation it seems like the ability to
multiply cards gets constrained just a
bit more with Pascal it was a gtx 960
but now it's the 27 t what's next now
I'm sure the number of people actually
using s lie on gtx 1070 cards wasn't
huge but the option was still there and
not having it on a $600 GPU just feels
wrong treat your ears with the
incredibly comfortable HD 5/8 X Jubilee
headphones from mass drop and some
Heiser delivering sound expected from
$500 headphones but only for a hundred
fifty bucks making it one of the best
price to performance scans available
check out and join the drop-down below
so there you guys have it everything
that you need to know before the r-tx
2070 benchmarks are revealed sometime in
October and now do yourself a favor and
don't fall into this hole pre-order
phenomenon thinking with this particular
card because if I were you I would wait
for reviews and better yet if you don't
need a cutting-edge card for 4k then I
would wait until 2019 to see if those
r-tx promises are actually kept because
for a card like this there's bound to be
some performance sacrifices somewhere
I'm also pretty concerned about what
we've seen from the r-tx 2070 so far
since out of all the RT x-series cards
its founders Edition pricing seems the
most out of whack the 2080 was expensive
while the 2080 Tiye is hideously
expensive but this card looks like it's
forcing up the cost of the popular
mainstream market come review time and
video may have a tough time convincing
us that 80 106 base GPU is worth $600
but you never know
miracles do happen but hopefully this
quick preview will prevent you from
making any rash decisions on
pre-ordering before that time comes a me
bar with hurricane X thank you so much
for watching stay tuned for the full
performance run down between the custom
gtx 980ti that we ordered from EVGA and
of course we put it up against the
TX 2080 founders Edition and of course
we will do a lot of our TX content
specifically comparing you know custom
bored partner cars with the gtx 980ti
with the RT x 2080 and we will give you
guys the full analysis when it comes to
temperatures and all that kind of stuff
so there's a lot of content hitting or
coming your way so again stay tuned for
that I'm signing off and I'll see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
