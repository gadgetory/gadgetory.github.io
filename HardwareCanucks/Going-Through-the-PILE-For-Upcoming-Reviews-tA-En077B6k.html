2016 7
that was a good morning drive so today
is a normal workday but I'm gonna try to
vlog with my c100 so welcome to vlogging
with my c100 part 2 so Samsung does in
real their Galaxy s8 and Galaxy S A+ and
I'm just catching up with Twitter and
YouTube what a good looking phone I
really like it
ignore those overexposed portions of the
frame it's not fancy has some other
lighting setups but today I'll be giving
you guys two rundown as to what products
I have in the studio and you guys can
get a rough idea as to what you can
expect in the next few weeks and pretty
sure you guys are gonna love it so
without any further ado let's hop into
it and the first bit of awesomeness that
we're gonna be talking about are these
boxes obviously has a review our boxes
is something that you'll have to deal
with on a regular basis it's part of
your life it is part of your life you
have to embrace it and if you have the
chance to clean it up then get for you
but for me all of these are important
anyways let's just take this ti from out
of the box because I actually don't have
a TI in it because a TI is sitting
inside my main workstation PC and it's
rocking like a boss one of the things
that we're going to be talking about or
will be doing a video on our mini ITX or
ITX based graphics cards and i have one
sitting right there I don't exactly yeah
that's right there
so after the mess from there and
whatever that happened I'm not going to
show what happened there
I finally got my second graphics card
which is this is the gtx 1070 from
gigabyte and we'll be doing a comparison
between these two actually we have one
more card from zoton this is the zotac
gtx 1080
I think it's the mini version of their
amputation but we've actually done some
coverage of this particular card at CES
so if you guys want to check that video
we will live it we will leave a link
down below
I'm really
fan of small form-factor graphics cards
especially since people are going
towards building compact cases of
compact PCs so if they want the best
power or they on the ultimate power on
that Compaq rig going with like a
higher-end card like this could probably
help especially if it's a 10 semi or
1080 especially like I can't believe
that this is a 1080 like this is an
actual 1080 I don't think they have done
any modulations when it comes to clock
speeds aren't thing like that I'll have
to look into that later on but it has a
really robust cooling system but I'm
really looking forward to testing both
these cards and put them and put them
against the GTX 1080 from ZOTAC so stay
tuned for that video that'll be a really
interesting rundown think I know what
this is this is a this is an Asus v3 15
motherboard this will be interesting so
guys this is the asus be 350 +
motherboard it's obviously a name for
platform supports the horizon processors
will be doing a build basing on the r7
1700 or the 1700 X not exactly sure
which one of those we'll be putting in
but that'll be a cool budget rising
build and we'll be focusing on a red and
black base card game so this motherboard
blends in really well what's really
interesting about this particular
motherboard is its price so at $100
you're getting a you're getting a lot of
value for the money first of all it does
overclock so if you're thrown 89 X or
1700 X you can definitely overclock that
processor and this motherboard s support
that capability
you also get maximum memory support up
to 32 gigabytes I think it 64 gigabytes
not 32 64 but one drawback is that it
does not have dual GPU support so that
is one of those limitations with the
e350 motherboards is there are dual GPU
limitations some other cool features it
has let me focus it has an MDOT 2 slot
which is awesome but it also has a few
LED lighting accents I'm not exactly
sure where it is I have to actually
build a full computer later on to test
out that but I'm really looking forward
to the build guys this is actually going
inside the Corsair spec alpha I am
I have that case sitting on my living
room floor it has been sitting my living
room for about three probably like ever
since Christmas so I think it's a good
time to take advantage of that
especially with the rising on the
horizon so there's a funny story behind
this USB flash drive this is the Corsair
Flash survivor a USB 3.0 Drive it is one
of those stealth drives adorable drives
that Corsair sells I think they still
sell them I'm not exactly sure but I
remember buying a 16 gigabyte module
from Corsair and of course that wasn't
from Corsair I don't really recall but
I'd bought a 16 gave my module and I
sent so it arrived a few days later and
I plugged in and I didn't detect
anything like I thought maybe I should
initialize the drive like going to going
through windows and starting a simple
volume but that just didn't work out so
the drive to the USB port didn't detect
the drive I plugged it into different
computers nothing happened so I
contacted the company and I asked them
was there way for a replacement and they
said you can just form we can file an
RMA and that won't get you through we'll
send you a new unit so what they did is
they send me a 128 gigabyte drive
instead of the 16 gigabyte module so
technically I paid 40 bucks for 128 128
gigabyte USB 3.0 Drive that is pretty
awesome I still don't know what's inside
this I should probably check this out
after I finish this video so I want to
know if you had any experiences like
this before you know buying a cheap
product and then if something goes wrong
with it you contact the company and they
send you something that is of a much
higher value let us know in the comments
down below and I'm really looking
forward to reading those experiences we
got a new package from Asus this is the
rog g20 guys i'm really looking forward
to this one this is a really compact the
compact desktop pc kind of comparing it
to the corsair one which that'll be a
cool video actually I have a cool idea
for that let's unbox this let's unbox
this
Oh check this out so they actually send
you a keyboard which is pretty cool
interesting so of course they're doesn't
do that so this is the unit guys this is
it these are some other accessories that
come with a box they coud a keyboard and
a mouse which is awesome so this is a
closer to look at the g20 it's a very
cool looking machine actually I can't
believe it does come with our LED
lighting inside but yeah I'm definitely
looking forward to testing this out
because some cables it also included an
extra power cable those that's the power
break that you need to power the actual
g20 in it it comes with all the i/o that
you require so USB ports you know 7.10
on you out take a bit either net and
that's obviously the fully fledged GTX
1080
I'm gonna have to open this up to see if
it's a strict variant of the GTX 1080 so
obviously stay tuned for that video of
the g20 by its own but this is looking
pretty good
I can't wait to test this out and
compare it against the Corsair one
that's sitting right there so the last
thing I want to cover are these
motherboards that are sitting here I
still have a few sitting inside the
drawer over there but this is just to
give you a quick hint on what's coming
up so this is a 7600 K it's completely
out of focus I really apologize for that
but okay stop right there so what I'll
be doing is installing that processor on
all three motherboards individually so
one after one and I'll be testing out
their auto OC features so I'm gonna be
testing out all three software's to see
or five of them I believe to see which
one overclocks that semi 16 okay to the
highest so so far are tested the ass
walk
the more that's sitting inside this case
right here but I've tested that
motherboard but the maximum I was able
to get was 4.6 gigahertz which isn't too
bad but who knows
my money is on me suits by the way
because I don't know I'm just I'm just
saying that so there you have it that's
what I have in hand currently I hope you
enjoyed this little vlog so I should
especially blogging the c100 is
completely it it's it's a tough task and
it's not easy I'm definitely going to
pick up a small camera unlike the a 6300
or the g7 very shortly for my next vlog
ignore the audio mess and all that kind
of stuff I'm definitely gonna fix that
later on and if you guys enjoy the sort
of vlogging style videos from my side
let me know in the comments down below
Dmitry's obviously and Promaster it
vlogging so i'm catching up to his level
slowly so i hope you guys enjoyed this
video stay tuned for more content
especially since risin 5 is right around
the corner we will be doing a lot of
coverage based on that platform or but
based on based on that series so stay
tuned for that but my my studio is
always a mess like this and I have to
clean it every day because I actually
sleep here so there you have it anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
