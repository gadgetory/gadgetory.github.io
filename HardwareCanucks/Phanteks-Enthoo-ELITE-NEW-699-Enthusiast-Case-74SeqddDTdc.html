new at Computex CES or any anything else
we're always very impressed and today is
no different if you love what you see
from the show Nvidia fantex NCIX and MS
I made this complex possible so there
are a couple of updates with their
already established cases the n2 premium
DS which stands for dual system will
receive a micro ATX support so it will
feature a full ATX support and a micro
ATX system and there's dual systems
which is pretty incredible and a new
bracket that allows you to flip your GPU
with a vertical ECI bracket extender
that allows the graphics cards to be
facing you and not be sort of installed
the standard way inside the motherboard
it's a very cool way to show off your
graphics card and also allow you to
install a full sized graphics card for
the bottom chamber where the micro ATX
board is since there is not enough width
for the GPU to be sort of in its default
position the next three upgrades come
with the m2 Pro M which is a nice budget
mid-tower very enjoyable experience and
now it has received the tempered glass
treatment and is going to be a slight
premium so it's going to be a $99 price
point with one tempered glass side panel
the second update would be the m2
evolved tempered glass Edition the
evolved ATX that is and you guys haven't
seen it make sure to check out our video
on that and the last one is the
envelopes which receives a new color
which is this grey very sparkly awesome
aluminum looking color and a tempered
glass side panel for only one side while
the other side is solid but you guys are
all here for this very unique new case
which was originally named the project
916 back at CES but we have a full name
for that one and that is defend x + 2
elite so the cool thing about the elite
is that fan techs are not kidding when
they're trying to really provide the
enthusiast community with absolutely
everything that we need inside the
enclosure that accommodates for water
cooling modular aspects of things not
wasting any space having
support for multiple systems inside a
single chassis while utilizing every
single inch of that enclosure to its
full potential no space wasted dust
filters everywhere tons of water cooling
support with fans beautiful construction
so all premium premium materials with
four millimeter aluminum tempered glass
side panels that swivel to open which is
so awesome there is very very clever
interior design so there's three
chambers so there's the main chamber
there's the bottom chamber and then
there is the sort of the rear chamber
for all your cable management and all
that is so well designed so you can have
multiple radiators installed inside the
system five sixty millimeter radiator at
the front with a little removable piece
at the front there so that I can
accommodate four radiators you can
install multiple raters in the bottom
chamber while also supporting things at
the top and then when looking at the
back it also features this new vertical
PCI treatment so you can install your
graphics cards in the vertical position
with these PCI brackets without modern
required all of that will be included
with the case which is so cool because
they've seen that modders love the
positioning of the GPUs in its vertical
position art of all these premium
features come plenty more so for example
at the front IO which includes bunch of
things like color support little wheel
that you can play press to cycle between
different modes or you can rotate the
wheel to cycle between different colors
and there's a type C port which is
awesome but one cool thing is the HDMI
pass-through so that is awesome because
with VR world and VR compatible graphics
cards making way into the market
especially with graphics cards like EVGA
and you know 980ti VR Edition and most
likely 1080p 1080p are additions as well
you will be able to route an HDMI
directly from the graphics card so you
don't have to sort of worry about
reaching behind the computer to connect
stuff you have an HDMI port right at the
front another cool feature with the end
to elite is the little grommeted cut out
behind the rear side panel so
that would allow you to route led system
that will be connected to the case or
perhaps to your motherboard to whatever
area around you area basically to light
up your scene exactly the same way as
you would with the case so that you have
consistency in lighting all controlled
through a single tap of a button so the
fan techs and to elite is supposed to be
priced at $6.99 which is in my opinion
totally justifiable and not just saying
this because fan tix is our sponsor and
you know we're totally transparent about
that one really cool aspect is that we
have all these different panels that
supports like five and a quarter inch
drive base that we'll be able to install
on the interior so for those who require
like a fan controller to be installed
inside but don't want to compromise on
that beautiful front solid finish there
you go you can have a five in the
quarter inch drive bay on the interior
and it also comes with multiple brackets
for micro ATX system if you want to
install that in the bottom and one of
the coolest features I find is that you
see those drives inside so that says
these are rotated in the correct
position which is awesome and the SSDs
are sitting on it's like a hard drive
tray that will support two and a half
and three and a half inch drives but it
is removable so that you can route
cables easier so it is actually acting
as a sort of a cable hider and supposed
to organize things and removing that all
a different bracket that will support a
radiator or fans and that will blow air
through the backside panel which has a
low removable piece with a fan filter
and so you can have instead of having
drives there you can have a radiator in
that position blowing air through the
back of the case and to wrap up
everything with the elite it looks like
a fantastic enclosure and especially
because it carries that fantex character
you can clearly tell this has been
inspired by the end to primo a lot of
the features have been carried over like
the beautiful curve at the very bottom
it's like one one piece which I find
really really interesting and I can't
wait to see what the enthusiasts
community
can do to fully utilize what the case
has to offer but guys this has been the
update within the case category from
fantex I hope you enjoyed we'll see you
in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
