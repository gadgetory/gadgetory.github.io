back to another harp Knox review now
today we're going to take a look at the
Rocket sq FX gaming keyboard which at
$99 may be questionable considering it's
not mechanical but let's first take a
look at how it performs before making
any conclusions now the first thing you
notice is how large the keyboard is
that's because the armrest is already
built in and we have a relatively large
bezel that will take up a lot of real
estate on your desk now it may be what
you're looking for but this is certainly
not a compact peripheral the main coding
is piano gloss which after use
definitely shows fingerprints while the
armrest has a more textured surface and
because there's a slight ridge between
the built-in armrests and the body we
experience discomfort while typing and I
actually developed a blister which
completely defeats the purpose of an
armrest and the fact that you can't take
it off might question your purchase now
below the space bar is where you'll find
three T buttons that are well within
reach for your thumb and you can quickly
adjust using these buttons in-game for
faster response it is also very common
to find M keys on gaming keyboards so s
Q is certainly not lagging on that front
with five M keys that you can either
assign the macro or choose a variety of
built-in functions in the software we
have a total of five profiles that by
default are switched using the t keys
below the spacebar and we have plenty of
multimedia controls in the center this
keyboard is also backlit with many color
options to choose from and we are happy
to see brightness is uniform between the
keys and that should be the expectation
if you are paying $100 for keyboard of
course we have brightness variance and
this breathing mode which looks pretty
cool now it's not a mechanical keyboard
but we were very surprised at how well
it performed for typing and obviously
gaming the keys aside from having
standard rubber dome switches have
really fast bounce and response they
almost feel like Cherry MX red switches
but with a little less travel time but
that's also partially because the
keyboard is so low profile throughout
our experience not once that we have any
key gems which is very surprising for a
non mechanical keyboard of course
trouble dome switchers regardless of how
good they are are going to be a
deal-breaker
especially because mechanical keyboards
are very well priced however let's not
give up hope for rocket yet as the
keyboard features what's called easy
shift plus which allows secondary
commands to be assigned to your M Keys T
keys below the spacebar and to this easy
zone which is an additional 20 buttons
that can be accessed without problem
using a thumb and your point finger so
this really is a treat for MMO and
strategy titles and really for users who
can take advantage of this workflow
improvement feature the problem is the
gaming profile is built into the drive
software are a bit older and miss some
of the most recent triple-a titles but
one extra cherry is this rocket talk
feature that allows two compatible
rocket devices in this case a mouse to
be in sync with these secondary controls
for example holding the easy shift
button on the keyboard allows you to
perform second recommends on your mouse
and vice versa now why is this useful
considering you have to play around
button assignments and record macros
well because it's super easy to do the
driver software is intuitive and
provides a lot of flexibility for
precise control of what each button does
instead of navigating to your most used
applications for example simply map them
onto any of the programmable buttons for
improved workflow there are really many
options available for desktop and game
use that definitely can improve the user
experience so to summarize with the
positives we think the best thing about
the sq FX is the user flexibility that
allows key mapping and dual button
assignments with this easy shift plus
that even works really well with other
compatible rocket peripherals
we have backlit keys that should be
expected at this price point and rubber
dome switches are actually very
satisfactory during gameplay
now this keyboard would have been an
amazing deal in addition to your gaming
setup about two years ago before
mechanical switches became the dominant
feature in any gaming keyboard also
we're not fans of its large size there
are definitely corners that could be
chopped
for a more compact design particularly
the built-in arm rests that creates
blisters so there's really no way around
and priced at $100 the SQ FX is a little
pricey and there's no denying that easy
shift bus and rocket talk are features
that are definitely useful so a
mechanical version is soon to be
available named ryos so perhaps wait
around until that arrives so what do you
guys think do you think rubber dome
switches are dead or not leave your
comments down below and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
