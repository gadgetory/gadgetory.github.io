great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Harbor
Canucks and before we begin this review
I want you to think of the first thing
that pops into your head when I mention
in win the reputation within the case
market has seen many downs because they
seem to focus on very niche and
expensive productions like the $350 Dee
frame materials and build quality is one
thing but when core functionality is
lacking it's hard to justify a purchase
but I feel they are slowly starting to
come back to their senses with regards
to core functionality and today this in
win 707 foot tower is going to get the
full Harbor Canucks treatment it retails
for $140 comes both in black red and
white black versions now is this price
range competitive absolutely not you can
pick up the m2 Lux or the pro the
defined at 5 th for 14 the silent base
800 all outstanding and accessible
choices for less cash but I'm not giving
up on the 707 yet I love the red black
accent this unusual shaped side panel
window and of course the brushed
aluminum front facade that unfortunately
is not fully uniform as the final
quarter inch drive bay door has this
different plastic finish that also feels
extremely flimsy and will most
definitely interfere with anything that
is not completely flush in those five
and a quarter inch drive base the
ventilation on both sides is adequate
and the panel is spaced out just fine
behind which we find dual 140 member
fans included sitting on these very
flimsy clips one just popped out there's
no dust filter here and the entire front
frame is super restrictive I'm not
impressed
the i/o port are located up top with an
activity LED dual USB 3 and USB to audio
jacks and the discreet power button on
the right a reset switch is nowhere to
be found the top exhaust area can
support triple 120 more fans only
weirdly without any 140 Miller fan holes
and while I do appreciate the symmetry
up top we all know the convenience of
having these holes offset closer to the
side
panel for extra clearance with any top
radiators I'm disappointed not to see
that also notice these rubber grommets
on all the fan mounting holes but they
are quite large requiring washers to be
used as otherwise the standard radiator
and fan screws just fall through
luckily washers are provided in
accessories but they don't look very
neat when installed plus it has an
internal mesh pre-installed it's
appreciated but it is not removable
making the cleaning process extremely
difficult and after having the case just
sit around fully closed for a few days
look at how much dust had collected on
the floor so those dust filters are not
very effective at the back nothing
unusual for grommeted water cooling
holes at 140 ml exhaust fan 8 PCI slots
with plenty of square ventilation on the
side and then bottom out the power
supply with I'm sorry to say but an
embarrassing dust filter for $140 I mean
come on in win also the case feet are
tall but it looks like they forgot to
attach any of rubber bits onto these so
yeah there's a 120 140 mm fan cut out on
the other side panel right behind the
CPU cutout not sure this is necessary
but it doesn't hurt the case either so
getting inside we find a very strange
color scheme on those five and a quarter
inch mounting knobs whoever thought
yellow or a sort of limas green had a
place in a black red case is mistaken in
my opinion plus it seems that color
scheme has been thrown out of the window
completely with entirely white front IO
cables and a power SATA cable for that
exhaust fan now the hard drive cage can
support up to eight units to list
mechanical and site SSD mount so one of
the corner pegs will have to come out
that's a bit annoying now look at just
how blocked that drive cage is I'm
surprised this actually passed through
testing because there will be almost
zero airflow coming in from the front
and a bracket to house an additional 120
or 140 ml fan on there won't do much as
the fan won't breathe at all now the
drive cage is modular so you can remove
the bottom portion to install dual 120
or 140 ml fans there
remove the entire cage so to let the
case breathe and with my reference
system assembled the cutouts of ground
them on the board are clearly designed
to accommodate for excel on e ATX
motherboards but don't fully benefit ATX
or micro ATX motherboards as they are so
spaced out there's nothing underneath
the motherboard either aside from the
very bottom cutout and routing
everything just seems like hassle and
doesn't look very pretty either coming
it on to the back we find no SSD
brackets only a few cable tie hoops
plenty of room for cables though but
this is not what I was expecting for a
2015 release and in this price bracket
especially I couldn't even mount my x61
cooler which is a 280 millimeter cooler
because the top does not support 140
Miller fans and I even had to mount our
240 millimeter all-in-one cooler in the
first front two slots up top to let me
route the eight pin cable in the corner
there without any clearance issues and
everything about the interior layout
screams lack of functionality that we're
not used to in this price range and I
mention price range because that is
important the in win seven of seven is a
perfect example of where size and build
quality alone won't sell if the Builder
is not satisfied with the system and in
my case here I was not expecting such as
appointment and one clearly has more
work to do so I hope you guys enjoyed
this review let us know if you have a
case in mind that should pass the
hardware tax treatment and make sure to
subscribe because we have this coming
next
