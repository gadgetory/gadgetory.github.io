doom time doom yes doom I don't have to
yes you do check your PC hello everyone
I'm Dimitri with hyper Canucks welcome
to another video behind me in that PC is
a gtx 1080 and what i'm playing now here
is doom let's test out the gtx 780 how
well it performs when overclocked what
type of temperatures we can achieve in
the actual real gameplay scenario when
we're running Doom and the highest
possible settings let's test that out
all right let's do MIT out first I'm
going to show you my settings to prove
that I am maxing out this game
everything has been set to ultra so
highest possible settings I'm running
the gritty rendering mode so that the
shadows are a little bit extra easier to
see in video I'm running 2560 by 1440 P
monitored for 144 Hertz with G sync and
vertical sync turned off and the
ultraviolence campaign difficulty now
before you enjoyed the gameplay itself
keep an eye on the top-left corner this
is where the MSI Afterburner overlay is
displayed so first of all we have the
FPS the frames per second the GPU
temperature followed by GPU usage then
the fan percentage which is set to
manual at 70% then we have the core
clock it's just past 2 gigahertz mark so
this is the founders edition then the
memory clock which is also slightly
overclocked and then the memory usage
and now I'm going to shut up and let you
enjoy the gameplay and just keep an eye
out on how the GTX 980 performs with
doom everything maxed out 2560 by 1440 P
resolution
one cool torturous
stay focused stay
what
demonic threat reduced by 25%
so I hope you enjoyed that uninterrupted
gameplay of doom see it in its full
glory and highest possible settings with
GTX tennety absolutely flowering through
the gameplay at this resolution so the
GTX 1080 remained at 82 degrees Celsius
that's where it plateaued out never saw
anything going above that and I never
saw any of the core clocks dropping down
so it's remained constant at 2 gigahertz
same thing with the memory overclock the
VRAM usage was weird because it was also
constant it was never shifting up and
down it kind of ramped up as soon as you
enter from the menu into the game but it
was mainly consistent there just below 4
gigabytes and the framerate so through
the playthrough that you just watched my
average framerate was 105 and minimum
was at 83 not sure where 83 came from
possibly through some animation but as
most of the time you go through its
absolutely smooth fluid and 105 on
average and maximum obviously is 144
which is the maximum fresh rate of that
monitor so this has been GTA X 1080 +
doom a fantastic combination make sure
to check out our review our inboxing our
full written review everything will be
linked in the description below I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I'm going to
be tree with how recognize and let us
know if you want to see more
uninterrupted gameplay little sessions
