a relatively fresh technology for an
average consumer and we haven't seen
many products pursue the market for
wireless video streaming now let's do
may need to competition with Smart TVs
and the good old HDMI cable method
wireless streaming in the way is still
seen as a luxury based on the price
comparison however it is exciting to see
new devices being introduced to the
market meaning HD TV streaming is
shifting into a different wireless era
so today we're testing out the sky
vision ws 100 from gigabyte which is a
nice compact package designed for the
on-the-go user it is released at around
$150 which makes it a really competitive
product on the line with similar devices
so let's quickly go over the specs this
is aw HDI 1.0 compliant it is able to
stream up to 1080p uncompressed video
with 5.1 channel audio up to 48
kilohertz at 24-bit with latency of less
than one millisecond and this is just ad
range of up to 10 meters with a direct
line of sight now the best part about
Sky vision is its portability factor the
receiver fits in the palm of your hand
it is nice and stylish with the metallic
finish it is also light and plastic but
the build quality is fairly decent at
the front we have three buttons to
navigate through the sky vision menu on
the side there is the HDMI out port
along with a micro USB power input there
is some ventilation in the back is this
thing tends to get quite hot and at the
top we have two LEDs to indicate link
and the power now the receiver also
stands on the rubber feet to prevent it
from sliding
now the transmitter is even smaller it
almost looks like a USB key there's the
top LED to indicate link and a side
button to initiate link there's the HDMI
connector a micro USB port for power and
plenty of venting on each side as the
transmitter also gets quite hot along
with the package gigabyte includes an
HDMI cable for the receiver only the
power unit and the micro USB cable to
power up the transmitter the micro USB
cable must first be plugged in into a
Mitter and the USB port on your host
device then you can plug in and
transmitter into your HDMI port and as
soon as the link is established both
LEDs on the devices should be solid now
this is a plug-and-play device meaning
no hassle with drivers the receiver
recognizes a signal on its own and right
away streams wireless video so let's
check it out in action and in this case
I'm using a laptop and a clone mode the
laptop has a 1080p display and the
monitor is a 1920 by 1200 so the
transmitted video must be stretched
accordingly and this is where we have a
problem the video artifact for the
bottom 120 pixels is evident and
whatever inside that area is destroyed
this is one limitation to this product
is it's not able to stretch 1080p
resolution accordingly on a higher
resolution screen however this artifact
is not evident on proper 1080p displays
but I did manage to make it work on my
larger screen with the transmitter
connected into the gtx 570 and through
Nvidia control panel I have chosen the
1080p resolution within the HD SD
settings and not the PC settings and to
my surprise that actually got rid of the
artefact by choosing the resolution from
the PC option brought back the artifact
for the bottom 120 pixels now in terms
of the connection distance it is always
advisable to have a direct line of sight
for these devices and sky vision
performs quite well with reasonable
distance without a direct line of sight
there are artifacts when the signal gets
weak but most of the time when the range
gets too far the signal just gets lost
but I can say comfortably that sky
vision has no problem transmitting 1080p
video with distances of up to 6 meters
with two walls in between and you would
still be able to get a signal with up to
10 meters but you do need a direct line
of sight between the transmitter and the
receiver
one thing I did not like about sky
vision is this strange artifact around
text and graphics for example if you are
scrolling down the page or moving the
page around the screen this weird
pixelation occurred which was quite
annoying and it wasn't an issue with the
signal but
thing related to the latency of the
streaming video and one last thing to
mention before we conclude is the menu
interface of the sky vision use the
bottoms on the receiver for navigation
and you can add multiple transmitters
under different names in case you are
using multiple devices for streaming in
your home
so overall the sky vision is a move into
the right direction with wireless video
streaming I really like how portable and
compact the entire package is this is a
plug-and-play device so no need for
drivers or any additional downloads and
the signal is quite strong up to 6
meters even with plenty of obstacles on
its way and the price is fairly
competitive to products of the same line
however the sky vision does come with
limitations like its inability to
properly scale 1080p video on a higher
resolution display and the strange
pixelated artifact the streaming video
produces so to conclude it is a nice
device for wireless video streaming and
paired up with a 1080p display at the
reasonable distance users will not be
disappointed and that concludes our
review for the gigabyte sky vision ws
100 thanks guys for watching and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
