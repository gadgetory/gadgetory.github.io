since they announced a ton of new
products at the show floor if you
haven't checked out our video showing
you after 2018 roadmap make sure you do
that right away you might be wondering
why this video is coming after our CES
coverage and that's because we wanted to
look over aim these offerings at the
show and then combine them into a single
video the detailed Raven Ridge rise in
2x4 70 and more this video will be going
over some of the more exciting things in
a bit more detail those things will
actually be coming up really soon
this includes the new generation rising
desktop processors and the Raven reach
ap use that will combine first
generation rising processing cores along
with Vega graphics we found a few
examples of those at the show floor at
CES so let's look at it a bit closer
wondering how to fix a boring fan check
out halos RGB they are super slim fan
frames that light up your blades of any
shade come on 120 and 140 member sizes
to fit any fan in a control through your
motherboard or your fan text case
available in beautiful aluminum or
simple plastic it's time to Halos your
build outline what matters so there's a
lot to get through in this video and the
first thing has to be the upcoming
second generation Rison processors that
use a new 12 nanometer manufacturing
process by moving towards 1200 meters
Indy has been able to achieve
significantly higher clock speeds
without more power consumption or heat
production that's super important since
the order for rising to compete against
coffee lake particularly in gaming
higher frequencies in lightly threaded
situations were needed but there'll also
be some improvements in areas like cache
and memory speed and latency hopefully
we'll see rise and finally be able to
consistently hit ddr4 memory speeds
above 3000 megahertz because we weren't
able to achieve that before without
overclocking and more voltage speaking
of gaming there will be a new multi core
algorithm boost 8 for higher performance
and gaming and other real-world
scenarios there won't be any significant
architecture changes to Zen Plus and the
second generation rising processors but
in order to take a better advantage of
the lower power consumption and
potential for higher frequencies AMD
will be updating precision boost and the
extended frequency range technologies
while we don't have all that much
information
how these two items will be changing it
looks like precision business we'll be
able to predict upcoming workloads and
further balanced core output that means
higher bass and boost frequencies can be
achieved more often something else that
is important to take note of is with
rising - there will be new motherboards
but before you panic don't worry they
won't absolutely be needed for the new
CPUs you see AMD has committed to keep
the aim for suck it around for a while
until at least 2019 current motherboard
chipsets like ether 50 and x3 70 will be
compatible with upcoming Raven Ridge
GPUs and second generation rising
desktop processors that's good news the
bad news is that even though older
motherboards will have some forward
compatibility you may be missing out on
key next generation features and
performance if you pair up an all
motherboard with a new CPU the proof of
this is a pen with the upcoming x4 70
motherboard series while a simple BIOS
update will ensure 2nd generation rising
CPUs are simply dropping upgrades for x3
70 only newer boards will be truly
optimized for them and II wasn't willing
to talk about any details but it looks
like x4 70 will feature improved
performance additional overclocking
capabilities and some new feature level
support we did see this at gigabytes so
called x4 70 motherboard and other
channels have covered it as well but
what we heard was a bit different this
was actually designed as an x3 70 base
product called the Auris x3 70 gaming 7
Wi-Fi but they decided to change their
flagship boards to X 470 basically that
means X 470 likely won't bring much to
the table from a chipset level most of
the performance rising to will offer
will likely be from the processor itself
rather than the motherboard that means
you will likely be totally okay staying
with x3 70 rather than paying a premium
for x4 70 this brings me to the next
part of AMD's big announcements the
Raven Ridge ap use which will be
launching on February the 12th the first
of those will be the Rison 520 400 G
that comes with 4 cores 8 threads with a
base clock of 3.6 gigahertz and a boost
clock of 3.9 gigahertz the Vega graphics
side of that chip will have 11 compute
units which means 704 SIMD
units or roughly one-fifth the raw
processing power of Vega 56 it may not
sound like much but this is crazy
powerful for an integrated graphics ship
and for $170 there seems to be a lot of
value here the Rison 320 200 G is cut
down a bit with lower boost and base
frequencies but it's still natively a
quad-core part and it's graphics ID has
eight compute units enabled at just $100
I could see this becoming the go-to
solution for entry-level systems and
both of these are 65 watt TDP parts we
actually saw a bunch of notebooks with
these EP use and they all look amazing
with low profiles and great battery life
I can't wait to get my hands on some of
these one thing you need to know is that
even though both of these carry the rise
in 2000 series branding they don't use
the new 12 nanometers n plus course that
will be found in second generation
rising CPUs since both will be living in
Andy's lineup at the same time I'm
thinking Bart confusion is certainly
possible so make sure you look anyone
back to this video for an explanation so
you can actually see here that through
higher clock speeds they 2400 G and 2200
G are able to easily outperform the 1400
and 1200 in every single application now
I know that like with Intel processors
you're buying an integrated GPU and
won't need if you use a discrete one but
it's hard to argue against these numbers
given how low the new ApS are priced
this makes it even more apparent at
least in multitrader environments the
2400 g and 22 energy are not only better
than the original rise in CPUs they're
replacing but they can also handily beat
Intel CPUs from a price to performance
standpoint now the 2400 G is gonna have
a tough fight against the i3 hit II 100
particularly in gaming with a discrete
graphics card but it still looks like a
phenomenal value a and B even tested the
horizon 520 400 G against Intel's I 580
400 and it looks like integrated
performance will line up with that Intel
CPU when it's paired with a discrete GT
1030 GPU what's even more impressive is
that Intel / AMD setup will have a TDP
that's about 30 watts higher than the
integrated Andy solution obviously a me
is going to show scenarios where the
multi-core architecture is going to
shine and these are two more instances
particularly because the integrated
graphics are being used in both
nonetheless there's definitely something
to take away from this the new apos are
even better able to compete with the
original rising CPUs at their given
price points in gaming the 2400 G's
obviously going to be the better bet
given how far Intel's integrated GPUs
are behind from an architecture and
driver perspective this is likely why
until desire to team up with the Iranian
Technology Group for some semi-custom
chips that will provide high-end gaming
capabilities to thin and light notebooks
the 2200 G is in the same position as
well against the i3 8100 but it will
definitely be interesting to see how
these chips line up with one another in
real-world scenarios like with all other
chips in Amy's car and line up these new
ApS will feature fully unlocked CPU
multipliers as well as capability to all
clock the Vega graphics subsystem aim D
actually showed us that a simple bump in
memory speeds will result in a pretty
significant gaming performance speed up
adding some GPU or clunking on top of
that saw over 40% better performance in
3dmark fire strike if that isn't
impressive I don't know what is so guys
that pretty much close us out our quick
rundown of some interesting stuff Andy
has coming up in the first half of this
year what do you guys think about it
will you be waiting for Rison to or will
you jump to take advantage of those
lower first generation rising prices and
what about those raven rich apos would
you be willing to give AMD a shot on
that front let us know in the comments
down below I'm Eva with Harbor Canucks
thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
