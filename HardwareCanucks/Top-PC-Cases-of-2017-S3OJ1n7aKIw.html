have happened it started with the pure
bass 600 and some 30 cases in between
many were surprised at how disappointing
this year has been let's put some fans
some shiny lights and call it a day but
little did they realize that nobody
would pay the bubble will soon burst of
this glass box where proper air flow is
a paradox year after year designs change
but only one can win so let the case of
words begin the new OC CTR 200 from
Toshiba is a great value SSD if you're
considering upgrading your hard drive
and get a nice boost in performance with
cutting-edge 3d flash memory and ultra
reliable controller with built-in power
management available in different
capacities check it out below
so guys welcome back to another annual
case awards video we do this every year
so this is gonna be our fourth time make
sure to check out our previous ones to
get an idea I'm like how the case
industry has evolved unfortunately the
disappointing category for this year is
growing and you can check out our worst
case trends video right over here to get
the bigger picture as usual the
selection process applies to cases that
we've reviewed in 2017 so the categories
are the wallet-friendly case the best
micro TX option my personal favorite
mid-tower the uniquely different in a
good way case the most epic but probably
not for 99% of users tower the WoW
category highlighting individual
fantastic features then the fan favorite
fail compilation and finally case of the
year let's go starting off with the
first category of the wallet-friendly
case this easily goes to the fantex p300
TG this case at only $59 surprised my
expectations while still holding the
core DNA of fantex design like built an
ambient case lighting that you can add
to we still have a lovely T G panel but
the lower portion of the frame is
actually the power supply shroud and
thus the glass is a bit smaller to
complement the price point the interior
can accommodate a 280 million radiator
up front and they even redesign the top
IO cable to allow for that to happen
storage is fine keel measurement is
possible and for a basic system either
with a radiator or a bee
CPU cooler you'll be happy for the price
my next wallet friendly option may be a
surprise but I've picked the Cougar qbx
this is a fantastic IT Xbox that remains
compact it's affordable it's forgiving
on larger Hardware so it's perfect to
use on existing ATX power supplies for
example so you don't have to buy an SFX
power supply full sized graphics cards
fit here too and we even have space for
a 120mm or all-in-one cooler and a slim
slot loading optical drive up top all in
the pretty attractive sparkly grey body
moving into the best micro TX option we
have the define mini see from fractal
design it's elegant it's not too bulky
it accommodates radiators all over well
with a nice shroud that you can open up
at the front as well and fantastic cable
management thanks to the recessed
mountable tray seriously there's nothing
bad to say about this one it's fantastic
the runner-up is the fan --tx evolved
micro ATX TG it's a slightly larger
alternative with more height on the
frame so you can install radiators up
top and it looks like a mini version of
the evolved ATX with beautiful aluminum
exterior smart blackout section on the
glass which is on the right side to only
reveal the SSDs and a super convenient
glass mount itself that swivels to open
now if you commit to a micro ATX system
it's awesome good for you but I would
say compact mid towers are more flexible
in case you decide to upgrade to a
larger ATX motherboard down the line
which brings us to my next category of
the personal favorite mid tower and this
has to be the fractal design mesh if I
see I have my rise in workstation in
there with good ol air cooling and the
front mesh is a brilliant combination of
design with that angular pattern and of
course unrestrictive air flow and also
acting as a dust filter I love the
compact power supply shroud incredibly
simple cable management and I know many
don't like the super dark tint on that
glass but it kind of turns it for me
like an elegant work machine instead of
this sort of gaming Tower moving into
the uniquely different case we have the
fan --tx of all shift and the shift X
this is by far the coolest ITX enclosure
that I've worked with the 2 size options
are of course appreciated the tower
design is fantastic with aluminum and
glass and the actual footprint
is not much bigger than this graphics
card so that's awesome
if you're in a compact space you just
need that vertical real estate the
interior segmentation is well done with
the GPU chamber that has flexible
mounting with fans either facing the
glass or the interior you can mount a
120 or 140 ml radiator at the bottom
cable management is challenging but we
have that midsection
that hides most of the cables entering
towards the motherboard and a lot of
velcro straps on the frame to help with
that interior guidance we can also guide
the top IO cables out of the bottom and
not from the top so they're not randomly
sticking out and I also have to give
cougar Conqueror some credit for going
outside the box with this totally open
aluminum and glass frame for a showcase
PC I love the shape of the glass that
corresponds to the frame with individual
armor like pieces the color scheme is
pretty cool too the motherboard is
slanted so you can explore fun
directions for heart tubing if you're
going with the water cooling setup which
you should 360 rad the top is supported
or a 240 ran to the front as well and
the overall layout despite being so open
encourages proper ko management that
even I could achieve with some sleeping
the next category of the most epic Tower
goes to the fan techs and two elite I
mean you could build a whole system for
that much money so the target audience
is quite small but it's really a bold
move from frantic Stu release something
that tries to justify its price the
aluminum and glass integration is
absolutely stunning especially with the
built-in ventilation on the glass panel
for that lower section the interior is
gigantic and you'll probably spend more
money on water cooling Hardware then on
the case itself with radiators properly
supported absolutely everywhere with the
removable brackets and easy to access
everything basically even with an option
to have a side mounted interior radiator
and the side panel to accommodate for
air flow exhaust absolutely all the
accessories are included with Drive
brackets and a five the quarter inch
drive bay and the vertical GPU mount
storage options are awesome you can
install dual power supplies and even a
second ITX system underneath the main
one and they've thought of absolutely
everything from packaging to the i/o to
all the possibilities with the elite the
name certainly fits the key
the Wow category is next highlighting
individual fantastic features starting
with the best cable management system
this one goes to the NZXT age 700 I I
absolutely love these new plastic pieces
to guide your cables behind the
motherboard tray
it's brilliant velcro straps are here if
you need them and many puck to wrap
cables around and more cases just need
to do something like it I will also add
this is my favorite power supply shroud
design with flexible mounting of the SSD
caddies on this perforation
and appropriate spacing on the front for
a radiator the best modular interior
goes to the be quite dark base 700 I
love how easy it has become to invert
your motherboard tray their approach is
just fantastic the power supply route
follows in that same footsteps of
paneling that can be removed when needed
and obviously accommodates the whole
inversion factor in this case also wins
the best IO that includes a type C port
plus dual USB 3 and an awesome fan
controller the best paint job goes to
the fan techs and to proem special
edition in white this is how you
introduce a color accent with enough
black elements to hide cables with
appropriate colored paneling and the
inclusion of lux RGB frames on the fans
is such a fresh take on illumination the
cooler master maker 5 t is another
awesome example with beautiful red
interior frame surrounded by enough
black to blend in with the rest of
hardware plus an awesome ambient red LED
strip is included and lastly the NZXT is
440 hyper beast is a truly unique piece
of art on the case it is cs:go specific
so if you don't play it wouldn't really
matter to you but it's a special
reminder that case companies have the
capacity and the know-how to expand into
unconventional paint job territory and
now for the fan favorite fail
compilation salman stick to cooling
you're drunk as the x7 absolutely worst
hour of the year
it's totally backwards crappy gigantic
interior layout do OTG but very little
thought into cable management plus a red
molex connector and the worst case
lighting with the worst case branding
two of the year absolutely terrible EVGA
you better send us a cheaper case first
as the DG 77 is way too expensive
because it's a $59 frame with
Aran's TG panels that don't make sense
like non see-through non reflective
front and side glass totally blocked
front airflow the fully white interior
is not attractive cable management at
this price point is poor and this dust
filter is absolutely insulting Lindley
go back to aluminum cases please you
need a new design there just like you
needed a new logo the Alpha 330 and 550
feel like a go-with-the-flow type of
release
just more TG with no focus on airflow
crappy RGB integration with more
expensive model Mullis connection and
fans like what and it just feels generic
they're older but more unique double
chamber tower the PCO 11 also needs a
lot of refinement like flexibility for
fan mounts up top better spacing and
rubber grommets for standard ATX
motherboards proper storage compartments
without so much wasted space and please
no ridiculous interior SSD mounts and
cooler master Wow they've been quite
sloppy this year they should rebrand to
a hot apprentice not cool master because
first the 25th anniversary edition of
the cosmos - nothing changed but they've
added Kirti G panels without any price
incentive it's a five year old case
brought into 2017 and then when the new
cosmos came out the whole thing felt
rushed with dual fire the quarter inch
drive base where only one is available
the interior divisions felt
claustrophobic with those giant panels
actually hiding more than it needs to it
seems like more thought was given to the
lighting features and the overall
exterior look and feel versus putting
more effort into cable management then
the highly anticipated H 500 P was full
of disappointment from terrible front
air flow to the weirdly designed 2-piece
power supply shroud that if moved back
will interfere with the SSD caddy I love
the concept of the paneling to hide all
this cable mess in the back but it was
poorly executed and not easy to work
with
hey silverstone you have the perfect
opportunity to impress with your budget
airflow focused our lo6 pro but why do
you gotta ruin it with this terrible
dust filter ketchup mustard cables all
over the place a molex powered fan hub
no clearance on the shroud for radiator
to slide through if needed
hey in wind get your case designers to
build a system first before launching a
case I absolutely love
the structure of the 301 with unique
ventilation pattern nice eg but the
interior is just a complete mess the
cable management space is also your
airflow area and who thought it was a
good idea to use plastic pieces that you
have to break in order to pass your
cables yes a lot of disappointment this
year right
but we gotta close that off strong so
finally case of the year word goes to
the fractal design define r6 I
personally prefer the smaller mesh spicy
but this introduction that really seals
the deal for many with an O so familiar
frame that is available in various
colors the aluminum front plate is a
staple but the glass mount is new so we
have no thumb screws sticking out from
the side instead it's a two-step mount
for security and better visuals front
airflow with the door closed and my
testing is not significantly affected
only three degree difference so that's
refreshing
the interior is modular for either this
old-school look with the closed off
front section or moving that entire
piece back to open it up for more water
cooling options but in either
configuration we have flexibility with a
front radiator without impacting that
hidden storage compartment the metal
trays are slim and can be stacked on top
of each other for SSDs and not taking up
much work of room the fan controller is
SATA powered and has a pwm connector for
your motherboard the top module and can
either be fully closed or opened for
airflow with the top bracket
accommodating a 360 rad easy
there's even a fill port up top so in
terms of cooling options a visual
variety ease of assembly and wiring the
definer six is our highly recommended
case of the year for 2017 experience
every pixel with the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
and enjoy these awesome new games and
full 4k resolution at over 60 frames per
second and get destiny 2 for free for a
limited time full details in the
description below and so that concludes
our case awards for 2017 let me know if
you agree with my picks and what do you
think of the categories I've added the
new WoW section because you know certain
cases don't have particular something
standing out but I really want to
highlight certain best features of those
particular cases and the fail
compilation why did it grow so much this
year I started at last
because there were a lot of
disappointments but man if 2018 is gonna
be moving like that then we're gonna
have a lot more to complain about
so guys I'm Dimitri with I reckon
extinct so much for watching Happy
Holidays we'll see you in next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
