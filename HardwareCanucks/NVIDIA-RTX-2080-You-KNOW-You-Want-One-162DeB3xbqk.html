oh man I love these quick spin
transitions now for the show floor
almost there but no GPU yet
we'll see so that is the new RDX from
Nvidia pretty exciting stuff but let me
explain everything to you the new master
keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic rest rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection Coolermaster
doing it right
check it out below so here's a funny
thing my nametag is spelled wrong
usually my last name is misspelled my
first time it's my first name that's
misspelled and how do you say pal
demurred e dirty I'm hurt temerity for
today the murder murder everyone
everyone put the murti in the comments
just nothing but demurred ease
Oh my good people Wow so the new r-tx
series has finally launched we have
pretty much you know the basic
information out of it and I can
guarantee the new RDX 20 series are
definitely the cards for the future and
so we have the our TX 2070 the 20 80 and
the 20 80 TI they're supposed to be on
the shelf on September 20th but only for
the 2080 and a 20 80 TI because the our
TX 2070 while everyone is excited about
the GPU is not yet available pre-orders
are not up and no board partners are
selling that car just yet as well so
we'll have to wait and see when that
comes out potentially sometime in
October
now the pricing for the new 20 series
cards is kind of variable so the
founders Edition are more expensive
versus like slightly lower clock
reference editions from work partners
are going for about $50 cheaper which is
the example with the Arctic's 2080 so
the founders Edition is $7.99 versus
EVGA Sangam for 750 or the pre-orders
are going out but they also have the 850
versions so it all depends on the clocks
the r-tx 2080 TI for example goes for
$1,200 for the founders Edition and
again $50 cheaper for the custom board
partner EVGA version but you also have a
$50 extra premium on top of their higher
clock starts while the architects 2070
is starting from $4.99 which is a super
attractive price point for you know the
new 20 series GPUs but the founders
Edition is $5.99 and you cannot preorder
that just yet but still you can see
there is that price fluctuation between
founders Edition and reference cards now
for the basic specifications the r-tx
2070 is running in two thousand three
hundred four quarter course at 16 20
megahertz on the boost with a gigabytes
of gddr5 Tex 2080 has 2944 CUDA cores
with 17 10 megahertz on the boost and
eight gigabytes of gddr5 epi is kind of
insane at 4352 cuda cores
1545 on the megahertz on the boost and
11 gigabytes of gddr5 how they
in games versus the previous Pascal
architecture but the new Turin
architecture seems promising because of
the new r-tx platform and this is pretty
exciting because now we have new
hardware on the actual die that handle
specific tasks with regards to AI and
rate tracing so we have new tensor
course and new our T course that will
handle those particular tasks very well
and while we still have the regular
graphics pipeline through cooler course
and it handling compute very well and
these new tensor course and RT course
seem to be so important to move the
whole visual industry forward within
gaming because that way we can have you
know photorealistic life realistic light
reflections right refractions within
your scene so it is based on texture
based on other objects with a new
environment and that is pretty amazing
to see and some of the demos that
they've showed like bow fit 5 and
actually seen fire
you know reflecting off a hood of a
metal car and then seeing that in
Windows and seeing how all those scenes
interact with each other to give you
like a really beautiful and visually
stimulated gameplay it was truly
starting to see something like that
especially when we have our TX on and
off that visual representation on what
exactly our TX gives us in terms of that
visual advantage you know it's not there
to give us any indication for better
competitive advantage in the game but
it's all about that visual experience so
it is I would say highly subjective and
that brings up an important concern
because these tensor course and RT
course occupy physical space on the die
so what happens if they're not being
used by the application and so Nvidia is
trying to give developers that hardware
to handle AI and ray-tracing tasks and
so it is almost like reliant on
developers buy-in for RTX to be
successful and one relevant example I
can give you is with quick sing support
with Adobe Premiere and how it's been so
slow to get adopted by such a popular
program within you know with a PC space
and so it also brings up the concerns of
our TX and
in the future another example is aimed
the true audio which was an actual also
function block that's built-in onto the
die but game developers didn't use it
and therefore it was wasted and almost
dead on arrival and so this entire MTX
ecosystem with the twenty series cards
it's kind of the future of graphics
cards because of that visual advancement
that we get with light interaction
within your scene but it is highly
dependent on developers by in with MTX
and them using that platform to your
built-in into their games and right now
I think we have about 21 games that
they've said that Nvidia said we'll come
with MTX support which is great to see
but we need to see that on a much larger
scale because right now it's such a new
technology that's looking so far in a
head that the consumer ends up paying
for the cost of that adoption now one
tiny concern the rises from seeing the
demos like the Ironman suit where he's
all dressed up in this like really shiny
metal is that everything becomes a
little bit too shiny and I understand
from a point of a demo that it's awesome
to see how that texture is interacting
with the light that is in the scene I
just hope that game developers don't
push that too far and make everything
super shiny so that everything can be
reflecting light because not only will
that be just a huge hindrance of
performance on the GPU most likely but
also it might look too fake when it's
like too shiny and too reflective so
we'll see and so this entire 20 series
launch is pretty exciting because RTX is
the future of gaming visuals I think you
know ray-tracing incorporating like that
proper light interaction between
textures materials and other light
sources within your scene that is
awesome but NVIDIA relies heavily on the
future games to push RTX and not what is
available now and that's understandable
and so my question to you is do you
think that there's no price premium
especially for the RT x20 ATI
for $500 more versus the GTX 1080 TI is
worth it to you right now because there
is nothing on the market that has r-tx
support just yeah
so you kind of have to buy into the
architecture and this whole ecosystem
with the expectation of r-tx enabled
applications to come later a few more
things I'd like to mention is the whole
GTD are six memory so it's faster much
higher bandwidth for that plus we have
the new and you link support so I think
if you're doing SLI then you're
combining the entire memory pool you're
not just having it and we also have the
virtual link so the type-c connection at
the back of the card for future of your
applications and I'm guessing because we
have the new tensor course and our RT
course for VR applications that's going
to be just killer killer quality and
super performance and yeah overall I
think they're preparing to go into
direction where the industry is just
about to turn and it seems like Nvidia
is their first I also would love to hear
what you think about the new shroud
design for the founders addition you
know duel fans kinda like that flat
section in the center illuminate logo of
course and that backplate but now
because we have two fans the back side
of the card is closed so the air will be
exhausted through the top of the card
where the geforce text is located with
the r-tx so it looks okay but yeah let
us know if you thinking alright guys so
that is the RT X xx series from Nvidia
pretty exciting stuff and they will just
have to wait and see how those new
tensor and RT cores are utilized and how
they are wasted outside of this whole r
TX arena in regular games that don't
utilize that stuff but you have to wait
and see so make sure to subscribe check
out this other realm content and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
