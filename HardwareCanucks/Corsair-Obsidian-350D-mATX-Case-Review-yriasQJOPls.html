Harmonix review we have an obsidian on
our hands today so quite a bit of hype
on this one because it stands in the
lowest price bracket between the entire
obsidian lineup you guys are looking at
the Corsair 350d priced at 110 dollars
now from the initial glance it is sized
as a usual mid tower but unfortunately
this is a micro ATX case the aesthetics
of course are extremely elegant it's
basically a miniature version of the 900
d a very solid construction and of
course that beautiful tented side window
brushed aluminum front panel and the
built in case feed that really brings it
all together into one attractive package
now for the front panel we have power
and reset buttons chrome plated audio
jacks and 2 USB 3 ports moving down we
have 2 5 in the quarter inch drive base
and notice the panel is solid without
any ventilation so your fans will have
to work extra hard pulling air in from
the outside openings behind the cover we
find a dual dust filter with an included
140 millimeter intake fan now also
notice the extra ventilation cutouts on
the frame to allow a bit more air
penetration now at the back we have a
second fan for exhaust and five PCI
slots now this is a micro ATX case after
all and of course a remove dust filter
underneath your power supply a dual fans
can be installed on top with included
rubber grommets to absorb any vibration
especially if you are installing a
radiator but also something to keep in
mind is the clearance for that 8 pin CPU
cable probably best if you route it
first prior to mounting the radiator as
it does block both top rubber grommets
now moving on taking off the side panel
the case internals look a little
different from what we usually see from
Corsair we still get a toolless five and
a quarter inch mount now they've also
added a dedicated SSD cage with the
usual hard drive cage at the bottom the
SSD cage can simply be removed if you
don't need it but it can also be
repositioned right above the hard drive
cage for example if you want to have all
your SATA cables sort of concentrated at
the same spot instead of you routing
them to the SSD cage and its default
position now let's take a closer look at
the SSD cage these are individual
brackets attached with three clips on
each side so prepare to be patient if
you want to remove one of them but here
we have three brackets so technically
you can populate all of them but you
might have trouble connecting them with
the usual l-shaped SATA cables and
that's why coarser includes the Miller
bracket to provide additional spacing
now the 3.5 inch brackets are pretty
standard also tooless approach and
includes mounting holes for SSDs just in
case that three above is not enough now
coming around the back we get an
oversized CPU opening nobody should
complain about the swapping CPU coolers
anymore with plenty of rubber grommets
and of course plenty of room for any
type of cable mess now given both the
cages are removable a second dual
radiator can be installed at the front
this of course means sacrificing the
default storage options but for many
enthusiasts there is always a solution
now with the radiator and the set of
fans installed this leaves 12 and a half
inches of clearance for your GPU so I
thicker radiators are definitely not out
of the question and the one thing to
keep in mind though is when the bottom
hard drive cage is removed the
motherboard tray loses some of its
stability now it's nothing major but I
thought I should point it out now let's
take a look at an almost finished
assembly if you ever worked with any
coarser case you'd appreciate the
experience the Obsidian manages to clean
up extremely well basically without any
effort but when the build looks so
professional and clean you come to
realize that it's not just a black box
that you're working with
it's really an experience in a really
joy to work with so in summary the
Obsidian 350d is stylish and elegant has
great water cooling options of course if
you are willing to sacrifice on the
storage we have great cable management
and there is absolutely no issues in the
hardware department now while I
personally love the simple look at the
front panel you're obviously sacrificing
on airflow and I would love to see some
ventilation integrated into it to keep
up with this elegant design while still
giving us a little bit extra air for
penetration and this only being a micro
ATX chassis it's still a little steep to
pay at such a high price but even from
the very beginning of the Obsidian line
these cases have not been budget
oriented but instead have always been
regarded as sort of these luxury series
so the new Corsair 350 is breaking the
lowest price point in the entire lineup
and definitely going to find the
customers who want that obsidian
experience without taking out a second
mortgage and we're giving it the
hardware canucks damn going to work so
thanks guys for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
