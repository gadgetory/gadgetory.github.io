and in a world of gaming headsets there
are so many different options it's
sometimes hard to choose the right
product for your needs
do you prefer a corded cordless stereo
or a surround sound set up its
portability necessary you know those are
some of the questions that need to be
asked before making a decision
logitech already has headphones that fit
nearly every single need but now they're
adding a new set to their lineup this is
the g5 33 wireless gaming headset and at
$150 it is meant to offer an alternative
for people who don't want to spend
nearly $200 on the expensive artemus
spectrum yet still one virtual 7.1
surround sound personally I've never
owned a virtual surround sound headset
simply because the ones I've tried in
the past failed to live up to my
expectations
but can be G 533 with its licensed Dolby
DTS headphones features changed my mind
let's find out after message from our
sponsor oh hey there nc XCOM is Canada's
leading a tailor for anything your mind
desires just keep within those
categories which are plenty and be
attempted by the weekly deals visit ncx
dot-com for all them sweet deals
wireless gaming headsets are slowly
starting to gain momentum within the
gaming community because the convenience
of cordless access to audio is so
tempting it is an inexpensive bill and
with the g5 33 retailing for about $150
it finds itself among some interesting
competition
there's the SteelSeries Siberia 800 that
retails for $300 the Razer Medawar for
$170 and Logitech's own flagship headset
the G 933 Wireless for $200 and let's be
honest here the g5 33 is similarly
priced to the wide 7.1 g6 33 but it's
lacking a few of that headsets aesthetic
features our review video link will be
posted in the description if you're
interested by looking closer at the g5
33 it should be obvious this is
logitech's entry-level wireless surround
sound gaming headset while it has many
of the g9 33 Artemis spectrums features
like DTS headphone X Pro G drivers and a
2.4 gigahertz single band things like
RGB lighting and the programmable G Keys
have the
removed basically this is a simpler take
on a proven formula that suits me just
fine since I'm not a big fan of RGB
lighting on it head set the g5 33 is
mostly made out of plastic materials
which is definitely not a bad thing
because this maintains the lightweight
structure that I prefer on any gaming
headset
although the glossy finish on the
outside of the ear cups attracts
fingerprints like a champ so be mindful
of that the sports mesh material on the
ear pads have plenty of cushioning to
prevent your ears from making contact
with the drivers and it's designed to
circulate air rather than capturing it
the same applies for the headband which
was pretty comfortable during my testing
the pads are also washable which is
awesome and over my course of testing
the g5 33 I didn't experience any sort
of a fatigue because the clamping force
was just perfect for my taste the ear
cups can rotate 90 degrees and if you
know me well I love this feature because
when I'm resting these around my neck
having them laid out flat gives me more
room to move my head around the
adjustable metal sliders are defined
with 14 individual steps for precise
adjustments so they can fit large sized
heads without problem the microphone is
retractable
and it also features a slight extension
for maneuverability what's interesting
about this blue mic is that they've
attached a small pop filter on top of
the mic to prevent it from picking a
breath noise and popping and it works
excellent Plus Logitech has also
implemented noise canceling
characteristics to eliminate background
noise and as you can hear it does a
pretty good job doing that for example
when I'm typing on a mechanical keyboard
I mind you these are cherry MX blue
switches so they do exhibit quite a bit
of noise the mic barely picks it up
without overpowering my voice so that's
pretty cool but judging the sound
quality it's possible in my opinion it's
definitely not one of the best but if
you take a close attention to the audio
levels my voice and the background noise
sound almost similar so Logitech hasn't
done anything to give emphasis on vocals
which is disappointing because I was
expecting something closer to the
revolver headset from HyperX
which has one of the best microphones
that I've tried recently the headset
also features side tone that lets you
monitor your voice as you're speaking
through the mic which is pretty cool
Logitech hasn't implemented a ton of
macro buttons like what sound on the G
933 ng
6:33 but there's a simply on/off switch
to enable the wireless mode and a button
that set the function as a mute command
by default you can actually remap this
button to perform other tasks through
the driver software that I'll get to in
a moment right beneath is where you'll
find the volume dial that has very light
steps for quick volume adjustments or if
you'd like to perform that precisely
this dial does it in two step intervals
one major advantage of not having ten
buttons behind the headset is that you
don't have to spend too much time
figuring out controls and from my
experience on-the-fly adjustments were
perfect logitech has one of the best
driver software's in the market no
questions asked if you only launched it
at gaming peripheral this would be a
plug-and-play method for you because
it's a unified software for all of their
peripherals in my case I'm greeted with
a physical overview of the headset the G
key can be programmed right here with
any command of your choice thankfully
Logitech has a handful of pre-programmed
commands that users can take advantage
of you can monitor battery levels and if
you'd like to play around with the
equalizer you're more than welcome to do
that inside the software as you can see
towards the left you can choose between
six different presets and finally the
7.1 surround sound tab lets you enable
this feature but do know that you can
assign this to the G key
either way this allows the user to
adjust the volume levels of the seven
audio channels plus there are certain
presets for this run mode regular stereo
mode is selectable - and that's an
absolute necessity when listening to
music all in all great stuff Logitech
now moving on to sound quality and I
have to say this thing surprised me now
remember Hensel reviews are typically
subjective so opinions are purely from
my own perspective with that being said
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with
the G 533 a few weeks back I reviewed
$100 gaming headset from coolermaster
and they sounded terrible for the price
but man switching back to the G 533 took
a whole new turn logitech has always
been known for their fantastic projet
drivers and this one does not disappoint
I tested games by enabling the DTS
headphone surround sound modes and let
me tell you I have never experienced a
virtual 7.1 surround sound like this a
perfect example would be battlefield one
which has a built-in sound preset
specifically designed for the logitech
project Ivor's and it's interesting how
they were able to simulate a virtual 3d
environment with just two drivers on the
headset I could hear gunshots a lot
closer and given the excellent bass
response from these drivers and gunshots
themselves felt powerful just walking
through certain locations in game gave
me a clear representation of positional
awareness which is excellent because you
can hear footsteps 10 to 20 meters
behind you and if they happen to be your
enemy you can easily position yourself
and target them instantly high-frequency
sound is fantastic without any
Distortion and honestly I wouldn't
history using these pair for listening
to music and however I would switch back
to the stereo mode just for that purpose
but regardless it was a beautiful
experience especially since I'm a newbie
to proper virtual science sound battery
life was just as expected given the no
RGB nonsense I was easily able to get it
throughout a day with continuous music
listening and a little bit of gaming
expect just under 15 hours of usage
which should be more than enough to get
you through a LAN party the built-in
battery is user replaceable and can be
recharged through the micro USB port
appropriate cables are provided in the
box the g5 33 connects to your PC
through a USB card wireless receiver and
according to Logitech it's supposed to
offer lossless digital audio
transmission with up to 50 metres of
range and I'm happy to report I had no
issues with signal loss in my office
the range was very strong even at my
kitchen downstairs considering my houses
about 1,500 square feet unfortunately
the gaming headset can only be used in
wireless mode the included micro USB
cable is only used for charging and
updating the firmware on the headset so
be mindful of that
to conclude the g5 33 from Logitech have
delivered a fantastic wireless audio
gaming experience in both stereo and
surround modes like I said the beginning
wireless audio is a tempting yet
expensive route to take however given
that these exhibit an excellent
soundstage not just for gaming but also
for listening to tunes and if you have
the money there are a very good
investment
unfortunately the microphone is
definitely one of its weakest points but
it's still passable so just keep that in
mind when you're using the g5 33 for
competitive gaming
speaking of feedback I want to hear your
