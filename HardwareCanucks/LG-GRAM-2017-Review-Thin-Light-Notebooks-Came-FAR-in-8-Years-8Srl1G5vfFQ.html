technology progress is some things that
we wish remained around are left behind
just take a look at the trend of
notebooks these days they are much more
powerful than they ever we're and they
can now be amazingly portable but
something as simple as battery life has
an improved over the past few years
look laptops have evolved significantly
over the past decade my first one when I
arrived to Canada was about eight years
ago and it was this HP g60 I loved it
and looking at it right now brings back
some memories
it took me through high school and it's
what got me started to think about tech
and pursuing it as a career I've even
edited a few videos on it but none of
you guys will ever see that but sadly
like any other piece of tech this trusty
old HP started to show its age and
eventually the display gave up on me but
it still works as a machine although you
have to connect it to an external
display like I said it's amazing to see
how technology progresses and here is an
excellent example of that this is the
new LG Graham 15 just look at this thing
when the G 60 was around people would
have thought the Graham came from
something out of Star Trek they'd be
blown away that this is an actual laptop
and even now I find it hard not to stare
at what LG has created so let's take a
look at the Graham 15 but first a
message from our sponsor the pure bass
600 is now available with a tempered
glass panel with an easy mount a couple
of pure wings two fans one of which is
140 millimeters with three modular
interior drive caddies along with dual
SSD brackets have nothing to hide
whether be quiet
pure bass is 600 with the Graham 15 LG
really did flex some engineering muscle
it's just point 6 inches thick or thin
if you'd like to say it that way but
what's unique about this machine is how
light it is weighing in at just under
two and a half pounds you wouldn't even
notice if it's in your backpack that's a
lot different than my original nine and
a half pound HP which felt like a brick
no matter how I carried it other than
the lightweight design this little
notebooks other selling point is it's
supposedly amazing battery life LG
claims that with a custom 60 watt hour
battery that uses carbon nanotube
technology the Graham will run for about
24 hours while being used for basic
tasks like word processing and website
housing and ultra thin and light laptop
with that kind of battery life would be
amazing but let's just see how well that
plays now let's talk pricing the fully
expected machine is expensive at $1700
with dual core quad right KB Lake i7
that's actually the same processor as
the gigabyte bricks that we reviewed a
little while ago it also comes with 16
gigabytes of RAM and a 512 gigabyte SATA
based SSD we lowered to your gram is
less powerful but it's also more
affordable at $1200 with better battery
life plus 14 and 13 inch models are also
available with the same larger 61 hour
battery giving users a lot of options
with the price as low as $1,000 for the
13 inch I 5 gram if you take the higher
tier model and compared to something
like the Dell XPS 15 that almost matches
the size of the gram they have different
priorities so the Dell focuses on
performance rather than giving you an
ultra lightweight body and crazy battery
life like the Graham actually one of the
closest alternatives is likely lenovo's
current x1 carbon that goes for a lot
more money but it's also backed by
amazing build quality while being thin
the gram does not compromise on port
selection on the right you get a
Kensington lock USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports a
headphone jack and oddly a micro SD card
reader I'm pretty sure most of you would
appreciate a full-size card slot so LG
please fix that in the next revision
switching over to the left side there's
power N and extra USB 3.0 port a full
size HDMI port and a USB type-c port
which does not support Thunderbolt
you get all the essentials of a basic
laptop without needing to carry any
dongles like what you do with Apple's
offerings Plus as a bonus LG does
include a USB type-c to rj45 LAN port
adapter so I'm pretty sure that would
come in handy during travel what's also
interesting about the Grand 15 is that
they've managed to fit a 15.6 inch IPS
display inside a 14 inch form factor
which not only reduces the overall
footprint of an average 15 inch laptop
but you're getting the exact same screen
real estate without losing resolution
and those bezels hold those bezels
they're almost non-existent especially
when you're watching videos or even
while casually browsing the web
unfortunately the bezel size compromises
the webcam placement which is really at
an odd location
because like you can see it points up at
my nose now given the grams has an IPS
panel viewing angles and contrast ratio
are great but not the best that I've
come across
it also doesn't get too bright
especially when you're taking this on
daylight conditions it's probably not
the best this is also a touchscreen
although I couldn't really take
advantage of that feature simply because
the screen wobbled every time I tap on a
window speaking of design the Graham
looks beautiful the whole body is
crafted of magnesium alloy which
contributes to the light weight
without sacrificing durability but I'd
like to challenge that claim to me the
chassis doesn't feel as durable as an
all aluminum construction and it's also
not cheap to produce there are barely
any signs of flex on the palm rest area
and the keyboard which is awesome
however the lid could pose some problems
since it really did bow when I tried
flexing it the keyboard includes a full
size numpad which could be useful if you
work with a lot of numbers and the keys
exited great tactile feedback so typing
in general was a pleasant experience
then again keyboard feedback is a very
personal thing so let's just say I
really like this one they've also made
it backlit with a two step brightness
adjustment and on essentially thin
chassis that's pretty amazing following
up with the trackpad it's almost perfect
but not quite there yet like the ones
found on the surface book or the XPS 15
the surface is really smooth for finger
navigation and the primary left and
right buttons are integrated at the
bottom tracking for the most part was
accurate I did not notice stutters or
lag so you can comfortably get work done
without an external Mouse also the
screen can be opened with just a single
hand and while it's not a super exciting
feature it's really hard to find laptops
these days that do that other than the
mac books or the razor blade so with all
the features out of the way what was it
like using the Graham 15 well after a
few weeks of getting acquainted with it
there were absolutely no problems with
script editing and media consumption
performance was just as expected the
ultra-low voltage processor won't render
4k videos or perform heavily demanding
tasks but the system was really
responsive sure you can definitely get
away with some like Photoshop work and
maybe a little bit of video editing at
1080p but be aware of your limitations
also the system was dead quiet under
idle situations and the fence do ramp up
slightly under load but
too-loud after temperatures the gram ran
surprisingly cool over my course of
testing other than running a few
benchmarks it really did get warm
slightly to the touch but it's nothing
to be worried about now just for fun
I put the gram up against my old HP to
see what nearly eight years of progress
looks like and the results are really
amazing even with such a thin and light
design new technology kicks some serious
butt I mean look these results were
expected but it's still incredible to
see it firsthand battery life is
actually something I need to take a
little while to discuss since it's one
of Graham's primary marketing points
without it hitting a long amount of time
without recharging there's really no use
of spending $1,700 right with LG's
previous grand notebooks the reviews
were not that positive when it came to
battery life but since the capacity has
gone from just over 31 hours to 61 hours
and of course the power efficient cable
eight processors helped as well so did
all of those changes make a difference
I'd say so I was averaging a little more
than 11 hours performing casual work and
while consuming content the notebook
dipped a little below nine hours still
that's a lot of juice to get you
throughout the day but it definitely
isn't all-day battery life like what LG
is claiming was I impressed though
definitely this is the longest battery
I've gotten out of any notebook so far
one thing I was a little concerned about
was the power connector it looks fragile
and it requires a little more force to
plug in that I'm used to so I'd be extra
careful with that but on a positive side
the power brick is super portable and
easy to toss into a backpack or carrying
case the speakers are not the best
they're located at the bottom with a
slide cut out facing the surface which
kills clarity in the vocals if you're
listening to music or even watching
movies base is completely non-existent
and so I'd highly recommend getting a
good pair of headphones for the best
listening experience and thankfully the
onboard audio jack has a really good DAC
to drive mid-range headphones like my HD
598 so should you get the Graham 15 from
LG it really depends on your demands
it's not for every power user and it's
super expensive for people who are just
looking to browse the web it's somewhere
between giving you the best of both
worlds that is performance and battery
life if you're looking for a thin and
light ultra book that can get you
through out the day with excellent
battery life the
is a noble to get the battery life is
one of the best I've seen on a Windows
notebook and you're not losing a lot on
performance either personally I find
that there's better value spent on
something like the Dell XPS 15 because
it has the specs to justify its price
tag but for an on Google user who
doesn't require a lot of processing
power like video editing or anything
that is super intensive the Graham would
be a perfect fit and that's what I'm
going to end this review I'd love to
hear your thoughts on the LG Graham 15
you know would you spend $1,700 on this
notebook or our Danny alternatives that
you might be interested in like the Dell
XPS 15 or the Dell XPS 13 let us know in
the comments down below I'm Eva with
hurricane axe
thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
