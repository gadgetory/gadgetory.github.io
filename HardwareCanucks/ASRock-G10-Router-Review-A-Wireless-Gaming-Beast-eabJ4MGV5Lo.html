great technology selection and service
gaming routers maybe the first time
you've ever heard that term in the past
most gamers preferred using wired
solutions since they offer the highest
most consistent bandwidth and stability
however with five gigahertz AC Wi-Fi
slowly starting to become popular these
days companies have begun to take
advantage of this technology to make it
even faster and more reliable in
addition with new features like mu-mimo
being implemented these routers are
quickly becoming the multi-user access
hubs today's users looking for
implementing Iban with wireless
solutions for multiple devices can
Wireless finally hope to match wired
that's exactly what as rocks new g10
gaming router hopes to achieve despite
being known for their affordable
motherboards asrock is shooting for the
stars with their first router not only
does the g10 have more features that
most users will actually utilize but its
price will likely be staggering or some
$250 that puts it in the line with some
of the best alternatives from the likes
of Asus Linksys and Netgear but if
you're considering a faster router
anyways there are a few nifty atoms that
as Rob brings to the table with the g10
so let's check it out from a physical
perspective as Rob designed the g10 to
look a little aggressive with these
angular lines pointing in and out the
glossy plastic finish on the body does
look quite good plus it blends in
perfectly within a gaming setup or a
living room unfortunately the g10 can
only be placed in a vertical orientation
so you won't be able to hang this on the
wall or tuck it safely beneath other
components it takes up a lot of vertical
space as well
chose this orientation since the 8
internal antennas are strategically
placed around the housing so blocking
them could jeopardize speeds and the
range within your household there's a
large yet basic LED indicator on the top
to indicate the router status it blinks
at different colors and speeds to
indicate various functions or errors I'm
not sure why azrog decides to go with a
one LED tells everything approach rather
than using a clear
LED panel so now let's talk specs this
is a dual band router with a single 2.4
gigahertz and five bigger expands with
full 802 11 a B G and an AC support
theoretically the figureheads band
should be able to push 1700 megabits per
second when the 2.4 gigahertz band
should be good for 800 megabits per
second it has a dual-core Qualcomm
processor with 512 megabytes of RAM that
can easily manage those 8 internal
antennas and multiple streams without a
problem the g10 can be classified as a
wave 2 mu-mimo router for those
wondering mooo memo stands for
multi-user multiple-input and
multiple-output this means multiple
users can simultaneously stream high
bandwidth data to the same network
without hindering performance hence why
as rock used a beefier CPU controller
and memory taking a spin at the i/o we
have a couple of IR transmitters
separate WPS buttons for the 5 gigahertz
and 2.4 gigahertz networks for Gigabit
LAN ports a single LAN port that's color
coded in yellow two USB 3.0 ports reset
power button and DC in the IR
transmitters that I just mentioned are
there for a reason let's say you have
this router place in your living room
besides your home appliance like your TV
home theater system or even the air
conditioner like logitech harmony series
of remotes the sensor picks up and
learns the infrared signals of your
remote controller and by downloading the
asrock a router app available on both
iOS and Android you can use your smart
phone to remotely control your home
appliances through the router it's a
pretty cool feature but I have a concern
regarding the sensor placement at the
back if you're going to toss this in a
corner of a room rather than having this
towering figure clutter things up it
would be difficult for the sensor to
pick up the signal but if you solve
these issues I would certainly use this
feature on a regular basis and from our
tests it did indeed pick up and learn
various remote control functions across
multiple devices the inclusion of two
USB 3.0 ports on the g10 is a welcome
feature as well you can connect flash
drives external hard drives or even an
ass and make yourself a personal
cloud-based storage or
back up solution setting it up was a
piece of cake all you have to do is log
into router as rom-com and configure the
USB drive as shared storage device and
click apply it reboots the router which
does take about five to ten minutes so
be mindful of that and what do you guys
think of this UI to me it shares a lot
of design elements from an old-school
8-bit game and for $200 I expect
something cleaner than this and even
though the interface is quite responsive
asrock I'm sure you can fix this with an
update on a positive note the
complimenting app that's available on
both Android and iOS looks nice and
works well when you fire it up asrock
requires you to register an account with
them and once you have done that log in
and add the newly installed g10 router
that's connected to your network tap on
it and you're greeted with the router
setting IR control and storage I was
interested to see how well the g10 could
stream movies from my USB device or the
network and to my surprise it worked
like a charm I have a thirty down five
up network set up and 1080p blu-ray
movies ended up streaming really well
when I'm upstairs near the router and
downstairs in my living room and kitchen
the app also lets me download delete
rename copy and move files within the
network drive and I can see myself using
this feature a lot just for craft
footage hats off as rock the overall
performance of the g10 was solid most of
my devices were connected on the 5
gigahertz band and the speeds were
consistent throughout my household that
being my office my sister's bedroom the
living room downstairs and again even
the kitchen I also happen to have the
shield TV from Nvidia so I wanted to see
how well game stream would run and yes
the g10 handled it perfectly
I experienced no signs of lack
throughout my gameplay and this itself
shows how strong and reliable this
router is there is one more thing to
cover and that's the included h2r dongle
held magnetically at the top portion of
the router its main focus is to provide
HDMI miracast abilities much like
Google's chromecast and it also acts as
a wireless access point when traveling
mirror casting did indeed work for the
most part setup process wasn't too
all you need to do is plug the h2r into
the TV via HDMI plug the included USB
cable into the TV's USB port for power
and have your smartphone set up the
whole system
what disappointed me was the UI take it
with a grain of salt but this is
definitely the worst you I have ever
seen compared to the competition out
there streaming pictures or video from
your smartphone is just too complicated
and the chromecast seems to do a much
better job at that as for the H towards
performance as a travel companion that's
a bit more complicated the supposed
benefit here is the ability to project a
clear wireless network in an area where
wireless connectivity maybe a bit spotty
for example in a hotel room essentially
all you have to do is connect the dongle
to an rj45 Ethernet connection and it
creates a strong low limited range
multi-user wireless access point that
can be protected behind a password to
limit access the problem is actually
powering it since azrog doesn't include
an AC adapter rather you should be able
to power it via a micro USB cable that's
plugged into a cell phones wall adapter
and any five volt USB plug should work
but that's another component that you
need to carry along with you and one
that won't be recharging your phone the
g10 is a fast router azrog did miss a
few marks with the placement of the IR
sensor lack of a dedicated led
diagnostic and the immature looking web
UI however on a positive note the
performance on both 5 and 2.4 gigahertz
bands were consistent and it got me into
a point where I wished I had a better
internet plan the h2r is a nice
inclusion for the price and it gets the
job done as well so would you consider
the g10 as an upgrade from your current
router if you don't mind things we
mentioned earlier and what would you
