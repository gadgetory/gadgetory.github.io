what is this
whoa what is this
hmm thanks Jason let's set all right
I'll be honest with you guys I have
certain deadlines to complete every week
for hurricane acts and it's so hard for
me to manage household work while I'm in
the middle of complaining something
important for the channel I do work from
home which is everyone's dream right not
so fast
realistically speaking I do have to take
care of some work in the house and one
of them includes vacuuming our 20 year
old vacuum cleaner did Sarah's quite
well and I thought that my household
tasks were being accomplished until last
week when dyson sent me out the robot
360 i vacuum cleaner and it changed the
story not only did I realize that I was
wasting too much time cleaning this
place but my old vacuum cleaner wasn't
quite doing the job that I expected it
was the dark base 900 maybe the most
innovative case of the year with a
built-in Qi charger interior lighting
tempered glass that can be installed on
either side and a fully modular interior
that can be inverted if you so desire be
quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below meet the dyson 360
i a robot vacuum cleaner that's equipped
with a 360-degree camera and a lot of
extra goodies that I'll get to in a
moment
it's supposed to compete and even
surpass the needles and Roombas of this
world but it does so at somewhat
staggering price of $1,300 Dyson
products aren't never inexpensive but in
many cases regardless of whether it's a
v8 animal or the DX Semyon multifloor
technological innovation takes center
stage these are premium products but a
pocketful of patents has allowed Dyson
to remain around for the better part of
20 years without missing a beat in that
time Dyson has arguably changed the way
we look at performance of vacuums now
they're turning their eye to semi
autonomous vacuums there are some
understandably high expectations by
we'll be 360 I be the best robot vacuum
cleaner out there let's find out a short
disclaimer I have never used a robot
vacuum cleaners so whatever I'm sharing
here whether that's positive or negative
is slowly coming from my experience so
if you guys have any suggestions or
alternatives definitely leave a comment
down below and I'll make sure to check
them out I'm approaching this blind as a
first-time user of a robotic vacuum
cleaner and boy am I excited I will get
into the technical details either so
think of this as a first time user
experience rather than a full technical
review all right let's begin with the
setup process it's actually pretty
straightforward you get an adjustable
docking station which gets plugged into
the wall you can plug the cable in to
either side of the dog depending on the
location of your socket which is very
thoughtful
once the 360 is plugged in you'll notice
a blue LED power indicator on the dock
right below is where you'll find two
large contact points for power to pass
through and when you place the robot
with the clear bin facing the wall the
battery light located on the power
button of the robot starts to pulsate
and it will turn solid when fully
charged while that's charging prepare
the room accordingly don't leave any
cables paper magazines bags etc on the
floor make sure that there's at least 50
centimeters of clearance around the
robot so the camera can track certain
points right away before it starts to
undock itself dyson recommends you to
provide adequate lighting for the robot
to navigate around since its sensors
work best in full light conditions it
makes sense because the camera sensor is
small making it hard to see in low-light
environments however I tried using this
robot in the night with normal room
lighting and while it did take a lot
longer to clean than the average
cleaning time during the day its task
was still completed to my satisfaction
so how does this robot perform does a
suction power work really well does it
really save you time how easy is it to
clear the bin and what's the experience
like owning one of these I just have one
answer to all these questions it's
fantastic let me elaborate Dyson has
implemented a new digital motor Vito
that's energy efficient and spins at up
to 78 thousand rpm which is ridiculously
fast and powerful enough to suck up most
dirt it's a hundred watt motor that one
the lithium-ion battery which gets
recharged through the dock the brush bar
has the same design as what their
full-size machines offer this includes
the carbon fiber elements along with
nylon bristles to drive deep into the
carpet to suck up the dirt the brush
bars span across the unit in order to
cover as much of surface area as
possible including the edges the 360 I
know gets around with on continuous
tracks and according to Dyson this was
implemented because using wheels would
have yielded less traction and
inconsistent speeds there's also a
complimentary app called Dyson link and
once you have it paired up with your
phone whether that's Android or iOS you
can use it to scheduled cleaning runs
view a visual map of previous cleaning
sessions along with the time it took to
clean as well as the area it covered
this is always a welcome feature since
it grants a visual indicator about how
well the vacuum informed there's a
separate product guide if you need to
learn a bit more about the robot as well
as troubleshooting section to the Dyson
360 is former gets updated automatically
when it's connected to Wi-Fi but if you
want to do it manually there is a USB
port behind the post filter and you can
grab the latest former directly from
Dyson's website and install it via flash
drive I do want to point out that the
robots functionality doesn't depend on
Wi-Fi performance it's designed to
function independently of any wireless
connection the Wi-Fi feature is just an
extension to the 360 eyes user
experience now my phone is connected to
a 5g network 99% of the time but
unfortunately the robot only picks up
2.4 gigahertz bands so you'll need to
connect your phone to a 2.4 gigahertz
network band to pair it and utilize the
features of the app just remember when
pairing place the robot as close as
possible to the router this is to ensure
that the unit picks up a strong signal
right from the get-go I started the
cleaning process with my office the
space was well lit I follow the tips
that I mentioned previously and I set it
to run an automatic path the results
where outstanding I was curious enough
to see and move around my space plus the
two obstacle detecting sensors at the
front do a really good job preventing
from any crashes even with low table
legs and judging from the footage
Dyson's first attempt at an automatic
vacuum pretty much covered the whole
stew
when you look at the map the empty dots
represent the obstacles and it picked
those out perfectly
if the battery is starting to run out
that 360 I finds its way back to the
dock starts to recharge again and then
resumes back to addressing the uncleaned
areas if something gets into the brush
bar your phone will receive a
notification and it's just a matter of
removing the debris and pressing the
resume button my top floor was covered
after a single recharge and that
includes the other two bedrooms plus the
hallway and the same story applies in my
living room too
I did set up the dock at a different
location since my office is upstairs and
there's no way for the robot to climb
down and clean the rest of the household
the best part is that once the cleaning
process is complete the camera sensor
erases the data and resets its memory so
no matter where you set the docking
station it thinks that it's cleaning a
new space emptying the clear bin was a
simple process
- once you press the cyclone pack
release button the bin comes out lift a
cyclone out and clear the dust and as
you can see yeah my old vacuum wasn't
working that great if you want to remove
any debris on the brush bar you can use
a coin to turn the brush bar fastener
and slide it out gently there's only one
thing I can complain about the dyson 360
I and that's the time it takes to clean
a certain space according to dyson it
takes two hours and 45 minutes to charge
the unit and the run time is roughly
expected to be 45 minutes I'm not sure
how this compares to the competition
like the Roomba from iRobot or the
bought back from Neto if I were to
manually clean the space with a modern
high-tech vacuum I probably get the
whole floor done in 20 to 30 minutes
luckily this can work while I'm filming
if not we'd have a problem this is not a
replacement for your existing vacuum
cleaner it won't clean the stairs or get
extreme corners or baseboard but what it
can do is clean your surroundings by
taking its own time and it does its job
really well with the power Dyson is
known for and intelligence of a good
robot vacuum it can certainly save you
some time there's definitely a hefty
price tag on this and I just can't
justify spending that much on it
compared to the offerings from iRobot Oh
neato because I haven't tried
yet it's not the perfect robot cleaner
but it may be the best one out there
from my first time perspective well
there you have it those are my thoughts
and experience with the Dyson 360 I
robot vacuum cleaner I can constantly go
out for business feeding or stay home
focused on work while this little bad
boy takes care of cleaning the rest of
the house I still have to go clean those
stairs though before mom starts yelling
at me but guys thank you so much for
watching and definitely leave your
thoughts on whether or not robot vacuum
cleaners are useful and I will make sure
to check them out
I'm Eva with Harbor connects and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
