possible without innovative fantex
world-leading Nvidia graphics memory
partner Corsair and retail partner and
CIX
along with silverstone and in win man
Thermaltake was in hot waters during
their Computex reveal having released
their WP wine that is strikingly similar
on the outside - what case laps is
producing has got the community fired up
about thermal fake quote unquote so I
visited Shannon to get his side of the
story and see for myself if the rumors
were true so first of all yes the
exterior framing and the total aesthetic
of this new series totally reminds me of
case labs but this type of structure and
framing was also found on mountain mods
cases and reminiscent of leonie cases -
and I wanted to point that out there
because throughout the entire category
of this type of high performance water
cooling enclosure there are similarities
shared between all these brands that
makes them people in particular have
pointed out the mesh design in the 5 the
quarter inch drive brackets that are all
different sizes just like what case-law
produce but the mesh Shannon told us is
made this way for the best possible
structural integrity of those really
thin pieces of metal so apparently they
tried honeycomb squares triangles and
circles all that have proven to bend
easily under pressure so it's the
combination of elements that have added
up to this case to look just like a copy
this still doesn't hide the fact that
thermo tech is clearly interested in
acquiring some that market share from
case labs and there is a clear divide
between how the enthusiasts crowd
responded either losing respect for
Thermaltake or not really caring about
that because the case industry always
borrows in some form or another and the
last group is happy to see this roll out
because they can now afford the case of
this caliber now in my opinion case
lamps and what they do speaks enormous
quality from the thick aluminum panels
to quality control and customer service
and the entire process is very pleasant
and you get what you pay for so while
their cases have a distinct look I think
it's
not what defines case labs in my opinion
so the one striking difference between
the WP line and case labs are the
materials used and target audience
Thermaltake uses very thin sheets of
metal you can see them just Bend easily
as the door swivels to open the exterior
panels do not use the same mounting
method and the internals are also
completely different because of the
steel you can now use magnetic dust
filters on all the ventilation ports and
for someone who is considering a case
lab chassis is buying into that
high-quality aluminum and incredible
customization from the very beginning
and the same cannot be said about
thermal take of course on the other side
of the coin users who cannot afford the
case lab chassis now have options at 1/3
of the price which is good for the
consumer however this entire heat of
thermal fake intensified with the
suppressor f51 that is to continue the
trend is also strikingly similar on the
outside to the fractal design define r5
you have a swirled or the front with
brushed plastic front esthetic and sound
dampening foam on the inside very
similar looking side ventilation strips
as on the r5 they've also added this
rubber strip in the corner so you can
loop that at the bottom and the panel
doesn't swivel open during
transportation there is a removable dust
filter at the top with three removable
sound dampening panels on the inside
that you can individually remove that
are pretty much identical to what
fractal design offers with their margins
on the inside however the internals are
completely different as it utilizes an
identical frame as their core v50 one
case which is a really good frame in my
opinion with module drive cages and
plenty of room for everything but I
asked Shannon why go this route in the
physical exterior department and he told
us that this is what people wanted to
see simple square edges very elegant
design like and thermal takes direction
here is to clearly compete with the r5
as both are priced at the $119 so the
question becomes what are your thoughts
on this entire ordeal with
growing design and functionality
elements do you think this will
negatively impact business with case
labs or the sales of the r5 I think it
has definitely sent a shockwave
throughout the industry but I wonder if
this will just blow over and we'll
return to business as usual but let us
know how you feel on the whole thermal
fake bandwagon and let us have a
discussion on the industry level of how
things like this should be handled</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
