hardware canucks video today we'll be
guiding you through the installation
process of this engine mod for the
touchpad nas engine mod is an enhanced
version of Google Android and we'd like
to give credit to Sinjin mod team for
developing the software along with roots
wiki forms where all this information
can be found now a quick disclaimer
before we begin is that this software in
this installation is use it at your own
risk as there potential problems with
the software and installation and it may
cause damage to your device
now HP has expressed its support for
this engine mod development however they
do say that it may void your warranty
now the link in the description is of
the actual forum on root wiki once you
are there we recommend reading the
disclaimer and potentially a number of
times as it goes into detail information
of what we'll be doing it outlines some
potential risks you may encounter and
provide some troubleshooting advice in
case something goes wrong now once you
have read the disclaimer the very bottom
of the article has all the download
links and let's do a quick rundown of
what they are first the Installer and
readme file then we have the uninstaller
which has been added with the alpha 2
version allows the removal of the
android from your touch pad then we have
the actual Android operating system
labeled cm7 and today we are installing
the alpha 2 version then there's the
clockwork recovery tool which allows for
updates to be installed on a touchpad
without needing to remove the Android
which is very convenient and lastly is
the mobile file that triggers the
installation on the touch pad so once
you download these files I recommend
putting them in the same folder so you
know exactly where they are located the
ACMA installer which which was the
readme and installer file it's a zip
file and it only contains two files
which I have already extracted a quick
tip if you open the readme file this is
just a text file so if you want to copy
the entire thing and paste it into a
Word document it would automatically
adjusts for the sizing of the spaces and
just a much easier format to read and I
do recommend also reading this prior
watching this video so you know exactly
what we're going to be doing
and what are the steps we'll be going
through and one thing you want to leave
all these files all the files in it's a
zip format because they'll be placed
onto the touchpad without further ado
let's dive right into it
another thing you will need would be no
calm no overcome as a software developed
by HP TouchPad that allow is the
communication between your computer and
the HP device and that's very important
here because we are making our device
bootable from a USB and overcome will
allow that portal between the device and
the computer and to initialize that
installation now simchah provides links
for all three systems and since we're
using Windows we'll just go on to this
link which I have open here already you
can list all the entire webOS software
developer kit but you can also just
select some options within it but all we
need is the normal comb driver which is
installed with the software developer
kit so you can download this entire
software developer kit or just Google
Nova driver download and find it at
your own time but once that's installed
you should have a folder I have just the
driver downloaded and installed and the
driver is installed in program files on
your local disk and under Palm Inc
folder and this is what she was what
should look like so you can see the
normal com driver over there which is
the executable file
alright so now the next step once you
have all the files already all you have
to do is connect your HP TouchPad
through the USB provided to your
computer
once that's connected it should
recognize from the HP TouchPad that it
has connected to the computer click to
use as a USB device so once you click to
use as a USB device it should be
recognized by your computer open the HP
TouchPad volume and create a new folder
called CM install now in this folder we
will place all the following files we
need the mo boot file just copy it over
we need the if you if you do want to do
to install the clock work recovery tool
also place that in there and we need the
actual Android system so we'll be using
the alpha 2 version we'll copy that over
onto the HP TouchPad
next what we want to do is we want to
unmount the HP TouchPad from the
computer using your mouse not the actual
USB you want to USB to remain inside the
computer you want the USB to be
connected to the computer in the
touchpad so we're going to eject the HP
TouchPad from the computer okay so the
HP TouchPad has been removed as you can
see we're back to the home screen next
thing we want to do is we want to make
the touchpad bootable through USB so one
thing you can do that you have to go
into your settings go into device info
reset options and you have to click
restart once you click restart you have
to hold the up power volume up button
once we see a little picture like right
now and that will make the USB bootable
make the HP HP TouchPad bootable from
your P as you can see now once we
receive this logo here we see if
Palmanova come booty which means that
the Nova comm recognizes that both
devices both the touchpad device and the
computer are communicating between each
other so the next thing for us to do
would be to copy the Acme installer file
into the palm ink folder alright so now
we have the ACMA installer file be in
place in the pound ink folder that will
initialize the installation now we just
have to input a code that will trigger
that installation so we have to first
navigate through the command prompt
window on windows if you're using Linux
or or a Mac it be similar operation on
the Mac its terminal you'll be going
exactly the same directions basically
into the folder so now we have to if you
don't know how to navigate through
folders and command prompt just a quick
tutorial press CD your volume disk with
which were on a local disk C colon slash
use quotations to indicate the exact
name of the folder you want to navigate
to Program Files quotation close another
another slash then we go on into pound
Inc make sure to type them exactly as
they are written now we now press ENTER
and as you can see we are inside the
Program Files palm in folder now we have
to input the certain following code that
will initialize the installation so we
type in over comm boot mam space Acme
installer now what this will do is will
initialize the installation from the
computer it will trigger the boot a
mobile boot file on HP TouchPad and that
will trigger the installation so if
everything has been placed correctly
let's cross our fingers and hope that
alpha 2 version is now installed
as you can see here the installation has
started to extract the files or what it
seems to to be doing it seems to work
properly and I'll just wait for the
installation to finish and it should put
right into Android so we're just gonna
wait for this relation to complete and
we're gonna take a look at the Android
alpha 2 version so now we are preparing
to shut down meaning everything has been
installed and hopefully if everything
told successfully we should boot into
Android without any issues and this is
another extra allows for a little menu
so you can select with the bone buttons
either going down or up if you want to
boot back into where West if you want to
use clockwork recovery or if you just
want to simply put into into it the very
first loading screen is gonna take a
little bit longer than the rest of them
and that's just the nature of the first
boot and as you go and further you will
experience faster boot times
as you can see we've booted into the
Android successfully just let's try some
options out as you can see we have the
menus everything seems to be working
properly now quick thing if you want to
put back into webOS let's hold the power
button down we are good in here
you have to reboot and it gives us a
nice option to reboot to webOS and
that's really great you don't have the
option so you click OK and if everything
works perfectly we should look put right
back into webOS and you can see the HP
logo is showing up now if the HP logo
starts to glow that means the boot into
the web West is successful and
everything is working perfectly
and if you want to move back in to
Android it should automatically as a
default boot into it if you power off
the system and turn it back on or you
just go into back the reset options and
restart and you are going to be prompt
with a the select window where you can
select either the webOS system or the
Android
as you can see the HP logo starts to
glow which means we are booting into
webOS successfully as you can see we are
booted back into the webOS system and ro
it has been installed successfully thank

this tutorial I hope it's been very
simple if you have any questions
