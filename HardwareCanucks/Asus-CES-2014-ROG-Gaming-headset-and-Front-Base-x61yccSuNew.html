to you by and say x-com technology
connect hey guys we are here in the Asus
booth we've covered the Asus press
release press conference where we took a
look at their mobile devices and their
let's let's look around here this is
their ROG monitor so we took a look at
this and it is very impressive at 1440p
resolution 27-inch exactly what we want
to see from g-sync right a very thin
bezel as well but why don't we take a
look at some of the other things that
they have here in stock so what you're
gonna take a look today is obviously
issues is they do have peripherals and
they do have audio products so once we
go ahead and take a look at this their
latest headset the Cerberus that I hope
I'm pronouncing that Cerberus so this is
a sort of your mid-level budget entry
level gaming headset a few impressive
features this is $49.99 so the audio
quality is going to be sort of it is
dependent on the price of course but
hopefully we won't be hearing anything
based to bass heavy and impressive
features 60 millimeter drivers of course
the the way the driver is tuned is very
important so we are told that of course
it's a gaming headset so there will be
sort of this bass sort of bass presence
but we've told them said that you know
what maybe tone down the bass a little
bit and emphasize the mids and the highs
all the detail on the game that you want
to see so it comes with a detachable
microphone like so it does have a wind
foam on there and it is noise cancelling
microphone so it has two microphones on
each side to cancel out the background
noise what's at whatever is around you
it does carry somewhat a very
distinguishable and very similar design
to somewhat of the SteelSeries Siberia
lineup and they actually do have a very
similar design in nature that's because
the actual headband as you can see these
tubes are sort of waving this is it's
lightly rubberized it can sort of feel
the wire inside of them but the actual
headband is as you can see is flexible
let me put them on my hand like so
and now they sort of perfectly fit in in
the place and there they provide a nice
resistance to the head so they are not
too tight and they do have a very
comfortable fit the ear cups have they
are pleather and they do have this sort
of memory foam like what we've seen from
a lot of a lot of gaming headsets
through the day and they do have a
design feature of this Asus red color
inside so the red lining and red strips
on the outside the this is a slightly
rubberized they do have a little bit of
swivel and so and also one more thing to
mention is that first of all you have
this mic control so you can either mute
or unmute the microphone it has a clip
on the outside and a volume rocker on
this side so you can adjust the volume
now this microphone is retractable sorry
attract what keeps are intractable is it
it's detachable microphone for the
purposes of being this being just a
mobile headphone and that's because it
does connect with a standard 3.5
millimeter jack into this extender that
does split into both a microphone and
headphone jack and it does include this
extender but using this regular 3.5
millimeter jack which is right here you
can use this with your mobile devices
your iPhone your Android whatever and it
has a microphone on the actual sort of
this base so you can still pick up phone
calls regardless of whether you have a
microlight din or not and that's a very
good feature I think that you know
utilizing this headset / headphone to
its full potential and they're very
comfortable and really hopeful to see
sort of to see to test them and
hopefully that they're not super bass
heavy and they do utilize a very tonal
properties now and a few other features
that we have here in stock at Asus booth
is this very unique rog front base it
utilizes sort of very dashboard looking
style it does have both microphone and a
headphone jack right below has a USB and
three buttons for there's three buttons
that two of them are programmable one of
them can just if you press it it will
exit the game or exit anything that
you're working in for very fast that
exit it does have a control wheel and
that's what you
used to basic control this entire screen
this is not a touchscreen as you can
tell and what you can do so we have rpm
for the fans you can cycle between them
using the wheel we have temperature
probes for the motherboard and the
inside the case that you have sensors
and we also have CPU frequency now plus
the time and you know the it does have a
very cool appeal it does utilize two
five and a quarter inch slots and one
more awesome thing to point out here at
the Asus booth is this asus Poseidon
this is a GTX 780 and one of the few
unique features about this it's both an
air cooling card and it water cooler so
right here these are your water cooling
sort of piping entrances that you can
unplug and you can put in your own
fittings and there you go you can have a
water-cooled poseidon as gtx 780 plus an
air queen there are two fans underneath
and this will be coming out later in the
year but it does have very unique
characteristics or the fact that it's
both air cooling and water cooling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
