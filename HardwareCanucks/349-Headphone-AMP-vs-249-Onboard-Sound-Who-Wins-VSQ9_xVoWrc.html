Dimitri with our Canucks and I used to
be very particular about my audio setup
in terms of what headphones i pair with
what particular amplifier and for the
longest time I used the o2 + au DAC from
JD's labs as my main audio source and
because I thought that that would be the
best thing to drive my HD 800 but at
some point I was like Yolo and routed
all my audio through the motherboard
because I was tired of being obsessed
with what is the best solution for my
headphones and for my speakers and stuff
and just was really enjoying the
convenience of it is what it is until
JVs Labs came out with the element at
$350 diag slash had some amplifier and
yeah I was intrigued but how does it
compare to the onboard audio of my $250
motherboard let's find out right this
explore your future with the cosmos -
case and celebrate 25 years of ambition
the drives Coolermaster forward enjoy
the familiar yet still forward-looking
character of the frame with solid
aluminum handles it may be the most
physical you'll ever get with the
computer case but it's all worth while
or get creative with any of the 13
storage options that encourage outside
the box thinking meanwhile the curve
temple glass panels on both sides
ensures a lasting impression classically
trained but still ready for anything
the coolermaster cosmos - lets celebrate
the past by building for the future so a
quick refresher attack is a digital to
analog converter it converts the zeros
and ones from your audio source to an
actual waveforms through your headphones
can read it this is just an external
deck it handles all the processing in
here and not on your motherboard or your
smartphone or any other source this is
where the processing happens so I had
one amplifier boost the signal for your
headphones so each headphone have
electrical resistance on the current
which is impedance measured in ohms so
the higher the number the more difficult
it is to drive them at proper volume so
this is 50 ohms impedance which is kind
of easy to drive in your smartphone and
through the motherboard but this is 300
foams so it's more difficult to drive
you properly at good volume with good
resolution and detail through your smart
phone so this is exactly where the
amplifier
comes into play so the element is both
exact and the headphone amplifier but
they can be purchased separately which
is why the element is the most expensive
one here it connects your computer via
USB cable and compatible with both PC
and Mac I wish they included cable was a
bit longer so I can place it further
away from my system and I also wish that
the power brick was somehow smaller it
just adds so much bulk to routing the
element but it's not meant to be tucked
away anywhere it's meant to be sitting
on your table and it's your show-off
piece it's very beautiful with this flat
and white body it's a little bit too
large for my taste but definitely looks
better than the old deck that has that
more rugged appearance overall I like
the smoothness of the metal shell and
while it looks good that slight
depression around the volume wheel
collect dust and particles that are not
as easily wiped as on the rest of the
flat surface aside from the logo the
front the top is very minimal with the
color accent around the volume wheel I
have the copper version to match my
macbook pro but the red and black are
also available and when using the
headphone amplifier we get an LED
illumination around the wheel the wheel
itself is very smooth with minimal
resistance and quite a lot of travel
distance for really fine adjustments in
the volume with hard stops on each end
the wheel of my unit wobbles just a
little bit it doesn't impact volume
adjustments in any way but because of
this motion I thought it was a press
down button but it is not at the front
there is the quarter of an inch
headphone output and the Resta
connections are at the rear so you can
route a set of speakers through the DAC
out or connect another amp through the
line in the power button turns on the
headphone amplifier and decide it is a
low or high gain to boost the signal and
my only complaint here is the lack of
source switching for analog in or out as
will have to manually disconnect one set
of cables for the other source to take
over plus the volume wheel is for the
headphone amplifier only and here are
some fancy specifications that I don't
understand and it was time to get into
the music element and hear what this
thing is capable of and wow I
it really led to instinctive mind of
wanting to go back and revisit some of
your favorite songs and hear how they're
different and they also did that with my
videos and realize that I did not do a
good job with audio and mastering things
with the in terms of the music in the
background and the voice so that will
change now with the element the DAC on
the element is excellent it's super
clean but it has a bit of wireless
interference so with my phone right next
to it I could hear the wireless
interference in the headphones before
receiving the notification on the phone
so make sure to keep the distance
between the element and your wireless
devices as far as the amplifier goes it
is incredibly powerful it drives my HD
hundreds perfectly well without
introducing the harshness that I
normally here at loud volumes through
the motherboards the output is just
natural I'm happy that it's not overly
bright and it's not warm either keeping
the bass controlled combined with a very
open and the detailed signature of the
HD 800 I'm going to keep this on the
desk for future reference sounds but I'm
very interested to hear how the onboard
audio handles HD 800 and this a 2's
motherboard comes with you know pretty
good audio in it I don't care about all
the gaming sonic studio stuff and
everything was disabled and I was
surprised that the motherboard drove the
HD 800 very well in terms of power and I
left about 60% volume to be comfortable
however switching between the
motherboard and the element I could
notice the difference so let's say the
lower end reproduction is just not as
full on the motherboards in terms of the
sound stage separation on the
motherboard again everything felt a
little bit closed off while on the
element I could hear things being sort
of in the distance while on the
motherboard things are just not as
separated and in terms of the the treble
on the motherboard
it was harsher and dryer versus very
well controlled and smooth on the
element I also have this dock the d3
from audio engine and in terms of sound
stages produced very similar
environment as the motherboard sort of
closed off so I can really appreciate
the amplification on the element that
really opens up the environment and you
can hear that separation and distant
audio elements in whatever you're
listening to and so the element is
superior compared to my other amplifiers
and acts with a fantastic neutral
amplifier a lot of power and it's also
standalone so you can move it around
your PC's and then giving it the
hierarchy next damn good award but I'm
honestly impressed with the onboard
audio and if I'm not critically
listening for the differences between
the elements and the onboard audio I
would enjoy both sources just fine the
courser glaive game mouse has it all
with the comfortable shape and
interchangeable some grips on run
switches a fantastic optical sensor with
one dpi adjustment steps and of course
my friends RGB lighting experience
performance in the palm of your hand
with the link in the description below
and so for concluding thoughts you
really got to ask yourself if you need a
DAC and a headphone amplifier because
you're not happy with your current audio
sources or you simply want to pair the
best quality headphone with the best
quality interface I'm perfectly fine
carrying the HD 650 s and the HD 800 s
with my motherboard but it does take a
certain level of commitment to branch
out into this really high-end audio
stuff with amplifiers and acts just be
warned that it's an expensive path so
