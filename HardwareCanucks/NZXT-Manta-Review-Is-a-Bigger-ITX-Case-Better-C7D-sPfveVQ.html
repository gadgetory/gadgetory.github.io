great technology selection and service
seriously okay the new mystery NZXT case
is finally here this is the manta Mini
ITX bend the rules as they say and who
better to introduce a curvy frame like
this there's an obvious shift towards a
powerful ITX systems and I love that but
you got to ask whether the larger form
factor is worth it to you because right
next to a mid tower something like the
age of 40 demanda doesn't seem so small
and actually NZXT is proud to introduce
a chassis this big tailored towards ITX
it is priced at $139 so the target
audience here are obviously enthusiasts
and the reason behind this price point
are the curves you notice the Manta
isn't your ordinary ITX enclosure with
curved metal plated panels all around to
give it an elegant design with a faint
NZXT logo at the front I personally love
this frame structure it's a nice
evolution of this unique NZXT character
and the only thing people will be asking
now is when are we going to see an ATX
version of the chassis the top is fully
covered with two beautiful curved
indentations where we also find a pair
of USB 3.0 audio jacks and the power
button with an illuminated power strip
that also acts as your hard drive
activity LED the ventilation ports
running down the top in front of the
case are very well implemented that
they're both almost hidden from the user
thanks to the coverage of the side
panels but they are also adequately
spaced out to a lot of front fans do the
job properly with intake and exhaust
there at the top to exit without much
resistance you can achieve fantastic
airflow inside the monta with dual 120mm
fans included at the front with 140
millimeter mounts available as well but
the dust filter here is also deep enough
to house a set of fans outside of the
frame for push-pull scenarios and the
same goes for the top in terms of fan
options which are supposed to be mounted
above the frame with the radiator just
below and so now you can appreciate why
this enclosure is actually so large a
few words on the side panels first NZXT
is proud to say the window is the
largest in size for an ITX case so far
which is understandably so given this is
one of the largest ITX cases that we've
reviewed to date second the thumb screws
are attached to both panels so you don't
misplace them and third they are curved
for a reason to give extra clearance for
cable management while still minimizing
the total footprint of the frame and
while it may seem as if the window panel
can be mounted at the back they are not
reversible as not all hatches align
properly and with regards to the window
itself be careful as it's not as
resilient to normal handling marks so if
you want to keep it clean make sure to
peel off the protective film after
you're finished with the assembly on the
inside we find an almost mini version of
the s340 I would say with the totally
enclosed power supply chamber that will
support any ATX power supply and as you
can see there's nothing in this chamber
to limit compatibility there's a dust
filter underneath the power supply the
top of the power supply chamber is
vented and it is also slightly angled so
your GPU doesn't choke and a small
square cutout is perfect for PCI Express
cable routing and if you're thinking of
a radiator mounting at the front you
have full 5 centimeters of clearance
from the fans until you hit the frame
which is already fully open for you to
utilize now one strange factor missing
here are rubber grommets which for a
$139 enclosure is odd especially with
this many cut outs but the unique cable
bar on the side of the motherboard
allows to strengthen the entire frame
while also hiding most of the cables
that pass through it for storage we have
dual SSD brackets on the side there that
are secured with a single thumb screw
and they are not on the way of your
radiator if you decide to put one at the
front however they need to be
in order to install the three and a half
inch drive which is on the other side it
would be super convenient to have an
independent hard drive bracket that you
can access without having to worry about
removing those SSDs first also the three
and a half inch drive is you can see it
sticks out quite a lot which is why the
side panel is also curved the one
disappointing fine for me was the lack
of compatibility with the hue plus due
to the nature of installation of those
SSD brackets that first have to go
forward into the cable bar and only then
back to secure the hinges this prevents
anything that is not an SSD form-factor
height wise to be installed but luckily
NZXT is aware of this and they will be
changing the installation for those SSD
mountings that will be moved forward
five millimeters towards the front to
allow the installation of something like
the hue plus or any other thicker to an
half inch slot device but regardless of
that they will all be upside down which
is super unfortunate taking a look at
the back and the XD has made sure no
cable will be left unattended with cable
tie points all around plus a fan hub is
available which is a must for an ITX
case as many ikx motherboards have only
two fan headers this one has eight with
an extension cable and the pwm connector
so you don't need to worry about fan
connectivity and finally here's the
finished system on the inside it's
practically like working inside an ATX
enclosure as you can take off the top
and the front panels and easily route
everything and mount your radiators and
fans and etc the case performed
extremely well in this record and this
was the most pleasant ITX experience for
me the frustrating part however was the
motherboard and where the eight pin and
the 24 pin connectors are located which
are way off from what this case is
designed for so I would highly recommend
choosing a motherboard whose layout
mimics a more traditional ATX for easier
cable routing on the flip side of that
coin however NZXT should have made
larger cutouts at the top which would
let me route the giant 24 pin cable
through there instead of it crossing it
through mem
Marie like I did with this build but
overall Monta opens new possibilities
for water cooling in an ITX form factor
one that prioritizes clearance and space
for the ease of assembly over space
efficiency and compact features and with
regards to cable management this was
such a quick cleanup at minimal effort
you have cable tie points running on the
side the cable bar a ton of space on the
other side of the power supply and the
entire front section is fully open and
this is where a dedicated hard drive
cage could've come in handy but they've
opted for just a single mounting points
for either a three and a half or two and
a half inch drive on the floor and
lastly the built in lining features are
very basic that allows you to cycle
between the side NZXT logo and the rear
i/o LED and turn them off individually
or both on I find the lack of RGB
lighting to be disappointing even though
the white illumination looks clean and
modern it might be very difficult to
color coordinate with the rest of the
hardware unless you plan ahead or at
least it would be great to have the hue
plus connector which can be part of the
system you would install yourself
in conclusion NZXT monta is a solid ITX
case and I mean that on all fronts with
fantastic build the right airflow
perfect cable management and is geared
towards full-out water cooling with no
compromise they will be fixing the SSD
bracket placement which is awesome and
the only real flaw here is the mounting
system for that single vertical
mechanical drive which I wish was on
some rails so you don't need to remove
both SSD brackets to get access to that
three and a half inch drive but the real
question is why a case like this even
exists it's almost the size of a mid
Tower it's actually more expensive than
something like the h4 40 and it's going
against all the attractive ITX features
like space efficiency and compact
footprint but I feel the bend the rules
slogan doesn't only apply to the design
but the mentality of what can be done
with ITX
which is very refreshing and that is it
for this review of the NZXT
to ITX thank you so much for watching
I'm Dimitri with hark knox don't forget
to subscribe for more case reviews in
the future and we'll see you in the next
