maker 5t Wow
they couldn't make the name any longer
actually T stands for turbo because the
top portion of the case is sports car
inspired or so we were told at CES but
regardless the five fee is well balanced
in the design department with a familiar
but refreshed coolermaster character one
that will haunt your wallet at $250 so
let's see if it's worth it after this
introducing the new ot CVX 500 all state
drives from Toshiba it offers great
well-balanced speeds build with mlc nand
flash for superior endurance and is also
backed by five year advanced warranty
program learn more about the VX 500 at
OTC calm now on the surface this might
appear as a luxury mid tower but I'm
feeling optimistic on many features
found on the 5 t to percolate into the
lower tier cases in particular the
tempered glass side pedal mounts that is
by far the best we've seen yet so
instead of using some screws on four
corners like we normally see we have a
key loss mechanism centered at the top
that makes handling simple and safe
especially with that extra set that
catches the panel and then it must be
listed for removal my only concern is
where to store the keys I would have
appreciated maybe like a little
compartment somewhere on that angled
front panel but you could store them
below the handle or hang them on one of
the sub screws for the power supply
bracket the handle on the v key makes me
want to see more handles on cases in
general it is securely attached to the
frame it's like the rubberized and
beautifully integrated into the design
so it's low-profile and doesn't impact
your top cooling options and I love the
tools approach to all panels on the
exterior you can remove the small piece
at the back to gain additional
ventilation if your exhaust is heavy
which has a dust filter but you can
simply lift the top plastic panel off to
gain access for the top fan bracket and
here you would need to remove the handle
first in order to gain access to that
fan bracket it supports dual 140 and
120mm fans with their respective
leaders and I just wish the Kula master
would offset the mound a little bit
closer to the side panel because I don't
care about top symmetry and any
additional clearance off the motherboard
would be nice the front panel goal is a
similar toolless approach with an extra
angular position that looks odd but it's
meant to open up the front intake for
more airflow and have enough space for
optical drive ejection or close up that
front intake to minimize noise while the
panel behind it it's quite open
ventilation wise where they built and
dust filter dual 140 more fans are
included here and you can remove the
finally quarter inch drive based system
to open up this area for triple 120 or
140 more fans also to easy limiter is
the maximum radiator support at the
front the i/o includes four USB 3.0 with
dual 1910 connectors so make sure that
your motherboard can support it then
there's the audio jacks PR buttons a
button for speed fan control with low or
high setting with the hub located at the
rear and it can house six 310 fans and
finally there's an LED button for
breathing effect or on/off switch for
the included red LED strip on the inside
and it gives off this beautiful soft
light plus it's magnetic so you can move
it around case but it's not our GD and
no additional strips included at such a
high price and what I find interesting
with the 5d is this sort of log down on
the color option with read-only accents
don't get me wrong
the interior is beautifully colored and
maybe encourages to follow a particular
color scheme but at this price as expect
some flexibility with LED strips in
particular and to me it's a bit odd to
see their own product line not
satisfying the RGB movement and NZXT
is the only company that currently
offers the best choice when it comes to
color on several cases something that I
want to see more of from the competition
the layout of the interior however is
identical to their maker v family with
dust filter for the power supply a
bottom secure PCI slot to lock down your
peripherals and they want 40-millimeter
exhaust Sam the basement is open and
here you see the drive cage that can be
moved into three different positions to
clear more room at the front giving you
a maximum of three inches to work with
and the
this open nature of the bottom chamber
cables from your power supply will be
visible which on other mastercase models
is fine because the panel would cover it
so why not include a basement cover for
the 5 t only or have a blackout section
on the bottom of the glass panel that
would be nice to conceal this
compartment there are dual SSD caddies
below the motherboard with their SSDs
either be mounted on top or the inside
the caddy like I have here and the 5d is
the only case that comes with a GPU
support bracket with two clips to
prevent GPM sag no additional drive
changers are included which is an
automation for the highest tier master
case further maybe reducing the target
audience for the 5 T now I do appreciate
the extra value added elements on this
model like the magnetic toolbox but
ironically you actually cannot attach it
anywhere on the 5 T because there is no
exposed metal surface the rear of the
case doesn't come with any additional
SSD caddies also you can move them from
the interior and I find that the deep
channel is handy for smaller cables for
cable management with the velcro straps
and cable tiles on the right spaces to
secure the receipe cable you just have
to be mindful of that see-through nature
of the bottom chamber and work on your
cables accordingly so who is this case
for I feel like this model exists to
bring more attention to the lower tier
versions like the $100 mastercase 5 or
the hundred $50 maker 5 that it's pretty
much identical to the 5 T and cooler
master should also recognize the
tempered glass is a very popular trend
but having such a large price premium is
a very good incentive for consumers to
explore competing options however the 5
t should also serve as an example of
excellent features that need to be more
present in 2017 like the clever side
panel mount easy to use the exterior
panels and that full eco system
development for modularity plus a well
integrated handle oh hey there and see
XCOM is Canada's leading a tailor for
anything your mind desires just keep
within those categories which are plenty
and be attempted by the weekly deals
visit ncx dot-com peril and sweet deals
and so the 5d is awesome but a $250
again coming back to that price point
it's so uncompetitive with a color
lockdown only a single LED strip
included and limited storage capacity so
let me know what you think of the red
color scheme in particular and if this
feels to you like the highest tier
mastercase lineup let me know in the
comments down below I'm Dimitri with
haruka max thanks for watching we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
