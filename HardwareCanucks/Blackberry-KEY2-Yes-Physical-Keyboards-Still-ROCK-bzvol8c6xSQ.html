connects and blackberry is officially or
inviting me to downtown Toronto for an
exclusive briefing for their upcoming
BlackBerry smartphone I'm not sure
exactly what it is but they are
announcing the smartphone on June the
7th it is May the 29th so I do have
quite a bit of time to get my hands on
the device perhaps come up with my you
know first impressions of the new device
as well so yeah this is pretty exciting
it's blackberry so I'm pretty curious
about this let's go check it out
all right go people so my briefing with
blackberry is complete and I finally
have my hands on blackberry key - so
this is a successor to the BlackBerry
key one if you guys recall I did take a
look at that phone
phenomenal device for the price and of
course it was one my personal favorite
our personal favorite smartphones of
2017 if you're interested in the review
you can actually check it out
right over here but what I'm gonna do
right now is just take some b-roll shots
of the key - and let's I'll give you
guys my first impressions of what I
think but first a quick message from our
sponsor the new master keys MK 750
keyboard comes with a comfortable
magnetic wrist rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection Coolermaster
doing it right check it out below so
after spending a few hours of the
BlackBerry key to of kind of saying I'm
interested to see how well the
smartphone would do in 2018 from a
design standpoint there is nothing
significantly different when compared to
the key one all BlackBerry has done is
sort of refined the edges but making it
more edgier the rear side of the phone
has also received a different treatment
in terms of the texture so now it comes
with this rough plastic tester when
compared to the soft touch rubberized
material that I loved with a blackberry
key one so I'm not sure how I would you
know get used to this key - when I
eventually get my review sample if you
recall from my blackberry key one review
I mentioned how the convenience key was
located at an odd position
so what BlackBerry has done is actually
relocated that key to the right side of
the device so we now have your wall-e
markers your power button and of course
a communion ski at the same sign
for easier access I was even interesting
is this convenience key can be
reprogrammable to open up any
application whether that's a chrome
Gmail camera whatever that is you can
also have the option to turn it off
completely off so I to me personally
this is an excellent feature in some
cases you could technically make it to
trigger a Google assistant but I
obviously have to play around with that
when I want to get the device in hand
later on so definitely stay tuned for
our full review now given that this is a
BlackBerry device and since the key to
is a successor to the key one obviously
expect a physical keyboard
within the unit and this time
they've actually changed the material
that they've used to manufacture the key
so instead of going with the glossy
plastic finish now we've get a matte
black finish which is great I love the
texture of the keys it's a lot more
easier to type with because with the key
one I sort of got to a point where when
grease and sort of other things gets in
the way it kind of feels awkward to type
with the keyboard and sometimes you
could end up you know slipping or you
might end up missing a certain keys so
with the matte finish it actually sort
of eliminates that problem and actually
looks a lot more sleeker one of the cool
features of the BlackBerry key too is
the addition of the speed key it's
essentially located right beside the
spacebar key which by the way still acts
as a fingerprint reader so what the
speed key does is that you can assign it
to open a certain application while
you're in a full screen app for example
if I'm you know browsing the web and if
I want to check Instagram I can just
hold this speed key and hit I and it'll
automatically open up Instagram without
having me to go back to the home screen
and open that application now given that
there are 52 or 53 buttons on the
BlackBerry key one the amount of
customizability is just endless you can
basically assign every app that you have
on your smartphone to a certain key and
you can use the speed key to open up
those applications instantly the only
thing is obviously memorizing those
shortcuts because you know they'll be
quite challenging but I think it's a
pretty cool feature now during my
briefing with blackberry one of the
things that they did emphasize a lot
more was on added security and level of
protection that they want to offer
customers with so first and foremost
it's the inclusion of DTEC and what they
have done to sort of enhance and improve
the built in or the app that normally
comes pre-installed with blackberry key
one and of course the key to so what
they've done is they've redesigned that
UI they made things lock cleaner but
what they've also done is given a more
divided features like you know being
able to scan applications in the
background so for example if you have an
application that's accessing your
microphone microphone without your
knowledge
the app will pop up or bring up a
notification saying hey this app is
using a microphone would you want to
take a certain action and you can
certainly go into settings and can sort
of disable that it gives it just gives
users the flexibility and the control of
you know what features or what are some
of the things that certain apps are
accessing now you could technically do
this within
enjoyed within the OS within the
settings app but I'd be interested to
see how this would do when I eventually
test the device now when it comes to
specs well I would keep your
expectations low because if you're
someone who's looking for flagship level
of specs on a BlackBerry smartphone this
is not it the key to is not for you
because they decided to go with a
snapdragon 616 sir instead of a
snapdragon here 45 and when I asked
blackberry about it they said that they
wanted to you know put inside a chip
said that's more power-efficient but yet
can still deliver fast performance and I
guess in a way I could go with what
they're saying here because you know if
we can find a way to sort of compensate
or extend battery life with going for a
power fish-and-chip but also you know
running apps faster that's great in fact
when I did review the BlackBerry key one
performance was just fantastic it was
not running a flagship CPU it was
running a basic mid tier CPU so I mean
to me I think that's ok but obviously
I'd love to hear your thoughts on that
the key to comes in two color variants
so you've got your standard black and
silver trim and of course your all black
trim so there are no special black
editions going on around here just like
the key one it's just called the
BlackBerry key - and that's pretty much
it there's six gigabytes of RAM 64
gigabytes of on-board storage in some
select regions you can actually opt for
a 120 gigabyte variant but you can also
expand the storage which is awesome now
the battery capacity hasn't increased
that much they've still kept the same
amount of capacity just like the key one
so it is a little bit on the
disappointing side but again it being
interesting to see how the battery life
would hold up when I'm actually again
the key to test sample the display on
the key 2 is exactly the same when
compared the key one you're getting the
same 4.5 inch 16 20 by 1080 IPS display
it's nothing significant it's a little
bit disappointing because I was
expecting you know a little bit more
pixels maybe give us Q HDS in some
variants but it is what we're working
with but I'd be interesting to see how
that holds up in 2018 now given that
we've witnessed smartphones in 2018 come
with dual cameras I guess blackberry
took the same route by implementing to
12 megapixel cameras both at different
focal lengths so the wide-angle lens
comes with an f1 point in aperture and
the optical zoom lens comes with an f2
0.6 aperture so you're gonna be losing a
little bit of light they are using
different sensors when compared the key
one remember the key one had
sensor on the Google pixel so it is
interesting to see all I will be
interesting to test out what the camera
performance is like BlackBerry has said
that have improved the hardware and the
software optimization when it comes to
processing images so again I will have
to test out the BlackBerry key -
especially when it comes to cameras to
see how that holds up with the pixel -
and of course other flagships in 2018
ask for software the key to is rocking
Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box and
BlackBerry has promised the Android be
upgrade later on and what he's really on
is the price point for the blackberry
key - so the base model the one that
comes with 64 gigabytes of storage 6
gigabytes of RAM Snapdragon 660 in this
all new not only more of it or fine
design when you compare the key one it's
gonna run you 650 dollars us I have
mixed feelings about that price point
because it puts it right in line with
the 1 + 6 the the one the Google pixel 2
and a few other smartphones so I mean
again I'd love to see how this would
hold up in 2018 now BlackBerry isn't
advertising the key - as a flash of
killer it's really targeted towards a
niche market you know people who are
blackberry loyalists you know not people
who are looking for a smartphone with
the best possible display the best
possible specs build quality and battery
life it is targeted towards a certain
type of people people who are people are
looking for smartphones with a physical
keyboard now the lack of wireless
charging and lack of ip68
water-resistant rating could be a few
deal breaking features for some of you
out there but again I would genuinely
love to hear your thoughts on the key -
what do you guys think about it do you
think BlackBerry has a shot with the key
- and would you be actually willing to
pick one up let me know the comments
down below i'm eber with hydra connects
stay tuned for our full review of the
blackberry key - once it's launched and
of course when I get back from copy Tex
I'm ebert with harbor connects thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
