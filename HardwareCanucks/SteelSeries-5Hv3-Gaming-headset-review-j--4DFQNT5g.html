axe and welcome back to another review
on the table today we've got a gaming
headset from Steel series this is the
five hv3
retailing for around $80 I think this
headset is unique in the sense that it
dismantles into three parts which is
awesome for travel it packs a very
simplistic and compact footprint plus
you can put it back together without
connecting any wires and so SteelSeries
sure made this process very simple
ironically I do however think that this
three-piece design is bound to make some
customers unhappy solely because there
are now more points of failure and the
joints just don't feel as robust as with
a single piece headphone also coming
from personal experience and many user
reviews online this three-piece design
doesn't prove reliable for connectivity
resulting in one of the ear cups to stop
working now with that said the plastic
construction has its benefits as the
headset is extremely lightweight I had
absolutely no issues with several hours
of use specs wise this house 40
millimeter drivers with a decent
frequency range and impedance of 40 ohms
and sensitivity of 110 DB which is
perfectly loud alright so coming on to
microphone qualities you can hear it
sounds very nice very loud very clear
and it manages to isolate my voice from
background noises so it says perfect
solution for in game volume yeah I like
the fact that this microphone is
flexible and has a very small footprint
on the headphone itself and you can just
stow it away easily and conveniently
inside the headphone just like this you
can hear it still picking up my voice
and that's why we have the new mic mute
button on the volume control on the wire
and moving on to the ear cushions they
are removable unfortunately we don't get
any replacement ear pads but still
series does carry open style cushions
that open on the soundstage just a
little bit but the stock pleather cups
of course concentrate the heat so you
will need to vent your ears once in a
while but they do provide excellent
sound isolation and produce almost no
leak which is perfectly if you want to
maintain your privacy I also appreciate
the small details like the single
orange thread outline to match the
internal lining the headband is also
quite soft and it is small and putting
these on I do find them quite
comfortable because of the lightweight
soft ear pants and an overall nice fit
with the adjustable headband on the
cable we have volume knob and the mic
mute button and has the usual 3.5
millimeter headphone jacks now you are
able to disconnect the dual jack and put
an angled headphone jack that is
included to be used with portable
devices and this connectivity is quite
tight so I wouldn't expect any issues
with the detachable cable at least in
the beginning of the lifespan now
overall the build quality is okay but it
does feel fragile in the hands
particularly because the detachable
joints and for $80 it's a bit of a
disappointment
alright now on to the most interesting
part of the review here comes the audio
quality and as always I let them burn in
for 48 hours with white noise and fire
them up with some of my favorite so I
know exactly what to listen for and I
tested these with mic so nerdy X 7.1
channel sound card
first impressions for an 80 dollar
gaming headphone were a little mixed for
one I missed a deep bass that makes
explosions and powerful gunfire that
much more powerful the bass doesn't
overpower and is quite detailed but it
doesn't deliver to that punchy standard
we've come to expect from gaming
headsets man perhaps maybe that's a good
thing as many times all we hear is the
bass that destroys the fidelity of the
sound the lower based on the 5 hv3 is
completely missing I wasn't impressed
and dubstep tracks really did not come
to life plus playing with equalizer to
move the bass slightly forward
introduced a lot of unpleasant
distortion so the 40 millimeter drivers
really don't shine in the lower range
the mid-tones were a little less
disappointing they aren't particularly
muddy and actually quite detailed but
they are recessed and sound quite hollow
that didn't impress when listening to my
favourite tracks it's a similar story
with the highs is they are detailed and
bring the vocals forward which is
excellent for in-game voice the highs
are more emphasized and is the best part
throughout the range I didn't manage to
improve the detail in the mid-range
using the equalizer on my sound card but
playing around with the bass was
impossible due to introduced distortion
of course taking into account the
pricing of the headset I wasn't
expecting amazing sound quality but one
thing that was really not happy with was
stereo imaging if you want to be
completely aware of your surroundings
and where those footsteps are coming
from you'll be disappointed and this is
mainly due to a very small soundstage
playing battlefield 4 things came
through clearly but I did miss powerful
and deep bass that makes you smile when
you fire rocket for example the
atmosphere and Metro last light is
outstanding for post-apocalyptic
environment and the 5hv 3 wasn't capable
of providing that immersive feeling it
really does lack appropriate soundstage
so the 5hv 3 is a decent headset
considering the compact nature of the
design a very comfortable fit with noise
isolating ear pads and the retractable
mic is a bonus to keeping up with a
minimalistic footprint clarity
throughout the headset was plenty
detailed but not without issues I really
wanted more emphasis on deeper bass and
better stereo imaging for directionality
as detecting precise positioning of
incoming footsteps was very difficult
and I wouldn't recommend this if you
play competitively the three-piece
design while compact is also the turning
point for build quality as the headset
feels very fragile and for of $80 it is
still quite expensive considering it's
not particularly good for music nor
in-game directionality and I think still
series should really focus on improving
the build quality on their three-piece
headphones as aside from disappointing
sound quality this old plastic
construction would be my biggest
critique now would you guys consider
this three-piece design useful for
travel and would you rather see a
