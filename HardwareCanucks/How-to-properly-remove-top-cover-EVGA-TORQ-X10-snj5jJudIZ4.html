first ever Mouse it seems one very
important element on how to remove the
top cover safely without breaking the
hinges was a sort of absent from the
instructions manual this is the video on
how to do it properly the top cover
grants you access to the slots for
weight customization simply pulling on
the small hinge at the end the cover
will yield unsuccessful results as
you'll be greeted with plenty of
resistance that doesn't really feel
natural fully hard enough and the cover
will come off along with a few
potentially cracked hinges this is how
not to remove the top cover as the
result may be upsetting and RMA inducing
instead they need to pull the cover
towards the back of the mouse first and
only then pull the hinge with your thumb
that comes off without any resistance
allowing the hinges to remain in tip-top
shape
and to quickly recap using just the
hinge to remove the top cover might lead
to a broken Mouse remember to pull the
cover towards the back first and up for
appropriate removal we decided this
video will save many hours of
frustration with our maze and also since
EVGA has asked us to create such a video
after I broke one of the top covers make
sure to check out our full view of the
toward extent to see how we feel about
EVGA s first ever Mouse hope this has
been helpful and we hope that no talk
extent covers go broken</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
