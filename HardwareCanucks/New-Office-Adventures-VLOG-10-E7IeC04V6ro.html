happened but as soon as i receive my
power supplies here in the new studio I
kind of threw out organization it's
completely out of this window so I moved
into the new studio this is kind of a
work in progress right now loving all
the shelf space this is the current
setup that i'm using now with my eurocom
m5 pro running on the acer monitor but
that would soon be gone and on here
would go my pc my sky like bill that's
coming up soon but this is what I've
been working on since i received my
power supplies the s3 40 from the from
NZXT but this is the design by Razor
edition and so I filmed this yesterday
finally have a fully working system so
that I can no longer just work off this
little machine but seriously though this
is totally not mean that in terms of
this type of this organization and all
this giant mess so let's clean it up
you
also this is the main wall with this low
number which is absolutely amazing for
storage and also it keeps me organized
in terms of what needs to go out and
what I need to be working on and
currently I'm having in position with
hardware stuff for cases peripherals and
stuff for cases and more peripherals and
of course hwc man plus look what I found
a perfect spot for the YouTube silver
play button so I was sitting on this red
chair for a little bit in the new office
until vergeer sent us dsl 4000 which is
very comfortable and the material here
despite my previous experience with the
SL 5000 with the carbon fiber version
that was really just not it was
comfortable but the material was just
sweat machine so this one seems to be
slightly better and it's also blue which
looks really awesome and especially on
the video whenever this is behind my
head highlights my eyes a little bit
pretty cool so I'm going to try to do
now behind me is the conclusion shot for
the s3 40 video which is the case right
here so this is the razor edition and
I'm going to try to raise her it up a
bit with the peripherals you can set up
the case here you're done put in some
rainbow circulating LEDs through
throughout the video to show the hue
plus lighting which I've installed
inside the case so yeah let's get
started
oh my god is finally built it was a
hella process because you have to build
a very new system for me because all
these components are not been tested all
aside from the GPUs of course that I
took out from my previous work station
video but the sky like stuff you know
the CPU the motherboard the RAM none of
that has been tested it has been sort of
sitting and I was afraid that one of
those components may not work but
everything is working I did this video
and we'll be doing this video in two
parts because the assembly process and
the testing and make sure everything is
working just fine before the sort of the
final final build completes because this
is still a work in progress I will be
doing more things with the cables
because right now I have quite the
master d look but ironically i am going
for the orange and green color scheme or
orange e and yellow and silver color
scheme which is awesome because the
graphics cards have the same type
metallic exterior as the case itself
same thing with the SSDs and also the
Intel nvme drive in there that looks
really cool but also the motherboard has
a line on orange out glow line that
highlights the audience tough so that
was kind of the inspiration behind the
orange color scheme and it actually
looks frickin awesome so guys make sure
to check out the videos they will be
linked in the description below about
this build I'm gonna go ahead and edit
on this machine now have been finally no
longer be editing on the your comment 5
pro which has been a fantastic machine
for editing for now but it's time to
move on to real workhorse and this is
new workstation PC inside the evolved
ATX from phantoms</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
