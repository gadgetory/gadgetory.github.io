and today we are talking about my food
drives more specifically about
non-volatile memory storage solutions
otherwise known as nvme we've seen these
type of drives slowly making its way
into notebooks and high-end desktop
systems because it promises fast
efficient and compact storage that can
easily be installed onto a motherboard
fortunately Samson contacted us about
their new 960 pro and their timing was
just perfect this happens to be one of
the fastest drives on the market
claiming read speeds up to 3.5 gigabytes
per second so I know it's bit of an
overkill but I wanted to show you guys
my whole experience with the upgrade and
how it turned out but before that let's
talk a bit more about MDOT - and its
various features plus how it will factor
into your purchasing decision right now
MDOT - is broken into two different
formats or speed bins I'm going to leave
until its proprietary you - on the side
lines on one hand there is a SATA based
standard that operates at very much the
same speeds as today's regular two and a
half inch SSDs for instance take this
crucial MX 300 525 gigabyte m2 SSD on
the other hand there is Samsung's newer
nvme format like the samsung 960 Pro
which utilizes up to 4 PCIe links to
potentially achieve some real incredible
speeds one of the speeds being achieved
you can shoot some of these drives into
the enthusiast market many can be
considered as great upgrades as they
become more affordable people with older
systems can use a SATA or nvme based m2
SSD to boost system responsiveness
technically they could clone their
existing Windows installation to the new
Drive and then use their older slower
spinning hard drives as a secondary
storage platform I think this would be a
better option though because higher
capacity SSDs are still expensive so
these drives are still not going
anywhere the beauty of this upgrade path
is that your motherboard doesn't even
need an inductive slot for compatibility
provided you buy the right components
since the nvme format communicates over
the PCI bus all you need is a cheap M 2
PCI a two PCIe slot adapter like this
one or even this and a free motherboard
PCI slot I'll make sure to leave links
in the description down below let's get
things off with compatibility
nvme was launched right around in tow
z170 launch so if your systems based off
that platform or even higher you should
be fine
this includes X 99 X 299 some AMD in
three motherboards and a few FM two-plus
boards as well just make sure to check
your motherboard manufacturer website
first older motherboards in the z97
generation and earlier will require that
adapter that I spoke about a little
while ago and of course a free PCI slot
many of those adapters are backwards
compatible with PCIe 1.0 and 2.0 but be
careful if you're all motherboard
doesn't support the end gaming protocol
the drive won't be bootable without
jumping into a few hoops first I'll
leave that guy for another video so stay
tuned for that next up is size and I
don't mean the capacity but the actual
dimensions of the m-dot to drive
generally they refer to as type 20 to 40
to 20 to 60 and 20 to 80 it's just a
short code for saying how long they are
in millimeters so in my case this 960
pro se from Samsung comes in 20 to 80
configuration meaning it's 80
millimeters long so make sure to check
your motherboard specifications to see
if it can host the type of drive that
you're planning to upgrade towards soon
now to quickly go over some of the
system components I'm using an ASUS
Maximus code motherboard it's a z2 70
based motherboard with a 7700 K 32
gigabytes of RAM 18 X 1080 and obviously
my 4 terabyte Western Digital hard drive
that we'll be upgrading to this monster
so let's hop into the upgrade process
okay guys so we finally have our system
ready for the cloning process and the
reason why I chose that or we're going
with a fresh install of Windows it's
because I have my benchmarks and/or my
benchmarking programs and my game
library installed on the spinning drive
so cloning was the easiest way to
transfer my existing files to the SSD
now the first thing you want to do is
head over to Samsung's official 960 Pro
website and download the nvme driver
once you complete that process the
system will reboot and you can head over
to the device manager tab to check and
see if P driver is properly installed
then what you want to do is initialize
the drive under the disk management tab
this basically creates a new partition
and formats the drive so you can assign
the drive letter and the name of the
drive to your desire the last step is to
download Samsung's
data migration software this is what
we'll be using to clone the existing WD
drive to the 960 pro SSD the process is
fairly simple samsung has done a really
good job with the UI so first time users
won't have a problem spotting things as
you can see I chose my source desk then
the target disk and proceeded with the
cloning process there's also an advanced
cloning option that essentially scans
your existing drive and gives users the
option to exclude certain folders or
files that they don't necessarily need
to clone this is an excellent option in
my opinion because say for example if
your nvme SSD is smaller and capacity
when compared to the spinning drive all
you need to do is clone your operating
system and a few applications that you
use on a regular basis and leave the
rest on the hard drive Samsung's
complimentary magician software is an
excellent tool to monitor the SSD the
user is greeted with a visual indication
for the drives health status you can
also update the firmware as well as
check the interface type that it's
running on there's also a click
performance tests to check weed and
white speeds a few more optimizations to
increase the longevity of the drive and
finally secure air base which is an
excellent tool to utilize if you end up
passing the SSD to someone else ok so
let's talk performance and how did the
drive do well all I can say is that it
incredibly fast I mean check out this
boot I'm comparing the old spinning
drive to the 960 pro SSD the WD drive
took well over 4 minutes to load up to
the desktop
while the nvme SSD took a little less
than 50 seconds to complete that task
that's 5 times faster which is awesome
my next test involves a folder duplicate
transfer which was about 20 gigabytes in
size packed with 4k videos a few game
folders and excel files the results do
speak for themselves the 960 pro just
blows the doors off the WP drive 5
minutes versus 50 seconds guys isn't
that just amazing what about gaming well
I was excited to test Ghost Recon
because a it's a graphically intensive
title and be loading up the game along
with missions take a chunk of my time so
it's a great way to test each drives we
performance and just as expected the 960
pro SSD was faster during the initial
game launch by about 20 seconds when
compared to the spinning drive loading
up a mission took roughly 18 seconds on
the 960 pro SSD and 40 on the WD Blu
drive quite a difference right there now
don't expect to achieve higher frame
rates when upgrading to the nvme SSD
because you genuinely won't be able to
do that in fact I did a recent video
comparing the gaming performance on
different types of drives so if you're
interested I'll leave a link in the
description down below now if you're a
creative professional upgrading to the
964 SSD might be money well spent
here's why I did a quick test loading up
a Photoshop project that I worked on
recently and the WD drive took a little
over a minute to complete that task the
960 pearl on the other hand took just 10
seconds to get to my work that's a lot
of time saved and if you are constantly
working on client projects that requires
deadlines then I can guarantee you this
drive will definitely improve your
workflow same story goes for Premiere
Pro users this Drive just blazes through
loading up projects and I can't wait to
get another one for my main workstation
PC so overall I'm really happy with my
upgrade to the 960 Pro SSD from Samsung
I mean just getting this kind of
performance in a compact form factor is
incredible this Drive is definitely one
of the fastest that you can find in the
market if you're really crazy about read
and write performance and of course the
benchmarks do show for themselves if
you're creative professional
this would be an excellent upgrade if
you're a gamer and if you really don't
want to wait for one or load times this
is an upgrade it's a worthy upgrade in
my opinion I want to hear your thoughts
on the 960 Pro SSD from Samsung do you
think you would consider this as an
upgrade for your existing PC's let us
know in the comments down below I'm Eva
with her connects huge shout out to
Samsung for sponsoring this video make
sure to subscribe for more similar
content featuring the 960 / SSD and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
