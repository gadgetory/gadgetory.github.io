revolutionize gaming and giving
real-time statistics to players about
their heartbreak their excitement levels
so they can be more immersed into their
game play with the Neos QG by my onyx
labs oh my god another gaming gimmick
making the mouse more expensive who
needs a heart rate sensor monitor and
GSR sensor what is it yes our sensor
anyway anything these days that will go
into a gaming product to make it more
high-end or leet or whatever but yeah
that's the whole idea it's so ambitious
we've never seen anything like this
before having a heart rate sensor on the
gaming peripheral might sound gimmicky
but you know I might want to control or
monitor my heart rate during certain
types of games like sure it's kinetic
cool and for streamers - if I'm
streaming right now for example I want
to give my viewers that extra
authenticity of my reactions to what's
happening inside the game definitely and
the unique element for the viewer and
the audience to experience while I game
and so those are the three camps not
including my Onix about their reactions
to the Neo sqg and the heart rate sensor
which camp do you belong to and I wonder
if your opinion will change after
watching this video and if it does let
us know in the comments below let's get
on with the review
this could be you every time you turn on
your PC super-chill CPU happy you
crackin x61
ye NZXT purchase discount in the
description below so it's been two years
since the Kickstarter campaign was
launched it was funded and now the
mayor's QG or quantified gaming mouse is
finally in my hands I was actually one
of the early backers as well so I
actually bought this mouse because I
absolutely loved the nails design the
shape the format is excellent so first
of all the QG edition is now a different
color it comes in math gray it hides oil
stains a little bit better versus the
black and the switches are the same to
the original but the sensor is now
upgraded the Pixar 3360 versus the 3310
on the original and then the reason why
you buy this are the two new sensors
beside the logo the heart rate sensor
and a GSR sensor that measures
excitement first let's talk about the
tech and its placement on the mouse
because that is the most crucial thing
about this product the green laser here
is a Pixar heart rate sensor with up to
3,000 frames per second and six point
eight megahertz frequency it's green
because our blood absorbs green light so
when the heart beats blood flow
increases and more of that green light
is absorbed so the sensor measures the
change in green light absorption and
determines the heart rate that way now
compared to my s7 the BPM is very close
and calculations have been a little bit
inconsistent sometimes it finishes in 10
seconds while other times it says it's
almost ready but really not picking up
anything for a few minutes but when it
does you have a live heart rate
measurement on your screen as long as
you're making contact with that sensor
which is the most crucial element about
the knee sqg which unfortunately for me
it doesn't work so I have large hands
and I prefer a hybrid grip where the
right side of my palm touches the mouse
body with this semi claw fingers while
the left side of the mouse where the
heart rate sensor is located it's kind
of at a weird angle and too low on the
body for my hand to actually make
contact with and apparently I'm an
outlier in this position because my Onix
obviously did there
research and figured out for the
majority this was the best placement to
accommodate for all types of hand sizes
and only palm grips so my hybrid grip
doesn't really fit that description so
for smaller hands less than mine and for
palm grip the sensor would be okay and I
gotta be honest it's quite unfortunate
that this placement doesn't work for me
I thought that the sensor would go under
the thumb buttons where you know your
thumb is always setting regardless of
hand size or on the right curve behind
the dpi change buttons and I consider
those spots to be sort of like safe
spots where contact with the skin is
guaranteed now the sensor is
high-quality it will pick up heartbreak
regardless of skin color regardless of
moisture on the skin and you can have a
little bit of spacing between the skin
and the sensor so like one to two
millimeters is okay but in the case of
my grip style the readout would not be
recognized and I just couldn't figure
out a better way to hold the mouse for
the sensor to work again so unfortunate
so let's talk about the second sensor
the GSR sensor which makes perfect
contact with my skin I really wish these
were just flopped because this one is
more of a let's put it in the mouse why
not type of feature it's called the
galvanic skin response sensor which
measures excitement based on
conductivity of your skin and this one
is less important because for it to be
accurate you need to be totally still so
if I pinch my leg for example you can
see the spike with GSR picking up
something but it really is kind of
pointless since it always detects
something when you move the mouse the
biggest question most likely from the
community would be why why is there a
heart rate sensor on a mouse what's the
point the biggest target here or maybe
the only target would be streamers right
now because to give my viewers that
extra element of like you know
authenticity so they can see my heart
rate while I'm gaming so that if I'm
playing something super scary and my
heart rate goes up you know I'm scared
you can have that extra observational
element giving audience your heart rate
BPM so that they're aware if your your
heart rate is rising based on certain
levels of the game with really
to show during really scary genres would
be really awesome for competitive
gameplay too from an observational
standpoint so you can see if certain
players on the team are more calm than
others to see if heart rate increase
corresponds to a poor performance or
vice-versa and you can sort of
extrapolate that information to coach
potential competitive game gamers to do
better in certain matches in certain
situations but beyond this observational
element right now there exists no good
system to you know track your heart rate
see when it was peeking see the average
see the lowest and see how it was
interacting during a certain gameplay
you have a little bit of that in the
statistics tab in the beta software but
it's just too little of a glimpse of
what is happening with your heart rate
at the specific session for example
here's a three hour gaming session you
can see my heart rate is all over the
place but corresponding perfectly well
with clicks per second and here's
another one for csgo and these sessions
are automatically created so I would
like some manual track feature that will
allow me to create these graphs based on
my in and out points now the good thing
is the hardware is working well it's the
software that needs to catch up they've
already updated the firmware that
drastically improves the time it takes
to detect your heart rate so that's
great and they're taking feedback on
what the what users want to see in the
final driver software or out of beta
software for example right now we don't
even have surface calibration yet but
all the button customization dpi and
color are working fine right now the
overlay is done through the overwolf app
that the super basic so you have three
color choices but the promise is for
this ecosystem to really grow and allow
you to show a lot more information on
that circle or cycle between some
information I just really wish the
sensors were swapped because as of right
now the heart rate sensor doesn't make
contact with my skin and I hope one of
the very few assembling your verdaguer
gaming chair just got a whole lot easier
with a simple insert mechanism off the
back seat onto the side rails so you
mount the side screws much faster a true
one-man job assembly made easy
for a year but I'm very interested to
hear what you guys think about this
product especially if you're a streamer
is it a cool thing to display for your
audience and if you're watching somebody
stream is it a cool thing to to see
their heart rate
you know maybe spiking up very high and
you're wondering if they're healthy or
not and maybe should stop playing
but like all this information especially
if you extrapolate in temporal scales of
seeing heart rates over time for certain
games and it would be really cool as the
software matures to see you know when we
are more stressed out when we're most
chilled out which what does our heart do
and like in 3-hour gaming sessions and
one hour gaming session and etc I would
love to continue this conversation in
the comment section below
who is very interesting for my own to
observe my own heart rate going from 70
to 90 and casual gaming and over a
hundred in competitive gaming so all
that is very interesting but again you
gotta ask if this is a cool thing of
value added for your audience because
this whole thing isn't really for
personal use it's more of an
observational perspective from like a
third party viewership so let us know if
your mind has changed based on your
initial expectations what you thought
the news coogee would be versus what you
think it is now I'm Dimitri with our
Canucks thanks so much for watching keep
updated in the comments section because
I will be giving my thoughts on new
driver releases and firmware updates so
guys thanks much watching we'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
