month ago we took a close look at the
predator x34 that monster decent gaming
monitor received quite a lot of
attention because of its curve and of
course the gaming performance
unfortunately it was just simply too
expensive for many gamers with a price
tag of $1,200 well we have a new kid
from Acer that's $200 cheaper yet it
still offers a superlative gaming
experience folks meet the Acer Z 35 this
is a curved 35 inches monitor with a
resolution of 2560 by 1080 that uses a
new generation advanced mva panel but
there's something more the refresh rate
goes to an awesome 200 Hertz you heard
that right 200 Hertz and as usual Acer
added a little bit of sweetness with the
addition of G sync so overall we're
looking at an alternative to the ex 34
which offers a much faster panel but
lacks the color reproduction offered by
IPs and the X 30 for better resolution
unfortunately due to bandwidth
constraints of today's display interface
connectors pushing such high refresh
rates to a high resolution monitor like
the ex 34 just isn't possible so Acer
made this Z 35 one thing to mention is
that the Z 35 uses a panel that natively
runs at 144 Hertz but through the use of
Acer's on-screen display menu it can
effectively be overclocked to a maximum
of 200 Hertz but achieving that 144 to
200 frames per second with in today's
highly demanding titles will be
challenging unless if you have a crazy
GPU setup you could play around with
graphics settings to increase that frame
rate but it ultimately boils down to one
question what's more important to you
higher graphics quality or higher frame
rate another concern is of course the
dot pitch level of this monitor a 34
inch screen with a 34 40 by 1440
resolution like the one found on the X
34 would provide a lot of virtual real
estate for productivity or more
specifically video editing meanwhile the
Z 35 2560 by 1080 screen just looks
enlarged and will likely provide an
inadequate experience for professionals
you lose quite a lot of real estate
especially if you
want to have a duel or try windows setup
something that the x34 can easily
achieve due to its high resolution I
think a sir went a little
over-aggressive this time in the design
department - don't get me wrong the ex35
is certainly gorgeous and has a pinch of
aggressiveness though I prefer a more
subtle approach since this a curved
monitor it only offers 130 millimeter of
height adjustment and thirty degrees of
tilt from negative five to 25 degrees
also the whole unit is rock solid which
means you don't have to worry about it
tipping over this is a 21 by 9 curved
monitor and it looks great especially
when gaming like the x34 the enhanced
immersion by surrounding our vision with
one continuous image is great although
do note that the curve can add visual
artifacts to menus and distort key
elements of a game interface just like
the x34 the z35 includes down firing
LEDs that allow the bottom edge to glow
in one or many different colors all of
which can be customized within the OSD
this feature actually plays a crucial
role as much as the x34 or you can have
it glow one color when g-sync is enabled
and another when the feature is disabled
in terms of Io we have four USB 3.0
ports with a single 3.0 upstream port
Acer did the right job placing them
right behind the panel for easier
plug-and-play
and on the bottom we have power in
DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI 1.4 and audio out
port connector respectively the OSD is
pretty much the same found on the other
predator monitors from our testing the
physical buttons were easier to navigate
with when you enter the OSD you're
greeted with a small shortcut menu
composing quick access features like
three in game modes that can be
programmed to your preference an
adjustable overdrive that pushes more
voltage through those liquid crystals
forcing them to change from one state to
another faster there's also volume
adjust input selection and the option to
enter the advanced setup within the
advanced setup Acer greets you with the
picture tab which lets you switch
between different profiles adjust
brightness contrast blue light dark
boost and adaptive contrast the color
tab lets you change the gamma color
temperature saturation and six axis
color the language OSD timeout
trait display transparency and game mode
can be set through their respective
areas as well moving on to the Settings
tab this is where the magic happens the
user can switch between inputs turn on
DTS for the included speakers change the
ambient light underneath the panel to
different colors
adjust the wide mode and the best part
overclocking the panel to 200 Hertz as I
mentioned earlier you can only do this
via DisplayPort 1.2 since HDMI port here
is only limited to 60 Hertz as for
performance there's really not much to
complain about the picture uniformity on
the z 35 was very good with a deviation
of about only 20 percent which is good
considering this monitors size there's
no way you could see this with your
naked eyes so what was it like gaming on
a 200 Hertz display really good actually
the combination of a 200 R radius curve
with that 200 Hertz refresh rate along
with g-sync support all makes it for one
of the best experiences around for
first-person shooters with strategy
games the features like a curve and high
speed panel aren't really useful in any
way though that are 2560 by 1080
resolution can become a hindrance to
coming from an X 34 it took me some time
to get used to this resolution just
because of how enlarged things look on
Windows while the field of view in games
is slightly more limited as well all in
all I had a lot of fun gaming on this
beast playing at 200 Hertz though
requires a beefy video card setup unless
if you have a high end GPU setup
actually taking advantage of that 200
Hertz will prove to be challenging
we used an msi 980ti lightning for the
task and it was not up to it in many
titles sacrifices will be needed on
other areas in order to achieve those
higher frame rates
Acer's z35 gaming monitor gave me a lot
to think about for one it's still
expensive at $1000 but that gets you one
of the best curved gaming monitors
available on the market today
the downside is of course that
resolution and the amount of firepower
you'll need to drive it to its fullest
potential I've used plenty of 4k panels
and ultra wide displays and it does take
some time to get used to the curve in
addition I can't really see using this
thing for professional tasks since the
curve tends to distort images of bed
but for gamers it's really hard to think
of a better option if you have the cash
and the money for a serious gaming PC so
what do you guys think about the Acer
z35 is it worth $1,000 plus do you see
yourself gaming and 200 Hertz I'd love
to hear your thoughts
