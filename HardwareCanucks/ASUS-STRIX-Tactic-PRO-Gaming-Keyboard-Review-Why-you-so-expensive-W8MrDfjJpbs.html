great technology selection and service
hey guys
eva here with her broken axe and the
keyboard market is almost at full
saturation in terms of variety of
switches and gaming features so
companies are now shifting focus to
design the best looking keyboard to
satisfy our growing desires for
something different so today we're
taking a look at the Asus Strix tactic
pro mechanical gaming keyboard priced at
170 dollars this is an expensive piece
of tech especially with much cheaper
alternatives easily available for
example the g9 10 from Logitech that
offers full RGB backlit different wrist
rest places and an app as an extra value
added all for that same price or the non
RGB k95 from Corsair has all the same
specs as a tactic pro for less cash so
the Strix line is aimed at those with
extreme gaming appetites the build
quality on the tactic Pro is outstanding
the thick hard plastic unibody design
barely flexes when forces applied on
both ends it really defines how robust
keyboard should be and it can definitely
take some serious abuse the design is
quite striking at first glance
thanks to that unique shade that follows
the Strix theme the edges are rounded
but looks pointed at different angles
you'll also find a thin orange line that
separates the media buttons and the
control pad keys there are also four
blank orange key caps with a key cap
removal tool that you can use to replace
your WASD zone the extra key caps are
not textured differently so this is
purely for aesthetics notice how narrow
the structure is with a slight extension
in the center but without a proper wrist
rest that is unfortunate to see for this
price there are a total of 21
programmable macros with 10 dedicated
buttons on the left side we've seen this
layout from time to time again so if
macro gameplay is your thing the tactic
Pro should suit you fine there are eight
more alternative macro keys on the F
keys plus dedicated thumb buttons below
the spacebar that are easy to reach
you have larger hands but a slight
offset to the left would complement a
more comfortable reach they are shaped
differently though for easier
distinction on the far right side you'll
find the dedicated media control keys
that offer play pause mute and forward
and backward skip function there's also
a scroll wheel for volume control and I
love how companies implement them on
high-end gaming keyboards well done asus
at the bottom you'll find small anti
skip pads and appropriate razors to an
angle the keyboard at your convenience
the cable is braided and comes with a
gold plated USB tip with a unique
looking header that complements for
easier differentiation between other
cables which is always a welcome feature
the LED lighting on the Strix tactic Pro
looks fantastic with unique Orange
system the aggressive Strix logo stands
out in the dark as well there is a
built-in special hotkeys that perform
various tasks for example adjusting
brightness with the function key and
number eight with three levels of
illumination and off plus a briefing
effect is built in the tactic pro
version we have here comes with MX trade
brown switches and other cherries switch
options are available as well it feels a
lot like typing on Cherry MX red
switches the keys don't really require a
lot of pressure to press so you won't
really feel actuations that you get
which typing on MX blue switches offers
the function key plus f12 disables the
windows key to prevent accidental usage
during gaming sessions the function key
+ f11 enables Keys f12 f8s Macker the
function key plus print screen and
screen lock and pause break allows you
to switch between three hardware
profiles that are built into the four
megabyte memory you can add multiple
profiles in the drivers software once
the software mode is enabled which I'll
get to in a moment
lastly the function key + NK ro key
allows you to turn on the extreme and
key rollover anti-ghosting feature for
all keys to be registered simultaneously
the LED notification area right above
the function key acts as the
notification area for all these
different scenarios the driver software
from asus looks clean and intuitive the
user is greeted with the option to set
the tactic pro in hardware mode or
after our mode Hardware mode limits you
to three profiles while in software mode
you can add as many as you like the
physical layout helps you with the
specific macro mappings with easy key
selection and the macro tab is where you
want to spend some serious time if you
plan to utilize all the macro buttons on
the tactic Pro so in conclusion Asus has
brought a lot of features to the table
with the Strix tactic Pro like the
robust build quality and the excellent
aggressive design the 21 programmable
macro buttons offer more than enough
commands for your gaming needs and the
variety of MX choice which is always -
must to lure in larger markets this at
$170 is one pricey keyboard regardless
of the features and we were disappointed
to find no fun lighting effects or a
proper wrist rest plus a thumb button
below the spacebar are too far to the
right to be commonly used for gaming
it's a great keyboard but we have to
come to expect more from the Strix brand
with this price so thank you so much for
