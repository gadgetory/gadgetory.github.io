Dimitri
and right I'm not and welcome to the
second episode of the Haruka knocks
Haruka knocks the Haruka knocks name
still pending show as you remember in
the first episode we've asked you guys
we want the community involvement your
engagement in sort of naming the show so
we've gotten a lot of cool and very
funny suggestions about the names really
funny one really funny ones and so the
way we're gonna run this is because we
want the community to decide on the name
and we want the community's involvement
with the show moving forward so what
we're gonna do is that there's gonna be
a link in the description directing you
to the forum where we'll have a poll of
all these different names that we're
just gonna call out right now some funny
ones some serious ones and some of us
that we also like as well so do you top
five let's hear a toughie all right top
five for mine is the Canucks nuts cannot
get that crunch we're short for CTC yeah
that's good the damn good show and I
think a lot of people were fine with
that and you know what we appreciate
that you guys thank you for the
compliment
Haruka Knox tech chat or HD tech chat or
just tech chat and my last and probably
one the funny ones in this top five list
is beaver time something that we've lost
for people not to go anymore but you
know what guys you are awesome and
creative and I love those those are my
top five for a top 5 my top 5 I actually
got a couple that are kind of similar or
and like the same so one that I really
liked was hardware connects the tap show
or tech access point tap tap the log the
log has kind of like the log critical
canucks
cuz that's actually a pretty cool name
beaver time beaver time yeah and the dam
just because I think that's the really
good time to the you know hardware
connects brands yeah it works just works
for me I like yeah yeah so well those
are the top ten again linked in the
description and like always we will put
a time code on this video so you guys
can go check out the topics that you
want you are interested in and also make
sure to stick around because we
a very special guest on the show today
it's gonna be in the end the show so you
can you know go ahead and skip
throughout the show but we do have a
really cool topics lineup today and so
well you know what let's just dive right
into it so the first topic is Google
glass competitor so Matt what is it um
well on the glass is actually coming up
with a brand new product that competes
directly with the Google glass so it's
basically gonna have a 720p liquid
crystal display a 4 megapixel camera
it's got an imaging chip in it that kind
of I guess is on par with what the glass
uses and everything but the tech specs
really aren't that important what's
really important right now is the fact
that the Google glass isn't even really
out yet and it's already getting
competitors now I know that Omni glasses
and at Microsoft is apparently
developing something that will play in
the same realm as what Google wants to
do so it's not even available yet some
sample kits guys are available from from
Omni glass but they're looking at
availability to be in like the first
quarter of 2014
um I don't have any pricing info I don't
know whatsoever but yeah well all the
topics are again with the links and type
codes below so go check out the actual
prototype that they display I think one
thing it's a cool thing because you have
Google glass competition right so that's
awesome always dry spicing down prices
down and encourages innovation but
another thing is I want to mention is
the fact that it's not it's not as
simple and elegant looking as Google
glass it seems like you're just in like
a plain military glass with this bit of
a machine on the side and I think the
google has the whole I mean target
audience is to have something elegant
and despite its functionality to have
something really cool like that
on your face so I think the Omni glass
is is reaching towards the functionality
aspect more than so to the actual appeal
of the glass
I'm sure that once the other prototype
and everything done in it they're making
money they might you know make it more
refined but yeah I hear what you're
saying that guess the prototype is ugly
you're just about to say it the
prototype is really really ugly why they
have something that they can work with
no that's
good news yeah um I want to get to the
second topic well second topic is well I
guess the gigs but dates back not gates
it dates back to Watson a computer that
was developed by IBM now if you guys
don't remember who Watson Watson is it's
that PC and or not the PC it's the
supercomputer that I've been built stick
that basically just wanted to compete on
on Jeopardy and it kicked some serious
ass so basically what they've found is
that they've actually found a way to
repurpose Watson and that's basically to
watch or to act like the TV doctor house
so now they put it to work basically
going and finding out all these really
obscure sort of out of nowhere type of
diagnoses for people that have like some
serious illnesses and they're putting
it's a really hard work and it just goes
to show that once you actually compete
on Jeopardy you can still go on and
compete really good things move on to
good things yes so it's able to Dowe
deep into like medical records and
actually find a way to diagnose things
that maybe people might have had a
really hard time before and that
actually could be the future of medical
diagnosis or the Samba that goes behind
it because now they're actually finding
some tangible reason that hospitals
could maybe venture into like getting
something like a crate which is still
expensive but it still might help
doctors do their job better and deliver
better quality of service so this is
just the I guess the tipping point or
just the beginning of what could
actually possibly have that and you
won't have to deal with the jerk house
it's himself I mean if you get I would I
would love to be like working or have a
doctor that's like how's my doctors a
jackass oh yeah yeah oh alright well
moving out to the next topic is Intel's
Core 3 revenue numbers have been
released and they're showing growth but
about this much yeah but okay much yeah
but this much there we go
can we okay yeah so but what's
surprising not surprising it's I think
that's a good thing to hear that Intel's
and PC industry is growing despite the
slowdown and
cease sales in the PC industry in itself
isn't necessarily it's growing and it's
a bowl they want it to its evolving and
it's changing
I mean Intel's actual desktop and PC
client sales went down I think it's like
three to like nine percent I think like
that but what is up and I significant
them I was significant amount I think
it's almost like or was it eighteen no
I'm sorry 12.2% was like they're the
data center services so the data center
group so I guess that's like cloud
management stuff it's up 12% so that's
where you're seeing I think the biggest
change going and that's actually perfect
timing because I mean Microsoft is
trying to do everything in the cloud now
yeah yeah the cloud is becoming huge and
actually their Microsoft is launching a
lot of stores throughout Canada and the
states
I was actually today at the event and
you guys gonna see most likely probably
before this video launches my trip to
this opening event but basically what
they're trying to do is get the hands on
with the Windows tablets and basically
push towards the more touch interface
ecosystem was it like an actual physical
store it's not a physical store and my
idea is that it's gonna be an actual
window store like a Mac store but it
just in in insert that time as smaller
insert in Best Buy so like it in its own
corner where I just Windows Windows
Windows ok so it's not like a kiosk like
guys I don't know if that it's bigger
than a kiosk so it's the one where today
is 1,100 feet 11 feet and I think
they're gonna go to 12 about 2000
something feet squared in terms of size
so it's not a kiosk in terms of like
this table and look at these phones and
look at these cards but it is an actual
basically you know a showcase physical
space yeah it's physics interphase being
in the middle of a mall like they have a
meeting center no yeah
well that's pretty cool I mean you can
see that they're trying to make some
serious changes I guess Windows good job
good job keep on competing keep on
competing we need more competition yeah
guys speaking about competition the the
new next-gen games are about to be
released and everything I mean with the
Xbox one and the ps4 launching really
soon I think we're talking like just a
matter of a couple weeks now
some bad news for you soft yes so
Ubisoft is the developer for watch dogs
watch dogs it's gotten a crazy amount of
height because of welcome do you know I
want to play too because you have this
GTA environment where you can actually
interact we can turn off that light bulb
turn off this camera and start the
camera in you know you can hack into
things and while I was in Montreal
covering the Nvidia event they did they
did a live demo playing watchdogs which
were unfortunately not allowed to film
but what I got out of it is the fact
that it's been delayed on October 16th
and that plummeted Ubisoft stock by 26%
so that's I mean if I that's the
equivalent to this yeah to their stuff
yeah but not only I mean not only the
delay is just super bad for the company
itself I mean 26% of stock loss it's
insane amount of money but that I was
also angry gamers who me and have wanted
to play this hacking game and all that
because the trailers and the hype that's
being building up so but going back to
the demo that they played at them in
Montreal it just seems so unpolished in
terms of optimization of your hardware
did it seem like they're using like just
like an alpha built or wasn't even
thinking that's like pre alpha that was
just like a tech demo it threw together
I it seemed like open-world environment
where people I mean where are you able
to go into places and they showcased
what you can do in terms of getting away
from cops so blowing up a pipe steam or
closing down a bridge or changing the
traffic lights but the problem the
problem was that it was very choppy
performance-wise I believe is running in
on Titan SLI
oh and it was just purple at
intersections where there was a lot of
things happening but it shouldn't be
that way especially if you're running in
the Etzel eyed Titan right so no wonder
this game is delayed while I'm excited
for it based on what I've seen I think
this game is going to be disappointment
kinda sucks now to something that's not
a disappointment for capo
this is why that's yeah you knew was you
knew I was coming I don't know why I get
the thumbs up this is inappropriate but
you knew it was coming so if you want to
find it you can find it somewhere we
won't even have any links for that but
you know now this is you don't ask how I
know this this is just an announcement
of that for all of you that have large
hard drives specifically for that
purpose now you know a way that you can
use them that's nice going with this you
get your mind out of the gutter people
Oh so moving on from 4k porn we have
more exciting as much as I don't want to
move on from 4k award
exciting news drug acts 11.2 yes
so DirectX 11 point 2 is set to announce
what is set to work in conjunction with
Windows 8.1 in order to offload textures
in a game that usually are that they
usually loaded into vram so dedicated
graph dedicated RAM on your graphics
card and DirectX 11 point to wit Kakashi
with Windows 8.1 will be able to offload
this textures from DRAM on to system
memory and this is this is huge that
means that if you have a one gigabyte
graphics card and you have 16 gigabytes
of system memory your system memory is
now going to be I'm not sure exactly how
much of it but it will be able to be
utilized for game textures and this
means that you have an insane amount of
more detail and high resolution textures
that will be able to be included in the
game and that's just exciting that the
fact that you can the PC industry is
moving forward in terms of incorporating
different performance just using
resources in in a way that we weren't
able to do before
so what I think that'll big news because
the way that I think about it is that
you're gonna have graphics card company
so you're so good at the end up throwing
out like four and three gig cards like
they usually do but what we're gonna see
is that one start seeing I think the
cores are be much better utilized with
11.2 specifically because they're not
going to be
pulling directly from the RAM that's on
the card and basically the cards aren't
really gonna be controlling that that
memory bandwidth so mm-hmm
really one thing I'm concerned about
though is that this might not
necessarily be as big of a thing for
discrete GPUs I think that the biggest
thing that we're see right now is that
when you have let's say an APU like AMD
you might actually have the textures
coming off of the the RAM that way so
might allow you to game at a higher
quality level with just an APU
then you would look at the discrete GPU
but I can see where if it's coated
properly in Gaza I have no idea how it
is coated but if it's coated properly
this could actually kind of remove like
GDD are whatever
yeah from cards for the next little
while if you're pulling it right from
system exactly and it could make the
graphics cards that much cheaper if if
if they include just enough memory on
the card to run all the processing tasks
that are required to run by the GPU then
the rest of the memory can be utilized
on the system memory and that way you
your GPU can only make me half a gig or
maybe 2 gigas and kids of RAM and just
as yeah to like run basic 2d tasks I
guess I mean if they're uh if they're
able to offload everything on to
assistant memory that would be huge yeah
I didn't imagine playing a game with
like I don't know I just well it's 32
gigs this place or the higher end
systems you can get right now
it's imagine running a game of 16 gigs
worth of actual memory running it like
thanks my memory yet so you're high
detailed insane resolution textures that
be great for 4k gaming yeah you know
what that's the perfect segment that we
who have done for 4k porn okay so with
moving from DirectX 11 points you we're
good before before we move on to another
topic is that well given now that
DirectX 11 point 2 and we'll be working
with an introduction with 8.1 Windows
would you guys be willing to switch to
Windows 8.1 because of that a good point
a lot of people are still very
unfamiliar with the Windows 8 ecosystem
I myself as just switch the wall
upgraded to Windows 8.1 which I prefer
just because it's Start button and
actually find ridiculous that it was not
including the on 8 and I find ridiculous
that all they are the advertisements for
Windows 8.1 were now we've added the
start button and you know it just you
put back something and took away yes so
I mean that is a whole story in its own
but the fact that now this is going to
be a thing exclusive for 8.1 Windows so
would you guys be willing to switch to
Windows 8.1 because of that I'm a
windows 7 user so I think that this
might actually help what do you mean I
might I might do it now I might get a
copy and move to 8.1 I might join the
new world so yeah enjoy in the touch
world I like it well not the touch world
I don't have a touch monitor yeah I need
one for a 4k porn okay so another thing
that's in the new guys and the new guys
in the news guys is something that's
actually a little bit disturbing if you
live in Canada and are a bowel
subscriber Bella has basically gone and
announced that if you use okay if you do
the following things if you have bel
internet if you have a phone with bel so
a cell phone if you have TV with bel so
either bel 5 or satellite they are going
to track every single thing that you do
in order to enhance customer
satisfaction so in other words let us
monitor what you do so that we can
collect this information and I don't
know what they do it pass it on to the
NSA okay I think simultaneously it was
awesome so basically this is really bad
news for the consumer I don't understand
how companies think that they can do
this type of thing
yeah and strip away just basic privacy
rights and basically get away with it
but at the exact same time guys stand up
for your rights I mean Canada's privacy
Commission has promised that they're
gonna actually look into it which is
huge news so if you want talk to your
MPs talk to people that will care go to
a bail store and yell at people just
random people
Oh Ranma beetle okay maybe not ran into
people don't get don't go to a bolster
and yell at anybody I'm not advocating
that but what I am saying is that rights
if you're as outraged as I am that well
I don't use spell products but if I did
use spell products I would be incredibly
outraged I would be writing letters of
concern and basically just stating that
listen this has to change it's not right
it has to change it's not right and
what's good from this story and I think
this sort of relates back to our Foxconn
story that we did in episode one is the
fact that international community while
yes in Canada people are responding and
people are saying this is not okay so
now the privacy Commission in Canada
have started the investigation to find
out what's that what sighing group yeah
an honest actually sent out a couple
tweets don't worry about it yeah okay so
uh Bell thank you and all you need to do
something quickly before they get you
before they get you yeah I think it's a
it's a good way to for the community to
respond I'm a bell customer so it
affects me I guess gives me another
reason to stick to a VPN yeah that's
true yeah um so another thing in the
news I don't know if you guys noticed
but Apple had a pretty big conference a
couple days ago the biggest thing is is
surprise surprise it's a new iPad oh my
god so I mean it's it's thinner it's got
a bigger screen kind of yeah that's
pretty much it it's what was it at 20%
thinner so that is pretty cool it's
groundbreaking yeah it's got a thinner
bezel it's got the a7 processor it's
very fast yes okay let's retina display
they're saying that it's eight times
faster than the original iPad yeah
that's eight or three years old I'd
certainly hope it's at least eight times
faster yeah
but the big thing about this that
they're selling it on an MSRP of $4.99
which is impressive considering the fact
that their past iPads have sold for
considerably more but in my eyes it's
like they're competing with a $500
product against stuff that you can still
purchase for 200 300 I mean you've
reviewed Pat tablets that are roughly
around the exact same size yeah that
might not have the same feature quality
so I might have the same pixel density
and everything on the screen but but it
it really comes down to I guess user
experience in user behavior and for
example I would
I would rather go with an latest Nexus 7
then and then an iPad just because I
like the Android ecosystem better but
there's gonna be a lot of people who are
you know Apple and they have been
following the iOS ecosystem for a while
and they just don't feel comfortable
expanding into Android yes you saw them
outside of the Apple Store every time
that there's any type of a launch if
they have new headphones there's people
lining up outside the door
so what making funny you I'm just saying
it's a fact yeah
there's a lot of you yeah so in terms of
they're announcing I mean it's not we're
gonna see a new iPad every year anyway
or same thing with like well at least at
least there's gonna be a cycle and so I
think there's cycles every six months
yeah every six months - like eight
months they released a new iPad products
the same thing with like the iPhone yeah
they're coming up with one I go out
every yep almost every year - six or
eight months to a year so yeah I guess
that's what their product cycle was like
but the only one thing that I wish that
they would have done is been a little
more competitive in price I might have
actually picked one up I have a eight
inch Samsung Galaxy Tab that I I find is
pretty cool I didn't pay for it I got it
from my bank but it works for me so my
value proposition is like I would like
something cheap but then again you don't
have people that are willing to pay that
price for it so yeah yeah well just
they'll on a topic of we have some stats
for you guys so in 2012 Apple basically
held 54 54 % of iOS in iOS in general
iOS ecosystem 54% worldwide this is a
year ago today in 2013 they held they
hold less of a share than Android so
Android is really up and coming huge so
like you said it's all about competition
right so the this new iPad while it is
still competing with you know I guess
find a $4.99 8 inch tablets in 10 inch
tablets said that there are windows that
you know have a lot more functionality
built into them than because it's it's
an actual Windows PC you can do a lot
more things with it than just an iOS
tablet it's also showing that this gap
between Android and iOS is widening so
potentially in 2014 we're gonna see that
Apple's
thinking that you know maybe we should
be competing more and become more
competitive by offering better pricing
because I think they tip their hat a
little bit with that with the the iPhone
launch yeah they had the 5s and then the
5c I mean they're saying that the 5 seat
is for five color
no it's for five cheap they basically
built the thing it's the first iPhone to
have like a plastic back cover I believe
it's the first iPhone daffa I like a
polycarbonate back cover so I mean
there's kind of going in that in the way
realizing that hey we've had a corner of
the premium market for the longest time
now maybe it's time that we'd do
something that gets to more of a broad
appeal so you can reach more people and
emerging markets they don't have the
same type of money that we do here in
North America so that's that's a pretty
big thing mm-hmm
yeah absolutely okay guys so the the
next topic that we have on our docket on
the lists of everything that we want to
discuss is something that actually will
we're filming this on a Thursday the
product that we're talking about the NDA
expired
as of midnight this morning so the
reviews are posted yeah it's it's out
you can buy one it's really hyped up
it's an AMD card what is it it has
mantle true audio to ensure audio a
really cool cooler it's a 290x dr9 290x
so finally finally a note you were able
to size it out finally its own okay guys
this is one of the bigger things that
the market next are the past little
while the rumors of it being a game
changer are kind of true if you want to
look at it on a value proposition type
of thing so yeah you saw it firsthand
what did you think
so 290x is based on the benchmarking
like you say it's a I think it's a
game-changer because it delivers to that
price to performance ratio that we've
never seen before and a lot of people
were initially thinking oh my god this
is going to be a Titan killer
and they've hyped up this this card and
you know what the when I first saw the
results I wasn't I was surprised because
the hyped up rumors were true
and that usually ever happens it beat it
it
beat and I did okay we're not just
talking about like marginally I mean the
majority of the the tests over if you go
too hard recognize calm and you take a
look at the the review section and then
you take a look at the 290x I believe it
beats the Titan by at least three
percent overall yeah and this is without
an overclock and I'm gonna be jumping
into that a little bit this is on this
is in the uber mode which is increased
fan speed but yeah so fan speed
increased so that better cooling and
allows the car to have a little bit
higher clocks but this is not
overclocking this is allowing the cards
to run and the best possible clocks
utilization of the core at the hundred
percent so basically what we're talking
about is that the clock structure is
dynamic yeah so depending on basically
how cool you can keep your card yeah
that clock will change now there is
still overclocking features that you can
get in this card but it's basically just
adjusting for your temperature variance
I guess or the temperature threshold
which is which is 95 degrees so I mean
there's a lot of concerns with a card so
the three the concerns is the first is
temperature
it's 94 degrees at 100% or 94 degrees as
soon as you do any benchmarking or
gaming with it right so that's kind of
concern for me like how hot will your
case become because of that that's a I
guess this is a perfect time to
introduce somebody to water cooling if
they want to spend I mean gay guys
famous the cost of the card is like what
five fifty yeah five forty nine MSRP
this is just the suggested retail price
if you go to your outlets you might see
some sort of a variance you might see
some board partners that come in less
they might come in more it might add up
more value to it but I mean you can do
water cooling custom cooling solutions I
know that Asus has like some pretty
decent ones I guess in the pipeline like
they're there dc2 and whatever they're a
direct hopper and everything that's
that's a great cooler who who knows
where you could push the card with a
really good cooler on exactly so that
that leaves up the potential for even
better performance so even you know
potentially to see higher 3% plus better
performance than the titan with the
waterblock with aftermarket coolers and
just
bored partners that are going to come up
with because this cooler is not very is
I mean it's not the exhaust design wall
because even in the back you have just
the tiny bit cutouts opening for the GPU
to second air it has advantages of it if
you have two cards in crossfire that it
will allow to still intake air even if
they're really close together but it's
just the fan itself and I mean the
heatsink is very large but it's just not
the best cool for the card and that's
something a little bit disappointing in
terms of a reference design yeah but it
just refers to something that I'll
fairness I don't remember
okay AMD I'm sorry I don't remember the
last time you came up with a reference
design cooler that was really super
efficient the most efficient air coolers
right now are unfortunately the ones
that pour hot air back into the case
they're not gonna get a blower cooler a
blower fan that's really gonna perform
really all that well while maintaining
low noise yeah so I mean you're gonna
get either you need to get something
that's lightning fast that'll keep the
card really cool and it'll sound like a
jet engine is taking off right next to
your head or you're gonna get something
that basically fills your case up and
you need really good positive pressure
and move all that hot air out of your
case mmm
but it'll be silent they're not silent
at least it'll be a little bit quieter
so I guess it's kind of like the
trade-off yeah water cool that's all I'm
gonna say you're gonna get great clocks
your article and everything yes that's
my that's my opinion at least mhm
and and this leaves a you know good sort
of a hopefully positive response from
Nvidia with their 780ti release so 780ti
supposed to be the I guess the fastest
card NVIDIA has ever built and they said
that in their Montreal conference so I
would say this would be a nice response
to the 290x but I guess it will come
down to price the pricing structure of
their of Nvidia's latest and the
greatest cards I guess because in videos
sorry
aim DS got got amazing pricing structure
at the moment with their 280x at $2.99
so you know it's I would say $2.99 is a
sweet spot for such a low-end and 550
for the highest end graphics car will be
like a really awesome plateau
we're hopefully we're gonna see this
type of pricing to sort of level out and
benefit the consumers
well we've seen I don't think that
Nvidia is gonna come back and sort of
like scale back their pricing in a way
that it'll be a huge difference like
we're not gonna see six hundred dollar
Titans we might see them be a little
more aggressive in in bundles added
value propositions like bundles we're
gonna go into that a little bit with
Linus a little bit later he'll outline
exactly what's gonna be included in the
new Nvidia cards I don't really see them
trying to respond directly to it I think
that they're gonna try to basically say
here's where you're gonna get value yeah
and you can choose between this product
and this product based on what you have
perceived value for the tool I would say
it's a it's a strategy that would work
because if you've been if you need in
video cards for doing your you have to
affect stuff yeah using in you utilizing
CUDA I utilize CUDA everything making
exactly so I mean if I wanted to get a
780ti simply for that purposes I would
have liked the option to have the value
included of maybe perhaps a few games if
you dollars off the shield you know so
it's I would say it would be an a good
comeback in terms of still giving the
consumer a little better value for their
for their money what they what AMD is
done is with this life cycle this
current life cycle that ran four GPUs
they've been competitive but ii the
titan basically came into life came into
fruition and via kind of just stole the
show they haven't really been
competitive with them afterwards i mean
yes you can really say dual GPU is 7990
and that's that's fantastic it's a great
card it's got a great value proposition
I think it's actually for the
performance it might be close to a value
per dollar leader their performance per
dollar leaders what I meant to say but
what this is done is that AMD is now
kind of like throwing the gauntlet back
at it video basically just saying hey
we're gonna price our cards aggressively
so that we can jump back in
and now this creates competition and
guys that's never a bad thing I'm
actually excited for the first time in a
little while yeah but the the whole GPU
market because of how things have
dynamically changed in the past couple
of weeks
yeah like Montreal was fun I I was
covering it with you but I was with in
Toronto watching a livestream and I I it
sounded like you guys all were having
like an amazing time seeing all the
demos yeah you're doing so I mean or
with AMD right across the street there
they're going to war guys and it's more
evident now than I think at any other
time that I've seen in the past couple
of years yeah I'm not sure about Amy's
history in terms of crashing and videos
events but they they were across the
street from the invidious conference and
so it's a little it's a little funny
trying to them trying to kind of lure
media into their direction but it is a
little unpolite and kind of leaves
beatty that taste in the mouth when when
the company tries to do something like
that when you are there for I like the
event I like it I think it's good I
personally I mean they thought with it
is imperative but the thing is they're
not they're not stabbing Nvidia in the
back they're stopping the press so if
you if you're there on invidious dime
yeah you're now gonna go to aim the
secret hideout place to like talk to
them ya know that that's that's true
that is true because then the price is
natively effective yeah okay no I
completely understand what you're saying
I mean it's one thing if let's say
they're throwing an event simultaneously
let's say like CES or something and
trying to yeah pull them away but yes
okay no I hear what you're saying no I
okay I agree I kind of misunderstood as
to what was going on mm-hmm
well that would be our topics for today
yeah and so no now we have lioness on
the line we have a great some great
questions for him so stick around and
this is the interview Matt why don't we
go ahead first question for you Linus I
know a little while ago on your on your
forum you had a opposed to basically
educated people and exactly how you got
started in the business but one thing
that I really
I'm interested in finding out is how
like what exactly inspired your
motivated you into jumping into this
field my boss so he basically pulled me
into his office and yelled at me one day
because tigerdirect had product videos
and we didn't so uh you know we needed
to get we need to get in gear yeah he
figured I would be the one to do it
because it was like you're reasonably
techie and you're not horrific aliso for
her management site is no longer there
unfortunately I respect him a lot and I
really like working for in spite of the
way that that story might sound but that
was that was actually how I got started
cool so I you know what that kind of
answered my second question was like who
actually inspired you're motivated you
to kind of reach for more but what was
the what was the biggest motivating
factor or opportunity that you saw when
it came to starting your a your
meat-eater well the biggest opportunity
for me was I mean I've been looking very
closely at the way that the way that
revenues have trended over the last five
years since I started doing this YouTube
thing and you go back and hit it and it
is a very is a very exponential growth
curve even for a relatively small
channel like NCIX tech tips or Linus
tech tips and I mean okay yeah they each
have over a you know a quarter million
and over half a million subscribers at
this point but that's still relatively
small in the grand scheme of things and
I looked at it my my world there's a
revenue opportunity here and there's an
opportunity for me to be self-employed
which is something that you know since I
grew up watching my dad run his own jam
company I had been interested in so I
kind of went okay well if I can make
enough money to survive and I can do
this full-time and I'm already doing
this well at it I only have a little bit
of time to spend on it I have a
full-time job otherwise then who knows
what I can do if I actually do this
full-time so that was that's where that
idea came from cool now I know that um
your persona that well I guess the one
thing I want to know about give us a
little bit of background as to exactly
who
you are and first and foremost do you
actually play a character when you do
your videos now if you don't want to
tell me that's cool but yeah give us a
little insight as to who you are I mean
the simple answer is I really wasn't
hard enough to come up with the
pseudonym or a persona or anything like
that when we originally started this
like I said it was it was my boss
yelling at me and telling me we had to
do videos okay I actually remember
watching you do one of the first ncx
videos and it was kind of like something
that I was also looking forward to when
I was starting my own channel eventually
more me off to Harvard Canucks so like
you know you I think are sort of the I
would say inspiration for him for a lot
of the people who are pioneers sir the
Pioneer yeah because still even building
my own first computer it was like
referring back to Linus it's kind of
like that type of history it's cool that
you've come so far with it you know I
didn't you know I wasn't like Logan
where I knew that I was you know needed
a you know stage name or anything like
that it was just me making videos and
the reason I was chosen for the project
was just because I was again techy and
not horribly ugly so that was that was
the entire rationale so it was just me
in front of the camera and I don't think
it's really changed much since that time
so all right so I guess can you describe
your fan base for us because you have
probably one of the most rabid fan bases
that I've probably ever encountered ever
and I don't mean rabbit in a bad way
like they are very passionate they are a
very passionate fan base so how would
you describe the people that follow you
and that yeah watch your videos and
stuff you know the way that I look at it
most III actually don't work her to the
people who watch Linus X it says fans if
you've ever heard me talk I'll refer to
them as viewers because the way that I
see it the show is about more than me
it's not you're not a fan of lioness and
you're not a fan of line effective
someone you may really like line
detectives' and you may really like my
approach to technology but the way that
I see it is my viewers are fans of
technology there are fans of computers
they're fans of the companies that make
this technology that makes
our lives better and more enriching and
and that that's really the way that I
see it and whenever you whenever you
take computer fan and computer hardware
enthusiasts and put them all in one
place you're going to end up with what
looks like a pretty rabid fan base yeah
but I didn't see it a little bit
differently than the way that I look at
someone like a fan of jenna Marbles
where the entire show is her personality
tactics was never intended to be about
me it was intended to be about this kind
of stuff
yeah oh the 290 speaking away speaking
of which the 290x in one word go okay no
word all right so then what do you think
the news release what do you think of
the 290x I think that potential
game-changer with respect to price to
performance you look at the way that AMD
is priced it I know we haven't seen how
Nvidia is reacted with something like
780ti they've given us almost no details
about that card but right now if I'm a
battlefield gamer and I want a card for
playing Battlefield as soon as possible
I'm looking very closely at the r9 290x
for a couple of reasons number one is
that even though we got a Bunco blocker
so we're one of the only sites reporting
290x not beating the GTX 780 because we
have a decent 780 overclock and our 290x
is a complete done in that respect so
even though we got one of those you look
at how competitive it is now and then
you look at how much more competitive it
could potentially be based on some of
the rumors I've heard about how project
mantle is going to affect performance
and we could be looking at a completely
different landscape come December when
battlefield 4
releases their mental support so right
do you actually think that n videos
gonna have any type of response to it I
mean we're there most likely will prize
jobs oh man I mean to Manta yeah or
automation they're very comfortable
being priced hundred dollars higher than
AMD I think their reaction mail may
already be done with their holiday
bundle which is the
three games I can't remember it's black
flags in there they've also got I had
tuned one that comes to mind cuz that I
think it's only one that I was
personally end up buying anyways anyway
holiday bundle and then they've got that
$100 box filled with 770 which I mean I
am maybe I'm the only person I don't
think I'm the only person left there's
some exciting stuff coming up about
shield with respect to the functionality
that they announced at the last
conference so there's the console mode
yeah that starting to look like very
compelling little piece of hardware and
a great companion for your graphics
cards so they not like they're
competitive okay do you think that they
kind of jumped the gun or not jump the
gun but kind of like found a way to work
around the fact that AMD ended up
picking up all the consoles and kind of
winning that console board do you think
they're trying to compete kind of with
consoles by kind of developing their own
version of one you know the rumors the
rumors are all over the place on this
one of the rumors I heard is that Nvidia
was approached about being a hardware
and the upcoming consoles and basically
said no not not lucrative enough doesn't
make sense for us and you know you look
at the way this new gen we have shield
being resistant as a replacement for a
next-gen console already the way that I
look at it is maybe in videos right
maybe maybe this generation of consoles
is the last generation that is relevant
and maybe even it doesn't last create an
entire console lifetime relevance
because the way that I see it we could
be looking at being machine versus
Android yeah rather than so many versus
Microsoft in the console space within
the next five or six years you mentioned
that next-gen consoles are obsolete even
before launch I would agree with you on
that point in terms of sort of where the
graphics industry is moving towards you
know insane performance like we saw with
the 290x for example one thing I want to
find out what about you and pick your
brain about is DirectX 11 point 2 and
Windows 8.1 and the feature of
offloading sort of the RAM memory onto
just regular system memory so
what do you think about that in terms of
moving into that direction for gaming
unloading much higher textures for games
for example what what do you what do you
think of that on the PC I mean it's it's
no secret you ask anyone whether it's
Intel or AMD who makes CPUs and they're
gonna tell you we are moving towards a
complete change in the way that pcs
operate and we want the CPU and the GPU
to both be responsible for general
computing we want them to both be
responsible for graphics computing we
want them to share more resources that
is an extremely exciting future I just
don't know that Microsoft will
necessarily be a part of it because
Windows 8.1 has been described as I
guess less terrible but the reality is
normally those eight already performed
better the Windows 7 for gamers and not
many people seem to be willing to
sacrifice the general usability of their
machine for something that's a little
bit more optimal for gaming right I'm
taking a very wait-and-see approach to
that I don't want what I just said to
sound like you know a prediction of doom
for Windows or Microsoft because they've
got a lot of time still to pull this
together and deliver something that
appeals to enthusiasts a lot at the time
I mean it's not like they've never
released an OS but nobody liked before
and they've turned it around and they've
released something better to follow it
up so I had to say anything about it I
would say I'm really excited to see more
shared resources between different parts
of your computer thanks Linda well that
concludes our interview session with
Linus thank you so much men for joining
on the episode 2 we we do appreciate it
man yeah and you know it's Haruka knox
name still pending show at the moment
where am i thinking of like there's one
about I don't know a log I just hope
that there's no dropping of log jokes a
lot of think of beaver time what about
the the tap show can you guys get away
from like
body by word well we asked for
suggestions so we're gonna wait and see
what the feedback is but we're gonna be
doing a vote and if you want jump in and
see what you'd like to have it called
thanks a lot man we really appreciate
your time and I look forward to seeing a
I don't know some sort of like a press
release that you actually did invent
that USB butt plug thanks Linus here all
right well guys this concludes episode
number two we've had a great show
excellent guest host excellent great
guest host first great guest Thank You
Linus so much for tuning in and
answering some of the questions great
insight then you know something that I
believe a lot of people you a lot of
people might have gotten some useful
information out of it and just great
Tech Talk man yeah I guess the next
thing I want to tell you guys is go to
the forums main reason why we love your
feedback I don't I don't know if you
guys noticed and I'm not ringing grandpa
sweater no grandpa sweater and no gum
this time yes I'm not chewing gum
I don't you didn't see any chewing
motion system but we do love your
feedback we listen to it we take into
consideration we're in a new set and
they kind of were in my apartment
because our studio was kind of taken
from us people's ember to stay in the
couches so we were just a little more a
little more cozy so basically guys what
you can do is go onto the yeah what the
hell like this okay so guys going to the
forums to grab you a bad folks go back
for you okay so let's go back so guys we
love your feedback obviously and what we
want to do is to be more help name the
show some you guys have already given
some incredible names so far yeah
so what we're gonna do keep on coming up
with names and giving them to us either
on Facebook Twitter YouTube or on the
forum itself we're gonna create a thread
so you can vote on what we think are the
top five for each of us yeah I mean
there is a little bit of overlap so
might be seven or eight options there
and you're gonna have a saying basically
what we call this going forward thank
you guys so much for tuning in in
episode 2 I hope you enjoyed it we will
be continuing along with this weekly
content
the delivering news text of some things
and ethics and more news in the
technology industry in general and we
are planning on having weekly guests as
well bringing in insightful information
for yourself and also you don't know who
yet we don't know who yet next week but
we are working on it then it's gonna be
exciting I'm looking forward to it and I
look forward to filming the show every
week so you know partly because of
really looking interested to see what
type of engagement we would like to get
from you guys because some really
awesome comments on the first episode
and really good feedback from you guys
as well and also just learning about
what's happening in the industry and
chillin with this guy so yeah let's wrap
this up and we'll see you guys in the
next episode see you guys see ya there
alright alright that's a wrap that's
gonna</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
