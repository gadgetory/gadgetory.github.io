at Computex 2013 they have a couple of
new cases they've just announced so
Jorge will go over with us about those
and they also have the new Vengeance Pro
memory specifically designed for
overclocking
so let's first check out the cases and
then move on to the Vengeance Pro memory
with I'm here with Jorge the product
manager for cases and Cooling so Jorge
go throw us some new cases do you guys
have here at complex 2013 this is a kind
of a new flagship for the carbide series
it's our high airflow case it's designed
to be kind of the the highest end
carbide serious case it's called a car
by the air 540 and it's a pretty big
divergence from the layout of a typical
case yeah we took the mechanical hard
drive cages and the the optical drive
cages and kind of moved them around the
power splinted around and everything
this chamber is designed to be an active
cooling product right so you have fans
for your video cards to blow right over
them your CPU cooler gets some fresh air
flow memory and even mechanical hard
drives right here are directly cooled on
the passive little side of the case on
this side if I flip it around real quick
we'll have power supply SSDs optical
drive cage and your cable right right
here and the reason we did that is
because these things are either
passively cooled or can cool themselves
like the power supply does it doesn't
need case air flow this is by itself
back here and that allows us to get the
best air cooling possible on this side
so we've tested this case versus all the
competitors case we haven't found a case
that is better than this on air flow and
we even have flexibility in the front
you actually have really good cooling on
the front with the dual 140 s that we
include in a rear 140 and then there's a
dust filter here
to keep the dust from getting inside the
case you can fit a 360 millimeter
radiator or a 240 or to 80 millimeter
radio this is $139 us come to the full
site panel window and will be available
towards the end of July alright so
coming to another case what do we have
here this is the 330 R it's an also a
carbide series case the premise here was
to take a 300 R which is one of our most
popular cases and a really good higher
flow gaming case it's kind of a
mid-level what price point yeah and to
make a silent version of it so we keep
the same internals the only change
readings that we added a little bit of
height for each 100 IH 110 compatibility
which is something people who have
bought the 300 or have asked us to do
and then we added sound damping off
throughout it so the side panels are
solid and have sound damping high
density foam the top has a removable
high density foam cover with plastic the
thing that just clips in and then the
front has a front door that is a similar
brushed aluminum texture to the 550d but
it's actually plastic that is molded
like this just like the front of the 300
R is internally it has a table of Steel
behind it and then a piece of rubber
here that keeps it nice and quiet and
that weight of the steel helps keep
vibration down right behind that is your
dust filter to access for the front 120
millimeter fan very easy to change out
doing 120 to 140 s in the front and then
inside the case the rear is a 120 the
top can you do a 141 20s as well if
you'd like that as well there's no hard
drive gauge in the way just like some in
ours so you get really good airflow
right to your auto components again and
it gets the air in and out of the case
and the for drive trays are SSD or
three-and-a-half-inch compatible so so
given this as you're turning 300 R into
a sort of a silent case how do you go
about you know giving us same airflow
options but because of the sound
dampening form how
obviously let air flow is being sort of
limiting so how do you go how do you
approach that issue so the main idea was
to look at the 300 RS performance and
say how do we affect that in
away like you said - we still want to
make it quieter but how do you affect
the performance in very small amount so
after doing things like we did a test to
see exactly how far that front door
needs to be away from this to get the
right amount of intake and it turns out
about 20 millimeters anything past that
is unnecessary do you have the same
number 20 millimeters is it with the
front door 15 millimeters away so we
said okay but anything closer restricts
it so that's why there's that gap
between that and front and then if you
look at this power supply and set up in
here we still have that same good
airflow in here and you have a very
similar airflow into the front the only
differences instead of them 300 where
the noise comes straight out the front
mesh now it's redirected away from the
end-user the top of the 300 R was made a
little bit taller for the 330 R that
extra volume of air inside the case
helps as well because it takes longer to
heat up a large volume of air so we can
keep the fans nice and quiet and yet the
air in and out so actually compared to
300 R this is only about one or two
degrees warmer in our testing on the
same chassis the hardware and but it's
about five decibels quieter which is
significant from because this was a
logarithmic scale so right it's a much
quieter chassis right so adding the
sound sound dampening material onto the
side panel how much does that affect and
if you kept a panel that is acrylic
window does that affect anything
the acrylic window basically negates any
sound damping you put on that side panel
so you might still get some on the back
side but the window itself is either
made of polycarbonate acrylic or lexan
or some other clear material and those
typically are not anywhere near good at
being quiet
they tend to rattle because of the
attachment that they can either rattle
or expand and contract when it heats up
or cools down right and these are just
not good for quiet cases so now if you
did buy a 300 R on window from the 300
windows version and put it on this case
it would work but it would no longer be
a silent case it would be you know a
piece of the front door and a window
which is not a quiet case right
I guess you keeping up all the same
internal components so any all the same
cable management configurations rubber
grommets the old cable ten notches and
stuff like that yeah we're pretty famous
for having done the the cable
grommets and cable stuff like that that
we can have invented at that time and
then every one of our cases has just a
ton of tool free hardware so that it
makes it kind of easy to build your case
my core philosophy is that you know if
you are building a piece of case it's
because you want to be able to a PC case
so let's make it as fun and easy as
possible for you to build your next-gen
case and that's why every case we have
has like two or three things
thumbscrews everywhere tool free hard
drive kita is when we can and the total
minimal lack of tools needed so you
don't have to find a different
screwdriver you don't have to worry
about having the right screws in your
drawer the only thing you really have to
screw in as your motherboard tray and
your mother would rather and we've done
a bunch of experiments to try and find a
way around that - is it possible to
install them other word without tools
we've never found one that was easier
than just using the screwdriver yeah one
day we might but for right now it's
still easier to use a screwdriver for
the you know screws that we have no we
did make it a little bit easier because
on all of our cases we have a center
post yeah place the middle standoff is a
center post so you put the motherboard
in line up your I Oh panel on the rear
and then you just put it on the post and
it stays in place while you screw the
rest in and even that little change
which is a very inexpensive thing to do
as something many of our competitors
don't do or haven't thought to do yeah
but it makes building your case a lot
easier and more fun so it's kind of our
philosophy make it easier to make it
more fun and then add a bunch of cool
features and performance stuff okay so
when when is this coming out and what's
the price range this is us and this is
available in late July okay well thanks
George to new cases enforcer are pretty
known for your cable management great
addition from the 300 our slight
modifications for sound dampening foam
for those who need it and also a very
extreme new carbide series this is the
airflow airflow at 5:40 given us extra
space behind the motherboard where you
can tuck away all your your power supply
your cables so the front of the case or
the side of the case gets all your
hardware - and I guess for the best the
better of the airflow so everything goes
through all the components that need to
be cooled are in their right spots
versus the others that don't need any
passive cooling let's say so hey guys
we're here with Rick Allen the director
of public relations here at Corsair they
have some new memory here lined up for
computing
20:13 so Rick tell us what is the new
Vengeance series and how it came to be
okay well sure well it's all here's it
here's one of the new modules right here
the reason we came out with a new
vengeance Pro line which is higher than
our current vengeance line is last year
we came to Computex and we're a lot of
the overclockers are asking us when
you're gonna give us some new
overclocking memory to help you break
some of the records out there so we came
with a vengeance Pro line it has higher
performance right now it's designed to
have a clock overclock heavily on
caswell systems so right now we're
shifting ecially with kits I'm going
1600 to 29 33 megahertz and it's very
achievable known that has well you know
last year on Ivy Bridge processors you
know getting up above 20 666 was a
challenge but now with Haswell 3000 is
easily achievable so we've got these
faster speeds yeah we announced 29:33
initially but we also just at the show
announce that we've got a new production
kit it's going to go to 32 hundred
megahertz Cass 11 so that's the fastest
production kit available currently Wow
so with the memory kit obviously a lot
of overclocking potential so great for
overclockers how is the module is built
to suit these overclocking capabilities
good question so one of one thing that
we did over the current Vengeance memory
line is we move to it of eight layer PCB
and it's all black we also went with a
new new heat spreader design which was
black and we've got it in multiple
colors now so it comes in two in gold
and blue and red and silver also that
there's the ICS are very tightly screen
now to make sure that we have plenty of
overclocking potential to hit the higher
speeds so that's one thing we're say
well get we're back for for the
overclockers that's one of the reasons
we do it yeah and so just the color
that's based on the speed of the module
or is that just just a customizable
color is completely independent of the
speed of the module so Rick you have
some bench benchmarking going on here
tell us what what this setup is doing
yeah you know one of the things we want
to do to prove that we've actually come
back with new memory for overclockers is
to provide a kit that is just fast
outside of the box so the stock speed of
this particular kit that were showing is
32 hundred megahertz Cass 11 and we
believe that's one of the fastest
duction kits available now that will run
air-cooled that doesn't include all the
overclocking Headroom let me be
available people that really want to
push the limits up
so given this is a let's say the stock
3200 what is the potential overclocking
capability for this module because the
person handbilling these kids are still
testing all that but he's he's an
overclock himself Jake Kremen so he's
going to make sure there's some room in
there so excellent
well memory from Corsair very fast great
for overclockers comes in three
different colors and what is the price
range for this how is it how does it fit
in with the rest of engine series and
the Dominator series okay at the
vengeance line and we have the Dominator
line what vendors Pro is doing is
sitting above the vengeance in terms of
providing over performance it's actually
getting up at the Dominator speeds but I
should bring that a price point and well
given this is sort of reaching towards
that level towards dominate their line
where do you see the denominator line
heading if the vengeance series is
becoming so strong is it I mean these
Dominator line becoming obsolete well
you have these new new memories coming
out in cycles so you'll see an update
