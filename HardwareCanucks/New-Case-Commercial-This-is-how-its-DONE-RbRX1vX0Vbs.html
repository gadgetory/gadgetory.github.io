me is a giant mess in the office that I
always create come on Demetri what but I
got a super busy day today
multiple things to achieve and prepare
for a few videos later in the week so
let's begin
like it get them so bad that I can't
even open my door because there's boxes
over there and this is from my most
recent project of trying to see how
sound everything material you know how
it works of isolating sound so it's just
been the crazy mess for me like aligning
boxes all over this case so that we can
actually do some tests
and check this out the corner has not
finally been cleaned it's it's a rare
sight to see this corner without any
boxes stacked on top of each other but
it's okay but now that some of those
cases are out I can finally start
working on this the cosmos 225
anniversary edition for a little
pre-roll for the channel well hello
there
always remember to lift with your legs
and your body and not just your back
thanks heavy man so I'm on this side now
what I'm going to do next is get the
most beautiful beer I can of the cosmos
- and it's quite easy because of those
beautiful aluminum and all the handles
and stuff but I'm going to try to create
a very moody atmosphere I'm going to use
my homemade gels for example this is my
portable light and it has nice output
it's very large but you add something
like this and it colors that source
lighting and I can create beautiful
Purple's greens oranges reds and blues
oh yeah now I already have a lot of
footage for the case because of the
review video so you may be wondering
like why I'm redoing this all over again
and the simple answer is I really just
want to use my jail time to turn all to
light
now believe it or not as much as I love
my window I get so much natural light
that I utilize all the time
whether it's now all the trees are so
close so the broom is actually
illuminated by a lot of the green being
reflected from the leaves which is not
the best because then you get very green
undertones and then has to like my room
with my giant off the boxes in order to
eliminate that ambient coming from the
outside which is why I'm starting to use
the color gels that eliminates any of
that color cast that is unpleasant and
it's been working great so far now the
color scheme for the cosmos as you can
see is blue silver and purple so that's
awesome so we can keep up with the color
scheme with all these added little
highlights of that that I do the camera
I'm using without to record these things
that the gh 5 make sure to check out our
review of it and I'm going to be doing
intended color so that we can capture
the best possible quality in color so we
have to switch to the g7 for the
remaining of this behind the scenes so
let's switch alright let's set this
thing up ready to roll
the thing is I don't want to overdo it
with the Purple's but I would love to
create a silhouette of the case because
we have very distinct angles on the top
and those case feet at the bottom
creates like a very unique cosmos only
looking type of uh you know silhouette
so what I just did there is light
painting I'm going to piece those two
footages together so that it seems like
the lights coming from the opposite side
but because I only have one I had to do
it this way so I think I'm done with the
exterior view off shots for the a spot
and since you know this is an enclosure
from 2012 it's been refreshed and is a
25th anniversary edition obviously you
know it's not the best in terms of
modernization of the interior however
that's challenged for for us to create
something that's appealing to the
audience and I know I think that's we're
not trying to cheat anyone by promoting
such an enclosure instead we're trying
to sort of you know target D the
classically minded individuals who might
have potentially bought this case back
in 2012 and still appreciate or like the
fact that it has 13 storage spots so
what we thought to be a Kawai to
highlight these storage spots not
particularly in the positive light or a
negative light but just to highlight
that they are there is to populate these
things not with drives but with
something else for example using that
space to store your Lego maybe camera
gear maybe even books it's also probably
gets my headphones and other audio gear
so yeah it's very unconventional to
showcase something like this but I think
you'll turn out pretty good
so as I'm setting up all these items to
be placed inside the storage
compartments on the bottom and in the
main hard drive cage here I'm realizing
there's so much hype here that my you
know Fred can fit in no problem so I'm
going to use that my coffee cup with an
actual coaster from cluemaster also sits
in there no problem so I'm hoping that
will you know deliver some uniqueness in
terms of how you can utilize that space
outside of the conventional storage
options
chickasaw it's a pretty hilarious look
for storage compartments got three GPUs
in here dual 1980 is and one 1070
normally the way these things work is of
course we write out the script we write
out a proposal coolermaster approves it
and then we go ahead with shooting so
there are no surprises but I have a
spontaneous idea that has come to mind
in terms of using the cup in between
those two Drive walls and actually
taking a sip from it which I think would
add a little bit of extra character to
actually using this space for other
things and not just showing that it's
there but actually me reaching in take
me a sip and putting it back
and weirdly as I'm shooting this
creative spot and utilizing the space
for other things are the drives
I'm actually thinking it's not a bad
idea there's so much room in the
basement
I could easily store my gear that I
normally use you know the door supposed
to open no problems so I can access them
easily and yeah there's just so much
storage room that you could potentially
explore if you're not using them for
drives and the last thing I need to
cover is the side panel I already have
the shot of its curved and that's very
cool but I also want to have a
reflection element so like me opening
the side panel and staring into the
camera like I'm checking out my hair or
something so kind of standard thing and
again going with the theme of
unconventional uses inside the case
Wow so yeah that was a lot of takes but
I usually do many and then choose the
best one based on you know movement
based on lighting and stuff of that
there's a little bit of variance and
every shot and just making sure that I
can choose the best one and don't be
stuck with something I shot only once so
all my shots are complete time to go
back to the gh 5 so we can begin the
Edit 4 so I have all my footage inserted
into premiere it's time to edit
the coarser glaive game mouse has it all
with the comfortable shape and
interchangeable some grips arm run
switches a fantastic optical sensor with
1 VPI adjustment steps and of course my
friends RGB lighting experience
performance in the palm of your hand
with a link in the description below the
Edit is complete and that it's helped us
you know I have so much footage from the
review video but yeah I think it turned
out pretty good it's a pretty simple one
with beautiful footage and that I think
a very unique grade on it as well so
here it is explore your future with the
cosmos - case and celebrate 25 years of
ambition that drives Coolermaster
forward enjoy the familiar yet still
forward-looking character the frame with
solid aluminum handles it may be the
most physical you'll ever get with the
computer case but it's all worthwhile or
gets creative put any of the 13 storage
options that encourage outside the box
thinking meanwhile the curved tempered
glass panels on both sides ensures a
lasting impression classically trained
but still ready for anything
the Coolermaster cosmos - lets celebrate
the past by building for the future I
