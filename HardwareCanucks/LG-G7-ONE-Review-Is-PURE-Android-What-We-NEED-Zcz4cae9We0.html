this is LG's g7 one now if you call I
did take a look at its older sibling the
g7 thank you a little over a month ago
and I had some concerns about that
device my major problem with that phone
was a softer experience
LG's skin on top of Android really
wasn't my thing and I didn't have a
great of an experience but the rest of
device was awesome he had a great
display the Quan - that was fantastic
battery life was also excellent so a lot
of things have changed ever since they
posted that video prices have dropped on
that device it could vary from carrier
to carry you might end up getting a
major discount on that particular device
and you know it actually competes with
the likes of Samsung and the rest of the
flagship devices so that's pretty
awesome but I think the g7 one might be
one of the favorite Android smartphones
or one of my favorite inner it's my
phones of 2018 I don't know why it's
running stock Android it's like a dream
come true
so let's find out who exactly might this
phone be appealing towards right after
message from our sponsor the new master
keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic wrist rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection Coolermaster
doing it right check it out below
okay so let's cut to the chase and get
to what exactly you're getting with the
g7 one perhaps the best way to describe
this phone would be a slight derivative
of the g7 thank you so you get the same
6.1 inch qHD plus display with the 1000
it's a boosted mode feature it still
features an IPS panels so viewing
content is just as good as a thank you
great experience overall
they've also kept the 32-bit high fived
ACK and the boom box feature that
resonates the sound within the chassis
to any surface that you place the device
on there's also the dedicated Google
Assistant button ip68 water-resistant
rating a 3000 milliamp hour battery with
charge 3.0 support you get the deal here
so what's really different well the
first thing that struck to my eye was
the slight shift in design and by that I
mean that they've replaced the glass
back with a stating black metal like
finish if that makes any sense
it certainly doesn't get as greasy as a
thank you and I like that even the
aluminum frame has a matte black finish
to it and I'm really diggin it over the
thing to use a stainless steel frame
they've also removed the
wide-angle lens but it still maintains
the same 16 megapixel F 1.6 standard
lens and pictures that come out of it
are mostly a hit or miss sometimes they
look too wibbit other times there there
are some weird color shifts going on and
if you're really patient with the device
you can actually end up getting some
amazing shots with the phone especially
in broad daylight conditions and if you
expose the subjects really well the
pictures coming out of the device is
actually really good there's a lot less
software processing on the gcn one
compared to thank you that's one of the
things I noticed after examining the
pictures up closely so I think that's a
positive because LG hasn't loaded it
with things like manual controls so
there's nothing like that on the jisun
one so it may or may not be a
deal-breaker for some of you out there
support for wireless charging has also
been eliminated and you're getting a
slightly older snapdragon 835 CPU four
gigabytes of RAM versus six on the thank
you and that's pretty much it the
biggest selling feature of this device
is the OS that runs on it LG has
partnered up with Google to give users a
clean version of Android that doesn't
come with any bloatware applications or
skins in fact LG is guaranteeing
software updates on the g7 one for the
next three years and I think that's a
step in the right direction because you
all know they have a pretty bad history
with updating their smartphones now this
guy's currently walking Android 8.1 Oreo
and it is expected to receive the
Android 9 PI update by the end of the
year which is pretty cool but
interestingly enough I did check the
software version running on the g7 thank
you and that device is actually still
rockin android 8.0 instead of 8.1 and it
really questions LG software team
because i feel like you know google is
directly handling the software updates
for the g7 one whereas with a g7 thank
you it's again mostly carrier related
and you kind of have to be lucky enough
to receive software updates in the first
place so it's kind of confusing when you
compare the g7 one to the thank you just
in terms of pure software perspective
and after spending some time with this
device I've got to admit I really wish
to think Hugh was running the exact same
oh s apps load up fast it's easier to
get the settings it almost feels like
using a pixel device and I think that's
a win win in my books but there is a
major problem you see this phone was
announced earlier at E for this year and
no one had any clue as to how much this
thing would cost and on top of that they
had no guarantee as to whether or not
this
ahead in North American markets as of
filming this video the ji-sun 1 is only
launching in Canada and not the US and
interestingly enough I have no idea as
to how much this thing costs in Canadian
dollars which is super interesting so we
reached out to LG and asked them about
this and their response was and I quote
the g7 1 will be priced competitively in
the mid tier smartphone sector and we
encourage all consumers to check with
their local carrier or retailers for
pricing so yeah
that's where we are right now it looks
like they didn't have any plans to
launch this device globally but rather
work with local carriers within select
countries to price this competitively to
compete with mid-range smartphones so
again pricing on the g7 one can vary
from carrier to carrier and if you
happen to find this phone at a really
good affordable price point and if it
really if it justifies your budget then
it's probably worth checking out but I
will mention this it's certainly gonna
cost a lot less than the g7 thank you
now I do want to take this time and talk
about Google's Android 1 program because
LG isn't the first device to run a blue
air free version of Android in fact
there are phones from Nokia Xiaomi and
Motorola as part of the Android 1 family
and those devices are also expected to
receive software updates directly from
Google you see Android 1 was initially
launched for the Indian market because
the majority of devices that were
available back then for that particular
market didn't have the required specs to
run a fully loaded version of Android
with a third-party skin on top of that
because the specs really weren't able to
catch up to the speed or it wasn't up to
the task and so you know being able to
offer a bloatware free version of
Android for the lower tier spec and
Google being able to customize and
optimize the software to run seamlessly
on lower tier devices was I guess their
priority and that's why Android 1 was
sort of formulated or I guess it was
launched with that idea in mind it then
started to spread across countries like
Pakistan Nepal Bangladesh Myanmar Sri
Lanka and other South Asian countries
fast forward to today and we technically
have three different versions of Android
so there's a standard Android operating
system that other OEM manufacturers put
their skin on top of it which is exactly
what we're getting with the note 9 the
other thousand-dollar flagship devices
and then we have the stock version of
Android which is the Android one program
which is more targeted towards the
mid-tier devices that are optimized and
they have mid-tier specs that can other
price competitively and then there is
Android Go which was introduced last
year along with android 8.0 Oreo this
essentially is a stripped-down version
of Android one so Google was able to
work with software developers to
fine-tune apps like YouTube Gmail Chrome
maps are the most frequently used
applications for most consumers out
there on devices that don't necessarily
have the highest end specs so we're
talking maybe one to two gigabytes of
RAM with a pretty low-end processor so
it really is it's a great idea
potentially for people who don't really
want to spend 400 or 500 500 plus
dollars on an Android smartphone so it
really gives you the best or I guess it
gives you an entry little step into
experiencing Android at its finest and I
think Android Go is certainly a great
way to get started if you especially if
you really don't want to spend too much
money on an Android smartphone and then
you have things like Android one which
is exactly what forms like the g1
represents because it certainly is a
great program I really wish Samsung
hopped onto this program as well because
you know who knows we might expect
something like the galaxy s 9 1 Edition
I certainly think that the g7 one might
be a fantastic option for you because
again this thing runs stock Android it's
fast I really love it it's my favorite
Android smartphone for 2018 but
availability is a concern so I'm gonna
just I'm just gonna leave it at that
hope you guys enjoyed this little bit
let me know what you guys think about
g71 in the comments if you happen to
find this at your local carrier store
would you actually consider this device
