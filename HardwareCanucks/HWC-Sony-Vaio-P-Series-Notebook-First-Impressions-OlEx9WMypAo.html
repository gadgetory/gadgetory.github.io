into the sub note netbook market with
their Sony Vaio PC Riis what's
interesting is that we've seen netbooks
on the market from a bunch of different
factures you have Asus Acer being the
most popular as well as units from from
companies such as gigabyte and Dell
already out there so the fact that Sony
has taken so long to actually get a
product out the market is quite
surprising when we're looking at the
price points it sort of depends on the
hardware that you get with the unit it
ranges from about 900 USD with a 60
gigabyte hard drive all the way up to
over $1500 if you opt for the 128 gig
SSD model as we open up the unit to
check out the accessories we have the
notebook we also have the warranty and
registration cards you have the power
adapter the battery we also have this
little device which we'll show you later
the volley ope has an incredibly compact
design we're using our newly
standardized highlighter measurement
system here unit is nine point seven
five inches wide four point seven inches
long and listed an inch at point seven
eight inches thick
and thinking
now the external ports you'll see on the
front that we have the wireless on/off
feature as well as an SD card slot and
Sony's memory stick Pro and then off to
the right we have the power slider as
well as the battery and hard drive
indicator lights jumping to the right
you'll see a single USB port as well as
a specialized port for Sony's display
and LAN adapter and then over to the
left we have the DC power in as well as
another USB port and the audio out as we
open it up you can really see how
stylish the Sony is what we have at the
top is an 8 inch LCD screen with Sony's
X bright eco technology the screen
resolution runs at 1600 by 768 which for
a device this small is actually really
in-depth sony has an 82 key qwerty
keyboard on the unit which is absolutely
great to type on because of the wider
form factor there's a lot more space to
spread the keys out and actually make
them bigger so they're about the size of
a regular notebook in the center instead
of using the typical touchpad what we
have is a for lack of a better term
Mouse nub as well as on the bottom we
have the left click the right click and
the center click and then off to the
side we have a couple of special device
buttons which we'll show you later
so because we knew we had the hard drive
version we weren't expecting anything
really revolutionary in terms of boot up
time for the unit which is actually good
because after about a minute and a half
of waiting we were friendly greeted by a
Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit
to the internal specs we have invented a
dam 1.3 3 gigahertz processor as well as
a 60 gigabyte hard drive now there is a
couple other options there's a 64 gig
SSD and 128 gig SSD available at various
price ranges as well there is also 2
gigs of ddr2 memory this is not
expandable above the two gigs
unfortunately the device has a few
different wireless networking features
it has the B G and N wireless LAN
adapter as well as the typical Bluetooth
and it also has what's described as
integrated mobile broadband which is
basically 3G in the laptop and I believe
this is primarily used for the GPS
features of the sony vaio
so in order to
forms of the unit will open up the task
manager and sort of take a look at some
different tasks running around in
Windows
you
so overall performance in Windows wasn't
too bad
the regular tasks you know such as video
playing word processing internet
browsing all that sort of thing you
passed with flying colors but if you
want to do anything high-end you
definitely want to be looking at more of
a notebook or even the desktop then one
of the coolest little features about
this laptop is you have what's called
instant mode which sort of it bypasses
the operating system and will give you
this sort of GUI interface pre OS so you
don't have to worry about booting up and
it's incredibly quick scroll through
here you can start windows power off you
can move over and you really do a whole
bunch of things you have network
settings display language sounds system
settings just whole bunch of settings
you can view your pictures you can view
music you can go and you can even view
videos as well you have basic internet
functions such as you can browse use
Skype and instant message and so really
that's about it for the sony vaio we
have an incredibly small little device
it's lightweight its compact it has a
unique design it looks really good the
one downside is the sort of hefty $900
price tag so there we have it the sony
vaio p unboxed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
