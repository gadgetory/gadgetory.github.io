doing another YouTube contest this week
this time it's sponsored by NCI XCOM who
has given us or given you as it will
soon be an ocz vertex 60 gig SSD drive
for those who haven't had the chance to
own or use an SSD drive you're going to
be pretty blown away the hard drive and
catechol hard drive is kind of the last
frontier of the modern day system the
last thing holding performance back and
an SSD with its speed really alicia's
the full power of your pc but let's
leave that for the review how can you
win the SSD what you can see here I'm
running future marks 3dmark Vantage it's
a benchmarking sweet you've probably
seen it in our reviews and I have this
mega system in behind me here alright
how you can win the SSD you've all
played the jelly bean game right you
know you have jelly beans in a container
in a bag you guess the number of jelly
beans whoever guess is the closest
number of the correct number wins the
jelly beans how we're doing it is 3dmark
Vantage on our system you need to guess
the correct number of 3dmark vantage
points or at least the closest number
i'm going to give you details on our
test system in a second whoever guesses
the closest by November twelfth is going
to win the ocz SSD alright so tune in
for a system we are running AMD's radeon
6870 video cards in crossfire an unnamed
core i7 cpu slightly overclocked three
memory dimms and windows seven for
Vantage we are running in performance
mode at 1280 by 1024 and there are no
other custom settings changed so the
finer contest details November 12 2010
is when the contest and make sure you
get your entries in before then
international players it is open to you
so anyone from anywhere can give it a go
and the most important detail is that in
the event that there are two winners
basically two people guess the right
number or two people are the closest
then whoever guesses first is going to
be the winner so you may want to double
check and make sure that nobody else is
taking your guests before putting it
down put everything in the youtube
comments section guys have fun make sure
you get your guesses in and make sure
you check back after we draw the winner
because i'm sure there's gonna be a lot
more stuff going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
