hardware connects and welcome to an
investigation video
what are we investigating smartphones
and how well do they play out in hotter
environments now it is summer here in
Toronto more specifically today we are
expected human x-values reaching as far
as 43 so definitely a hot day and the
best way to survive these summer days is
to stay hydrated so take as much as
liquid as you can just to survive the
heat but coming back to smart phones
I really hate using devices during
hotter environments more specifically
more specifically when I'm outside
checking Twitter or from doing an email
from watching a video or just using my
device in general smart phone just warms
up especially if you're at a higher
temperature or if it's a hot day outside
so we're gonna test three phones to see
if we're gonna be experiencing any
performance issues when we're using the
device so we're gonna be running a few
benchmarks indoors do some CPU testing
or I guess a CPU temperature testing
validate or monitor CPU temperatures I'm
gonna use some apps that are available
on the Play Store let's see how that
plays out and I do it before and after
kind of comparison to see what the
differences are after we are gonna be
experiencing any throttling issues or
anything like that that'll be cool
to obviously find out so let's get into
it right after message from our sponsor
are you ready okay watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P managed by
coolermaster check it out in the
description below
alright so allow me to introduce to you
the three contenders for this
non-scientific test the first one being
the Google pixel - I've been using this
device for the past year or so so it'll
be interesting to see how this compares
with the two other smartphones that been
recently launched in 2018 our second
contender is the blackberry key - my sim
card is currently on this guy I'm just
compiling my thoughts on it I've been
using it for the past week or so so stay
tuned for my long-term review of this
device so far I mean really enjoying
this guy and our last contender is the
LG G 7 thank you or think we have three
different smartphones featuring
different specifications so the g7
features a snapdragon 845 processor it
is the latest and greatest from Qualcomm
the pixel 2 features slightly older 835
processor from Qualcomm so that's
something to keep note of and of course
we have a key - that's featuring a
slightly slower a snapdragon 616
processor so the first round of tests
involves me running Geekbench 4 on all
three devices I record this course and
of course record a CPU temperatures
using a CPU monitor app I downloaded
this directly from the Play Store I'll
make sure to link all these applications
in the description down below just for
your reference I should also mention
that I will be recording the battery
temperatures on all three devices and of
course I will be testing them both
indoors and outdoors to see if there's
any difference in that so yeah let's
just get to this
well guys I'm in my car right now I had
to read Park it from the garage it's
actually a lot cooler in my underground
parking compared to when the cars
outside it's very hot outside I can
definitely say that and the phones are
right here I have it placed on the
passenger seat definitely gonna roast
these phones but I really feel bad for
them right now because by the time I
come inside after an hour and when I
start using these I'm definitely gonna
feel the warmth because yeah I'm really
not a fan of that also I will be running
Geekbench and of course doing my
observations and taking down those
numbers while I'm outside so it'll be
interesting to see what the results are
iPhones I really feel bad for you guys
alright here we are
walked outside let's let's go back and
get some more work done it's all about
being efficient so I'm gonna be working
on a thumbnail yeah
good use of time alright guys so it has
been a little over an hour what we're
gonna do is head back to the car and of
course validate temperatures or observe
the temperatures note the temperatures
uh I'm really hesitant to go inside this
car but we have to do it for the sake of
this video so let's do this alright so
the best possible way to describe the
situation here in this car is that it
basically feels like you're inside a hot
oven I feel like the car itself is sort
of baking you I don't know if that makes
any sense but it is really hot guys I
mean I'm really curious to see what the
temperatures are like so let's check
that it right now okay so I really can't
hold one of these phone because it's
like it's burning in here I don't know
what the battery temperature is like
like been it is really toasted I feel
like I might have I feel like the CP
temperatures are like 100 C right now
because trust me it is really hot I mean
I really can't I really can't take them
back so what I'm gonna do is actually
just quickly put them in my pocket and
then head out
site somewhere else and we run the
benchmarks all right so brought out the
phones outside I'm gonna start with the
pixel two and see what the secret
temperatures I like let's see disappoint
even beyond the phone shut off huh so
that's quite interesting bone turned off
due to heat all right so I do want to
mention that the g7 did turn off during
the time when we're sitting inside the
car so obviously it's due the
overheating issue I'm pretty sure that's
the case here it doesn't say it but it
doesn't say on the actual home screen
but I did have to I did turn it on just
to get this thing up up and running so
let's let's run the test on this one
let's actually see the BlackBerry is
still on Hey look surprisingly the
BlackBerry is still on obviously have to
do take a lot of time to load you can
definitely notice yeah there's quite a
bit of lag especially when you're on
Instagram work here say for example
loading up at YouTube video or just
YouTube in general you turn on data here
for a second yeah the whole yeah it's
it's definitely laggy I can definitely
notice that performance yep animations
are very much laggy not super smooth
makes sense because the phone is
definitely definitely toasty so I'm
gonna I'm gonna run those benchmarks and
see how I how they stack up alright so
I'm back here the office after spending
about 15 to 20 minutes testing these
phones outside in this quarantine and
boy I've got to say that the results are
definitely north worthy so as you can
see just by looking at the Geekbench for
results you can definitely notice that
there is a significant decrease in terms
of performance on all three devices both
on the single core and multi-core scores
next up we're looking at internal CP
temperatures and as we can see once
again we notice a significant increase
in terms of just internal CP
temperatures and the readouts as well so
a quick example would be the Google
pixel - we saw 33 C versus 53 C in terms
of CP temperatures and of course when
you look at something like the LG G 7
the CP temperature was around 36 C come
2:45 see when we were testing it
outdoors and the same story goes for the
blackberry we didn't notice a
significant increase in the temperature
as well
same story goes for battery temps as
well the battery did warm up while it
was sitting outside and you can see that
obviously with the readouts and the
results that I'm showcasing right now
now in terms of battery percent loss
it's actually pretty minimal so with the
BlackBerry key - we started off with 78
percent battery and we obviously were
left with 76 percent before running to
keep bench for results outside so not
that significant same story goes to the
LG g7 + igoogle pixel - so you're not
going to lose a lot in terms of battery
life but the one thing that I'll
obviously admit is at the performance
just using the device in general without
running the benchmarks obviously is
pretty terrible so we can definitely
notice the lag in terms of animations we
clearly solid that with a key - but I
can say that the g7 and the pixel -
we're a little bit on the lighter side
as well I should also mention that the
phones did shut off both these phones -
LG g7 and the Google pixel - did shut
off mid time or some time in between
while that was sitting in the car and
that's obviously because it realized
that the temperatures were getting a lot
warmer so I decided to completely shut
it off whereas with the key - it was
still on I mean I was surprised by that
the internal thermal engineering that's
inside the key - is probably a little
bit better than the LG G 7 and the
Google pixel - that's what I think but
that is something to keep note of so
what did we learn from this
non-scientific experiment testing these
three phones outside on a scorching hot
day well the truth is that using smart
phones for a longer period of time
outside will definitely affect
performance and we've seen that by the
results we've seen that CPU temperatures
obviously increase significantly that
includes battery temperatures as well
and you could potentially end up with a
smartphone that just wouldn't even turn
on when it's at a relatively higher
temperatures so we've saw we've seen
that with pixel - and the LG G 7 the
phone just completely turned off in the
middle of in the middle of testing so
that is something to keep note of the
each phone has their own characteristic
of course it all comes down to thermal
engineering and of course the way how
each smartphone manufacturer has
designed to cool and then SOC that's
built inside these devices so that's
something event could differ from every
smartphone out there so as I said this
is just a general testing methodology
it's not sort of testing each individual
smartphones I'm not gonna say one phone
is better than the other it's just
pointing out the fact that using a smart
phone outside especially on a hot day
like this is it's definitely not ideal
I wouldn't definitely prefer using
something like this well I hope you
enjoyed this investigation video
definitely let me know in the comments
down below if you--if you experienced
throttling issues while using your smart
phone outside on you know and especially
during the summer I love using smart
phones during the winter though because
you know when you wake up in the morning
the cold feel that you get when you were
just you know holding the device is just
amazing but during the summer you know
it's like it's weird your your pants get
sweaty the whole yeah your screen just
gets greasy it's just not that great so
anyways love to hear your thoughts about
this experimental video and of course
the other things that I mentioned above
I'm a bar with hard-working acts make
