great technology selection and service
it seems that mini ITX cases are just
becoming shrunken versions of their
larger ATX siblings and there's no
simpler way to describe the new define
nano s which is just a mini version of
the defined s priced at 69 bucks for the
windowed version and $5 shaved for the
solid panel the pricing structure is
right in line to be competitive within
the ITX category and i say this because
the most recent release from NZXT which
also aims at an ITX form factor is the
monta which doubles the price of the
Nano s and if you guys want to see an
extensive comparison between the two
cases make sure to go ITX on that like
button now I don't need to spend much
time on outlining the exterior of the
Nano s because it's just literally a
smaller version of the defined s with a
plastic brushed front panel that still
gives off a nice shimmer without being
aluminum the side window is revealing
and all thumb screws remain with the
panel which is awesome one of which is
covered in sound dampening material
which is great to see and the same goes
for the front panel it's nice to have
these silent features built in as it
would make for one kick-ass living room
gaming PC because of what this case is
capable of in this tiny form factor here
it is next to the H 440 that I would
consider to be this average mid tower
size so you have this very good visual
comparison and how tiny the Nano s
really is removing the front panel that
is very well spaced out to allow
adequate airflow intake we find a
removable filter with a very fine mesh
covering the entire intake here a 140
member fan is included with sliding
strips for installation of dual 140 or
dual 120mm fans when an up to one 280
member radiator compatibility the IO is
at the top with dual USB 3 ports audio
jacks and PR buttons with an illuminated
ambient blue LED which is sort of that
staple for the defined series here we
also find a single module and spending
the entire top panel it is easily
removable and inside is covered with
more sound dampening foam the top of the
nano s will support dual 120 or 140
millimeter fans with support for up to a
240 millimeter radiator with mounting
holes offset closer to the side panel
for best
internal clearance and I've always liked
both fractal design has done with
radiator compatibility but removing that
Maji vent cover means exposing the top
of the case to dust and I wish that an
optional dust filter would have been
included which it is not speaking of
filters though spending the entire floor
of the Nano s is a giant filter that is
so conveniently removable and accessible
from the front now you could ask why an
ITX enclosure has to be this large well
because the target audience for this
type of case are people who would want
to water cool and just want to have a
pleasant experience building inside an
ITX case where the priority is not to
create the most space efficient and tiny
and compact layout but instead to give
the best cable management hardware
support and the most effective airflow
possible for an ITX in this sort of
comfortable to work format so here the
interior is fully open direct airflow
delivery we have a single bracket on the
floor that can be used to mount a pump
for custom water cooling or mount a hard
drive or an SSD it is also on a rail
system which can be moved to accommodate
for proper clearance for your power
supply with recommendation of units of
up to 180 millimeters for comfortable
cable routing however this bracket can
also be vertically installed which is
pretty cool now because of that front
fan the hard drive is almost spilling
over onto the rubber grommets so if for
any reason you need that space near the
rubber grommets cleared moving the fan
in the bottom slot allows the drive
bracket to be installed all the way up
and to the front of the case well away
from the rubber grommets which is
totally cleared but now you sacrifice
the top fan slot at the front because
there is now no clearance also with the
hard drive in this position mounting a
120mm fan at the top may
you kinda have to press the fan into the
hard drive in order to align the fan
holes properly so just be mindful of
what this means to utilize this bracket
for vertical installation but moving to
the back this is where all the native
storage options are located where the
dual SSD bracket behind the motherboard
and an additional bracket beside there
for a three and a half or a two and a
half inch drive they are easily
accessible and secured with a single
thumb screw and there's no better
implementation for such a tight space so
well done fractal they also include a
dual fan splitter because they
understand the lack of fan headers on
ITX motherboards and the fact that this
case does not have a fan hub and we have
these two brackets as well that can be
utilized for reservoir installation on
the vertical strips on the side of the
motherboard so this leads us to the
finished build which took me about 30
minutes to complete and I am very happy
with the results I love that we have two
large rubber grommets that are available
at the top is our ITX board has the
worst kind of 8 and 24 pin connections
but the Nano s accommodates for that
beautifully leaving the sides rubber
grommet totally underutilized despite
not having a power supply shroud that
helps to minimize time spent on cable
management
I just routed all the excess cables to
the back and the interior looks very
clean this is one of the easiest ITX
systems that I had to assemble that
turned out to look this good the GPU is
very close to the power supply but it's
such a small volume that with the front
intake and its own cooling it will avoid
the GPU choking for air so no worries
there and this is what the back of the
case looks like which in my books is
fine and dandy job for just under 30
minutes of total system assembly I love
that we have this nice pocket right
below the hard drive and space to talk
any loose cables all around I still
would have liked to see more cable tie
points despite having velcro straps and
those key areas but overall it's a
fantastic cable management inside this
case and so in conclusion the Nano s is
a great ITX
option with a good price if you fancy
water cooling in this
form-factor it's well equipped to handle
appropriate hardware there's never
really anything at fault with a defined
series and it's always suitable for one
build or another but one key element
that always stood out to me as an issue
is the top ma juventus system now I love
that it can deliver a more silent PC
with it on but removing it lends itself
to dust accumulation as it will
percolate through when the system is off
we need to see a hybrid top cover to
solve for that one complaint but other
than that this is one damn good case
people and I would highly recommend it
for an ITX system it's got an enjoyable
experience throughout in this typical
fractal design fashion so guys that
concludes our review of the define nano
s and as I said earlier if you'd want to
see a comparison between the Nano s and
the new NZXT monta which is also an ITX
case let us know in the comments down
below because we could do temperature
testings acoustics the user assembly the
user disassembly and just basically do a
full-on user experience in which case is
you know exceeds in which category but
that is it for this video thank you so
