knocks and welcome back to another
review
cool master recently released the half
stacker the latest addition to the high
airflow series the concept is very
simple and surprisingly functional for
many purposes but it's the execution in
design process that could potentially
render it useless so let's check out
this cool master half stacker 935 which
incorporates the mid Tower 925 for the
main chassis and an attachable smaller
chassis the 9:15 R that carries a few
tricks up its sleeve as well this combo
will set you back $170 which is very
comparable to pricing of full towers the
actual process of stacking is very
simple Coolermaster has designed the
rail system that works really well you
basically align the bottom rails of one
chassis with the top of the other and
there you have it a couple of screws on
each side will secure the stack and the
whole assembly seems pretty solid the
main tower portion comes with removable
case feet that allows easy swap between
chassis the smaller portion here comes
with the top cover that must be removed
if you want to stack anything on top and
it also features a built-in dust filter
that is always appreciated
now you can either go with the default
configuration with a smaller chassis on
top or swap the set for a different
configuration the bottom of the mid
tower features a removable dust filter
plus two large rubber grommets which
would be useful for this type of setup
while the smaller portion has a few
cutouts as well and the large opening
with the rubber grommet again would be
useful to pass cables or water cooling
tubes between chambers now this is very
much a cooler master chassis with rigid
corners and even the window sticks out
which i think looks really good
especially because it is tinted at the
front we have three plus one optical
drive base plus all the connections
including power button audio jacks and
four USB ports two of which are USB 3
now notice the 915 hour doesn't have any
connectors at the front that's because
it's all really intended to be used on
its own but in conjunction with another
stacker
taking a look at the back we have a
bottom mounted power supply 8 plus 1 PCI
expansion slots and an exam
last fan and a smaller 915 are stacker
at the top includes a mini ITX slot with
2 PCI Express slots and a top mounted
power supply and taking off all the side
panels starting from the top we have a
single optical slot a drive cage for
three drives to list mounting for three
additional optical drives and another
drive gauge that is fully modular so you
can remove both and install in the top
chamber for better front intake or water
cooling capabilities now what I really
like on all of the new cooler master
cases are the drive caddies they are
sturdy and feature this widening a
mechanism for installation of mechanical
drives this way you don't need to bend
anything for assembly and it's also SSD
ready the front panel is easily
removable and features a built in dust
filter behind which we can install dual
120 millimeter fans or a single 140
millimeter on the inside the drive cage
platform is removable to make room for
radiator but I was disappointed to not
see any optional mounts for the platform
which does limit your setup also another
thing I noticed when the rather small
ventilation cutout for the power supply
but it is dust proof so that leaves me
happy the front panel on the 915 R is
also removable with a built-in dust
filter and features a very tiny 80
millimeter intake fan that is very much
blocked by the cage behind the frame so
don't be expecting much air delivery
there and checking out at the back a
very common feature these days is an
extra SSD mount behind the motherboard
tray very good utilization of the space
plus large rubber grommets for all the
cables and quite limiting space with not
even an inch for all your cable work now
it's the top portion of the stacker
that's the most interesting so let's see
exactly what we can do with it and we
get a large grommet opening leading into
the next chassis that will be useful for
water cooling tubing but maybe also
cables as the optional power supply
mount installs right above the power
supply is only held by four screws in
the back so it's not the most stable
mount which may be concerning
but installing the second drive cage in
there and we have plenty of room for
cables so that's not really an issue we
also get a rear i/o cover if you decide
to not install a second system
there and this is one of the options you
can actually go with that basically
allows you to install a mini ITX system
above your main system obviously this is
not ideal because of the limited GPU
space availability due to that drive
cage which if removed allows long GPU
compatibility but also CPU coolers will
be limited to extremely low profile due
to the power supply and while installing
a system at the top is an option it is
still not recommended because well first
you don't have dedicated power switch
for the system on top and the 90 15 R is
really intended to be used either for
extra storage or for water cooling and
this is where the side panels really
come and play as they can house triple
120 or dual 140 millimeter fans with a
removable dust filter meaning you can
install two three sixty millimeter rats
for your build
and tubing would be passed down through
this cut out into the bottom chamber and
because the width of the chassis is
around 225 millimeters
this means portion pool on both side
panels shouldn't be an issue and looking
at our setup here if you decide to go
with a 240 movement of RAD you still
have a drive cage that could be utilized
the only hiccup I could see is routing
all the SATA cables from the bottom of
the build that might become a little
challenging but we do have a few cutouts
for that exact purpose so you'll still
be able to wire everything just fine and
finally starting with the build putting
in our motherboard and getting down with
cable management it really is a piece of
cake the top chamber leaves much to be
desired for water cooling enthusiasts
who want to go to the extreme path and
it's exactly what the stacker is
designed to do the internals clean up
well bust the rear despite a relatively
small distance to the panel it's pretty
straightforward to work with and I'm
going to conclude by stating that the
concept is certainly innovative with the
ability to stack one on top of the other
has the benefits of user specific
configurations with a very simple
stacking module this means two very
different uses either for water cooling
or extra dry storage or even a system
and I like them the chassis is
expandable vertically as cube cases are
still quite awkward
placement the overall build quality
despite all the plastics is robust and
the tinted window is seriously awesome
however while the top portion has its
functions it's not utilized for its full
potential
for example the Mini ITX motherboard
mount is quite useless since we don't
have any dedicated power buttons plus
the power supply mount above will
seriously limit your CPU cooler to
something extremely low-profile the 80
millimeter front intake fan is placed
right against the drive cage wall that
will limit air flow delivery and giving
this as part of the half series the
entire airflow seems to be a little
disappointing but I am glad coolermaster
is heading into this direction with such
a user flexibility and that is one thing
that the stacker 935 does really well
and we're giving it the Harwick Knox dam
innovative award now coolermaster has
also released a second version of the
smaller chassis and the 915 F head on
over to that video to see what the
differences are and how extreme you can
take the stacker now we'd like to hear
your thoughts on the stacker concept and
do you think this will get picked up I
certainly hope we'll see something
similar from the competition in the near
future well thanks for watching guys and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
