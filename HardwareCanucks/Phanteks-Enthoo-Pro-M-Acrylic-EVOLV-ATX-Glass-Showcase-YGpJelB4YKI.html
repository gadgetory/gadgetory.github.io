possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex and NCIX
without them we wouldn't be here fantex
is really going to kick butt in 2016 we
have received so many requests to check
out their new revisions of the n2 Pro M
with the acrylic window and well here it
is but they also surprised us with the
tempered glass version of the evolved
ATX which is on the right and it looks
absolutely stunning but starting with
the m2 Pro M acrylic Edition it looks
absolutely gorgeous as well the cool
thing about the side panels there will
be both acrylic so you'll need to take
out your cable management skills to the
next level to take advantage of this
whole full transparency fantex is also
taken into account the non-filtered
ventilation on the front panel and they
will be updated and filtration will be
installed to make everyone happy the
evolved ATX looked even more gorgeous
with the tempered glass that will also
be on both sides and you can see the
full transparency effect when it comes
to a new side panel a few things to keep
in mind with these panels is they are
not compatible with the previous
versions of the case as the mounting
method is different and thus for those
wanting to upgrade will need to purchase
the new case separately here at CES they
also unveiled their new upcoming line
the Eclipse with the launch of the P 400
and the P 400 deaths they will be
available in three color options black
white and grey and they all have metal
exterior and solid build quality on the
interior and you can check out our full
preview of it with a link below the
design language is pretty simple but
leaves room for expansion into something
a bit more complicated to maintain that
familiar look and feel of the Eclipse
line and at 69 and $79 price points we
think that P 400 will be a really hot
budget enclosure looking inside the
power supply chamber is totally enclosed
with an open interior layout that's both
friendly for front radiator installation
and optimization for the airflow the
silent Edition we'll have these
removable sound dampening panels at the
top that will be color coded based on
the color of the case as well so they
will not just be black and we also have
dust filters included with the silent
edition in case you'd want to opt
and for the extra airflow at the top
this is an awesome inclusion plus the
silent Edition will feature a 3-speed
fan controller for the front io so
that's where the extra ten dollars come
into play your fan controller and the
white finish on the silent Edition is
actually a bit more expensive overall we
are very happy with the direction fantex
has taken with the Eclipse line and if
you don't see a more in-depth video on
the p400 check it out in the description
