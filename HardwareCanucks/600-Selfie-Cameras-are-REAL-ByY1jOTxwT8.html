you're in the market for the best
mirrorless selfie camera look no further
than the x3 this is fuji films successor
to the very popular ex a tumulus camera
and it comes with a few new upgrades
let's get the specs out of the way it
sports a 24 megapixel aps-c CMOS sensor
with an ISO sensitivity of up to 25,000
600 do not that this is an X mount
system so you are limited to mounting
Fuji lenses but this camera will come
bundled with the xc60 250 millimeter F
3.5 to 5.6 with optical image
stabilization which is perfect and it
also comes in three colors silver brown
or pink which is what I have here
personally I think they could have
expanded the options a little bit more
but considering the price is $600 USD
it's a good package the main selling
point of this camera is that three inch
touchscreen LCD screen that flips all
the way up but what's really interesting
here is that when you complete tilting
the screen there is an extra step to
slide it out a tiny bit and that should
let you compose better shots this will
also switch the camera to selfie mode
which enhances eye detection and stays
focused the grip has also been optimized
for selfies and I certainly enjoyed
holding it in one hand and the body
wasn't too heavy as well this my friends
is taking selfies to the next level
there are also different modes built
into the camera specifically for
low-light situations
landscape sports macro photography with
specific filters sharing them digitally
is also super convenient thanks to the
built-in Wi-Fi capability that allows
you to remotely control transfer photos
to your smartphones and even print
directly into the Instax share printer
on the video side of things it's nothing
too surprising the sensor shoots 1080p
video of up to 60 frames per second with
a time limit of 14 minutes think of it
as a replacement for an existing entry
level DSLR because mirrorless cameras
are slowly starting to gain momentum and
the sensors are getting a lot better
plus imagine getting DSLR features on a
significantly lighter body incredible in
my opinion shortly after the
presentation we were taken on a rickshaw
ride which was my first experience and I
enjoyed it quite a bit they took us to
Fuji films grand opening of the
next photo studio the stores primary
goal is to recreate photo sharing
experiences that cherish our precious
moments this includes specializing in
processing and printing traditional 35
millimeter and 120 color black-and-white
and the older odd sized negatives which
is super awesome and you love it
especially if you're an old school
photographer there's also the option to
process and print digital files from any
source of media whether that's your
smartphone SD card CD ROMs etc using the
in-store kiosks if you live in Toronto
you should definitely stop by the new
annex photo studio but that about wraps
up our coverage on the new xa3
selfie mirrorless camera or you could
call it the best selfie merliss camera
as well as the studio i mean bird with
hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
