hello everyone this is Dmitry with Hydra
canucks
and on the review table today is an EVGA
gtx 950 FTW or for the win edition
invidious latest release is the gtx 950
that aims to bridge the performance in
the price gap between the gtx 960 and
the 750 Ti this is that sub $200 GPU
that we've been waiting for loaded with
all the latest Nvidia features and
promises quite a substantial performance
improvements for owners of that 650
series and here's the technical rundown
of the current value stack of Nvidia
cards the gtx 950 is a cut-down 960 with
lower clocks
25% less square cores and texture units
still with 2 gigabytes of RAM and the
reduced TDP of 90 watts the reference
950 is launched at $159 which fits
perfectly between the 960 and the 750 Ti
but with vork partners coming in with
their custom coolers and factory or
clocks that price ceiling extends all
the way to $179 which is the price of
this EVGA for the win condition and
knowing what Maxwell architecture is
capable of in form of ORAC walking's we
are surprised to see this EVGA card
clock 179 megahertz higher on the base
clock than reference and the whopping
217 megahertz increase on the boost
clock in terms of the card itself
nothing has changed and how EVGA handles
their a CX 2.0 current design triple
heat pipe layout with a wide aluminum
Finnair a dual fans that shut off
completely when idle and the AC x2
pronoun cooler is not only super quiet
as you can see from the graph here but
also effective at keeping the GPU at 68
degrees Celsius during load the plastic
shroud is simple the card is just over
10 inches or 26 centimeters there's an
SLI finger for two-way SLI and check
this out a back leg is included on this
budget GPU with plenty of perforation on
it and properly oriented text for
the card is installed inside the case
but keep in mind only the FTW edition
comes with a backplate EVGA super-super
clocked super clock plus and
superclocked come with no backplate or
it is optional
the FTW Edition also comes with a dual
BIOS which for those enthusiasts who
want to tinker with various overclock
settings the IO includes triple
DisplayPort 1.2 DVI and HDMI 2.0 and
seeing how well this card is suited for
HTTP sees we think that Nvidia missed an
opportunity here by not enabling hdcp
2.2 support for protected 4k content
over HDMI for your UHD TV the reference
950 requires a sixpence for power while
EVGA has equipped this FTW card with a
single 8 pin and due to a pretty high
factory overclock already system power
consumption is actually almost in line
with the reference 960 now before we get
into gaming performance let's analyze
the competition aim DS current $149 card
as the r7 370 with aging three year old
architecture but with 4 gigabytes of
video memory so let's see what the new
950 with the highest factory overclock
that EDG offers is capable of
and so as you see the gtx 950 FTW is
getting really close to a reference 960
and is ahead of the r7 370 in pretty
much all the games here except for two
hitman absolution and Middle Earth
shadow of Mordor which is likely thanks
to that extra video memory and based on
these numbers it is clear that the GTX
950 will be a popular GPU for budget
builds but it is also important to
remember that the car tested in this
review is factory overclocked and thus
carries a heavier price tag than
reference and represents the best of the
best of what will be offered by four
partners we were able to push the
overclocked even higher to a stable 1612
megahertz on the core that lends itself
right in line with the reference 960 and
so what do you guys think of the price
range for the new gtx 950 cards do you
feel the $159 spot is a large departure
from the 129 dollar release of the 650
Ti there are certainly massive
performance benefits as you saw but it's
just a matter of gamers upping their
budget for the GPU so are you prepared
for that or not leave your thoughts in
the comments below
and that concludes our review of the
EVGA gtx 950 for the win make sure to

reviews in the pipeline thanks so much
