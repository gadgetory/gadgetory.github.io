everyone this is Dimitri with hurricane
accent on the review table today we've
got a pair of biodynamic headphones as a
brand I would say they're on the same
level as son Heiser and sure with that
unique and familiar biodynamic form
factor with their unique sound signature
as well and make sure to stick around
till the end of the video for a little
bit of a surprise
the dt9 90s come with different
impedance factors the one we're
reviewing today are the 250 ohms but
they're also available in 32 for more
values and 600 ohms for those extreme
high-end audio systems retailing for
just over three hundred dollars now if
you are looking for that next level
upgrade over your standard gaming
headset or headphone that price bracket
this sort of a comfortable zone to
strive towards as most enthusiast level
headphones in that range provide the
best value for the sound and longevity
the dt9 90s are packed well inside this
leather like pouch that has a handle and
inside nothing but the headphones and so
much padding for travel preservation and
if you're looking for creative ways to
utilize it safe storage for your lenses
have done deal
the headphone form is typical biodynamic
with the aluminum support on each side
that houses the ear cups plus the
headphone is super flexible yet feels
durable and size adjustable with the ear
cups extending into the headband notice
the exposed cables on each side now this
should cause no alarm as this is just
the style but it's good to be mindful
that it is there so just be careful the
headband is plenty thick and it's also
leather I've never had any issues with
overhead pressure thanks to the
extremely light weight of the headphone
now the ear cups are the most
interesting part of the design on the
exterior we have this grill like design
with the model number engraved it's not
flashy in any way but it still helps for
easier distinction this grille design
covers the interior driver so the dt9
90s are semi open in the sense that the
dry
isn't totally exposed but this semi-open
distinction practically means an open
design with plenty of noise leaking and
there's absolutely no sound isolation
this is expected and I personally always
gravitate towards open style headphones
for any type of listening well except
when I'm editing the cable is not
removable that's one thing to be aware
of plus it's super long and three meters
so good luck handling it if you use it
at the desk like I do it connects
through a quarter of an inch adapter
that is detachable the large and super
soft ear cushions are made of microfiber
and it is the most comfortable headphone
that I've worn seriously in the comfort
department dt 990 surpass my daily used
HD 650s from San Heiser their circular
shape form and even seal around the ear
causing no concentration of pressure at
any specific point and it could easily
pass through an all-nighter session of
gaming or some movie marathons they even
look pretty sweet when worn not too
bulky fairly low profile and absolutely
no problem for those with glasses the
deep ear cushions seem to compensate
very well for that now as for sound
quality the dt9 IDs are known to be very
picky about the amp you drive them
through with my limited selection at the
moment I use the d3 DAC for my flak
library and as expected we are greeted
with a signature biodynamic sound
compared to my HD 650s the highs are
more crisp if you're not a fan of that
edgy extension and prefer something with
a more of a roll-off perhaps consider
the Sunrisers but I love that brighter
presentation on the bar dynamic it's
revealing of the environment and perhaps
you'll discover something that hasn't
been audible to you before
since the clamping force is very relaxed
the bass is also relaxed it's present
but it's full and it's tight and I'm
surprised at how well it's actually
presented here given it is an open
design the soundstage is very large this
is an amazing pair for gaming it has
replaced my HD 650 s in that regard now
for the music there's a good sense of
the recording environment with the
mid-range being pushed back so the
vocalists sound
a bit distant compared to the HT 650s
and overall not as full or warm so the
sound signature is very specific it
could be fatiguing for sensitive ears
and for very treble heavy music it's not
ideal you might need to turn down the
volume or even tweak the EQ and you have
to suit your own preference but I found
them perfect for uplifting trance and
progressive house the entire Dark Side
of the Moon album was wonderful with
outstanding detail and they also proved
extremely satisfactory for hip-hop with
sharp hitting vocals and those bass jobs
now the main points of praise here we
have to go to build quality this is an
insanely comfortable pair the impedance
options are great for multi audio
scenarios I love the bright a treble
extension and relaxed but tight bass and
that's what the bar dynamic are known
for sound stage is open and this is my
new headphone for gaming but just
switching between the HD 650 s and the
DT 90 s the mid-range is recessed the
overall sound environment was deeper
that some people might not favor but if
you are exploring your options and
prefer that sharp and detailed sound
signature we would certainly recommend
you look into the DT 990 line so I hope
you guys enjoyed that review now to the
