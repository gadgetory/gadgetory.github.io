Samsung's included a task manager which
is great we really like the ability to
close individual applications we can
close all of the applications at once
with the eggs at all button we also have
the ability to clear our RAM which you
can see here closed 15 applications and
when we return to the home screen you'll
see it takes a couple of seconds to pop
up as it restarts only those necessary
applications the capacitive buttons
along the bottom edge aren't engaged by
the touch of the s-pen but we can swipe
from the bottom of the screen to the top
to bring up the menu the same way as if
we push the button with our finger let's
now take a quick look at some of the
applications that come with the Samsung
Galaxy Note at the top of the list we
have the All Share programme calculator
and clock as well as the contacts know
everything within the OS is really fast
and responsive as we can see here firing
through contacts if we go back to the
list we have crayon physics which is
included for drawing with crayons as
well as the built-in Internet
application now this is a bit of a
contention with us because as you see we
open it up and it complete asks us to
use which application we want because we
had Firefox set as the default it asks
us a second time as well then when we go
to search it will actually open up
Firefox to complete the search instead
of using the Internet application there
were times when we wish we could have
just used the built-in Internet
application heading back to the
applications we see the mini diary as
well as a music player now music pops up
extremely quickly again we can fighter
through their music list which have our
entire atmosphere discography in there
and then back to the programs list
without uh any hesitations in the OS
some Samsung is also included a file
manager called my files that allows us
to go through the entire file system of
the Galaxy Note and if we go to open a
photo here it'll ask us what we want to
use Pixlr Matic or gallery or any other
camera programs that we have installed
you can also see that more swiping from
the right to the left to go back to
screens just as the back button would
the phone application opens quickly and
closes just as quickly for easy access
as well as all of the applications we
can also see here the Google Play Store
as well as Polaris Office and then the
group of s mammal programs s choice S
Memo and
planner and that does it for the
applications back on the home screen
we'll have a quick look at Firefox
browser and just show that you can see
entire webpages and it doesn't actually
bring up mobile sites you can just go to
the full size web pages here we've gone
to hardware connects we also get this
strange message at the bottom of the pit
screen asking us to upgrade to a full
version of a previous app which happened
once in a while but click on a link the
other websites responsive even on a full
site and when you open up an image it'll
open up a jQuery image to bring it
full-size so again we've got a full
browser here in Firefox and on the large
screen is very useful flipping through
the OS you can go from panel to panel
everything's quick and responsive let's
now take a quick screenshot using the
s-pen by holding down the button and
pressing on the screen as you see here I
miss the button the first time but once
we have it the screenshot gets taken and
then it opens up gallery immediately for
us to annotate or adjust the screenshot
or crop it or do any number of things
here with the program this is the sort
of built in aspect of the galaxy note
that we really like and we really
appreciate it we found it very useful to
be able to take a quick screenshot and
then share it or print it with Samsung
printers in the share it menu we have
every option available from Dropbox
which we used a lot as well as sending
it with email or messenger we found
Dropbox the most useful you simply take
a screenshot open up the share it click
on upload and it goes into our Dropbox
folder but we also used a tweet deck or
the social hub a lot just to send a
quick tweet with the photo it attaches
it uploads it to Twitpic automatically
the last program we're going to take a
look at here is the gallery or the photo
editor application we just had a quick
photo of our setup as we're videotaping
here we just want to show some of the
features that the photo editor has now
we have a full list of saturation
contrast a cool vintage effect that
everybody seems to like so much but you
can also adjust the color temperature
now even though they got it wrong and if
you go up it gives cooler and if you go
down it becomes warmer the fact of the
matter is it's almost like a raw image
where you can adjust the
aperture of every image you take we also
have the lasso tool here that you can
see we're using to cut out the camera
you can cut out a square box to crop an
image or simply cut that part of an
image out and then bring up the Tools
menu select the pen and then write a
quick annotation if you want to isolate
something the best part of the photo
editor is the fact that we can edit this
photo and then write anything we want on
it do any of the changes that we want
but then you can share it with another
editor program such as Pixlr Matic make
your changes apply an effect and then
send it off as we normally would
this makes the photo editor program
extremely versatile we found</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
