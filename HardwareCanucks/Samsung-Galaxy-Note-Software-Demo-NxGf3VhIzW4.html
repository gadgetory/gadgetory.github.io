Samsung's included a task manager which
is great we really like the ability to
close individual applications we can
close all of the applications at once
with the eggs at all button we also have
the ability to clear our RAM which you
can see here closed 15 applications and
when we return to the home screen you'll
see it takes a couple of seconds to pop
up as it restarts only those necessary
applications the capacitive buttons
along the bottom edge aren't engaged by
the touch of the s-pen but we can swipe
from the bottom of the screen to the top
to bring up the menu the same way as if
we push the button with our finger let's
now take a quick look at some of the
applications that come with a samsung
galaxy note at the top of the list we
have the all-share program calculator
and clock as well as the contacts now
everything within the OS is really fast
and responsive as we can see here firing
through contacts if we go back to the
list we have crayon physics which is
included for drawing with crayons as
well as the built-in internet
application now this is a bit of a
contention with us because as you see we
open it up and it complete asks us to
use which application we want because we
had Firefox set as the default it asks
us a second time as well then when we go
to search it will actually open up
Firefox to complete the search instead
of using the internet application there
were times when we wish we could have
just used the inbuilt in Internet
application heading back to the
applications we see the mini diary as
well as a music player now music pops up
extremely quickly again we can fighter
through their music list which had our
entire atmosphere discography in there
and then back to the program's list
without a any hesitations in the OS some
Samsung is also included a file manager
called my files that allows us to go
through the entire file system of the
galaxy note if we go to open a photo
here it'll ask us what we want to use
pixel aromatic or gallery or any other
camera programs that we had installed
you can also see that more swiping from
the right to the left to go back to
screens just as the back button would
the phone application opens quickly and
closes just as quickly for easy access
as well as all of the applications we
can also see here the google play store
as well as Polaris Office and then the
group of s mammal programs as choice S
Memo and s planner and that does it for
the applications back on the home screen
we'll have a quick look at Firefox
browser and just show that you can see
entire web pages and it doesn't actually
bring up mobile sites you can just go to
the full size web pages here we've gone
to Hardware connects we also get this
strange message at the bottom of the pit
screen asking us to upgrade to a full
version of a previous app which happen
once in a while but click on a link the
websites responsive even on a full site
when you open up an image it'll open up
a jQuery image to bring it full size so
again we've got a full browser here in
Firefox and on the large screen is very
useful flipping through the OS you can
go from panel to panel everything's
quick and responsive let's now take a
quick screenshot using the s-pen by
holding down the button and pressing on
the screen as you see here i miss the
button the first time but once we have
it the screenshot gets taken and then it
opens up gallery immediately for us to
annotate or adjust the screenshot or
crop it or do any number of things here
with the program this is the sort of
built-in aspect of the galaxy note that
we really like and we really appreciate
we found it very useful to be able to
take a quick screenshot and then share
it or print it with Samsung printers in
the share it menu we have every option
available from Dropbox which we used a
lot as well as sending it with email or
messenger we found Dropbox the most
useful you simply take a screenshot open
up the share it click on upload and it
goes into our dropbox folder but we also
used a tweet deck or the social hub a
lot just to send a quick tweet with the
photo it attaches it uploads it to
twitpic automatically the last program
we're going to take a look at here is
the gallery or the photo edit or
application we just had a quick photo of
our setup is we're videotaping here we
just want to show some of the features
that the photo editor has now we have a
full list of saturation contrast a cool
vintage effect that everybody seems to
like so much but you can also adjust the
color temperature now even though they
got it wrong and if you go up at games
cooler and if you go down it becomes
warmer the fact of the matter is it's
almost like a
image where you can adjust the
temperature of every image you take we
also have the lasso tool here that you
can see we're using to cut out the
camera you can cut out a square box to
crop an image or simply cut that part of
an image out and then bring up the Tools
menu select the pen and then write a
quick annotation if you want to isolate
something the best part of the photo
editor is the fact that we can edit this
photo and then write anything we want on
it do any of the changes that we want
but then you can share it with another
editor program such as Pixlr Matic make
your changes apply an effect and then
send it off as we normally would this
makes the photo editor program extremely
versatile we found</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
