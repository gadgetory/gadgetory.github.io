an absolutely unique product the HP omen
mindframe the naming scheme is awesome
the package is good although there
absolutely no accessories you just get
the headset itself and I feel like this
is HP's way of experimenting with the
market to see if this whole cooling
situation will stick so the concept here
is that we have thermal electrical
coolers inside each ear cup there for
cooling your ears so if your ears get
warm if you're in a really warm
environment then HP is trying to tackle
that with actively cooling your ears so
you can wear this headset and not get
any heat accumulation and as a concept
and idea it's pretty awesome while also
kind of like flying by in that gimmicky
territory I am excited to see if this
will stick in the gaming sphere or it
will be simply swept aside as too
gimmicky so let's review right - this
evolved with the times
consider nvme storage today the new RC
100 brings affordable nvme storage into
your hands with various capacities in
this super compact form factor that
plugs directly into your motherboard
it's extremely powerful and utilizes the
Sheba's advanced 3d flash memory for
awesome speeds so you can be a happy
user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme
drive to consider check it out below
alright guys so for the past two weeks
I've been using this headset and tried
to get into the mindset of HP trying to
understand exactly why this exists so
it's a pretty standard gaming headset
for $200 very expensive Auto does go on
sale quite often for 150 still quite
expensive for that sale price anyway in
terms of build quality it's fairly
plastic it does creak a little bit when
the ear cups are moving it has this self
adjusting headband up top it is kind of
like a pleather material so it should
fit larger head sizes and accommodate
smaller head sizes as well I am
concerned about the red exposed cable on
each side it is slightly bent already
and I'm not sure about its longevity but
like I said I feel like this is HP's way
of experimenting with the market and not
necessarily you know being super proud
of this headset I find them pretty
comfortable but they are extremely heavy
at 475 grams compared to much lighter
designs like the GSP 500 which is still
a pretty bulky design but much lighter
358 grams and my favorite pair of all
for gaming and editing the HD 5 at X at
260 grams we have a volume dial on the
right ear cup nicely accessible the ear
cushions are pretty deep not irritating
pretty comfortable but they're not
removable and of course RGB lining on
the sides but you know it's tasteful
nice ambient illumination of course it
wouldn't be a gaming headset without it
the microphone is muted when in the
upright position you can see the red LED
it is pretty flexible but in terms of
sound quality it is just okay so this is
what the microphone sounds like it's a
little bit disappointing so there's a
lot of noise in the background in terms
of the vocal compression it's kind of
nasally it's not too detailed and
overall a little bit of disappointment
and also when you mute the microphone
there's a beep that also mutes the audio
incoming so it's quite annoying if you
have to mute it up you will lose your
audio for a brief second this is the GSP
500 the headset that there's over $200
but you can hear the difference in terms
of audio quality for the microphone and
the vocals just a lot more body and
richer sound so yeah and the headset is
connected via USB with a braided cable
that doesn't kink easy and also doesn't
pass too much cabling noise when it's
brushing against the shirt into the ear
cup which is great and so the whole
point of this headset is the cooling on
the interior of what HP cost frost cap
it's their branding terms for a thermal
electrical cooler which means there are
two semiconductor layers so when voltage
passes through one of them it carries
the heat away from one to the other and
so that's what we have here we have a
cooler side on the interior and the
warmer heatsink type on the exterior
inside the RGB elimination and it
actually works in terms of cooling so I
can put my fingers over here and feel
like I'm touching really cold metal and
that's pretty incredible so a few ears
do you know sweat that is a really good
mitigation strategy and you can also
adjust the low to medium to high
settings in the software which is pretty
good and based on our flurry
the maximum temperature or the minimum
temperature we can achieve at maximum
cooling setting is about 12 degrees
Celsius and that is really cool in terms
of the feature set and also the
temperature and so for the first time I
put these on I had the cooling capacity
on high setting and I could feel the
cold being radiated from the drive walls
onto my ears you know literally cooling
whatever was inside the ear cup and that
is exactly what this headset is intended
to do but multiple things to consider my
ears are actually more sensitive to cold
so I couldn't keep them on for a long
time because my ears got like too cold I
had to take them off right now it's like
fall so I'll not necessarily need it and
number two if your ears are potentially
slightly larger or like stick out a bit
more you might run into risk of making
contact with that wall which is what
Ebor experienced and therefore it could
be an extremely unpleasant experience of
physically feeling that cold wall which
is 12 degrees Celsius and therefore just
not having a good time at all and the
side effect is that warm plate on the
exterior which is basically the heating
that takes away the heat from the
internal plate and it's kind of strange
handling a headset that is warm on the
outside but extremely cool inside the
ear cups and HP warns that there might
be condensation forming on the interior
depending on the ambient temperature and
this whole cooling thing works like it
should it's not a gimmick we have
literally cooler inside the ear cup that
passes on you know you can feel the
cooling kind of like radiating from that
a little bit on plate and it would it
should cool your ears no problem I don't
need them because I have headphones that
are open back and therefore never have
any heat concentration and for even
headsets that are totally closed back
you might have some concentration of
heat where the leather makes contact
with your skin but my ears are never in
that zone where like they they sweat on
the exterior on the inside so for me
this whole thing makes absolutely no
sense but let me know if this is
something that you might actually find
useful and now the reason why I think
this is
fermentation product is because the
driver software is so basic first it
takes forever to load and we only have
the RGB selection and the cooling
selection um of those three profiles and
absolutely nothing about the sound and
it's weird because this is a USB headset
it also has the surround sound enabled
by default
normally for USB headsets you'd have
stereo mode and some form of EQ profile
customization and then surround sound
toggle but this one has neither and
weirdly when you go into device
properties enable the Windows sonic for
headphones it makes absolutely no
difference to the sound signature of
this headset so you kind of locked in to
what HP wants you to hear and you know I
actually don't mind the sound signature
profile of this headset it's very
crystal clear lots of detail not harsh
trouble either the bass is kind of like
it's deep but it could have a slightly
deeper impact the mid-range is clear
it's like you know it's like the open
but not too Airy so like I actually like
the sound signature of this but the
issue is having absolutely no
customization and that is strange for a
USB headset for example I recently
started playing escape from tarkov a
game where you have to absolutely listen
to everything that's happening in your
environment listen to footsteps where
they're coming from the actual profile
of where those footsteps are coming from
in terms of ID stepping on glass wood or
metal and I had absolutely no issues
detecting all those elements in my
surround environment and
mindframe but of course for $200 price
point you'd expect more like slightly
deeper bass that is a little bit more
controlled and not too open and of
course all those you profile so you can
tone down the treble if you find it too
harsh and you know do all types of
customization that we're so used to now
I'm going to let Eva chime in on this
conversation so you can get an opinion
from both me and him Eber take it away
design and build quality it's a complete
disappointment especially for a $200
headset I wasn't expecting a plastic
frame that actually creaks which is
really unfortunate I have big ears so as
soon as that where these headset they do
get in contact with the drivers inside
and as soon as I crank up the cooling to
max setting which is the only way to
control through the driver software
there are no hardware buttons on this
headset which is kind of unfortunate it
gets really cold it almost gets to a
point where it's almost you feeling
you're you're touching like an aluminum
surface first thing in the morning
that's it's that cold alright guys so
that is the omen mind frame a super cool
name for a product by the way that has
like kind of a gimmicky feature but that
actually works in cooling your ears and
the only drawbacks are the rest of the
headset you know in terms of build
quality it's extremely heavy it's kind
of plasticy so I'm guessing a lot of
that weight is with that thermal
electrical cooler that's stuck inside
the ear cups sound quality is actually
pretty good the microphone for a USB
headset is fine as well but the price is
not competitive but of course I'm
guessing there is that price premium
because of that Tec built in to cool
your ears this is not something I would
recommend but I'm guessing for a really
hot environment where you do get that
heat concentration stuck that cooling
the active cooling would definitely
prevent any heat concentration which is
awesome but also you have to think about
the actual headset design because going
with open-back headset usually have
absolutely no heat concentration because
it is totally open like my HD 5 EDX even
in the summer absolutely no issues and
I'm actually excited to try this out as
well in the hot air environment just to
see if this would make a difference
all right guys I'm Dimitri how are
Canucks let me know what you think of
this whole concept of cooling you
in the gaming headset I know it sounds
gimmicky but I'm happy that HP has made
it work and it's not like some some fans
are spinning inside the ear cups but
