definer 5 from fractal design link in
the description for pricing and
availability hello everyone I'm Dmitry
with harbor conducts and I want to say
right off the bat that there are not
many things to love about the new Dell
Venue 8 7000 Android tablet it is a new
direction for the company to compete in
this high price bracket for Android
devices and one thing they sure managed
to do is generate the hype for the
world's thinnest tablet as this thing is
only 6 millimeters thick check it out
side by side with my two daily used
devices the iPhone 5s on the right and I
already think that's incredibly thin and
the Nvidia shield tablet on the left
when compared to the venue 8 7000 looks
and feels so chunky already so the
tablet being so thin you're most likely
skeptical of the tablet bending or
feeling weird for handling but that's
not the case at all and it's running an
Intel Atom quad-core CPU the z3580 at
one point three gigahertz with boost up
to 2.3 power vrg 6430 Intel HD graphics
16 gigabytes of emmc flash for storage
and 2 gigs of ram and until 7260
wireless AC and on top of Android 4.4
KitKat and so coming back to the format
the aluminum chassis is clearly
reinforced that feels premium in the
hands the buttons while in a kind of an
awkward spot are clicky and follow in
line with excellent construction at the
bottom there's a headphone and mic USB
port and micro SD card slot on the side
for expandable storage and that's always
a major positive for media consumption
devices like this and man look at that
bezel impressively housing an 8.4 inch
2560 by 1600 p.o LED display so there's
nothing to give but praise to tell for
the overall outstanding build quality
the images crisp and PPI is high but the
color accuracy and the saturation of the
display is just way off
it's an overly saturated image you know
if you're into that but there's also
gamma and color shifting when reducing
brightness with a very visible purple
in the shadows they have managed to
create an almost pure block so that's a
positive but the saturation in the red
is just non pleasant and here is next to
the Nvidia shield tablet and while I do
appreciate that extra pop on the now it
is a shame that you cannot tone it down
a bit
games and content looks fantastic don't
get me wrong but looking at such an
overly vibrant display gets tiring on
the eyes you know after a few hours now
being only 305 grams seriously this is a
super lightweight tablet I found this to
be sort of perfect for one hand holding
without any strain on the wrist after an
extended period of time this is also due
to the lip on the one side that's both a
major benefit when in portrait
orientation I would even go and say that
this is the perfect reading tablet but
also a big negative for just standard
landscape use you know I thought we were
past the one sided speaker fan and to
see it live again on a 2015 release is
disappointing
although the speakers actually quite
loud and detailed furthermore the camera
position and quality and the somewhat
laggy performance also add up to this
being one of the least competitive
Android tablets in this price range
given it's priced right against the
Nexus 9 or the iPad Mini 3 so let's
start with the camera this is how it
would hold the tablet on a regular basis
the lip at the bottom for extra surface
to grip and I'm totally covering that
front-facing camp so if I was to Skype
regardless of the orientation
composition of that video is just
terrible and the same story continues
with the sense 8 megapixel camera on the
back regardless of how you hold the
tablet your fingers always seem to
interfere not only that but the quality
of the camera is absolutely horrendous
here is a side-by-side comparison to an
iPhone 5s with plenty of available light
out of an airplane window so that's not
a limitation but the image looks so
washed out the poor contrast and the
detail is just not there now this trio
camera is meant to capture depth
information too for depth of field
effects that no one should ever use
because you get visible artifacts around
the objects and foreground and having
the ability to take measurements is not
really a positive feature as it's not
accurate and who would ever use
something like this ever
and finally the performance is also
nothing outstanding it is running in
almost pure stock Android and that's
appreciated with Macs
audio built-in with different sound
profiles there's also a flip to silence
feature that needs notifications when
the tablet is facedown on a flat surface
but the animations seem to experience
lag common lag rotation on the screen
takes a while icons take a while to load
luckily gaming is not really affected
playing some of the best Android titles
is satisfactory I notice this portion in
the back could also get quite warm also
this is the least attractive design
decision with this glossy to get dirty
quickly type of surface really the two
main thumbs up for this tablet is the
build quality and battery life lasting
me an entire trip to GDC from Monday to
Friday so that's two full six hour
flights plus usage throughout the week
and also this thing is super efficient
when sleeping position of this bottom
lip though feels like a massive troll
because it's so awkward to use I love
this for reading but I won the tablet
for all other things too and first
impression of the display was fantastic
given the high resolution and such
vibrancy but you cannot stare at
something like this for hours without
getting eye fatigue and reducing
brightness introduces extra mess with
gamma shifting and we are toning in
shadows I am surprised to see that
Android lollipop hasn't rolled out yet
for this tablet as that might fix the
laggy UI and if only we were given the
option to change color profiles then you
might overlook the compromises well that
