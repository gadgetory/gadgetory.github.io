welcome to another video
I think the enclosure market is changing
direction I think we're moving away from
bigging building the biggest to building
the smallest and most compact and
space-efficient cases while still
maintaining all the features or the
functionality so today we're doing a
mini ITX showdown comparing some of the
latest and some of the most popular
offerings within the current market now
this doesn't mean it's showcasing the
best mini ITX cases but this is just to
give me an idea of what is available and
how they compare against each other so
let's get started
so the five cases on display today are
the courser obsidian 250d which is the
latest addition to this series the beach
Phoenix Colossus the Mini ITX version
coup Master Elite 130 the note 3 or 4
from fractal design not not this is not
a microwave EVGA hydrent err there's
their first case that certainly needs a
revision to and lastly the Leonie PC Q
30 very interesting case with pretty
unique design now let's first outline
all the criteria they'll be making this
Throwdown possible we'll be taking a
look at price volume volume is important
because it gives us relative comparison
as to the internal layout space
efficiency we will take a look at power
supply compatibility graphics cards
limitations CPU color options Drive
storage potential and finally dust
proofing so starting with the first the
most expensive over the pack would be
the EVGA John heir but that's because it
actually comes with a 500 watt called
power supply so the high price tag may
actually be slightly misleading next is
the all aluminum Linley case that brings
in at the hundred forty nine dollars
plus this is a very limited edition
coming in after that the beach phoenix
colossus and the note three or four both
of which ring in at hundred dollars now
keep in mind the internal layout of the
colossus is identical as the original
prodigy and the Phenom lineup so we're
technically not singling out this
particularly model the latest obsidian
brings in a very competitive price of
$90 and lastly the Elite 130 has only
$50 next is the internal volume in a way
determines whether or not the case is
specific space efficient so you can go
as compact as possible without
compromising on internal functionality
the largest of the pack coming close to
30 liters is the Colossus it's not
surprising given there's a full hard
drive cage inside and it has also been
designed for water cooling in mind the
next case is slightly smaller at 28
litres the 250 d now it's still
considered slightly bulky for its form
factor but also does have internal water
cooling support next on the list is the
pc q 30 this is leonie's case would make
a really cool modern case with
the curve you do have limited
compatibility and functionality the note
three or four and the elite 130 come
very close to each other almost the
exact same volume of just under 20
liters one looks like a mini fridge the
other like a typical Coolermaster case
and lastly the smallest guys in the pack
is the hey John Eyre at just under 16
liters now that we have the price and
size out of the way let's jump inside
these cases and see how it deals with
power supply graphics cards and cooler
compatibility and starting with the hey
John Eyre the reason why it's so small
is because of the included slim power
supply it occupies the bottom portion of
the case and it does not interfere with
the rest so up to ten and a half inch
graphics cards are supported with five
and a half inches for your CPU cooler
moving on to the node because the power
supply is installed in the front case
units longer than 160 millimeters will
restrict long graphics cards so go for
smaller power supplies and you still
will have 12 inches for your GPU and six
and a half inches for your CPU cooler
the elite 130 takes a slightly different
approach with top mounted full sized ATX
power supply with 13 inches of clearance
for your GPU and this is really meant
for 120 millimeter own one close to
water coolers instead of a CPU tower
just because of the three inch clearance
between your motherboard and the power
supply the pc q 30 is a bit different
requiring an sfx power supply so we have
seven point eight inches for a graphics
card and five inches for your CPU cooler
moving on to the corsair 250 d thanks to
a very open design that will support any
size power supply we have 11 1/2 inches
for your GPU and three and a half inches
for your CPU cooler and just like on the
elite 130 this is designed for an
all-in-one closed loop and we have a 240
millimeter radio support so an
all-in-one cooler is the ideal solution
here and finally the colossus power
supply is installed at the rear because
the chamber is sort of closed off by the
hard drive cage units only up to 160
millimeters will fit there's 12 and a
half inches for your GPU with the top
hard drive gauge removed and almost 7
inches for your CPU cooler so based on
that
four out of the six cases will support
internal olan one closed water coolers
only two of which can support the 240
million radiators so the 250 D and the
Colossus effectively the two largest
cases out of the pack now aside from
having the best cooling and having a
best support for enthusiast hardware a
lot of Mini ITX cases are turned into an
AAS unit so network-attached storage so
drive capacity is key the note 3 or 4 is
the best option with 6 Drive slots
available for either SSD or mechanical
drives followed by the Colossus that has
an integrated drive cage with five total
drives supported then the is delete with
a good combination of either three and a
half or two and a half inch drives
internally the q30 from Lee and Lee due
to its size limitations can only handle
solid-state drives four of them and the
hindered air would only support for to
drive slots but this means each case is
unique if you try to cram as much stuff
as possible into a mini ATX enclosure
you're effectively making it bigger
while going on the other side if you are
trying to make it as compact as possible
you do arise to some compromises so the
250 D and the Colossus both have
internal water cooling support for 240
million radiators
this is excellent news for enthusiasts
who want to utilize that function while
the note 3 or 4 and the Elite 130 have
sort of an all-around excellent
application for dry storage capacity and
enthusiast hardware support you just
don't have that water cooling abilities
as a 2/5 d in the Colossus the pc q 30
is a whole nother story it's in just a
unique case that would be perfect for
models for example but it doesn't have
the same type of functionality that we
have come to expect from a mini ATX
enclosure if you're really strict on the
budget the Elite 130 it just $50 is
almost a no-brainer considering how much
things you can pack in there
without any type of restrictions on your
graphics card power supply and as long
as you're using a closed-loop 120
millimeter water cooler inside you're
golden only 2 cases out of the pack are
fully dust proof that's an old 3 or 4
and the 2
d while the hydrent air doesn't have any
intakes who don't worry about that four
out of the six cases supports some sort
of optical drive and while working with
each case is slightly different the
individual chamber layout on the 250 D
and the Colossus is just slightly more
convenient given there's more cable
management and cable routing is overall
easier the Hadron air I think looks the
best out of all the cases and it is also
the smallest out of the pack that can
still support enthusiasts great GPUs and
the pc q 30 like I said it's just very
unique it is very particular case with
very particular needs and there I'm sure
there's going to be people that would
find the use for the case especially
within the modern community now I hope
this guide has been helpful exploring
the Mini ITX options on the market but a
camp in the video without mentioning the
silverstone SG line as they pack extreme
extreme space efficiency and excellent
functionality in through the cases just
sucks we don't have any on hand to show
and compare with the rest of the cases
so let me enjoy this video I hope this
content has been helpful make sure to
thumbs up and subscribe for more similar
content and if you do decide to go the
mini-itx route let us know in the
comments below as to what case you
finally ended up choosing and building
your system and what type of
specifications you went with it because
I'm sure a lot of people are now
interested and that small form-factor
including myself so I'm sure that all
these setups are going to be very
helpful for the rest of our readers and
our viewers so guys thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next one
now aside from having the best cooling
and support for enthusiasts hard work a
lot of mini ITX systems are turned into
an SI units and si</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
