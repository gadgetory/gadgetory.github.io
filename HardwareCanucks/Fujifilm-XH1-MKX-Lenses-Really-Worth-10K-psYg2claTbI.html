hard-rocking axe and guess what fujifilm
decided to send me $10,000 worth of
camera gear
I repeat 10 grand worth of camera gear
so I've got to fujinon lenses over here
and I also have this Fuji film xh1
mirrorless body so let's check it out
all right so you can clearly tell that
this stuff isn't geared towards the
average consumer
in fact Fujifilm is targeting the set of
four cinematographers who are looking
for a hybrid solution where they can
take advantage of a digital cinema style
glass paired with a pretty compact body
and this looks certainly interesting
definitely unique
if you ask me because I'm typically used
to seeing you know cameras like red and
already paired up with this type of
glass but being able to have that
mounted on a mirrorless setup is
definitely fascinating and I'm you know
I'm approaching this video as a newbie
because I'm pretty new to this stuff
I haven't played around with you know
prime or zoom lenses in the first place
it specifically lenses that cost so much
so this is like a first time experience
and this is my no means a full dedicated
review I'm not the person for that but
I'm just gonna be sharing my experience
using a setup like this especially since
you know these are some of the
opportunities you get and definitely you
know it's also something that I'd love
to share with you guys so let's talk
about Fuji film and this whole ten grand
set up alright so what do we have here
well let's kick things off with the body
this is the xh1 Fuji films flagship
mirrorless camera and it features a
twenty four point three megapixel aps-c
size X transpose CMOS three sensor which
is actually the exact same one found on
their xt two camera that costs a lot
less than the XH one coming to think of
it the XH one is pretty much identical
to the xt two in terms of the physical
design you get the same physical dials
to adjust the ISO and shutter speed you
also get the same dual SD card slots for
flexible recordings the exposure
compensation dial has been replaced by
the one point two eight inch LCD ink
display that shows the main settings
like battery status the f-stop shutter
speed and white balance and all the
other kind of stuff it's certainly a
welcome addition over the XT 2 but more
specifically I think it's a unique
implementation on a camera body in the
first place because I personally don't
or can recall any camera bodies that are
currently in the market that feature an
ink display and this by itself is pretty
unique because you know it's a great way
to check battery status if you're in the
middle of a shoot and if you just want
to make sure that you have enough
battery you can just quickly grab the
camera look at it and you can judge
whether or not if you have
battery life instead of having to turn
on and turn off the camera so it's
certainly one step away again little
details that create a whole seamless
experience using the camera some other
features that I want to point out is
that this camera now comes with five
axis image stabilization which the xd2
didn't come with so that's definitely an
awesome upgrade but I also want to talk
about the electronic viewfinder on the
XH 1 now if you recall watching my XT 2
review I had great things to talk about
the electronic viewfinder and I have the
exact same say for this setup because
it's by far the best experience using it
especially when composing shots outside
in direct sunlight and when the screen
doesn't really get that bright the
viewfinder is the way to go and again
having that electronic viewfinder it's
super sharp and crystal clear
it's very bright as well but there's
also one thing that really boggles me
with the release of the XH 1 because if
you think about it when the XT 2 came
out I had a few concerns with this
internal recording capabilities for
instance it was not able to shoot any
slow-motion but at the same time it
didn't have the capability to shoot to
shoot epilogue which is fuji films flat
profile internally on the XG 2 and when
fuji film released the xh 1 this camera
sort of addressed all that by including
slow motion capabilities and internal
epilogue recording what's really odd is
that fuji from rolled out a firmware
update to the XD 2 that added all of the
concerns that I had for that camera so
now you actually could pick up the XD to
update the firmware and you can now get
the ability to shoot F long internally
plus also you get the whole slow-motion
capabilities as well so it really comes
down to you know which camera really
perfect or which is probably the best
pic if you're choosing between the XC 2
and the XH one because I feel like Fuji
film is competing within themselves with
the release of the XH 1 and now with the
updated xt 2 with just the firmware
thing so it's kind of confusing I'm kind
of left in this spot where I really
can't recommend which one should I go
with if I were you I mean I would
probably go with the xt 2 because it's a
lot more cheaper and if you update the
firmware you're looking at a pretty
solid camera that can compete identical
to the XH one moving on to accessories
and there's this the vertical power
booster grip and if you recall watching
my xt 2 review i had great things to
talk about that accessory in fact it's a
must-have accessory for a puji film
camera
I have the same thing to say for the xh1
because this thing can Colt up to two
batteries so you can shoot for longer
periods of time without worrying about
battery life it also improvises the
ergonomics especially for shooting
portraits because you can control the
shutter speed and the aperture along
with a few more functions when you have
oriented the body vertically you also
get extra features like a headphone jack
for monitoring audio extended 4k
recording to approximately 30 minutes
and a boost mode that improves burst
shot performance
now before we came to the MK X lenses I
just want to quickly go over my thoughts
on F log I did do a few comparisons
between the XH 1 and the C 100 to see if
there was a difference in dynamic range
and quite frankly there was in fact the
highlight recovery with the Fujifilm
color profile is actually a lot better
compared to the C 100 and that also
makes a lot more sense because the
internal recording bitrate is actually a
lot higher compared to the C 100 and I
also love the colors coming out of for
this Fujifilm camera - I mean looking by
these samples you can definitely tell
that Fuji film is really a solid camera
when it comes to displaying or just
outputting great colors and if you spend
some time tweaking and tuning the grade
I'm pretty sure you'll be able to get
some amazing results with the XH 1 and
lastly let's talk about the exciting
stuff which is the Fuji non NK x lenses
so this is the 18 to 35 millimeter T 2.9
cinah lens and for those of you are
wondering what t21 n stands for it's
essentially the actual test value for
the aperture compared to the theoretical
value with some of the photography
lenses so for instance C Sigma 18 to 35
millimeter lens comes with an F 1.8
aperture which is the theoretical value
but in some cases I would have to
compensate for the exposure you know in
post some cases but the reason why you
know a lot of these cinema lenses have
the T rating or the T reading is for the
fact that they're more accurate so if
you are shooting on multiple exposure
levels you know for a fact that you're
shooting with an accurate aperture
control and that's why they sort of
referred to this as the T stop compared
to an f-stop so that's something to
consider and of course implementing T
readings especially with photography
lenses is definitely expensive I'll
actually leave a link to an article that
actually describes the whole differences
between f-stop and T stops really well
so
if you're interested in reading that
definitely make sure to check it out so
this lens is geared to deliver the best
optical performance and comfortable
operat ability in professional film
environments it's a complete manual ins
meaning us user would have to adjust the
aperture focusing and the range and no
it does not come with auto focusing
capabilities so it's not really ideal
for photography but I've got to admit
the build quality of this lens is
outstanding the whole body is
constructed out of metal and aluminium
materials it's also a heavy glass
weighing a little over a thousand grams
which isn't too bad since mounting it
with a compact mirrorless body makes it
this ideal for typical running gun
situations the weight balance is good
especially when you mount this lens on
the tripod with the included bracket and
overall it was a really comfortable
experience shooting with this system I
should also mention that the other 52
135 millimeter lens weighs exactly the
same as the 18 to 35 millimeter lens so
if you were in a running gun situation
if you had this setup on a gimbal and if
you wanted to swap lenses you can easily
do that without having to recalibrate
your gimbal setup and I think that's
pretty cool and all of this translates
to its hefty price tag of 4,300 US
dollars per lens and to give you a
little bit of context you can actually
pick up these sony a7 3 merliss camera
with the 24 to 70 millimeter f 2.8 G M
lens for the exact same cost so for
those of them who are actually getting
into these lenses know exactly what
they're looking for in the first place
and I think pricing is more of a
secondary a concern because at the end
of the day all they want is a system
that works flawlessly something that
they can rely on and these lenses do
exactly that now that being said there
are some key advantages opting for a
sinister lens instead of a traditional
photography lens so one of them is
obviously the physical aspect which I
talked about earlier but there's also
the three manual rings that feature gear
pitches that allow the use of
third-party accessories like adding a
follow focus so for instance if you are
working in a film in Ireland where you
have someone that's actually pulling
focus for you but you're just behind the
camera composing and making sure
everything is in perfect composition you
can actually mark certain levels within
the focusing range and you can have you
can just make sure you can tape that
particular portion and you can have your
second camera operator you can make sure
that he's
right in focus just when he switches
from you know the foreground to the
background or something like that where
he doesn't have to miss that particular
mark so that's one of the advantages of
playing round or just using cinema class
in the first place is just giving the
extra flexibility especially when you
have someone else taking control of the
focus ring I should also mention how
smooth and satisfying these manual rings
are when it comes to pulling focus or
even zooming into a subject there is no
resistance whatsoever and it's far
superior to my Sigma 18 to 35 millimeter
lens and the end results are pretty
amazing there are also things like
suppress focus shift while zooming and
this essentially eliminates the need to
refocus a subject after zooming in and
out so for example if I'm shooting
someone for a client work and if I'm
shooting I'm literally trying to focus
or zoom into that subject while
recording I wouldn't have to punch in
and make sure that the subject is in
focus because that could disturb what
that could introduce camera shakes
within the video and that's something
that I don't want to compromise on
especially if I'm you know working for a
client I want to make sure everything is
consistent and clear and that's again
it's it's a mind.you detail but at the
end of the day it really creates a big
difference especially when it comes to
your final delivery because your your
whole story is basically consistent and
that's again a pretty cool advantage and
when it comes to shooting with these
cinema glasses and lastly there is
suppress lens breathing and this feature
maintains a consistent angle of view
while shifting focus especially from the
foreground to the subject and this is a
pretty cool addition in fact it's
probably one of the first things that I
realized when playing around with the
cinema lens because normally when I am
trying to focus from a subject or from
foreground to subject I do notice
breathing with my normal Sigma lens but
it's something that was not able to
notice with the with the digital lens or
the cinema lens so it makes a lot more
sense especially when you're composing
or if you're working again in short
films and these are just mind you things
that just add on to the whole experience
when it comes to shooting or just
sitting behind the camera and making
sure that your composition is well
tacked so having talked about some of
the features that the MK x-series lenses
offer compared to a standard photography
lens especially for you know
cinematographers how was it like
actually for YouTube to be honest it's
not ideal for me personally and let me
explain to you why alright so here's a
more realistic scenario where if I'm
taking a shot a close-up shot of this
local on this headset so I have this
camera positioned at this angle and I
really want to go in so I'm literally at
fifty five limits right now but as you
can see the the lens actually has a
pretty difficult time trying to focus
that's because the minimum focusing
distance on this lens is actually along
higher compared to the Sigma so we're
talking eighty five centimeters which is
the minimum focusing distance compared
to thirty or about thirty centimeters
with the Sigma lens so you know from a
flexibility standpoint I like to move
the camera around the different angles
and I like to shoot at certain positions
so you know this setup wouldn't be ideal
because I would obviously have to
compensate for that by moving the camera
a little bit behind
which isn't too bad but again it's that
one extra step that I don't have to do
which I don't have to with this setup
over here because again the minimum
focusing distance on the Sigma lens is a
lot shorter and of course therefore it
just helps my workflow a lot easier so
what I'm gonna do right now is just roll
some of the footage that I shot with
this camera and you guys can tell for
yourself for what the quality looks like
especially with this camera shooting in
4k at 30 frames per second I also did
shoot with the f-block profile and I did
spend some time color grading in so
definitely let me know what you guys
think about the results in the comments
down below
treat your ears with the incredibly
comfortable HD 5 EDX Jubilee headphones
from mass drop and some Heiser
delivering sound expected from $500
headphones but only for 150 bucks making
it one of the best price to performance
skins available check out and join the
drop-down below well guys that pretty
much concludes my experience using 10
grand worth of gear from Fujifilm now
let me be honest with you guys this
stuff or this stuff isn't geared towards
everyone out there it's really geared
towards a specific workflow certainly
not for me because you know as a
youtuber specific specifically for
someone who shoots tech videos I like
the flexibility of having the Sigma lens
with the c100 because I can go in and
shoot macro shots and do all kinds of
stuff which I necessarily won't be able
to do with this setup it's really geared
towards documentary filmmakers you know
someone who doesn't want to compromise
on things like lens breathing and of
course be able to get that consistent
optical focusing while zooming in
without losing focus so those are the
little things and of course the build
quality and the reliability that you get
with some of these lenses those are the
some of the things that makes this lens
sort of stand out from the traditional
photography lenses that are out there in
the market so this isn't a full review I
wouldn't treat this as a full review by
any means this is again me scratching
the surface I'm a noob at this when when
it comes to testing the stuff so I
definitely had a lot of fun testing out
this setup and I can't wait to see what
Fuji film has planned out for the future
with their mirrorless and their cinema
style glass and how they can serve wark
hand-in-hand and what they have planned
out for future filmmakers so I hope you
