possible by our partner Nvidia it has
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex and NCIX without them we wouldn't
be here so we stopped by the AEG booth
and the first thing that caught our
attention was the recently announced and
ninety Q the quincy jones edition this
is what it looks like to have $1,500 on
your head it's quite a feeling let me
tell you that it is a new addition to
their flagship line and is designed for
audio enthusiasts obviously who would
like to experience the ultimate acoustic
performance along with active noise
canceling technology and also self
auto-tuning feature which they say
adjust the frequency response of the
drivers to eliminate any distortion
which is based on the microphones placed
inside each ear cup that measure how the
sound waves travel to your ear now this
is a very unique feature because
everyone's fit is different everyone's
ear size is different and thus this auto
frequency will be adjusted differently
for everyone I couldn't really tell the
difference between Auto tuning on and
off but I guess more listening will be
required obviously to detect all those
differences in addition there are three
listening modes that include standard
2.1 stereo and 5.1 surround sound which
extends the soundstage on the right ear
cup you'll find both analog and digital
output via micro USB so it can output
the higher resolution files off your
source this port can also be used to
update the firmware which is built
inside and it supports rapid charging
volume is adjusted via this turning
wheel on each ear cup the leather cups
are quite deep but super comfortable and
let me tell you they sound absolutely
fantastic very clear highs so much
detail and so much emphasis on a very
nice clear deep and really powerful
emphasis on the bass it really put a
smile on my face while listening and
depending on your soundstage studying it
really feels like I was sitting directly
in front of the artists AKG also
announced the Y 50 B T on the air
polluted headphone sets feature and
aluminum built on the ear cups and
headband they do come in two variants
black and blue with the AKG branding on
both sides which looks nice the both and
battery can be recharged they are USB
and
the Bluetooth on you can expect up to 20
hours of use volley controls can be
found on the right ear cup along with
the analog jacks so that's another
option to listen to and another awesome
headphone we stumbled at AKG was the N
60 which is the noise cancelling
headphone that's purely meant for
portability and traveling the build
quality is nice and solid despite this
very thin frame and even though the
aircrafts are pretty tiny the seal they
created was quite impressive the padding
and pressure on the headband was
comfortable plus noise cancellation for
blocking out low frequencies worked
really well and if you'd like us to
review any of these so let us know by
leaving a comment down below thanks so
much for watching our coverage of CES
2016 we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
