used to be crucial for getting the best
performance in games but now it's really
not the case and with ddr4 making its
way into the mainstream in this video
we'll be testing how Ram capacity
impacts gaming results and also my
favorite video production so I have
these two kits on hand the avexir core
32 gigabytes clocked at 2400 megahertz
and an eight data kit and that is 16
gigabytes with the same speed for eight
and sixteen gear by testing I'll be
using the a data memory and for 32
gigabyte testing we'll be using the FX
circuit and the we both set to the exact
same XMP profile with frequency the same
and all the same timings as well gaming
up first so I took four very demanding
titles currently battlefield 4 Metro
last light Redux
rise of the Tomb Raider and armor 3 to
see exactly how much do you gain with
more RAM I am using my skylight PC with
these specs and while ddr4 is an
improvement over ddr3 I am confident
that these results in terms of capacity
will carry over to ddr3 as well starting
off for reference here's a couple of 3d
mark scores between 8 16 and 32
gigabytes there is some variance here
which isn't significant at all it is
less than 1% difference between a
gigabyte score but interestingly the 16
gigabyte kit performed the best and
these results it is when we ran the DX
12 API overhead test we got a 10%
improvement on 16 gigabytes versus a
gigabytes and a slightly lower 9%
improvement on the 32 gigabytes versus
the 8 but now let's try those games
starting off with bf4 difference between
8 16 and 32 gigabytes of ram grant see
only slight performance gains for
average frame rate and this is supposed
to be the game that is notoriously bad
for needing so much RAM and you can see
here not so much the case you're totally
fine with eight gigs Metro last light
Redux is next and we see a similar
result no difference across the board
here but we did gain that one extra
frame per second hit the
to gigabyte capacity rise of the Tomb
Raider sees identical pattern as
previous games with averages staying
constant despite a much higher maximum
in use memory at 32 gigabyte capacity
but finally the Mount Everest for gaming
that requires so much hardware to run
properly ARMA 3 and to no surprise it
follows in the same footsteps as other
games with no significant improvement
but the average does rise to frames per
second with each 2x of capacity and so
now on to my favorite part video
production because that's where usually
Ram is targeted towards and we have this
association of more is better right
so first opening a large premiere
project and waiting for the files to
load there is a significant time booster
with 32 gigabytes compared to the 8
gigabytes while rendering final videos
isn't RAM intensive so you don't get
much of a boost there just a few extra
seconds faster Adobe After Effects on
the other hand loves RAM as notorious
for needing as much as possible but for
only certain uses like Ram preview so
the more you have the more it can load
into your RAM for real-time previews
however I was very surprised to see
notice Ignace conduced when you're
encoding only a 5 second difference
between my tests and so for concluding
remarks if your gaming system already
has a gigabytes of ddr4 there is no
point of upgrading as you saw with our
results at 32 gigabytes we gained only 4
average frames per second boost compared
to our control point of 8 gigabytes with
no impact on the minimum frame rates so
if you were to invest that money from
say spending it on a high-capacity
memory kit and put that money into a
more powerful GPU or an SSD or any other
component that would make more sense if
your purpose is gaming save that cache
save that cache
so guys I'm Dimitri with our Canucks
thank you so much for watching I hope
you guys enjoy this video and we will
Ram you in the next system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
