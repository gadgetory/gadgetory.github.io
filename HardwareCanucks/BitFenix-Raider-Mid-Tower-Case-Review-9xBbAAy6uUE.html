BitFenix on our review table and we have
to say that Big Finish has taken our
feedback seriously and added some major
improvements on the interior functions
when compared to the shinobi chassis
which we have reviewed in the past the
case rings in at $89 and within this
price range there's a lot of competition
that big Phoenix is facing so let's
check out the Raider and find out if the
company is on top of the game to impress
the current market at such a price first
let's do our usual exterior inspection
the chassis is much smaller from some
other mid towers with 19.4 inches in
depth 8.3 inches in width and 19.7 in
height and weights only 19 pounds the
case is made of steel with plastic front
and top panels these are covered in
BitFenix a soft touch coating in matte
black and adds a little more quality
feel to the plastic parts there's also
long continuous mesh that adds to
ventilation with a rounded contour to
add to the design the case comes with
four adhesive feet as part of the
accessories and we recommend attaching
them right from the beginning as the
Raider is not very stable right at the
top we have 4 USB 3 ports and your audio
between exclaims is to be the first
chassis in the world to have that mini
USB 3 ports these ports connect through
an internal 20 pin cable but also the
regular USB ports for those non
compatible motherboards and if that's
the case you just have to hide the 20
pin connector somewhere inside on the
other side we have a fan controller a
very thin and hardly accessible reset
button your power button and hard drive
activity lights the fan controller
supports up to 5 fans and notice the
cabling is all black to keep things
uniform
now the placement of all connectors and
buttons on the top is unwise because
case placement under the desk is quite
common and reaching for these buttons is
very inconvenient at the back we have
the usual layout with water cooling
holes exhaust fan IO area 7 PCI slots
and a bottom mount the power supply with
the removable dust filters at the bottom
the top panel can be easily taken off
which doesn't have a dust filter but a
fine mesh to serve like one underneath
this is where 200 millimeter fans can be
installed
unfortunately no other fan mounting
options are available at the top which
is quite disappointing at least a dual
120 millimeter fan mount should be
available for case this caliber with so
much competition especially at this
price this means additional expenses to
the consumer has the 200 million of fans
to go for quite a bit of money movie on
the front panel has four optical drive
base and it's removable this time with
dust filters now the front panel has a
lot more versatility with regards to
airflow the trianing secludes 220
millimeter intake fans and mounting for
an optional 200 millimeter fan is
available and to remove the front fans
you have to lift them up through the
optical bay area and the bottom three
five and a quarter inch drive base must
be free in order to have clearance
due to the sizing and the weight of the
chassis this makes it suitable for land
parties however not an easy case to
carry without any support for handles
all right so let's open up the Raider
check out what we have for the internals
thinking of the side panel it is thin
and flimsy and does not contribute to
the overall quality of construction and
if the side panels and the frame were to
be a little thicker this case would have
felt solid starting from our usual spot
the Raider comes equipped with tools
five and a quarter inch drive
installation below which are the two
hard drive gauges that use
backward-compatible brackets for both
3.5 and 2.5 inch drives then we have
rubber grommets around the motherboard
tray for expected easy cable management
and all the front cable connectors in
black to keep the inside uniform the top
hard drive cage is removable just with
thumb screws to allow installation of
longer video cards and also free up some
space for the airflow now this is a
feature that is widely used within the
enclosure market and props to big
phoenix incorporating this into the
raider movie on the power supply is
slightly raised and right beside that an
optional housing 20 millimeter fan can
be installed but as you can see
utilizing extra airflow from the bottom
will not be possible with power supplies
longer than 160 millimeters in length
checking out the back fin Phenix
incorporated zip-tie mountings all over
the motherboard tray which will come in
handy for cable management along with
rubber grommets that are fairly small
and might cause some frustration during
assembly
for example the 24 pin motherboard
connector which is surprisingly
difficult to pass through these rubber
grommets the spacing to work with
between the motherboard tray and the
side panel is just under an inch which
is plenty of room for all the cables
all right mounting the 3.5 inch drive
into the cage is straightforward and
while the bracket is secured you are
able to log the driving place with
provided screws which is especially
useful if the system is in transport and
you need that reassurance that
everything will stay intact even due to
its small stature the radar handles
hardware and cable management without
any hiccups for example with the hard
drive cage well removed cards and 15
inches are supported otherwise 10.2 inch
cards can be installed and looking in
the back all the front panel connectors
blend in with the overall black theme
and not spending too much time on
cleaning things up the radar looks great
with minimal effort and looking at the
CPU cutout it's becoming vital for all
competitive chassis and one really
important feature consumers care about
unfortunately the cutout on the Raider
is worthless for motherboards that have
high CPU placement which means swapping
coolers requires entire disassembly so
let's wrap this up first the Raider
rings in a t-value which most consumers
will categorize as budget which BitFenix
is heavily targeting as there's a lot of
demand for practical chassis at lower
cost and the airflow options are quite
good with three quality fans included
and the hard drive cage wall removal is
extremely useful for longer video cards
that can be utilized if needed
and lastly sorting out the cable mess in
the back is surprisingly easy
considering the smaller than usual
rubber grommets but with cable time
mountings and plenty of room at the back
to work with now from a critical
perspective the radiator doesn't have
that quality feel because the steel is
quite thin and the chassis superlight
the side panels are flimsy then easily
and should be reconsidered we would have
liked to see more fan options available
for the top is only 200 millimeter fan
mount is available this limits not only
your airflow possibilities but also
internal water cooling and we would have
liked the chassis to be slightly longer
and like to support longer power
supplies while still having clearance
for the bottom intake fan and lastly the
CPU cut out for our motherboard is
impractical and should be taken into
account for future
All Things Considered the Raider has
potential for pretty much any setup but
is facing already established
competition while be Phoenix is emerging
as a budget brand certain quality
aspects are being compromised which is
something we think they should
reconsider and that is it for this
review hope you enjoyed it and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
