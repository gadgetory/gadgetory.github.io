great technology selection and service
hello everyone
Eber here with hurricane axe and the
current fad with in gaming peripherals
market is RGB everyone is obsessed with
multicolor options and for good reason
the mismatch of brands on your desk can
be united with a color and this
flexibility is always welcome
so this is the Razer Naga epic chroma
MMO style Gaming Mouse priced at 140
dollars this is a $50 premium over the
predecessor and for those in love with
the design of the original Naga we now
have this wireless option the build
quality of the epic chroma feels the
same as a traditional Naga it's not bad
but there's something about the coding
that doesn't fully translate into a
premium feel at 150 grams the chroma is
on the heavier side this is to support
your palm with its wide and top profile
that doesn't exactly compliment claw
grip but with full finger support on the
right side and non-restrictive frame on
the left for easy access for those 12
buttons the Teflon feet at the bottom
helps with that smooth glide without
peeling and the epic chroma is equipped
with the same sensor as the original
that is the 8200 dpi 4G laser sensor no
complaints and no surprises here either
the primary left and right click
responds well with fast bound that
requires a comfortable amount of
pressure for registration the scroll
wheel was difficult to press but the
scroll steps were accurate and more
distinct than the traditional Naga and
the tail clicks felt great too so we are
happy to see these improvements the dpi
extra buttons were easy to reach behind
the scroll wheel and this on-the-fly
change is always appreciated the 12
buttons on the left side remain
unchanged there's some shake variance
between each row and column to help your
finger memory this is total joy for
Diablo 3 World of Warcraft and League of
Legends once you setup your macro
commands but if you mainly do
first-person shooting then most of these
will be left unused and if you've always
wanted the Naga for its MMO ability
you'll be
happy to know that epic chroma is now
also a wireless mouse a charging dock is
included that hosts the epic chroma in
this awesome showcase standing position
and the strips at the bottom of the dock
stabilize the structure it's very
natural to put the mouse to charge
during the night and if you have any
doubts on its wireless latency we're
here to say the wireless performance was
always exceptional but if you're
skeptical you can always plug the mouse
in for Wired operation so aside from the
wireless implementation the Naga has
also received the RGB treatment one
thing to note is that the logo is no
longer illuminated most likely to
preserve battery life but the scroll
wheel and the macro buttons are color
adjustable there are only two lighting
effects for the zones spectrum cycling
effect that cycles through different
colors static effects in which users can
pick the color they need and completely
letting it off this isn't totally
exciting and we're hoping for more
integration for this color API for
gaming for example individual button
illumination for your different profiles
or game modes that color matched for
your in-game patna sphere moving on to
the driver software the Razer synapse
2.0 which is a fairly intuitive hub that
also detects other Razer peripherals you
can store multiple profiles on the mouse
and thanks to the built-in 32-bit ARM
microprocessor the physical layer of the
mouse helps with easy button remapping
with nine programmable buttons at up to
eight key maps the side view displays at
12 macros that you can customize to your
preference the performance tab helps you
adjust the DPI setting along with the
pointer acceleration and the option to
change the polling rate the lighting tab
allows you to change the lighting
effects on both the scroll wheel and
thumb grid with brightness control on
both wired and wireless mode the power
tab indicates the battery level of the
mouse as well you can set the mouse to
sleep after a certain time and you can
set the scroll wheel to blink when the
battery life is below a certain
percentage the option to record macros
is also available which might come in
handy especially for gameplays and
thanks to the built-in micro processor
that can store all the macro recordings
so in conclusion razer has improved
their best MMO style Mouse with a new
wireless option and full RGB support
however with very limiting customization
for
it made sense to leave the rest
unchanged although an added weight
system would complement the higher price
that being said for all you Razer fans
looking for a little bit more from the
traditional Naga the epic chroma might
be the right choice for you thank you so
