great technology selection and service
hey guys Ibrahim with hot reckon accent
you may have come across ek water blogs
a company well-known for water cooling
parts and accessories
they've mainly focused on providing
appropriate hardware for custom loops
but are now expanding into an all-in-one
solution with the predator 240 if you're
looking into water cooling your gaming
PC ek has you covered the company has
taken a custom water loop consisting of
a massive radiator and a high
performance water block and then seal
the entire thing up priced at $200 we
would consider this a pretty hefty
investment for a CPU cooler and it is
certainly one of the most expensive
options but given their solid reputation
within water cooling let's find out if
ek is able to impress the first thing to
establish here is that this thing is
massive measuring at eleven point six
inches long five and a half inches wide
and a whopping 68 millimeters thick ek
is using their own custom a cg
compression fittings for the predator
240 and this allows the tubing to swivel
easily which will then make installation
easier the AIO tubing is made out of
synthetic rubber that is of quality plus
typically the outer diameter runs from
nine point five millimeters to fourteen
point three millimeters on a standard
AIO cooling solution this bad boy starts
at 16 millimeters in outer dimensions to
10 millimeters for the inner and this
allows an increase in fluid capacity and
pressure reduction pretty cool at the
end of the tubing ek has managed to
implement their supremacy MX water block
which is one of the best you can find on
the market
it comes with four pre-installed
spring-loaded retention bolts that
simply slide in and out to fit different
sized CPU mounting sockets this makes
installation a lot easier except with a
few caveats
which I'll get to in a moment there is a
brass water chamber attached to the
bottom of the radiator which holds a
significant amount of the fluid more
than a typical AIO
the results should keep CPU temperatures
lower as there is more flu to carry the
heat next to the reservoir is where
you'll find the DDC 3.1 pump which
indeed is an overkill for a single rad
setup the last piece to the equation are
the two in
loaded EK bard are branded fans which
are capable of running up to 2200 rpms
instead of relying on software they've
included a four pin header fan
controller this combination not only
exceeds expectations but makes USB based
solutions look downright cheap in
comparison now moving on to the
installation the predator 240 only
supports Intel based sockets and
unfortunately there isn't an AMD
solution do not that out of the box is
configured to support these sockets as
you will have to purchase the 2011
school adapter set separately but for
$200 they should have just included it
I tried installing the unit inside my
fantex luxe case but I ended up having
clearance issues while mounting the
radiator on top as well as the front of
the chassis
given the thicker and longer than usual
body of the radiator you would need
minimum 70 millimetres of high clearance
most likely low-profile Ram and a short
vrm heatsink on the motherboard for the
predator to fit
we hope this actually might change the
way cases are designed as there are only
a handful of enclosures that can
accommodate proper clearance for this
AIO so how well does it perform as
expected it was simply not equal to any
other AIO on the market
the thick radiator does demand high
static pressures to keep it cool the
stock fans can only do this at higher
speeds which results in a much higher
noise levels we also tried a quad fan
configuration and I'll be it it turns
the thickness from 68 millimeters to 93
millimeters but the results are even
more impressive lowering the
temperatures by 5 degrees in conclusion
the predator 240 is by far the most
expensive a i/o solution available on
the market today and for the price you
do get a well performing waterblock
best-in-class tubing solution high
quality fittings a built in four pin
header fan controller but most of all
the performance has surprised us in
every way the only downside is of course
the size of the unit as even my full
tower the fan takes Lux that is
considered to have excellent water
cooling support doesn't have enough top
clearance for the predator 240 but for
those who want that custom water cooling
loop temperatures in an AI yo form
factor this does not disappoint
and we're giving it the Hydra connects
damn good and damn in a way overboard so
