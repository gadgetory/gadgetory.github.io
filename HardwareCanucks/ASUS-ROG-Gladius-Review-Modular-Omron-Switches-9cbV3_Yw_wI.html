great technology selections and service
hey guys
eva here with hurricane axe and the rog
series from asus has been dedicated to
providing only the best experience
towards the gaming community their
gaming notebooks in particular are some
of the best on the market so there's a
lot on the line for the ROG peripherals
made to complement your gaming
environment
now they've grabbed everyone's attention
with the addition of a new gaming mouse
that brings a totally new way of
customization that we haven't seen
before so this is the rog Gladius from
asus priced at $80 this mouse is placed
in the higher tier category that can be
a little risky given the abundance of
excellent and less expensive offerings
on the market the Gladius comes with an
outstanding build quality and the top
surface is made out of premium plastic
material for comfortable use the
designers have ensured the best organ
Amish on this mouse which means that the
Gladius is a perfect fit for all grip
types at a hundred and sixteen grams
that Gladius does feel heavy but for a
well balanced weight system there's no
customizable weights to suit the users
need but I wouldn't complain as it
suited my style quite well the rubber
grips on both the left and the right
side of the mouse ensured a perfect grip
the curvature on the right side of the
mouse provided enough support for both
my ring and pinky fingers and the slight
curve on the left side of my thumb suits
palm tight grip extremely well
Asus has designed the Gladius with
mobility in mind you get two cables one
braided two meter cable and the other
shorter plain rubber one meter cable it
is removable that allows you to leave
one at your desk and take the other with
you for your laptop for example both of
them have a proper logo at the USB tip
to help the friendship between other
cables attaching it is pretty
straightforward by just plugging it in
but the mouse also comes along with a
lock that essentially prevents the cable
from getting unplugged the mouse also
comes with a carrying pouch which is a
good addition and overall I really liked
the flexibility of having to use one
Mouse a different working or gain
barman's the Gladius is equipped with
the 6400 dpi optical sensor and it's so
important for Asus to choose the optical
rail as many gamers are not even
starting to consider mice that are not
optical I had no issues with tracking as
it was perfect just like my AV or 7000 I
enjoyed my usual 1600 to 1800 dpi
setting which gave me the best tracking
experience with precise aim in-game and
satisfying accuracy for editing as well
tracking on white surfaces was really
inaccurate so we recommend using a dark
mouse mat while there is an option in
the driver software for glass surface we
also encountered inaccurate center
tracking with jittery movement
regardless of lift off distance
adjustments in the software itself there
are six programmable buttons on the
Gladius the omron switches on the left
and right primary buttons are not heavy
with pleasing tactile response the
scroll wheel is definitely one of the
best on the market as the scroll steps
are so defined and accurate and pressing
it didn't require a lot of force with
good bounce back nice the DPI shift
button behind the scroll wheel is easy
to reach and it enables instant
switching between two sensitivity levels
and the two side buttons on the left
side where nicely placed for quick use
by your thumb they did provide excellent
tactile feedback nothing to complain
about
Asus also included an extra pair of
Emraan switches allowing users to swap
them for different click resistance this
is the next level of customization we
haven't seen before on a consumer mice
to replace the switches you first have
to peel off the four Teflon feet at the
bottom this means effectively destroying
the Teflon feet as there isn't much
adhesive left for reapplication while a
Sioux supplies an extra set of Teflon
feet for this purpose you are limited to
that one replacement procedure once
removed the four screws are exposed that
holds the top cover of the frame once
that's removed you can take a moment to
admire the engineering that went into
crafting this gaming product and
replacing the switch is not so difficult
all you have to do is pull on one of the
arm on switch is gently it'll pop out
and you can insert the replacement the
replacement switches provide lighter
actuation so if you prefer a really fast
switch this is possible with the Gladius
also you can experiment with mixing
for example a slightly heavier
right-click while a lighter left-click
here's a test on how all of the buttons
sound I also wanted to mention that
there is no way to visually
differentiate between the default versus
the additional arm on switches but look
for serial numbers to help you determine
the correct pairs moving on to the
lighting of the mouse the Gladius comes
with two LED zones the logo at the back
and the scroll wheel it is subtle but
really nothing special unfortunately you
cannot customize the color given the
read-only Auto G color scheme but you
can play around with some lighting
effects like breeding or steady-state
the software just looks gorgeous with
the user greeted with four different
tabs and the option to add profiles on
your PC the buttons tab essentially
displays a physical overview of the
mouse with eight different button
mappings the performance tab helps you
change the to different sensitivity
options plus adjustment to acceleration
and deceleration and angle snapping that
we would recommend you leave untouched
and finally the option to change the
polling rate which is appreciated a
lighting tab essentially allows you to
change the logo lighting effects and
turn off the illumination on the rest of
the zones the calibration tool helps you
to either manually calibrate the surface
or choose two different preset surfaces
that are pre-loaded on the software it's
always important to do such a thing for
your mouse mat or surface finally the
macro manager is built-in that's easy to
use and thanks to the built-in memory
all the settings are saved on the mouse
and so its conclusion time but Gladius
is well built
ergonomically a smart design should suit
many gamers the optical sensor is
excellent and I didn't have any issues
with tracking the option to change the
dpi setting on the fly and the inclusion
of dual cables for mobility is a nice
add-on plus interchangeable arm on
switches are a huge bonus that allows
extra resistance control per switch and
finally the excellent driver software
rounds it up nicely the few negatives we
can mention in this price bracket is the
lack of customizable weight system which
may or may not be an issue
pending on your preference while an
extra set of Teflon feet is included the
process of replacing the arm on switches
effectively makes one set of feet
useless and a more user-friendly process
of deconstruction wouldn't work
unfortunately tracking on glass surfaces
may be inconsistent despite having a
class preset inside the driver software
but at the end of the day the Gladius
does not disappoint and we would
recommend this to anyone looking to
experiment with different arm on
switches and we are giving it the
Harbour Canucks damn good award and so
let us know what do you think about the
rog Gladius considering the price point
and the features that come with it
especially the interchangeable switches
is that something that would appeal to
