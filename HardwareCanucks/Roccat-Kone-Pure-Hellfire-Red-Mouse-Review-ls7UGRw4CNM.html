awesome Mouse so thanks for watching
guys and enjoy the review so hey guys
this is Dmitry and welcome back to
another hair products review have any of
you heard of Roccat one year ago
probably not particularly in canada but
they are sure expanding they're in North
American reach and their products are
finally making their way into our hands
now there's really so many peripherals
today in the market that it becomes very
difficult to differentiate yourself from
the rest of the competition computer
isn't revolutionary in the sense that it
holds the basic principles that are
needed for gaming without being too
ambitious now what we have here is the
Hellfire red edition priced at $80 with
other color options available as well
but this red on black combo I think will
definitely spice up your desk space the
coating on the entire body is rubberized
which feels very nice but we do need
more coarse texture on the sides for a
steadier grip also definitely expect the
rubberized surface to wear with time now
this illuminated rocket logo is a nice
addition although it's not exactly
uniform but that just as being cakey
economically speaking the mouse feels
very light at 90 grams with no weight
adjustments but it's also not a very
large Mouse either so it complements
it's lightweight pretty good this is
particularly important for those who
prefer lower dpi and like to lift off
the mouse while aiming so we don't have
any issues in that department your thumb
rests comfortably and in the perfect
reach for those browser buttons and your
pointer finger can quickly access the
DPI
months now the DPI buttons on the comp
you have excellent feedback and require
quite a bit of force to register and
same goes for the browser buttons that
have just the right amount of travel and
resistance now usually what we see some
sort of LED to indicate what what dpi
setting you're using or which profile
but with the computer we have a rather
different approach
take a listen epi 6400 dpi 8200 dpi
volume up volume down volume up volume
down profile 3 profile for 8200 dpi
that's right the driver software by
default will announce what profile dpi
setting and even achievements not
in-game achievements but Mouse
achievements which is rather unusual it
does show you all the click and scroll
statistics for example now speaking of
the scroll wheel this is one of the best
scroll wheels that I have ever used on
the mouse there is just the right amount
of resistance and you can feel every
little scroll step it doesn't wobble and
the rubberized surface helps with
perfect operation every time
so from an ergonomic and button design
the computer is very satisfactory to use
now coming into the software we have all
the customization needed to really
personalize the feel starting with the
main control where you can adjust five
different dpi settings all the way up to
8200 dpi we have sensitivity options and
scroll speed rate standard stuff
obviously button assignment and macro
manager is key and rocket has this easy
shift plus feature which allows
secondary button assignment which
basically doubles the amount of things
you can do with your mouse by default
the backwards key is mapped to be the
easy shift plus as long as it's pressed
the rest of the buttons will perform
under secondary command this is
particularly useful for switching
profiles or adjusting the volume for
example this works very well for simple
multitasking in desktop but provides a
whole new level of Mouse control for
in-game is now you have pretty much six
extra button assignments for your mouse
for example I found useful to map the
talk key to be used with the right mouse
button which means you don't have to
lift your fingers from the
is these zones also rocket includes easy
aim function which essentially drops the
DPI to your preferred setting and
essentially acting is a sniper button as
long as it's pressed so that will
definitely come in handy in the advanced
control tab we get X and white
sensitivity a tracking control unit that
scans your surface and adjust the laser
accordingly for more accurate tracking
and for those who like left off the
mouse liftoff distance can also be
configured now this mouse is rated at
the thousand Hertz so absolutely no lag
during gameplay and the LED color and
effect can also be adjusted
now the lit up logo is a nice touch and
if you do decide to silence the
announcer color is a good option to
differentiate between profiles so I took
the time to explore my gaming library
with the cone pure and have to say my
experience has been very satisfactory
upon setting up appropriate dpi levels
and sensitivity and turning off that
annoying announcer the mouse really grew
on me as the buttons feel extremely
sturdy and responsive it's very
comfortable despite its light weight and
really no complaints about the tracking
either driver software is a little
cramped but nevertheless provides a lot
of flexibility for user preference in
particularly the secondary button
assignment which are totally worth it
for improved gameplay and all this for
$80 we think is a good value if you want
a proper gaming mouse now our only
critique is that we wish the sides were
more textured to provide a tidy grip but
all in all this is a gaming geared Mouse
that definitely should be considered and
we're giving it the hardware canucks
damn good and then good value award so
thanks guys for watching make sure to
like this video for a chance to win the
cone pure and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
