cool here we come
what a view
but first huge thanks to our sponsors
thermaltake Razer MSI Corsair and fantex
for making C as possible
alright good people so this is the deep
cool my cube 550 why am i cube you might
ask I have the same thing because well
maybe it's magical you know on the front
it's all minimalist but there's some
magic on the back side panel the
ventilation design that they've
implemented there I would say really
good stuff there but the my cube 550 is
all about minimalism so in terms are
like branding you know it's not visible
it's not in-your-face and this is part
of game or storm division so not deep
cool but gamer storm and it's really
interesting to see you know their logo
in the front for example it's white on
white so it's discrete the same thing
with this handle on a TG panel that is
black on black so it's again not
in-your-face and I definitely
appreciated that and you guys will too
so there are no lighting effects it's
just plain either white frame or a black
frame we have a TG panel over here with
this chrome accent handle for a magnetic
TG panel so this we we've seen that with
the quad stellar the magnets are super
strong and I was actually personally
worried about let's say what if you're
carrying the system and accidentally tip
over something but no the magnets on
here are strong enough so you don't have
to worry about this thing popping out to
me to my cube 550 is kind of a
combination between like the H 700 from
NZXT in terms of this like almost
unibody front panel and on the interior
taking a little bit elements from let's
say the case of the year the olam
dynamic because let me remove the front
panel on the interior we have dual sort
of intake and fan configuration so
you're a traditional 360 rather the
front you can do or now the side
installation of the fans so you can do
either three one 20s or three one 40s
and up to a 360 rather than there and
there's a little bit of spacing behind
the frame so you can still install a
radiator or a fan behind the frame so
that it clears up all the space on the
front so you could do fans on the front
and fans on the side without them
interfering with each other and that's
for the interior there are many cool
elements starting off with a power
supply shroud we have a tempered glass
side panel over here to reveal what's
inside so they're still not finalized
with the actual design hopefully they'll
carry over from the ventilation of the
rear pen
something over here so the design is
cohesive and over here this front
section of the shroud is open but
they'll close it maybe with another TG
panel so it reflects any illumination
that you might have on the front here
which is cool as for the standard ATX
motherboard support EA TX is not here
rubber grommets and because of the side
ventilation you can do like 360 and 3
140 Miller fans the frame is quite tall
but since there are no fans about the
frame its it gives you a little bit
extra space to breathe but then this all
that space is a little bit wasted if you
are not populating a really tall
radiator on the side as for storage we
have one SSD mount on the power supply
strap we have two more in the back and
we have two of these hard drives
included so you can install two three
and a half inch on each caddy and the
cool thing is you can install this guy
on to any of the fans thoughts on the on
the side or the front and you can either
rotate them whichever you see fit for
cable management or the way you are
trying to display your hard drives so I
find that really awesome and so this is
that really cool ventilation pattern
that I was talking about it's got
multiple angular elements and depending
on how light hits it it creates the
shadow on that internal structure has a
little ventilation pattern on the
opening spaces so I find that quite
unique and hopefully we can find this
pattern somewhere else inside the case
for a little consistency and the one
minor concern for us would be of course
airflow since the front panel is so
close to the frame but depending on our
based on their own testing they say
there's about 25 percent difference in
air flow with the panel completely
removed versus the panel installed so I
really want to see this whole thing
slightly expanded for better airflow but
of course once we get the my cube 550
info review will do all the air flow
testing and this thing is going to be a
hundred and nineteen dollars for the
white edition and 110 dollars for the
black one so I think it's a pretty good
price territory and only one fan is
included for the rear and it will be
black and now let's talk about the gamer
storm assassin three of what they call
within the company in the king of air
coolers so it's going to be competing
with the Noctua NHD 15 so it's got this
whole 140 member form
but the assassin 3 has an advantage in
size because it is 165 millimeters in
height but it is much thinner at the
only 140 millimeters so the actual
thickness of the fence aligns with that
of 140 the more fan making it a slimmer
package that would you know allow you to
you have just generally more clearance
above the motherboard and below the
sockets ah now visually I love what
they've done with the assassin 3 and so
it's a black design with chrome accents
and you can see these top plates that
actually have functionality behind them
they're like these air channels that
make sure that air flow flows directly
from the top of this fan all the way to
the back of this fan you can actually
feel that and a little extra Tim bit for
us Canadians is that you can remove the
gamer store logo from this black portion
if you want to go all black and go a
little bit you know more low-key now
what about actual performance of this
thing so we have 2 140 Miller fans that
have been specifically designed for this
type of heatsink so they go from 500 to
1,400 rpm and right now they're spinning
at full speed and the noise profile is
quite pleasant it's not too loud it's
not too frequency and that's for the
heat pipes themselves they're using
groove center structures so the heat
transfer is 15 percent better than your
traditional heat pipes which is awesome
and they have solder flow through so the
heat pipes make that makes direct
contact with the heatsink which again
improves the overall cooling efficiency
I would say for 99 bucks the assassin 3
is going to be a really good contender
from a visual perspective from a purse
for performance perspective and the
noise profile - one more thing is that
and one more thing a screwdriver is
included for installation I love this
thing be quiet actually includes them
and they're amazing now Ram
compatibility is usually an issue with
such big air to air coolers so right now
we have 30 millimeters so your standard
low-profile Ram will fit in the full
configuration but of course you can move
the 140 Miller fan slightly up so to
make up more room or you can remove it
completely for that whole clearance to
be completely open
that's hot and that's high mean that's
high the coolness the the temperature is
cool you did
you know I don't know why I do that and
lastly the matrix 70 it's a $69 a case
from deep cool now and I find some
really interesting elements inside this
budget and closure like a temper glass
ceiling on the power supply shroud so it
has many cool elements like if you have
a graphics card that has some LED
illumination now you can have that
reflection element and actually see
those lonely LEDs that otherwise don't
see any eyes and number two I find this
a graphics holder a pretty unique
addition so it is going to be sold
separately for $15 it has its own cable
routing channel on the internal now
internally because it's light a little
bit thick of course addressable are
jovial nation too so let me know if this
is something that you buy for your next
case alright guys so that is all the
things that we saw today deep cool and
gamer storm let me know what you think
about the McHugh 550 the titled maybe
has to change me signing off and these
guys right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
