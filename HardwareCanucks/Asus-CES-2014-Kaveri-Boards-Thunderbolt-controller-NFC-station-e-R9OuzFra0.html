is brought to you by and say XCOM
technology connect ok guys so the asus
suite here at CES 2014 not only has some
pretty kick-ass graphics cards and some
awesome audio solutions but they also
have some pretty innovative ideas for
their motherboard line so starting off
over here just because of the new apu
that AMD just launched Kaveri they're
showing off their new 8888 x-pro
motherboard so it features a one clues
or 1-click boost button so you can
overclock even none of black edition AP
use but some of the really cool things
that we want to show you moving over
here is actually this little port right
here it's the SATA Express port now this
is going to be the new future standard
of SATA interface that's going to
feature speeds up to a thousand megabits
per second so it's a lot faster than the
current state of three ports and it also
has backwards compatibility using an
adapter they are also showing off here
the new asus thunderbolt ii x2 which is
an expansion card for those motherboards
that do not feature thunderbolt now
there is a limitation because only some
boards will be supported and they need
to have i don't know if you can see it
but you need to have this thunderbolt
header and only certain boards currently
have the certification through intel but
what I can tell you is that it is a
pretty cool option because they featured
here is that you can actually daisy
chain you are let's say GPU to
thunderbolt to have thunderbolt out so
it's a really cool option that you could
actually force the display through
thunderbolt especially because we're
going to see a lot more displays
probably in the future featuring this
type of technology as well they have
something else that they wanted to show
off today too which was this right here
and just to show the power of
thunderbolt and what you could possibly
do in the future with it they have rated
to raider SSD drives together using the
thunderbolt technology which get some
actual incredible numbers if we take a
look at the disk benchmark as well as
where we're seeing here on the screen is
that read and rights are incredibly high
and we've seen up to a thousand megabits
per second so performance through
thunderbolt is
really really really strong another
really cool technology that asus is
showing off today in their suite is NFC
Express so this is a piece of technology
that will allow you to connect it
basically to your PC or it's your phone
or anything that has a USB port or USB 3
port and basically will allow you to
control a certain application or it will
allow you to launch an application or
even sign in to your PC just by tapping
your phone so this is basically one side
of everything that Asus does and we
featured quite a few of their new
jaw-dropping technologies in the release
video when we had there when we covered
their press conference now you've seen
pretty much what they have available to
us on the component side as well guys
just in case you haven't seen it you can
go on to the asus website they also have
launched a brand new 8 an AC router that
has four antennas which actually
increases the wireless performance and
they have quite a few other little
tidbits that you can see in our press
conference coverage now guys thank you
for taking a look at our video here at
the asus booth what I'd like you to do
is like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it but i
don't think that i need you're going to
end up disliking it and make sure that
you subscribe for more of our hard
hitting kickass CES 2014 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
