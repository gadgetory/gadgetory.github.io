video let's get started what's up guys
you were here with hurricane axe and if
you're in the market for a GPU that
costs less than $500 the gtx 1070
founders edition is certainly an option
but you have to consider that it's
actually more expensive than custom
solutions but what if you want something
a bit more and you're willing to pay an
extra $20 for gtx 1070 that's on
steroids you might want to take a look
at this light up your build with hue
plus by NZXT d it fits into two and a
half inch drive slots comes with four
individually controlled RGB strips with
plenty of connection cables for best
routing and is wonderfully controlled
through the camp software get 10% off at
NZXT comm link in the description meet
the zotac gtx 1070 amp extreme edition
ZOTAC went a little extreme with the
packaging - since this is one of the
largest boxes I've come across but let's
get to the chase and talk about the card
priced at 470
you're getting quite a lot over the
founders edition how does it compare to
the other GTX 10 70s well we'll see in
the coming weeks the amp extreme bass
clock starts at sixteen thirty two
megahertz with a boost of 1835 megahertz
which actually represents a pretty
significant increase over the founders
Edition and other important difference
is the memory clocks which unlike many
other cards have an aura clocked as well
that's a great change there's a whole
lot of other features like RGB lighting
upgraded PCB components and of course
more room for overclocking I was amazed
when I picked up this card it's freaking
huge huge in a sense bigger than my GT X
1080 super clock from EVGA the amp
extreme line up from ZOTAC has been
around for quite some time and let's be
real it's ice dome coolers have
performed outstandingly compared to any
other flagship cards out there and
throwing on the same cooler as found on
the 1080 epic stream should give us
excellent results the heating itself
sits on top of the GP 104 core and
covers the majority of this card and by
the looks it should help heat
dissipation but take good notes though
this card measures almost 13 inches long
and nearly 6 inches in height that makes
the amp extreme a triple slot GPU so
installing 2 of these may be a challenge
even I have to be
careful when installing this card inside
my case and it almost didn't fit so make
sure yours is compatible the design on
the external shroud has received some
glossy Carbon detailing I wish it was
man but overall it adds a layer of
stealthiness if you have it set up on an
open test bench or inside your PC taking
a look at the backplate ZOTAC did spend
some time designing this but I'm not a
fan of it
I understand how they wanted to showcase
the yellow and grey color scheme which
complements their logo and they did a
pretty good job implementing grilles for
increased airflow but I want to hear
your thoughts on this would you prefer a
more low-profile finish over this fancy
artwork feedback is always welcome
another item that's worth mentioning
here is the gold plate right behind the
GPU core area it's labeled power-boost
which is actually a solid state
capacitor that's meant to smooth out
voltage ripple expand power delivery and
essentially prolong component life the
AB extreme Edition has always used a
triple fan layout and the GTX 10 semi
version is no different the dual blade
ekl fans stand out from the traditional
design they utilize a double blade
design that's supposed to increase
airflow by up to 30% allowing more
effective heat dissipation as well as
quieter acoustics and it works really
well as we'll see later
just like other custom cards these fans
shut off during idle situations and they
start spinning when you throw something
intensive at it the i/o hasn't changed
that much from the founders edition you
get dual link DVI 3 DisplayPort 1.4
connectors and an HDMI 2.0 output for
power well since this is a monster of a
card it requires a hell of a lot of
juice to perform well especially when
overclocking with dual a pin power
inputs you shouldn't worry about
limiting voltages and the chips usable
power but that's provided ZOTAC software
actually supports high voltage and power
inputs otherwise these dual inputs are
completely pointless so Tex firestorm
software is meant as an all-in-one tool
for overclocking and controlling other
aspects of the card it's actually pretty
well done there are basic sliders for
overclocking while the right-hand side
of the application holds things like fan
speeds and BIOS update dialog and a
monitor tool moving on to the second
section of the software which leads to
LED lighting so tech labels their LED
lighting spectrum and in this car
you get zones the first one is the logo
on the side and the other being the
subtle lighting around the armor as well
as the push to limit branding on the
back plate there are four lighting
effects static breathing strobe and
cycle you can choose your preferred
color choice although I think eight of
them seems limiting there's also the
ability to adjust brightness which is a
nice touch
frame rates throughout gameplay were
consistent across the board plus given
the beefier heatsink temperatures were
hovering around 56 degrees Celsius when
I'm doing idle tasks like writing
scripts or consuming content remember
this is where the fans are able to turn
completely off switch to gaming and
after 30 minutes this card is only
touching 65 degrees this was not a
surprise to me since the card is
absolutely massive and anything other
than a cool running core would have been
unacceptable
the gtx 970m Xtreme was also pretty
quiet during the gameplay let's take a
listen
so the zotac cards installed the case I
have a side panel closed and microphone
is right up there so you can get a
reference audio of how the card performs
or sounds when idle
yeah that's dead quiet I was only able
to hear my CPU coolers fan let's hop
into the benchmarks and see how well
this gtx 1070 stacks up with the
founders edition gtx 1080
looking at these results it's not a
significant difference in performance
compared to the founders edition 1070
but there's something there you're only
getting three to four frames per second
on most 1440p titles pranked at the
highest settings the same story applies
when switching to 4k it's not that far
from the gtx 1080 but you do get more
performance when paying more for the
faster card I have good news for
overclocking as well we were able to hit
a little over two gigahertz on the core
and the memory was running at an
impressive 9390 six megahertz now while
that's not that much higher than what
you could have achieved with the
founders edition the temperatures keep
astounding me as you can see you gain an
extra three four frames per second and
fallout 4 and witcher 3 and it's closing
the gap towards the gtx 1080 amazing our
conclusion on the zotac gtx 1070 amp
extreme is pretty straightforward paying
extra $20 for this card or the founders
Edition will result to you in an extra
three to four frames per second in 1440p
and 4k but remember the fascinating
temperatures and mind-blowing acoustics
floors the doors copy reference card
personally I didn't enjoy the visual
aesthetics of this card but if you can
get over it this is well worth your
investment and for that we're giving it
the Haruka knacks damn good award would
you consider spending next to $20 for
this card over the founders edition or
do you guys still crave for the 1080 let
us know in the comments down below
I mean bar with hurricane axe thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
