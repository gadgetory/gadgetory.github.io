great technology selection and service
after a very long week I was about to
start my third I TX build for this week
and it was really excited to see how the
new core 500 from kracko design would
stack up with my usual reference system
and then I asked what makes a good I TX
enclosure it's definitely a combination
of things like hardware support
how many drives can you mount and
wouldn't support me or beefy GPU but
what about a power supply and any
overkill all-in-one coolers that you
might want to mount just because you can
and what about cable management or is
the assembly process a total pain or
will you preserve some nerves and so due
to space limitations I thought at least
one of these factors must fall short in
the new core 500 and so I began my
journey hoping for a good outcome to see
if this is the best ITX enclosure yet at
$60 the core of the core 500 is
extremely well built solid steel joints
no flex anywhere and the only plastic
piece is the front panel with that
staple brushed aluminum quote unquote
look there's a single file in the
quarter inch drive bay at the top with
dual USB 300 jacks and PR buttons
ventilation all around small one for the
power supply venting strip's spending
the entire panel near the GPU and also
the top panel that are both covered with
this magnetic dust filter which is
awesome plus a removable filter
underneath the power supply is available
the only minor annoyance is reinstalling
that the exterior panel which is more
difficult than it should be as you need
to align all the clips on all the sides
from the panel to fit in place properly
behind the front panel we find no intake
ports instead a single SSD mount that if
installed facing up interferes with the
five-minute quarter inch drive bay but
is easier to route with the your SATA
cables but the cutout on the bottom left
would allow appropriate routing for
those SATA cables if the SSD is facing
down at the back it's a standard ITX
setup motherboard IO and dual PCI
brackets a power extension plug is on
the left side that you have to plug into
the power sub
internally and a 140 millimeter exhaust
fan is included the idea for this ITX
build was to utilize the 240 million
radiator for the CPU that will also act
as exhaust and that's the impressive
design choice here as the fan bracket at
the top that is totally removable by the
way allows dual 140 or 120 million fans
and their respective radiator sizes
which suit this form factor really well
and here's what the inside looks like
without the GPU and I say that an
all-in-one suits and ITX enclosure well
because of cable management everything
has to be concentrated to the side of
the motherboard and handling any cables
with a low-profile CPU pump would be
easier than having to work around
eight-hour CPU cooler which it does
support by the way up to 170 millimeters
in height the core 500 supports
full-size ATX power supply that is
installed at the front of the
motherboard with recommendations of 160
millimeters in length or shorter for
module units as that would mean no
interference with the GPU there are
cable - hoops on this side of the case
if you'd want to secure some cables
underneath the graphics card with
maximum supported GPUs up to 310
millimeters in length or just over 12
inches which means you can easily build
a suite ITX gaming system without
sacrificing on cooling nor hardware
compatibility for storage the main drive
bracket can support dual three and a
half and two and a half inch drives at
the same time this as these are
installed on the outside and the hard
disks on the other side of the bracket
with appropriate cutouts available to
get in with your screwdriver plus
non-restrictive mounting positions for
either drive which I appreciate greatly
you can unmount either drive without
affecting the placement of the other the
only challenging thing here I could see
if all four drives are installed is
managing all those SATA cables in this
tiny cutout in the center you'd need 90
degree SATA cables for sure in order to
fit everything now on the topic of
challenging notice all these cables
coming from the top io which are paying
to hide they would be very difficult to
work with if an optical drive was
installed as there right about there and
I like having top IO that are easy to
reach on the exterior but in certain
internal configurations these cables are
frustrating to work with and finally
installing the five and a quarter inch
drive bracket back inside the case I'm
happy to see no clearance issues with
our H 105 radiator and a set of fans
plus a third mechanical Drive can be
installed right underneath for that
additional storage bring total drive
capacity to three SSDs and three three
and a half inch drives so the core 500
at its core offers a fantastic
foundation for enthusiasts ITX systems
cable management will always be
challenging in confined spaces and you
just have to accept that and I feel this
case is a good balance of making sure
hardware compatibility is maximized and
you have a great cooling options plus a
storage is well incorporated although I
wish the drive bracket was completely
removable outside of the case to make
installation and removal of drives
easier when the system is fully
assembled but in general I enjoyed
working with the core 500 there were no
deal breaking surprises along the way
and we're giving it Haruka Knox diem get
award so this is it for the Core 500
review let us know if you've been
enticed to do an ITX build of your own
with a comment below I'm Dimitri with
Haier Canucks thanks for watching we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
