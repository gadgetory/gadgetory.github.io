it doesn't really feel a lot good but I
gotta make this video hey guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and this is the msi PS63
I can't call it a gaming laptop although
I don't know if I could call it a gaming
laptop or a content creator friendly
laptop but we'll finalize on that in the
conclusion so this is an interesting
notebook because MSI partnered up with
the Discovery Channel to come up with
this guy and as you can see by the
design it it looks definitely a lot
sleeker certainly looks not MSI
whatsoever because if you if you think
about MSI you think gaming aggressive
designs but this is totally a complete
refresh and I really like the way how it
looks so just to quickly go over the
specs it has a whiskey lake core i7
processor 16 gigabytes of RAM 512 byte
SSD nvme SSD but oddly enough my unit
was partitioned which was really weird
and it also has a GTX 10/15 max-q GPU
and that is an interesting combination
because typically you would pair or
you'd find gaming laptops with primarily
mainstream Intel CPUs and a discreet
NVIDIA GPU but in this case it's
different MSI decided go with a slightly
underpowered you series processor and
pair it up with a 1050 max-q GPU and so
I just really wanted to test out the
performance and what you can get with
something like this particularly
interested by the battery life as well
and there are a lot of surprises and of
course a few disappointments as well so
let's get into it but first a quick
message from our sponsor damn what that
provide TX system you run and this is an
ATX machine you mean micro idea no no
full-size ATX components is just a small
package it can still satisfy the Q 500 L
by Cooler Master and affordable and the
pretty compact enclosure for all your
regular hardware would perforated
exterior and PSU bracket that shifts up
and down flexible side IO and awesome
cable management the Q 500 L a compact
frame with full ATX centers
check it out below all right so before
we get into the aesthetics of this new
book I do want to quickly discuss
pricing so you can pick it up for around
1,300 to 1,600 dollars depending on
again depending on retailers again they
have a lot of these notebooks on sales
so that's kind of the price ranges
you're looking at for the specs that I
just mentioned a minute ago with that
out of the way let's talk about the
design and I really love what MSI has
done here the partnership with the
Discovery Channel really shows when you
take a closer look at the notebook so
the front panel feels like it's made out
of polycarbonate materials that
sandblasted in this galaxy blue trim by
the way this is an MSI term the interior
is full on aluminum and it comes in this
nice carbon gray finish with a bit of
blue accents on the trackpad and I think
that's a nice touch the keyboard layout
is pretty compact the key sizes are
slightly bigger than usual and I like
that because I got used to it really
fast they do have a shorter amount of
travel distance and I want to say that
they're slightly better than my daily
driver the Razer Blade 15 so that's nice
there is good feedback the arrow keys
are positioned appropriately nothing to
complain here it's also backlit but it
does not feature RGB lining which i
think is great because it wouldn't have
fit the design aesthetic so there's no
book in the first place
however I do wish the brightness levels
were a little bit you know higher or
brighter because they don't get as
bright in darker conditions moving out
to the trackpad MSI one with a slightly
different approach this time so they
made it wider to accommodate your
fingers comfortably and I really enjoyed
my time using it it features Windows
position drivers so it takes advantage
of all the gesture controls baked into
Windows 10 and it also has a built-in
fingerprint reader which is a nice touch
taking a look at the i/o on the left
side you have your power in HDMI that
can only output 4k at 30 Hertz a USB 3.1
genuine type C port that also acts as a
display port another USB 3.1 genuine
type a that supports quick charge 3.0
that's actually a really cool feature
because not a lot of laptops support
that and the fact that you can simply
plug in your included USB cable to plug
in your smart phone provided that
supports quick charge is great and I
think this would come in super handy for
people who travel a lot and of course
you do get a headphone /my jack
switching over to the right you get two
more USB 3.1 ports one of them being Gen
1 and the other one being gen 2 and a
micro SD card slot now a lot of gamers
won't care about this but for content
creators it's a huge deal because this
notebook is geared for that and the fact
that you know they're targeting this for
people who travel as well who create
content does make any sense because you
know most people use cameras with
full-size SD cards and I would have
preferred to have that on a notebook
that's geared for content creation just
something's missing there on the
positive side the display is really nice
to work with
it's a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS screen that
exhibits great colors with good contrast
ratio it's also a matte display and the
webcam is placed at the right location
and I thoroughly enjoyed my time gaming
on this laptop as well because a display
is just really good however I did wish
if the screen got a little bit more
brighter because viewing content was a
bit challenging outdoors and this is
something that I have encountered among
other gaming laptops in the past brands
just tend to pack in good displays not
our grading colors but just not bright
enough especially compared to what Apple
offers with their Microprose those
queens get super bright but again like I
said if you're thinking about picking
this up and if you're traveling a lot
you may find the brightness up put on
this a little bit you know disappointing
now in terms of upgrades when you crack
open this notebook the first red flag
that I caught was that the memory is
running in single channel mode and so I
was certainly expecting that to affect
performance which will definitely take a
look at later on you can't upgrade the
memory up to 32 gigabytes switching over
to the storage configuration the main
drive is sitting on a PCI gen3 slot
whereas the other one only supports SATA
based drives so keep that in mind
as for battery the ps63138 ficient
processor like the whiskey lake cpu and
we pair that up with a fairly
respectable graphics
like the GTX 1050 I think you've got a
really solid middle ground in terms of
power efficiency and performance and
guys I also want to mention that I
haven't tested other 15-inch notebooks
with lower voltage processors and lower
end discrete graphics cards so the four
core a threaded CPU is a decent
performer obviously keep your
expectations lower since it doesn't get
anywhere closer to the six core
8750 H processor but you can still get a
lot of work done and I was really
surprised with the video editing
experience as well now typically on any
notebook reviews I would take our
standard 13 minute 4k project and I
would render that on the machine to see
how fast renders but weirdly enough this
notebook had some issues with Adobe
Premiere and that project which was so
odd
obviously premiere is broken I mean I'm
having issues with my desktop PC so I
tried rendering another project which is
a 10-minute 4k clip and you know it
completed that render in just a bit over
14 minutes which is really respectable
because you've got CUDA acceleration
paired with good Intel Quick Sync so
like I said you can get away with video
editing on this thing I wouldn't push it
to the extreme and but I'm actually
really surprised by the playback
performance on this guy gaming on the
other hand well let's just save the
10:50 max-q pushed out respectable frame
rates paired with a wisk cubic processor
I mean the fact that the memory is
running in single channel mode certainly
bottleneck the performance and this is
the PS 63s biggest disappointment
because I actually made a separate video
comparing dual channel versus single
channel on notebooks and the results
were substantial I mean if you're
interested you can actually check that
video right over here but you know if
msi pre-loaded this with a dual channel
configuration it just would have made
this notebook a lot more responsive and
the frame rates would have obviously
topped the charts especially at 1080p at
medium to low settings taking a look at
temperatures things are not looking that
great on a full synthetic load using
either 64 the CPU did get toasty at 95 C
and India throttle however do keep in
mind that it's a full synthetic load and
not a real-world use case scenario
especially for content creators so I did
monitor clock speed when rendering
the premier project and CPU got around
four gigahertz which is again well
respectable and the temperatures are
also well under control unless if you
decide to fully push the processor to
its absolute limits you shouldn't have a
problem the GTX 1050 max-q did peak at
84 C which is to be expected considering
the form factor of this notebook and the
clock speeds were shifting back and
forth between 1200 and 1683 megahertz
fan noise is tolerable I mean the good
thing is that it doesn't sound like a
jet fan when gaming or doing anything
productive under idle scenarios it's
also really quiet which fits the
notebooks character now MSI has
pre-installed control center that lets
the user switch between different
performance modes and of course adjusts
fan speeds as well and you can also set
you know CPU and GPU preferences for
certain applications which is pretty
nice and the one thing that I'm really
surprised is the lack of crazy amount
bloatware on this notebook considering
that is an MSI laptop because you know
the last MSI notebook that I reviewed
was again this was a while back it was a
huge thick beast gaming beast from MSI
and that thing was just loaded with
bloatware apps but I'm really surprised
by the cut down of that on this notebook
I'm hoping it's the same case with their
gaming lineup but yeah on this guy very
minimal so I guess it's time to conclude
my thoughts on the ps6 between modern
from MSI you see the biggest strengths
of this notebook is the battery life the
fact that I was able to get over 11
hours of use in my use case scenario is
just fascinating I mean when you look at
the hardware configuration this thing
you know has a you series rescale like
processor and when you pair that up with
a respectable again gtx 950 max-q GPU
it's the combination is just very unique
and I think it establishes a solid
middle ground especially for people who
don't want to spend too much on a
super-fast gaming laptop but also don't
want to compromise on just an ultrabook
featuring integrated UHD graphics that
gtx 1050 guys it really does elevate the
content grading experience that being
said there are some things that I'm not
a fan of especially on this notebook so
first and foremost the speakers they're
not that great they're downwards firing
and they completely just block because I
know it's just a weird implementation
I would prefer to fund facing speakers
for better protection also the single
channel memory mode is just a big red
flag in my books because it affects
gaming performance now you can upgrade
it on your own to a dual channel config
but that's an investment on your end so
keep that in mind and in micro SD card
reader is an ironic implementation
especially since MSI is gearing this for
content creators who travel a lot lastly
there's the cost so as I mentioned
earlier you can pick up this notebook
for anywhere between thirteen hundred
and sixteen hundred dollars and that
puts it at a very interesting spot
especially the competition because you
can pick up a faster gaming laptop with
the gtx 1060 and a faster six core
processor for around the same price so I
guess it's ultimately depends on what
you really need I mean are you someone
who's looking for exceptional battery
life in a notebook that has you know
decent performance that can comfortably
push games at 1080p over sixty frames
per second and that's the question that
has to be answered especially by the
user and I think the PS63 is a really
good middle ground between you know a
super-fast high performance gaming
system and an ultrabook
and I think if you're willing to you
know do the memory upgrades on your own
and if you're willing to go past the
speakers and the micro SD card
implementation I don't think you can go
wrong with a notebook like this but I
want to know your thoughts about the PS63 Modern
from MSI what do you guys think
about it first and foremost do you like
the design also are you comfortable with
the combination up at GTX 1050 max Q
and a whiskey a processor I do want to
quickly point out that I did notice a
listing on MSI's website where they're
offering this notebook with a 1650 max Q
GPU although it is not available to buy
right now so I guess we'll just have to
wait and see how that goes but let me
know what you guys think about this
notebook in the comments down below
