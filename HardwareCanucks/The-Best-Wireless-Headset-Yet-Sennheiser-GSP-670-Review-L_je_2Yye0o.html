wonderful GSP 670 in my possession since
Computex so over a month now and son
Heiser makes great audio hardware but
software not so much I haven't actually
been able to use this pair because of
BSO DS and nasty audio distortions the
driver software was even crashing my
video editing programs like the Vinci
resolve when you plug in the USB port
and the CPU usage for the drivers was
over 15% but all that has been resolved
with a new final stable release of the
software so this my friends is my full
experience with San Heiser's first
wireless gaming headset the GSB 6a so I
think wireless audio has always been
important for gaming as it's always been
about that whole cable free convenience
and as with any wireless gaming headset
it's not perfect but the GSP 670 is the
best sounding wireless gaming headset in
my collection well hello there
where'd you come from hey don't matter
it's a back where I'm going I don't
really need a new Mouse right now sure
we'll see everybody loves a 4-way hidden
d-pad and a cool OLED display plus I'm
quiet sensitive at 24,000 dpi plus RGB
you got a try what was I thinking saying
no to you the MM 830 by cool master the
mouse you didn't see coming
check it out below alright so in usual
Sam Heiser fashion accessories are know
all you get is a wireless dongle and a
micro USB charging cable
these are PC and ps4 compatible with a
two-year warranty and in case you need a
bank account clearing these are right
for the job at $350 ouch
but can we just talk about the new
wonderful black color design with a few
tant a neum hints all around the ear
cups gone is the red and black color
scheme from the previous GSP lineup now
is this kind of discreet all matte black
beautiful pair it's kind of weird to do
praised something that there's so almost
boring but gaming headsets normally are
like raw and
was like nicely muted I didn't even
realize the side plates are removable
for potential customization if you 3d
print them or color them yourself as
their current selection is not very
ambitious now the frame is still massive
and bulky and as far as I can tell no
changes have been made to slim it down
and it's only gone up in weight by three
grams versus the GSP 600 however it is
still pretty heavy pair and the flight
weight is all you need then the cloud
flight takes to win the clamping force
is adjustable via the headband like on
previous models that adds or releases
the pressure of the bottom of the ear
cup and if you have a more triangular
face structure this will work well by
allowing the actual ear cups to angle
but even with the slightest pressure on
my face I'm getting a lot more
concentration of pressure at the bottom
of the ear cup instead of the top which
is not really optimal and the only way
to flatten the ear cups is actually to
reduce or collapse sized extensions but
then the heads becomes way too small it
doesn't really fit me and so comfort
wise unfortunately I would take the game
series or the HD series any headset over
the GSP line any day the ear cups are
leatherette with suede contact surface
and a really nice memory foam like
padding that delivers carry good sound
isolation so with any music listening
right now I would not be able to hear my
own finger snaps so if you're into the
whole like completely zoning out the
fact these will not disappoint just be
mindful of your environment now my ears
do not touch the internal wall same
thing with Ebor which is good but when
mike tried them on at Computex his ear
made contact with the driver wall
despite playing around with size
extensions and reed pressure adjustment
the volume wheel on here is like a
fidget spinner it's so smooth and
satisfying and it also acts as your
power off switch when it's in the lowest
volume position with a tactile click
nice son Heiser does not actually
recommend you use this because the
headset goes to sleep when it's inactive
so you don't really need to turn it off
every time you don't use it beside it
there's a smart button to either enable
surround sound mode or switch between
different EQ presets and can't be
assigned in the software with a nice
visual pop-up to indicate what's active
but only on a desktop and not while
you're in game and this notification can
also be turned off and the other wheel
is your chat mix to balance in-game chat
volume on the other side is
my curry is B port for charging and a
slide switch with multi functionalities
like checking battery status with a
single slide or if you hold it for two
seconds it activates pairing mode
between 2.4 gigahertz and Bluetooth mode
and Bluetooth functionality built in
here is excellent value and especially
for the price points however this is not
exactly outdoors friendly so for office
use only
and bluetooth in that setting is a bit
less functional now it is very important
to mention that pairing can only be
activated when the main dongle is not
sending any audio and once I paired with
my iPhone I can listen to Bluetooth as
long as the main PC and dongle is not
sending any audio but as soon as I start
to play anything on the computer
bluetooth gets disconnected or the
headset switches to the dongle because
that always gets priority so
unfortunately there's no physical way to
switch between sources between 2.4
gigahertz and Bluetooth as that is based
on the inactivity
of the main dongle hmm and as far as
audio goes this thing is incredibly
satisfying for its category so we have
really powerful output at full blast
with wonderful detail and just enough
sparkle to hear that every bullet
slicing through air in squad
and with also very clear base hits of
that distance water fire fish the
soundstage is closed but not too narrow
with good indication on the size of your
environment inappropriate positional
cues the cloud flight in comparison just
sounds muddy and it's like what were
they thinking although this thing is
more comfortable while the arctas Pro
Wireless from still series which is the
same price as these at 349 has less of
an impact on the lower end and compared
to my GSP 500 with leather ear cups the
sound signature is actually quite
similar with widest soundstage in the
cleaner signal on the wired pair and
that's where the driver software it's
not complete yet but has a lot of
features by customizing your own EQ
curve and enabling surround sound with
reverberation level adjustment so how
spacious or how much more like echoey
audio gets and you even get a sound test
for audio feedback that cycles between
what you've created versus the default
preset so you can hear before and after
which is quite nice
I prefer surround sound on this pair to
be disabled it does create a wider
soundstage slightly things more distant
but with the too much of a sacrifice in
detail but it has really nice stereo
imaging so like the audio is coming in
front of you and not necessarily like
right here when the surround sound is
disabled inside the microphone tab we
have a few voice enhancers but now what
you listen to is set to OFF so by
default vocal clarity is good for
wireless pair but the bass and the
detail is not exactly on par with what
you get with the same microphone but on
a wired pair like the GSP 500 or 600 and
this is where the GSP 500 sounds like
the same microphone on the different
body and a wired connection so here you
don't have the same properties in terms
of driver software outside of whatever
is on your motherboard but
I feel like the depth and the clarity on
the vocals is a lot more natural not as
compressed as what you get with the
wireless pair but this way I guess it's
wired so it will always be better what
you listen to now is the worm preset
that I unfortunately do not hear any
difference between that and off which is
strange because it's supposed to give me
more like a broadcast quality vocals and
I don't feel like the software is doing
anything and the same thing can be said
with the clear preset which is what
you're hearing now let me know if you're
hearing a difference because I do not
furthermore in that mid section you can
adjust gain side tone and noise gate so
maxing out the side tone lets you
actually hear what you're speaking and
right now for example everything being
so quiet it's actually really nice to
hear myself and not be really muted
while noise gate lets you actually pick
at what level the microphone starts to
pick up the noise so if you're in a
really loud environment or if you're
speaking loudly increasing the noise
gate will help to eliminate those lower
volume noises as for noise cancellation
I feel like they've done a really good
job here so right now I am typing on the
keyboard and this is with it off the mid
preset has a pleasant character without
too much processing on my vocals while
trying to further isolate whatever is
happening outside of that vocal range
while maxing out the slider changes the
vocal properties of your voice that's
understandable there's a lot more
processing going on as it tries to
cancel out anything that's not like
right over here and now we're back to no
noise cancellation with default settings
so you can hear what it sounds like
before the next microphone and here's
what another wireless headset sounds
like this is the HyperX cloud flight and
fantastic all-around pair but the
microphone quality on here compared the
GSP 670 first of all it's not as
sensitive so it doesn't pick up my voice
as loud and depth clarity and bass is
all better on the GSP 670 and lastly the
settings tab is mainly used for updates
and the handy shortcut for the sound
control panel brilliant
they still need some work to do to-- as
the visual barrier percentage indicator
does not sync with the battery
percentage voice prompt on the headset
itself and the software must be running
on your PC to enable surround sound or
profile switches with the smart button
otherwise it does nothing and on a ps4
since there are no drivers this is a
stereo headset only and lastly battery
life so it's not the best but it's not
terrible some Heiser claims up to 20
hours and in my continuous usage at max
volume
I got about 16 hours so I guess I'll be
fine but the good thing is the standby
time on this thing is amazing up to 30
days and the headset shuts off by itself
when there's no audio coming through so
nice battery savings built in by default
and so for conclusion I would say the
GSP 670 is the best sounding wireless
headset currently out in the market
right now but it's not for everybody as
you can see the fit is a bit ridiculous
and might not fit larger heads that have
maybe a little bit more square software
needs work despite having a lot of cool
features and also not having a physical
toggle between 2.4 gigahertz and
Bluetooth it's like why there's a lot of
space on here and would eliminate any
guesswork especially because we do have
a Bluetooth signal on the right beside
the volume wheel but you think that it
would illuminate with the when the
Bluetooth is connected but nope and of
course you got to pay the premium for
the wireless freedom that by the way is
actually one of the worst I've tested in
a wireless headset so beyond 4 meters
with a direct line of sight to the
dongle the headset cuts out with nasty
distortion or just completely loses
audio and through just one single wall
whereas other headsets that I've tested
even like $50.00 headset have much
better range so not exactly sure why
this is happening with a $350 pair but I
don't really want to end it on a
negative note because all wireless gear
have some form of compromises but the
oddity on this thing is the new wireless
standard with a GSP 670 all right guys
some to meet you hope you enjoyed let me
know what headset you rockin Wireless
are wired
