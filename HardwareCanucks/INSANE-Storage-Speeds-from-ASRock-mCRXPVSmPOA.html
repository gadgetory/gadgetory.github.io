and while we were walking through the
computation show floor we spotted a
couple of interesting things at the
azrog booth no it wasn't a motherboard
or a graphics card but rather storage
demo that showed some absolutely epic
speeds but before we get to that I want
to thank fantex coolermaster &amp;amp;
Thermaltake for sponsoring our Computex
2018 coverage okay about that epic
storage test basically asrock had a test
system set up with their x29 and
professional gaming i 9xc motherboard
and this yep that's the same as rock
ultra quad nvme raid card we saw at this
year's CES but it's now being used and
in ridiculously fast system it uses an
integrated fan and a metal shroud that
makes contact with the internal SSDs via
thermal pads for increased cooling
capacity but it was the internals that
blew our minds inside where four of
Intel's new 380 gigabyte nvme octane 905
PSS deeds placed in a raid array these
are actually some of the most advanced
SSDs currently on the market and it
delivers blazing fast speeds this is
actually the first time we were seeing
this drive in action since the 388
gabite was just announced at Computex
basically it's equipped with Intel's new
3d crosspoint memory that is not only
fast but durable - each of these drives
is rated at 10 Drive writes per day
which is crazy considering most standard
SSDs have rating up between one and
three these four SSDs ended up hitting
speeds of almost 11 gigabytes per second
per reads and 10 gigabytes per second
writes this is kind of the array that
would be amazing for creative editors or
anyone who needs ultra quick access to
massive files do you guys see any use
for this in your own workflows let us
know in the comments down below
now another computer that we were
actually able to finally get our hands
on is the latest update to Intel's often
memory ecosystem as a small refresher
opt in memory allows you to boost the
performance of slower SSDs or hard
drives by caching bits of information on
ultra-fast memory by using an algorithm
that learns your habits they're able to
improve the load times of your most used
applications
back when it was first launched opt in
memory was a bit limited since it could
only accelerate your primary drive or
partition through its caching
algorithm now Intel is allowing the
optin memory modules like the opt in SSD
800 P the opt in SSD 900p drives to
boost performance of any secondary
drives or partitions as well this is
pretty big news for anyone who runs a
smaller capacity SSD as their primary C
Drive in parallel with a larger capacity
hard drive for their game installs and
other space hungry files in this case a
Scirocco is using a pretty slow 1
terabyte Seagate hard drive and an opt
in SSD in the background both partitions
could easily hit over one gigabytes per
second read speed just amazing so our
visit to asrock wouldn't have been
complete without at least one
motherboard and this one certainly stood
out say hello to the Jade 3455 pro BTC
plus a pretty unique motherboard that's
targeted at you guessed it miners who
want to run a huge number of graphics
cards in this case you can run up to 8
GPUs off of PCI slots which according to
asrock is a much more stable setup than
linking them up via USB headers like
asus did with their latest mining
centric motherboard each one of those
slots also has a dedicated molex power
connector with that being said there's
three USB headers dedicated towards
additional graphics card support if you
want to expand the mining capacity to 11
GPUs since mining on GPUs don't require
a huge amount of CPU horsepower as well
integrated an inexpensive Apollo Lake
processor onto the board the other
interesting thing about this motherboard
is its form factor honestly guys this
thing looks like a long portfolio and
it's definitely won't fit into a
standard ATX case the j34 55 pro is
meant to be installed into an open test
station environment where form factors
are less of a concern so that's it from
as well guys it was really cool to see
some of these storage setups which
target very different use case scenarios
but what do you guys think is opting
something that you would look into now
that its capabilities have been expanded
into its options for you let us know in
the comments down below and don't forget
to check out these additional videos
from Computex 2018 i'm Ebor with
hardware canucks thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
