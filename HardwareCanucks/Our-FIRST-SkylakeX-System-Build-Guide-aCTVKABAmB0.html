has seen a lot of bills 13 to be exact
but when the Harbach next team got
together at CES this year we realized
that there was a missing platform among
all those systems somehow skylake X and
the X 299 platform were missing from our
system setups and yes you guys called us
out in the comments you wanted to see
what Intel's high-end desktop platform
could offer I didn't have all these sky
like X processors I wanted to test so we
reached out to Intel and they agreed to
help us put together this video now
before I get too far I want to explain
that my sky larkings journey is gonna be
spread across three videos so you guys
can actually follow along through the
process since I haven't built with X 299
yet
this video is gonna be a recap of my own
research into the platform and its
capabilities as I choose the right
components that fit my needs hopefully a
lot of information in the next few
minutes will also help you make the
right decisions as well but remember sky
like X is part of a flexible ecosystem
that can offer you everything from an
ultra high-end system to a compact ITX
setup so it was kind of love at first
sight you know there's really nothing
like this exterior I love the metallic
color the tinted glass panel the RGB
fans at the front it's basically a
see-through case and who doesn't love
that your graphics card can go vertical
the top is Radiator friendly and the
right side is so unique when exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
age 500p my coolermaster check it out in
description below
speaking of picking hardware actually
building the system and running
benchmarks that'll be done in the second
video of the series from there in video
3 I have something a bit different
planned with tricks and that will get
the most out of your systems with a huge
number of processing threads but the
first thing I want to talk about is the
processors and for those I have to thank
Intel because without their support none
of this would have been possible sitting
right at the top of Intel skylake X
lineup is the $2,000 970 980 Extreme
Edition which has 18 cores and 36
threads making it the highest
performance desktop processor available
right now it operates at a base clock of
2.6 gigahertz and can run its turbo
frequency to four point
four gigahertz but Intel also gave all
their high-end Scylla qex processors a
third gear with turbo boost max 3.0
technology which basically identifies
cores within each CPU that can run at a
higher sustained frequency than the
others it will then take advantage of
the thermal and power head room to push
speeds even higher and in the case of
the I 979 80 Hz that means it can hit
4.6 gigahertz in the right conditions
next is the I 979 60 X which goes for
about $1,700 and features 16 cores with
32 threads operating at a pace clock of
2.8 gigahertz a turbo of 4.2 gigahertz
and turbo boost 3.0 that could hit up to
four point four gigahertz the I 979 40 X
is a little bit expensive at $1,400 it
has 28 threads that operates at a
slightly higher frequency but otherwise
it has the same specifications as the
other high-end Scylla Keck CPUs to close
out the i-9 series there's heai 979 20 X
which has 12 cores and 24 threads a base
clock of 2.9 gigahertz and a turbo
frequency of 4.3 gigahertz and 4.4
gigahertz do not that it features a
slightly lower TDP finally there's the I
970 900 X a processor that a lot of you
may be looking closely due to its price
and large number of processing threads
what I like about this is it's higher
bass and turbo 3.0 speeds which should
be a good fit for gaming scenarios and
it still has 44 PCI 3.0 lanes from the
processor the skylight X family also has
a bit more budget-friendly processors as
well and they could act as a great
starting point for an impressive system
based off the X 299 platform these are
the i7 78 20x and the i7 7800 X the 78
20x uses 8 cores and 16 threads while
running at the highest speeds of any
skelux processor one thing to take into
account is that it only has 28 PCI 3.0
lanes but that shouldn't be too much of
a limitation unless you plan on running
two GPUs or a whole array of nvme SSDs
but then again epic setups are what's
callek X is meant for at $389 the i7
7800 X is the least expensive processor
in this lineup
it has 12 friends and a respectable 3.5
gigahertz base clock
but it's 4 gigahertz turbo speed is the
lowest of the bunch and unfortunately
there's no support for turbo boost max
3.0 so I know that's a lot of
information to digest but it looks like
intel has hit every possible usage case
scenario with these processors I can't
blame them either since people have
different needs for example if you're
like me needs to process parallel
workloads like rendering gaming and
streaming at the same time then
something like this the i9 79-80 Extreme
Edition processor could be a good fit
sure it may cost $2,000 but that cost
could be justified for professionals who
know that every minute counts in their
workflow meanwhile a processor like the
i9 70 900 X combines pricing the
possibility of using up to 20 threads
and higher frequencies and I see this as
a great option for someone who's on a
smaller budget but most importantly they
can also get to experience and create
in-game frame rates you see these were
all the things that went through my head
as I was approaching on how to you know
put this bill together because fun
factors are making this video I still
haven't decided on which CPU to choose
you know should I go the 18 core
processor or maybe the 10 core CPU yeah
it's it's definitely gonna be an
interesting one for sure now I also
wanted to talk about motherboards since
just like the processors there are ton
of options and various price points and
sizes and with different capabilities
let's start with something that just
serve Ryan and it shows how versatile
this platform is so check this out this
is the asrock x2 99e ITX / AC and it's
the smallest high-end desktop board
currently available when we first saw
this boy at CES I was inspired to create
something with it
asrock has built a ton of features onto
this board like three ME ME ME two slots
two USB 3.1 gen2 ports six SATA 6 ports
support for octane technology and a
wireless AC module but before thinking
this board is for you remember the
limited space means many of ex-students
best features can't be included for
example there's only a single PCIe x16
slot so ultra fast SSDs that means a PCI
slot at Intel's own 900 P series can't
be installed so the memory needs to be
used as well so memory choices will be
limited and they could potentially
become expensive as well I should also
mention there the up come
x2 99 IT exports who own support or
walking on 165 watt CPUs or these 16 and
18 korskaya X processors because of the
limited space they have for the input
power regulators the azrog Board does
support 18 core chips and can even
overclock them but you might need
additional cooling on PWM so overheating
doesn't happen especially if you are
using a liquid cooler these x2 nine-nine
IT exports will likely be a great fit
for people who want to maximize CPU
power in a compact case while running a
single GPU but what if you want to step
up a bit well that's where MITx boards
come in right now the asrock x2 99 ITX
AC is the only ultra small form-factor
motherboard available and M ATX options
are also pretty limited as a matter of
fact there are very few micro ATX
motherboards available for any platform
right now but this is the MSI x2 99m
gaming Pro carbon AC and even though
that isn't too much larger than ITX it
almost has all the features Intel
skylake X platform is known for almost
but not all so there are still
sacrifices you'll make if you want to
use these processors in a more compact
set up basically on this board when a 44
Lane processor is installed you get to
full speed x16 slots for dual graphics
and a bottom back slot that takes 8
lanes since the board isn't that high
there's not enough space to install
another GPU there's also just 4 memory
slots instead of the usual 8 which means
the MSI x2 9 and can only support up to
64 gigabytes of memory rather than 128
gigabytes storage has been limited to
since there are only two m dot 2 and
mimi slots and no you da - connector for
intel's high speed SSD but like I said a
lot of expansion can be done if you use
the PCI slots the MSI micro ATX board
isn't unique in these things either so
make sure you research smaller x2 + 99
boards before assuming that they will
all have the features you want 4x 299
now if you want to get the absolute most
out of X 299 and don't want to worry
about your systems overall footprint ATX
and ATX boards will be the way to go to
be honest with you there are many ATX
motherboards that cost less than the
micro ATX and ITX options that have
talked about
but the smaller form factor designs have
a premium for their compactness I won't
go through all the options here since
right now there are about 50 different
options in the ATX category alone but
let me say this if you have a specific
set of needs and a set budget there is
likely an X to 9 and point out there
that will meet them if you want or
ability a huge number of options for
professionals the asu's WS series will
have you covered everyone from Oris to
asus and msi and asrock have something
for gamers and there's even a huge
number of budget focus boards that cover
necessities another big investment into
any new system these days is memory what
you need here is a good quad channel
memory kit while you can use a dual
channel setup on Scylla X it isn't
something that should be done since the
negative performance impact can be huge
for example I give it a try in Adobe
Premiere and my running times increased
by almost 50% with a dual channel kit so
I would highly recommend going
quad-channel of a dual channel for
skylark X so guys we know that Intel's
high-end desktop platform needs quad
channel memory but which kit should you
choose there are a ton of options but
they're really boiled down to what your
needs are heavy multitasking will
require a minimum of 32 gigabytes while
more intensive professional applications
could even stress this platform to own
the 128 gigabyte limit the memory
frequency will also play a pretty big
part in these things for example with 32
gigabytes of memory running at 26 66
megahertz I got an average of 170 frames
per second with an average minimum of
$135 per second switching to 3600
megahertz at the same time ins boosted
that to 188 frames per second with
smoother minimums of 155 even Adobe
Premiere benefited from the faster
memory but not by much rendering a
one-minute 4k video went from 75 seconds
at 26 66 megahertz to 70 seconds with
the faster memory personally I like the
combination of speed and capacity for
gaming and more professional tasks that
means a 32 gigabyte or 64 gigabyte kid
that's as fast as I can afford will be
amazing right now the sweet spot seems
to be a 32 gigabyte setup that runs at
3200 megahertz but that might change
since Ram prices are all over the place
these days
if you can afford to step up to 64
gigabytes at higher speeds jump on it
okay so another challenge that I had
when putting together my skylight kick
system was figuring out the cooling
situation now while I won't recommend
any specific models here I can point you
towards what I learned after testing a
few processors at both stock and
overclock settings so basically the i7
7800 models can be easily handled by a
single all-in-one liquid cooling
solution or a basic tower style he think
even a bit of old clocking shouldn't be
a problem
provided you keep the voltage under 1.2
volts but remember that skylight X
builds up heat faster as you increase
the voltage and the clock speeds
especially on I nine CPUs so that's
something to keep in mind when you
consider overclocking these processors
and those I nine processors need some
pretty substantial cooling in just their
stock form I would recommend at the
minimum a large tower style heater sink
or dual fan all-in-one solution if you
intend on even a small overclock or
running at stock frequencies aiming for
even higher speeds and voltage increases
temperatures output like crazy so for
series overclocking you should think
about triple BIOS or building a custom
water cooling loop my big word of advice
here is to not underestimate skylight
X's ability to push out heat and upsize
your cooling solution so by now we
learned that skylight X is a serious
performer but we also learned that
cooling these processors is just as
important because if you're planning on
overclocking these processors you want
to make sure that the temperatures are
well within reach one more thing that
needs to be taken into account is the
power supply because they play a huge
role when it comes to powering these
CPUs so these processors are actually
very efficient from a performance per
watt standpoint but the sheer number of
cores means power consumption is
something to take note of for my build I
ended up following a pretty simple
strategy if I was going to use one of
the 18 16 or 14 core processors along
with two graphics cards and a few
storage drives I wanted at least a 900
watt PSU or maybe a bit more since
overclocking could push input needs even
further that may seem like an overkill
but I would want to have some breathing
room for upgrades sometime down the road
as well
using one of the other skylake CPUs like
these 79 20x or below with a single
high-end graphics card with lower my
needs to about 650 watts meanwhile that
set up with a second GPU would likely
need about 800 watts to be safe and
allow for overclocking as well so there
you guys have it that's my little
journey through researching and doing a
bit of testing with skylake X the only
thing that's left to do is pick the
components and proceed with the build
but as I mentioned in the beginning of
this video that will be in the second
video of this series so stay tuned for
that
I'll also be comparing some rendering
results to my current workstation PC
featuring the Rison 7 1700 X but most
importantly I'll be fine-tuning the
components in this upcoming X 299 build
to give me a better editing experience
because currently my main PC is giving
me a lot of issues especially when
editing the video so definitely stay
tuned for part 2 I'm even with hurricane
X thank you so much for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
