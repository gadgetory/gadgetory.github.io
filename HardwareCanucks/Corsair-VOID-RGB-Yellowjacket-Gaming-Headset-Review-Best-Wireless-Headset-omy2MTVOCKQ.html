practical design maturity fans not just

hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Hard
Rock Canucks and on the review table
today is a product that will for sure
divide the consumer base I'm saying this
because we are at a point in time where
there is no escape or potentially
useless features entering into anything
gaming and I'd like to start a
discussion about how you feel of RGB
lighting into peripherals in general but
what about headsets is there space for
RGB lighting on something that you never
see or never even care about the courser
void RGB wireless headset is under
analysis for this video
Corsair is introducing a variety of
additions to span the largest consumer
base for the void headset line
everything from the black stereo version
to USB version in white and black and
Wireless RGB addition with black and
this Yellow Jacket addition the one
retailing for 130 and 150 dollars u.s.
respectively the yellow combination
initially did not sit well with me
especially because of the multicolor
elements on the ear cups it is a simple
logo illumination with that broken down
strip underneath but I'm sure many would
agree of this RGB customization is not
exactly welcome on a yellow body headset
now there is a black version for the RGB
wireless Edition which makes a bit more
sense for color customization because
you're not obstructed by the massive
yellow body but to be honest the yellow
has kind of grown on me I mean you'd
still need to probably populate your
entire peripherals with coursers yellow
line peripherals for the void to feel in
place but even if you're wondering why
Corsair would attempt such a color
scheme and it's all about branding
eSports and video game streaming is
booming so this is sort of one of those
best marketing practices for immediate
brand cognition and so moving on the
build quality is not all 100% but there
are some aluminum integrations for the
swivel joints but the rest of your
construction is plastic and while it's
good to maintain a lightweight profile
you don't necessarily get the confident
sets like the soil joints are a little
bit loose the same story with the
microphone that has a built in rotation
steps but they feel so weak and I
question if at some point they'll just
give out the microphone is not flexible
and it's not removable and I feel put
the headphones down the wrong way
several times and something just might
snap all of the controls are in the left
ear cup include the power switch and the
mic mute right below that is also used
to enable or disable side tone which is
the microphones feedback to you so you
can hear what you're saying during game
time I love this feature there's a
swivel button for the volume control
that has a built-in click and that
allows you to change EQ on the fly by
quickly pressing it and an audio cue
will play corresponding to any of the
five EQ presets and long pressing it to
enable or disable Dolby Surround again
with a distinct audio cue finally
there's a microUSB underneath to charge
the headset which you can do without
interrupting your audio playback if
connected to a computer or if the hub is
connected now the completely
disappointing aspect of the Void
Wireless is the fact that you cannot use
them in Wired mode I understand the
convenience of buying something Wireless
to use them wirelessly but the you micro
USB here is only for charging you cannot
pass any data through it so in order to
you for you to receive the audio signal
between the headset and in the computer
you have to use the USB hub and it would
have been great to just connect the USB
here in case you forget the hub
somewhere else and still want to use the
Void Wireless the second biggest
disappointment is battery life so I
started writing the script around 10
a.m. this morning I did some gaming I
was listening to music throughout the
entire time so the headphone was
constantly working on something except
for one hour when I was just left at
idle it wasn't passing any audio through
it at 4:00 p.m. six hours later I get
the low battery beep so the battery must
have been below 25% at the time so at 6
hours for just listening to music and
gaming with RGB enabled you won't even
be able to sit through an entire day of
land if that was the case but corsair
recommends if you are uninterested in
the RGB lighting effects you can disable
all the lighting on the headset to
greatly
and battery life which also disables the
very helpful notifications on the
microphone by the way so that's not cool
so I redid my tests and instead of
lasting about six hours with the RGB
enabled I could easily last more than
twenty five hours of constant use with
the headset so 25 hours there was a
signal coming through at all times and
so my said my advice
turn off RGB I choose battery life over
some blinking lights which are nothing
special by the way you can choose any
color you want sure the sixteen point
seven million colors and the eleven
effects are just some variation of
blinking speed or breathing there's
actually no way to link lighting
behavior to the audio source and the
fact that it drains the battery this
quick it should just be turned off now
comfort wise the are sized adjustable
and given their front front leading
nature like so throughout my gaming
session I found them to slightly start
to slide off forward cupping my ears in
the process and making concentrating
some pressure unpleasant pressure behind
my ears and partially the reason I think
the ear cups are not optimally shaped as
it narrows near the back and regardless
of how I try to position the ear cups
there's just no way the void would cover
my entire ear without pressing on some
specific part the ear cup stole our
removable thoughts could be replaced in
the future and I like this material
because it can breathe there's zero
issues with sweat or heat concentration
but it's not the most pleasant material
for long-term use and for those with
sensitive skin I would say just be aware
and I really wish that Corsair would
have included extra velour pads so you
can substitute this if you are not
totally comfortable with this material
especially 450 bucks the microphone
rotates only there are two LEDs in the
front to indicate the status of the mic
mute and which eq setting you're using
and i think the intent here is for those
lights to be out of sight but still in
your peripheral vision so you can see
them unfortunately i can't even see them
despite where i position the microphone
so what I found out to do is if I mute
my microphone right now
I can bring my hand closer there to see
if the LED reflection is there and that
would indicate if I mute the microphone
and also if I have the site tone enabled
I could clearly hear if the microphone
is muted and that's helping a lot
unfortunately the microphone doesn't
sound that great it's fine for in-game
chat and talking to your teammates but
nowhere the quality that you would
expect for professional gaming
commentary now this being a wireless
headset the special edition comes with
an extension base to broaden your range
into which you plug the USB hub and the
2.4 gigahertz signal has a range of
about 12 meters with the line of sight
which remained clean up to 5 meters but
then start to experience some crackle as
walls and other abstractions were on the
way so let's get into sound quality
despite being yellow feature you can say
pointless RGB lighting and being not
100% satisfactory for comfort I was
genuinely happy in the sound signature
considering its Wireless and gaming
oriented the wireless signal was
completely clean there was no hum or
audible interference and almost like I'm
wearing a wired headphone there are a
couple of built in profiles that are
excellent with delivery of exactly what
you hear with pure direct bass boost
that lifts off the low-end regen super
well without muffling the sound
signature and hitting the bass just
perfectly for a bit more power and
impact for games yet with distinct and
clear high tones FPS competitor mode was
my favorite it brings up the mids so you
hear your environment very well clear
Chad brings up the treble but I didn't
find that mode interesting and lastly
movie theater that's more V curve now
for music playback I left it at the
simple stereo mode with pure direct
sound which was and didn't give me any
coloration which was fine for music but
for movies and gaming I enabled Dolby
surround sound which was fantastic I
really enjoyed my experience with
finally with virtual surround sound and
the EQ profiles that Corsair has
provided here absolutely fantastic so I
used the FPS competitor mode battlefield
4 it was a 32 min server with a hardcore
mode so you need to rely on audio cues
to know what
the enemy's coming from and if
somebody's coming behind you or
something and I could easily hear what's
coming around me directional systems
with absolutely phenomenal you can
clearly feel the distance of how far the
audio sources are from you so that's the
beauty of Dolby Surround
audio is not concentrated in the
headphones and hear but it feels like
they're bigger speakers right in front
of you and there's very good stereo
projection that helps with that
directional assistance now the beauty of
the EQ tuner is the fact that you can
adjust certain settings if you are not
totally satisfied with the bass you can
still bring that up and really fine-tune
the sound signature to what you like to
hear for your games
and there were still plenty of juice
left inside the headphone for higher
volumes I gained that 60% volume that
gave me very good you know level of what
I want to hear without blasting my ears
off but turned it off for more for while
I was listening to music and also movies
without introducing any interference or
noise or any humming in the signal and
that is very impressive and so in
conclusion the Void Wireless is the best
wireless gaming headset that I've
listened to there's a clean signal
excellent EQ presets full bass extension
and clear mid-range RGB on the headset
is excellent for marketing and brand
recognition but point is to consumers
especially with such heavy battery drain
the microphone quality is subpar both in
quality and form and no different
material ear cushions are available and
it seems many premium elements are void
excuse the pun as they sound fantastic
but don't completely satisfy in any
other area so guys thank you so much for
watching this concludes the review of
the void wireless RGB from Corsair let
us know what you think of this color
scheme and of course the RGB stuff would
you get something like this in the
compromise of massive battery drain or
not leave your thoughts in the comments
