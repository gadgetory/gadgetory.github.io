our first factory tour Computex doing
your first to wherever first factory
tour yes that's correct
let's do it huge thanks to our Computex
sponsors for sending us out here
shout out to nvidia fantex and cix and
msi one of the great advantages of doing
tours that are not directly in taipei
city is the fact that you get to travel
around and see the beautiful nature that
is that surrounds you know these
highways and stuff it's actually pretty
beautiful
and we are at Inlet power supply testing
all done here this is the EMI chamber
with this big antenna it's firing into
this table behind here which can rotate
and then they measure the mi for cases
and servers look at this room so we're
inside the semi anechoic chamber and
it's semi because we have the room that
is normally the way he goes but the
floor isn't treated normally so we're
gonna spend some time in here and
eventually we'll be able to hear our own
heart beating and like blood flowing
which is very strange
it is very quiet so Andy tells me here
this this room is used as a punishment
room if somebody's not doing their job
right people come here and they stay
here and wonder what type of um so this
is right now 27 degrees in here it'd be
really cool to see what what audio
levels we get cases fans and power
supplies are tested here for noise
pretty cool pretty cool and look at how
thick this door is
so this room is where all the cases are
born case design spot we put all these
and things in the middle how many yeah
this is the s frame right yeah yeah
people we well look at all this aluminum
so we get to see a pre-release version
of this case which is launching tomorrow
so we would pop publishing this when the
NDA list but look at this pretty cool
very England like with this this frame
but what's happening with all the fans
on the lighting look at this so cool and
there's this little box it's got like a
hub right I can actually adjust the
brightness just so the secret to our
productivity today we don't have many
meetings but we're kind of back and
forth back and forth we don't have much
time in the hotel to keep editing or
finishing that it so what we did is come
back to the hotel for an hour finish
what about like 80% of the edit and now
go back to a second meeting so that we
can be productive
I could hear them Justin roiland and a
lot of time so as usual inside the
fantasy suite there's plenty to film one
two three four five five cases and
especially with the project 916 which is
now the project elite quite on the
project the end through elite it has
been quite a fun shoots almost like a
mini review and it's just giving us
giving us exciting about finally
building in some inside something like
this and seeing all the progression
between what we saw with a 9/16 and CES
versus this almost almost complete
project is so fantastic because of fan
TX what's up guys okay so this is a
chair from vertigo and it is the most
comfortable chair that I have sat in yes
teaser the camera is fogged up again
wrap
and so as eber washes his face right
behind this computer this is going to be
a conclusion for this episode because I
want to show you how we handle video
production in a hotel with limited
lighting so first we have this low light
on the side so that's blasting power
into that chair so it's giving me a bit
of a highlight on this side we have the
c100 here and we have my big light so
bouncing light off the wall for a pretty
decent lighting setup especially with
the c100 that is a total light low light
monster so guys thank you so much for
watching this vlog I hope you enjoyed it
tomorrow is the grave reveal of our
third member as he is on his way to
Taipei right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
