would best suit your cpu it actually
depends on several parameters but in
general all in one cooling solutions are
far superior in this video let's play
out a scenario you're using an air
cooler and you're wondering what
benefits there are to upgrade to an all
enclosed liquid cooler come along to
find out the dark base 900 may be the
most innovative case of the year with a
built-in Qi charger interior lighting
tempered glass that can be installed on
either side and a fully modular interior
that can be inverted if you so desire be
quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below I've been rocking
the cooler master hyper 212 evo for
quite some time it is one of the best
coolers for the price and only $40 USD
with simple installation and smaller
footprint but a 240 millimeter radiator
with high performance fans and low
profile CPU block is definitely
appealing to dissipate all that
rendering heat
we'll use the new a IO from cooler
master the master liquid pro 240 that's
three times the price of the evo at 120
dollars the liquid pro remains
competitive for a 240 millimeter
radiator and the purpose of this upgrade
is pretty simple I want to compare sound
levels as air you'll have the reputation
for quite performance and then witness
temperature differences with the case
open as many users take off the side
panel for better cooling and will also
test a side panel close to simulate
harsher conditions for each cooler all
this to conclude if paying three times
the price of the a IO is really worth it
the pro 240 has a few unique features
that's worth mentioning first the dual
chamber design on the CPU block is
engineered to transfer heat a lot
quicker meaning there's high emphasis on
letting cool stuff go in making proper
contact with the CPU and the heat that's
dissipated from it channels for
different chamber which ultimately makes
cooling more efficient second the fins
on the radiator are designed in a square
shape this is supposed to create a
greater surface area for the absorption
of heat but also allow for expansive
airflow tearing down the 212 Evo was not
that difficult I had to remove the RAM
sticks in order to access the fans and
the screws on the mounting bracket
followed by a quick wipe of the thermal
paste installing the pro 240 is familiar
as with other a IO
first I install the mounting bracket for
socket 2011 then I moved on to the fans
and lowering the block onto the
motherboard thanks to the low nature of
the block thus cooler can be installed
even with all RAM sticks in place
radiator installation was a piece of
cake allowing the appropriate mounting
holes with the case tighten that with
the included screws and you're done
so was this all worth the extra price
for my overclocked 4930 k at 4.5
gigahertz at one point for two volts I
used I to 64 to monitor the CPU temps
and with the side panel open and closed
the results were totally surprising with
the panel open the pro 240 ran six
degrees cooler at load than the 212 Evo
and I did notice after a few minutes of
stress testing the CPU started to
throttle on the Evo 212 installed after
switching back to the pro 240 it was
table like a champ closing the panel the
pro 240 outperformed the 212 Evo with a
9 degree difference but check out that
massive temperature difference between
open and closed side panel once again
open and close the acoustic performances
also surprised me take a listen for
yourselves
I wasn't able to differentiate the noise
level when both pillars were running
idle but switching to load the AIO
seemed to be the loudest among the two
which makes sense because the two static
pressure fans mounted onto the radiator
we're doing some serious work cooling
the 6 chord chip so to no surprise the
massive radiator space on the AIO over
the tiny evil cooler delivered better
temperatures across the board but what
surprised us is how well the evo stacked
up at this price point if we were
running at stock clocks for the CPU I
wouldn't need the a IO and it would
short handle and overclocked I three and
i-5 - plus it brings down the cost of
your PC and so that concludes my quest
to find out whether an AIO was worth the
premium price looking at the results in
my case it's very clear that going for
an all-in-one liquid cooler for my 49
30k was ideal because considering how
much voltage were throwing at it to keep
the overclock stable it's so much worth
it it almost feels standard purchasing
an all-in-one cooler for any build but
as we've shown here
simple CPU towers still have their place
inside a case I'm a bar with harvick an
axe thank you so much for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
