just the litter with because today we've
got something really spend our you
seriously presenting with that hair hey
you be quiet you want me to be silent is
801 and go base your accusations
elsewhere so we're worried what I want
to do what I want to do today is attempt
to build a super quiet system running
around 40 DB a which is the noise
pressure decibel levels of like a
library so that is definitely quiet
using all be quiet components I mean it
is in the name after all so let's see if
we're successful right after this
then you enter max lick fusion is their
first addressable RGB all-in-one cooler
with a standard 240 ml rad an absolutely
beautiful RGB ring elimination on the
fence and the pump to highlight that
unique flow indicator through the
transparent top check out the lick
fusion down below now I want to preface
this video by saying that making a
silent system isn't all about the
enclosure it's about the balance and the
combination of all your hardware fan
speed rpm you know are you getting coral
wine from your GPU or not and like other
things that introduce noise in terms of
like airflow restriction and that air
being turbulent and therefore causing
noise so it's not necessarily all about
the case but the case definitely helps
and you know what helps us all the parts
are used in this video will be linked in
description below so that is our
affiliate stuff helps us out make sure
to check it out if you want to maneuver
yourself into that silence right alright
so this entire project is quite
interesting to me because we have the 99
hundred K which is super hot so how do
you approach balancing out silent
operation of your entire system yet
maintaining good temperatures number two
is that we have the RT X 2080 I and the
new z3 90 Taichi motherboard from asrock
that perfectly blend together in terms
of color coordination that is something
that I'm super excited and because be
quiet is kind of at the core of the
system we have their new silent base 801
and I actually think this is my favorite
be quiet case so
for just because it's not super
expensive it's $149 for totally solid
side panels or the ten dollar premium
for the tempered glass side panel it
still offers the you know inverted
motherboard layout like we saw with the
dark base 700 and the 900 Pro and so I
think it encompasses all those features
into a pretty decent overall silent PC
but of course airflow restriction is a
thing and they have to kind of balance
out silent focus so like these little
air pockets on the side are there to
prevent noise from leaking out
but then there's definitely that hit on
airflow it does come with three
140,000,000 rings two fans toward the
front and one of the rear and the cool
thing is that this entire like mid-tower
frame can accommodate still quite a lot
of airflow and water cooling options you
can fit like up to a 420 radiator in the
front and up to a 360 up top
if you interesting changes that we see
with this 801 enclosure is that the
front panel is no longer brushed
aluminum like we see on pretty much
every single be quiet case here it's
almost like sandblasted steel so cool
texture to look at and also it doesn't
leave any finger marks also the frame is
almost like enclosed as you can see at
the bottom there is no gap like we
normally see with case feet instead case
feet are always built in and there are
small little gaps for airflow so you
could potentially put this on the carpet
but I think this design choice is mainly
made for silence but this also means you
cannot pick up the case like you
normally would be able to by the front
because there's no gaps there and don't
try to lift it by the little gap in the
front panel because that is how you
actually remove the front panel and
there is your access to the giant bottom
dust filter the top panel is very much
closed off for ventilation except for
those few strips at the back but they
have raised the top panels so that if
there is any airflow coming out it will
not necessarily bounce back there are
some ventilation strips all along the
top that you don't see but they're on
the sides so with a low rpm fan like we
have setup here
the temperatures are actually pretty
decent I also really like their new side
panel mount with a button at the back to
release the side panels and you kind of
have to just align them and
pop them back in so reinstallation is
easy and it gives you that beautiful non
interrupted glass on the side and a
simple solid panel on the other you can
also swap the side panels for that
inverted motherboard layout but also if
you want to showcase your cable
management work put the glass panel on
the other side and be good to go
the interior is very much the same as
what we've seen with dark bass 700 so a
nice power supply shroud with modular
plates up top that you can remove to
either give you extra space at the front
for the radio to fit through or clear up
some additional room for ventilation for
the power supply if it's facing up you
can also put a fan there so plenty of
options and you can close them off as
you go we also have these five plastic
covers that go over top your hard drive
mounts we have three metal caddies
included so you can use them for storage
and you can also extend them slightly if
you let's say need to route your USB
cable like I have here with the USB 3
and this case does not support EA TX
motherboards so keep that in mind we
also have a fan controller at the back
for 6 fans so there's either powered by
SATA or a PWM cable via your motherboard
and you control that via the toggle on
the top IO for auto having the PWM
connection and then one two three for
those three speeds here we also have
three USB ports two of which are USB 3
power reset buttons and audio jacks and
obviously this is being part of the
silent base series we have very thick
noise dampening material on the rear
panel and at the top and in the front
panel too so it's pretty much spread all
around and actually be quiet started a
selling sound dampening material first
and it's kind of great to see it really
been thickened up for this edition
versus what we see on like the dark bass
series where it is much thinner alright
enough about the case the rest of the
components include the silent bloop 360
which is definitely needed for the
really hot 9900 kay and to power that
entire thing we have the dark power pro
11 1200 watt power supply so that thing
is also extremely quiet and since we
have like a pretty enthusiast 'im I
don't want any noise coming from the
power supply which has a really good fan
and then it's completely silent I'll
finally be able to play around with the
wrong XIII Nadi Tai Chi which has a
really beautiful design I must say it's
not like this really flashy kind of like
red and black type of scheme I really
like the silver accent on there and the
little gear heads on one of the heat
sinks looks pretty awesome the
reinforced PCI slots have become the
norm for premium motherboards like it
and we have triple-m de 2 slots which
are the PCI speeds and non SATA and it's
for power phases we have plenty of
overclocking Headroom right out of the
box it's just a matter of controlling
those temperatures and to complement the
8 core 16 thread 9900 k we have the MSI
r-tx 2080 ti Duke man what a monster
card it is super powerful and you know
I'm kind of like preparing myself to
shifting away from the 80 600 K towards
the 9900 K for my daily work station
productivity slash gaming PC so it's a
good start to like working around with
these components and then putting them
to good use in in the future
alright I think it's time to roll the
assembly procedure
and now the system is complete I am
pretty proud of how this whole thing
turned out in terms of color
coordination so all black components
basically with some silver accents on
the motherboard and the GPU and then
also have the capo mod sleeves
extensions for a 24 pin cable that
really just jumps out and it's not like
a boring 24 pin cable but kind of like
really ties in to my gray and orange and
black color scheme and turning all that
RGB off and setting everything to orange
for the elimination looks absolutely
beautiful but the purpose of this build
was to create something that was super
silent so let's see how we did shall we
now just to give you a perspective for
these DBA readings a microwave here is
about 56 DBA my bathroom with the window
open so it's elected louder at 33 and my
bedroom with everything completely
closed is around 31 the first test is
pretty successful and I think this is
Fredd worthy so my original plan was to
create a system that was as loud upload
as it is at idle and I think we have
achieved that perfectly while the video
was rendering
we were hovering around 33 DBA at one
meter distance so if you were to walk
into this room you will not actually be
able to tell the system was on it just
kind of like new blends in with the
ambience and remember I have six fans in
here three 140mm fans and three 120 but
they are pure wings two fans and we can
get even better airflow performance and
silence operation with silent wings
three so let's replace those now I love
these plastic pegs for installation no
need to take out the screwdriver
she's back online and after the fan
swamp what's interesting is that the DBA
readings are about the same versus what
we had before around 33 but the noise
profile of the sound Winx three fans is
different remember I have six fans in
here and they're all running around a
thousand rpm and that's my desire like
bounds between achieving good
temperatures and also good sound levels
too but the sound noise profile here is
different the sandbanks three produce
slightly lower frequency hum versus with
the pure wings too that had there was
slightly higher pitched and therefore I
guess more noticeable for me that's four
frequencies and temperatures the 99 100k
boosts itself to four point seven
gigahertz stable throughout the entire
render no issues there with the same
voltage as before but the temperatures
are around the same as well seventy five
degrees Celsius on average course so
pretty decent and I feel like you know
the DBA level hasn't lowered by me
switches switching out the fans but the
noise profile has and I feel like this
system with the same extry is perceived
to be quieter but then what about noise
levels while we're gaming so I've been
in destiny 2 for half an hour the GPU
has had enough time to warm up
I got a blow a gaming session out of the
way as well and I said the RT X xx ATI
fan curve to 44% which is practically
inaudible it does increase the overall
DBA level for the system but we're still
significantly under 40 I had to rethink
my strategy because 40 is pretty loud so
I think my target now has lowered to 35
which is what I'm happy with now here's
an interesting fact during these tests I
had to shut down my light because it has
a heatsink
and a fan and the fan is actually pretty
loud when you put your ear to it that
was interfering with my DPA meter so
that thing is pretty loud especially
when compared to like six fans in the
system itself and one fan for the light
and so for my intended usage of the
system moving forward in terms of video
production and gaming
I am extremely satisfied at how silent I
had to make this thing by lowering all
the fans to 1000 rpm and just keeping
the CPU at stock
but not like really pushing it to five
gigahertz because that's when things get
kind of crazy so at four point seven
that's the maximum boost clock for the
CPU that it boosts itself - based on my
temperatures I'm pretty happy with that
and I'm not going to be pushing it any
further because that would mean that I
have to increase the faint speed and
that would ruin the whole point but I
would love for you guys to hear what the
system sounds like when it's at load
versus when the system is off so please
turn up your volume and put on
headphones so you can get the better
understanding on how the system sounds
so this is at load
created em quiet all right guys now on
to my conclusion I was honestly
expecting slightly better temperatures
with six fans in the system running at a
thousand rpm but the CPU is extremely
hot and the GPU balancing out around
that 47% faint speed or like 44% fan
speed is practically inaudible and
reaches 80 degrees Celsius but if I bump
the speed on the GPU to like 55% then my
temperatures drop 10 degrees so it's
like a fine balancing act between how
how loud and how fast your rpm goes
versus house island the system is and
since the focus here was on silence then
I can sacrifice a little bit of
temperatures and I can confidently say
that this is the most quiet system that
I've ever built that is also the most
powerful that has six fans in there and
a 9900 ke that stays constantly cool
below 80 degree Celsius when I'm gaming
and rendering videos but it is always a
fine balancing act between RPMs getting
a little hit on temperatures because the
rpm isn't you know too high and also
depending on the case - like if this was
completely open then it would be a
different story for cooling but making
sure that the system is quiet isn't all
about the case it's about the hardware -
and the RPM of those fans and there's
always all the parts will be linked in
