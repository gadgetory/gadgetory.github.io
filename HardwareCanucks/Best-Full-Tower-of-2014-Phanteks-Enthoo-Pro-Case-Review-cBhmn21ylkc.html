great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dimitri with her
broken ox and enough teasing we have a
highly-anticipated chassis from fantex
and to give you a little bit of refresh
their first case ever was the anthro
primo that we awarded the case of the
year last year so the enter pro is
finally rolling out and it will
seriously challenge competing foo towers
as not only we are seeing excellent
feature sets but incredibly attractive
price points as well the windowed
version stands at the hundred dollars
while an on window option is $10 less
aesthetically this actually feels like a
fan text case with plenty of resemblance
to the original enter primo the panel
design is quite unique with a small
angular window to showcase the internal
logo and the larger portion for the rest
of the components the exterior plastics
look like brushed aluminum and the same
type found on fractal design cases that
look elegant without any significant hit
on the cost we have three optical drives
and you can see that brushed grain
looking pretty sweet without the
annoyance of all the fingerprints found
on actual aluminum behind the stealth
cover we have four USB ports two of
which are USB three Auto jacks and a
reset button taking off the panel a
large dust filter is right there it is
removable and included is a 200 mil more
fan with appropriate cat outs for sort
of unrestricted intake + dual 120 and
140 millimeter fan support as well the
front panel also has some side
ventilation that helps with total air
flow delivery so that's very much
appreciated
power button is located on top the case
along with a large mesh that has a built
in dust filter and overall excellent
cooling up top with triple 120 and 140
Milner fan mounts so radiators up to 420
millimeters are supported and actually
for this price bracket that's very
impressive at the rear we get an exhaust
fan with height adjusted mounting strips
that complement flexibility for top
mounted radiators and as there's three
inches until the RAM slots thick rads up
top are totally possible
then there's the 8 PCI slots and finally
we're seeing dedicated reservoir
mounting hole
calls for water cooling builds that puts
YouTube reservoirs very well the empty
bro is elevated quite high with sturdy K
speed and you can see the two removable
dust filters at the bottom making this a
fully dust proof enclosure so so far so
good I'm really happy to see no features
missed for this 100-dollar full tower
taking a closer look inside we get this
compartment separation with all the
drives accessed exclusively from the
rear that I do prefer a power supply
bracket that is only available with the
windowed version and also the main
chamber with a ton of rubber grommets
the power supply bracket is great as it
hides all the sort of exiting cables
however it must be removed every time
you need access to your power supply and
it's not as easy as it should be since
the three screws in the back hold the
cover there's a large cutout on the side
of the bracket to pass for example your
PCI cables but nothing else on top that
could easily incorporate SSD mounts and
perhaps even more cutouts also as more
fans are supported at the bottom the
bracket will consequently block the
airflow and I think it should have been
more open to allow the integration on
bottom in take two more 120mm fans can
be installed on the drive cage however
you must first remove this supporting
bracket it just sits on two screws so
it's not a big issue and you have
yourself some additional airflow now
since the anther Pro is so water cooling
ready this supporting bracket is
actually used to install an included
reservoir bracket and that's really
considerate of fantex the bracket has
many mounting holes for compatibility
with different reservoirs GPUs over 13
inches are supported so installing extra
fans on the drive gauge is welcome and
clearance will depend on the size of
reservoir if you do decide to put one
there and coming around to the back I'm
very happy to see there velcro cable
management system in place and looks
like fantex has done the initial routing
for you bus there are many cameltoe
mounts spray it around and get a single
SSD bracket that can be relocated to
accommodate your preferred cable routing
and 2 Pro also features a fan hub for 6
fans that can either be powered and
control
bolt through the four pin motherboard
connector and for non compatible
motherboards a power SATA cable is
included just in case the hub can be
also relocated a little further down
giving users flexibility again depending
on how you configure your cable
management there's an ample of 1.5
inches of space at the rear plus the
ability to talk some small cables
underneath the frame so enter pro is
fully equipped for a totally enjoyable
and hassle-free assembly the two cages
are removable with these unique drive
caddies using sort of like a wing like
design to secure the three and a half
inch drives so no need to flex the
plastic for mounting
there are also SSD compatible with
centered medaled so I am happy to see
that removing the cage platform and we
also get some clearance for it to
40-million radiator at the bottom so
power supply bracket in this scenario
would not work we still get over 200
millimeters with the bottom rat in place
so power supply compatibility is not a
concern the front will support the 240
millimeter radiator as there's so much
internal clearance so thick radiators in
push-pull are welcome I was also happy
to find the toolbox included with the
case that conveniently separates all
your extra screws and is a much better
alternative over like a single bag that
most cases come with and to no surprise
the finished build looks outstanding
with grooming turtles that screams for
some Horta cooling components to be
installed inside all the cutouts around
the motherboard make cabling super
efficient and most importantly clean
everything in the rear looks as expected
this wall with cables flush to the case
and tucked away so if you're wondering
what is a totally new friendly case for
cable management the anther pro is
definitely it and one more thing I'd
like to mention is the smart friendly
concept fan techs have gone ahead with
allowing you to disassemble basically
the entire chassis so the top frame
optical drive bracket the side drive
panel and the front frame are all
attached with screws and not rivets and
this was totally unexpected from my side
for a chassis in this price bracket and
huge props to fan text for trying to
introduce such features back into the
enthusiast Chaz's market
and to conclude the enterprise one
impressive product as we've sort of
gotten accustomed to missing features on
expensive cases and the pro doesn't seem
to miss a thing
without standing cooling and water
cooling options appropriately-sized
internals for enthusiast hardware with
great cable management the fan hub
implementation the single SSD bracket
two dedicated spots for the reservoirs
and totally modular chassis frame for
motor friendly endeavors all at the
super value of just $100 that puts many
cases to shame I'm talking to you and
tech 1900 the only feature that I think
wasn't entirely thought through was the
power supply bracket now sure does the
job but it could do a lot more such as
additional SSD mounts extra cutouts for
cables and the more open design to allow
air flow if the bottom intake fans are
installed and a feel the introduction of
the an through line is really important
as it highlights that great features
don't have to cost a fortune so if
you're looking for a future-proof boot
our we strongly recommend this damn good
and damn good value case but share your
thoughts on the enter pro in the
comments below I'd love to hear what you
think this definitely takes the top spot
for 2014 for towers at the moment and
this makes me really excited on the
future roadmap for fantex as a company
so guys thanks for watching don't forget
