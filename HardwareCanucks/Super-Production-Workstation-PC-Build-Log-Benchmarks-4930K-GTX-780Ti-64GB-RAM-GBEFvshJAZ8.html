hey guys Demetri here with Harbor
Canucks and Eber who is one of our
reviewers here on the channel has been
editing on his Aging XPS 15 laptop and
he was obviously frustrated with the
overall performance of the laptop not
being able to keep up with the demands
of efficient and productive editing
workflow so he saved up some money and
he decided to go all out with some drool
inducing parts and this being his first
ever build we thought we'd share this
experience with you so you can follow
along and see how we put this super
project production workstation together
so let's check out the parts now for the
processor he chose the Intel Core i7 49
30k a monster 6 quart ship with a
relatively affordable price point
compared to see on CPUs and of course
hyper threading is a big plus for
applications like premiere and After
Effects it also has a crazy amount of
overclocking potential to house the
strip we've got the Asus x79
deluxe motherboard it is considered one
of the best in the class for reliability
and expansion and it's one of the few
boards that was actually in his budget
for the CPU cooler the courser h100 eye
is fully capable of keeping the 49 30 K
under control
especially since overclocking is coming
to town now for RAM he's gone ahead with
a Corsair Vengeance quad channel 64
gigabyte kit clocked at 1866 megahertz
and while it seems like a complete
overkill it would be for a gaming
machine but this will seriously help
with 3d animations and After Effects and
any video editing software that we throw
at it now for storage a 256 gigabyte
Samsung 840 pro SSD is plenty to house
operating system and all of his
applications with excellent read/write
performance and also proven reliability
now for the GPU the part he was most
excited about he's opted for the
reference NVIDIA GTX 780 Ti this is an
absolute powerhouse for gaming in ultra
settings with potential to push proper
4k gaming when of course paired in SLI
now the real advantage of editing key
is CUDA acceleration in premiere and
after-effects and for anyone who has
worked with Adobe before would know the
massive performance boost you get when
taking advantage of the power of the GPU
and to power this whole build we have
the courser ax 860 it's a fully modular
unit with nice low-profile black cables
that will contribute to clean cable
management and finally to house all
these parts we hooked him up with the
fan tanks and through Lux
if you haven't seen our review of this
case yet we definitely suggest you check
it out as it is an outstanding chassis
now the building process was
straightforward we started with the
processor installation making sure you
align the arrow on the chip with the
arrow in the socket and it drops right
in without any pressure next are all the
sticks of RAM all eight of them I like
the module accordingly with the spots
and give them a slight press and you are
good to go followed by a quick
installation of the rear i/o shield and
mounting the motherboard inside the case
carefully with the included screws and
we are ready for installation of the CPU
cooler now installing the liquid cooling
kit was simple just have to make sure
you take your time to appropriately
align the fans with the radiator and
securing it up top next is the power
supply very straightforward just pop
that in secure some screws and we are
ready for the best part
installing the GPU does require removing
appropriate PCI brackets at the back of
the case align the GPU with a PCI
Express lane on the motherboard giving
you like press and the GTX 780 Ti is all
ready to go and lastly the SSD was
installed on one of the rear brackets
attached behind the motherboard tray
perfectly within reach for all the SATA
cables now cable routing and management
in the envelopes is an absolute breeze
plug in the 24 pin and the eight pin
into your motherboard and the PCI
Express cables into your graphics card
and we did spend some time cleaning
things up in the main chamber for best
possible looks and of course
unrestricted airflow and the super
project production workstation is ready
for its first boot and so now onto Ebor
with his final setup and his thoughts
and some benchmarks of this dream
machine
to what he had before with the XPS 15
let's take a look so now on to the
performance portion of this video first
I want to see the performance difference
between this new machine and my XPS 15
especially with an overclocked 49 30 K
at 4.5 gigahertz I was excited to see
how this workstation upgrade would stack
up in the benchmarks starting with
Geekbench 64-bit test the new Rick
scored a little over 24,000 on the
multi-threaded test and just over 4,000
on the single core test which is
ridiculously closer to the eight core
xeon processors from Intel while the XPS
15 scored around three to four times
less now on two Cinebench r15 for the
OpenCL tests my rig scored almost 110
frames per second while the XPS 15
scored around 30 frames per second with
its outdated gt540 m GPU the cpu test
was to highlight for this benchmark as
the 4930 case called around 1200 points
whereas the core i7 quad-core processor
gave a lower 362 points absolutely
astounding
moving on to Unigine valley benchmark
the new machine averaged at 63 frames
per second on Ultra settings at 1200 P
with a total score of around 2,700
points the XPS 15 on the other hand
scored significantly less with an
average of 13 point 3 frames per second
at twelve-hundred P and a score of 557
points jaw-dropping results from the GTX
780 Ti I also ran the lux mark OpenCL
benchmark and my rec scored around 2400
points whereas the XPS 15 output at a
lower 107 points now I know that
synthetic benchmarks wouldn't really
paint the entire picture so I ran the
cs6 cuda benchmark with a total render
time off the 3d ray tracing composition
in 3 minutes whereas it took over 40
minutes on the XPS 15 again thanks to
those cuda cores on the GTX 780 Ti and
the 64 gigabyte RAM kit I also took one
of our earlier review videos and
rendered the entire sequence with the
After Effects composition in under 6
minutes whereas the XPS 15 took an hour
and 5 minutes to render this 5 minute
review
so now you can see how fast six score
4930 cake rushes to render times in
Premiere Pro so at the end of the day
the total price for this upgrade was
around three thousand and while the XPS
15 served me well to edit up to this
point this was definitely a needed
investment to speed up my render times
and boost my productivity workflow so
what do you guys think did I make the
right choice in terms of parts and what
would you have done differently given
such a budget again thanks for joining
