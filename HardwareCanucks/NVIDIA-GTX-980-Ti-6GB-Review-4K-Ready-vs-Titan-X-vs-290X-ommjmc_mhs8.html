great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hurricane axe and the new flagship GPU
from Nvidia the gtx 980ti has just hit
the market
it's an exciting direction for
enthusiasts gamers who want the best
performance especially since the 980ti
is basically neck to neck the Titan X
but released at $649 so the value
proposition is there compared to the
$1000 Titan X
the 980ti is targeted for 4k gaming
directs 12 compatibility and a full
stack of features that rolls out with
this new GPU within the sphere of game
works VR that we'll cover in the future
video specifications of the 980ti seem
very promising for gaming with 2,816
cuda cores 1,000 megahertz base clock
and 1075 megahertz boost six gigabytes
of vram on a 384 bit memory bus so it's
just slightly below the Titan X in the
cooler core count with half the RAM and
I'm also really excited to see the
prospects of this new GPU for adobe
applications so make sure to subscribe
as we will be doing many tests across
multiple GPUs to compare so now let's do
a quick physical tour
alright well another deja vu moment
really this reference GPU does not look
any different with the TI added beside
the model number at the front
illuminated GeForce logo at the top of
the card ends no backlight for this one
the IO is no different either triple
DisplayPort 1.2 output or triple 4k no
problem
single HDMI and dual link DVI power
connections include the 1/8 and 1/16
with 250 watt TDP in total so about a
600 watt power supply is recommended and
so first let's do 1440p benchmarks as
expected the 980ti is just a few frames
below the technics on average on all of
our benchmarks they are practically
neck-to-neck and this certainly feels
like a new flagship GPU simply based on
the price you are looking at around 36%
better performance across the board
compared to the 980 and it will be very
interesting to see what will happen with
the Titan X and in fact Jenson himself
was asked this question recently and
this was his response first of all first
our job is to bring value to the market
and we set the opportunity for for
taking the most important job for our
next flagship gaming product that's not
what Titan is the Titan is not our
gaming product Titan X is really our
enthusiast front are our 980ti 'zed
mission in life is singular and must be
able to deliver for taking if it cannot
deliver 4k gaming 0 it did nothing so we
wanted to deliver for
number one number two just absolutely
knock vr out of the market those are
some of the things that we wanted to do
with 980ti
and so the price was not my most
important objective I wanted to make it
affordable for flagship the consistent
price of a friendship g-force
which is 60 or 50 dollars and it has to
be able to be the world's first out of
the chute completely 4k gaming
experience
now type necks has has some special
properties first of all it has 12
gigabytes of memory which is really
important for people who wants to do
video editing in 4k could you imagine
doing After Effects and 4k premiere in
4k if you wanted to do deep learning it
is it is the perfect development
platform for students and researchers
all over the world for deep learning and
so you need a lot of if you weren't a
developer making a for taking and
developers before you can enjoy the game
in 4k they have to develop the game in
4k which means they need a lot of a lot
of memory we have created the perfect
platform for it and so art art
enthusiasts GPUs are served many many
needs
okay so I hope you enjoyed that and as
he said it must drive 4k games otherwise
is zero so let's take a look at that as
well
as expected the 980ti is a quiet capable
at this resolution playing the latest
titles and highest settings without
hiccups so having only half the memory
of the Titan X should not worry anybody
as the numbers speak great frames and
imagine tuning some of those settings
down to get solid 60fps at 4k no problem
and the card was staying well within the
thermal envelope at 82 degrees Celsius
during load as expected for reference
GPU so putting this thing under water or
some cooler from one of their board
partners should see the enthusiast
community spark with excitement for
extra Headroom for overclocking and so
right now NVIDIA has made yet another
confident statement with the Maxwell
architecture if you want the best gaming
card in the market right now the 980ti
is it scoring about 2% below the Titan X
while offering a much better value for
those 4k needs
so the 980ti is a damn good card make
sure to subscribe as we have an overview
of all that NVIDIA has just introduced
coming very soon thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one
