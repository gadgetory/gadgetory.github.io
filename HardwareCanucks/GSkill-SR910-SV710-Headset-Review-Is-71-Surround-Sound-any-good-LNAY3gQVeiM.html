great technology selection and service
hello everyone Eber here with Habra
connects and today we're taking a look
at g skills new gaming headsets their
entrance into the peripheral market with
the km 780 gaming keyboard and the MX
780 Gaming Mouse has proved to have
potential but for memory company to
enter the audio spectrum may cause a few
raised eyebrows we have two variants
here the Ripjaws sv7 10 virtual 7.1
headset and the sr9 10 real 7.1 headset
priced at 85 and $160 respectively this
price bracket is quite risky considering
g.skill has a no audio presence in the
past and these two headsets will set the
roadmap for future success or failure of
their gaming line there's also a lot of
competing gaming headsets in this price
range like the G 633 from Logitech the
HyperX cloud to course avoid headset and
a few more so can g.skill keep up with
its big leagues let's find out physical
tour first both have an identical frame
that is in one word bizarre the elevated
Omega style headband looks very strange
even with these self adjusting padding
that leaves the plastic top piece
sticking above your head speaking of the
padding it's very cushiony and
comfortable to wear on your head the
outline stitches on the headband are
black on the SV 710 and red on the sr9
10 for easier differentiation the SR 910
continues that red and black color
scheme throughout the headset whereas
the SV 710 maintains that simple black
minimalist look the transparent ear
cuffs reveal illuminated g.skill logo on
both which looks very nice
the SR 910 illuminates the internal
drivers a little more than the SV some
10 but the transparent plastic covering
is a fingerprint magnet if you're
concerned about the looks the year comes
offer a good range of rotation but not
much angular adjustment so comfort wise
they definitely need to go back to the
drawing board the sr9 10 is worse
between the two having five drivers in
each year
makes the headphones very heavy and
given the loose headband most of the
weight is held by your ears which makes
wearing the headset totally
uncomfortable the SV 710 is 40 grams
lighter which makes for a more
comfortable fit for easier movement and
I prefer these a lot more than the SR
910 the low-profile microphone is
retractable which is great plus you can
maneuver it into whatever position you
want but here's a sound quality test
it's okay but it's not the best quality
we've heard they sound identical on both
headsets and it's very disappointing
that so far neither of these provide any
unique features the SV 710 has a giant
inline wall in control and the cheap
plastic shell feels like it might not
last long the SR 910 on the other hand
has a larger desktop control hub that
allows volume control for individual
channels which is great in practice but
that doesn't help much when the driver
quality in this real surround sound
headset completely lacks any definition
or accurate positional awareness also do
note that the control hub is a heavy
unit that's connected to the left ear
cup which in turn creates a lot of
pressure on your left ear if you don't
have it properly set up both of them are
connected via USB so the main difference
are the drivers the SR 910 has five
separate drivers in each year cup that's
supposed to represent a more distinct
direction from where the audio is coming
from the main problem though is the
driver size and the lack of accurate
soundstage creation as drivers are so
close together you lose all sense of
audio cohesion this means a lot of the
detail is lost and the audio separation
is very poor the FV 710 on the other
hand has just one driver per each Cup
and in standard stereo mode creates a
much better stereo imaging with wider
soundstage and even better positional
cues the base region is so much better
on these versus the SR 910 but don't
expect to be blown away at the lows as
they exhibit unpleasant distortion at
high volume levels also enabling virtual
surround sound completely kills the
detail the soundstage expands but in an
unnatural way where everything just
feels more
and moving on to the driver software it
seems like it received a zero attention
on the design aspect as it looks
something like from the late 90s visuals
aside you have EQ settings with some
premium presets but for the SV 710 I
would recommend sticking to stereo mode
while the added complexity on the SR 910
is not user friendly and figuring out
optimal settings is difficult so the
entire experience with this new Ripjaws
headsets has been unfortunately mostly
negative with weird comfort issues due
to this unconventional frame design and
lack of appropriate padding the
microphone is terrible and while the
sound quality on the SV 710 has its
strengths the SR 910 built surround
sound headset needs serious revisions as
directional assistance and detail is
poor plus the clunky UI seals the deal
as the product to avoid so that
concludes this review we hope you
enjoyed and make sure to say hello to
that like button on your way out
