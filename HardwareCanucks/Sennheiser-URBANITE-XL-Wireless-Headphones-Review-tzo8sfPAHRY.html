great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Herick
NOx and if you're looking for a wireless
headphone and trust what's Anheuser has
been doing then you might be looking at
the either the momentum Wireless line
that's a bit pricey but you do get noise
cancellation outstanding low-profile
headphone that's great for travel but on
the other hand the urbanite line has
also seen the cut of the cord if you
will
now with the urbanite XL which are the
over the ear and regular urbanite that
are on ear headphones the urbanite XL
wireless eye priced at the $50 premium
over the non Wireless version and carry
an identical physical language with
fabric headband the visible stitching to
color match the rest of the white
accents like the ring on the ear cuffs
and the white sound Heiser logo and the
light rubber underside of the headband
these fold in like so and the joints
feel robust especially being steel
reinforced but can be a little too loose
when taking them off as the fold would
sort of give in with the to the weight
of the headphone and that can be a
little annoying I would like to see
these joints to be a little bit more
reinforced so they don't fold in as
easily the urbanite XL extremely
flexible as you can see and then it can
be stretched out if you find the
pressure to be too tight the ear cups
also slide with the aluminum frame to
accommodate for different head sizes
with a little play on each ear cup for a
better fit and I love how the cable has
been incorporated to live inside the ear
cup protected from the elements and
regular wear and tear the size of the
ear cushions is appropriate I think but
the foam is a bit tough so it doesn't
fully compress much to contour to your
ears I wouldn't like to see extra
padding on the inside as well of the ear
cushion as otherwise you feel the
plastic housing and if you ears happen
to make contact it won't be pleasant all
the controls and inputs are on the right
ear cup with a power on slider and
Bluetooth pair within the decorative LED
that lights up red and blue to indicate
connection status further down is our
audio socket with a twist to lock system
as a tangle free cord is included with
the volume slider multi
his button and microphone with a low
profile 90-degree 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and I love that the cable
is included with the urbanite XL giving
users the convenience of using the
headphone wired as well
let's say if the battery run or runs out
or if you don't have a compatible
Bluetooth device further down is a micro
USB socket for charging the headphone
with a USB cable included and finally a
built-in microphone to use when
connected via bluetooth now one cool
thing is integrated touch controls on
the right side the earcup allowing you
to tap to play pause switch tracks with
a double tap and triple taps and change
volume with the swinging up and down now
this is something I really have to get
used to because the touch area is fairly
small finding this on the side of your
head may be a little challenging and
also there's about 1 second delay
between a desired action that is being
executed by you through what you finally
hear on the phone sometimes the double
tap registers as one tap so you would
pause the song instead of trying to
switch the song and also because of the
lag I found myself tapping and perhaps
thinking that it wasn't registered
tapping it again only to hear the music
to resume and go back to pause as it
starts to catch up to your latest
command
so this lag is really not pleasant and
overall the touch controls I think a
little bit too gimmicky I would much
rather prefer a physical switch the like
a dial on the momentum Wireless that I
can switch tracks I can literally press
the button instead of using this very
tiny control on the headphone and
something that I also noticed that a lot
of times to do is when taking off the
headphone to automatically sort of touch
the the side controls here and pause the
song and whatever I was listening to and
do the same thing when I was putting the
headphones on me instead of putting them
on and then resuming the tracks but
accidentally touching this this area
because it is capacitive and resuming
the songs without me sort of wanting the
resume the song and I think a simple
solution for this would be an audio cue
or some type of ring that would play
when the command is registered this way
you know when the headphone accepts your
commands and you don't have to over
tap a couple times to make sure that
things are actually registered now these
are NFC ready simply tap the device on
the Left portion of the earcup for a
seamless connection as far as Bluetooth
audio quality goes it is utilizing the
app text codec and Sennheiser is using
the aplex Kotick on all of their
wireless devices which is a very good
codec unfortunately not many devices
support optics and using my iPhone 5s
I've had a few weeks with the headphone
and actually haven't needed to recharge
it just yet and battery is rated at 25
hours of listening now so the Bluetooth
audio quality is pretty comparable to
Wired performance the upper mid-range is
clear with vocals come through
emphasized but I'm guessing due to
bitrate limitations of Bluetooth there
was an overall lack of resolution to
separate audio elements and things just
kind of blend it together these are
attached on the bright side the treble
is crisp but only to about 75% volume
we're afterwards it gets harsh and
unpleasant at loud volumes the wireless
bitrate limitations really start to
appear now the base region is probably
the most disappointing one it is well
controlled in the lower base with
appropriate amount of power for dubstep
and bring extra body for male vocals but
the upper bass is disappointing without
any real hit of energy especially when
compared to the momentum Wireless
so the urbanite XL and Wireless mode
were not as pleasing however the sound
stage on the urbanite XL is wire there's
a bit of extra depth for larger setting
plug in the cable and the limitations
and the lower frequencies seem to still
be present I was hoping for deeper and
more impactful bass hits
but the urbanite XL is just not that
type of headphone and if you're looking
for more energy the mentum line will
definitely satisfy now the wireless
convenience is definitely amazing it's a
huge positive not having to deal with
the wire dangling around especially if
you travel and have multiple bags on you
it's a huge positive however personally
the sound signature is not totally to my
flavor
so I want to hear a bit more resolution
I want to have more impactful lower
regions for my house and EDM tracks for
a little bit more energy
however the siblings is there if you
want to pinpoint detail out of a large
soundstage that's very good
and if you prefer a low impactful bass
section then the urbanite excel may be
right on point and so this concludes
this review of the herb night excel
Wireless and since we all like different
audio I'd love to hear what the type of
audio signature you prefer and whether
or not the signature slightly brighter
side but have very flat and the bass
section is the type of signature that
you prefer with the comment below and

this coming next yep so thanks so much
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
