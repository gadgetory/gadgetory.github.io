world's best gaming cpu that makes AMD
look good
what's up guys I'm Dimitri with
hurricane axe and today is a good day
because we get to see performance
numbers on this new processor and this
whole fiasco will definitely come to an
end but Intel still in the hot waters
with reviewers and consumers especially
from a value perspective and also trying
to fudge the numbers that didn't work
that well for them then as you'll see in
this video the 9900 K as expected it is
powerful its power efficient it tops all
the gaming charts but it also does
highlight the competition and its
strengths not just within AMD but also
with different generation of Intel
processors like 8700 K so I'll do the
full analysis right after this so you're
looking for something with class good
value comfortably populate an ATX
motherboard are you it's all about the
user experience and great airflow who
knew your temperatures would drop that
low route the cables behind the cover
illuminate your hardware with built-in
LEDs the age 500 I is for you to
discover this one's in real life not in
your dreams
say hello to the link below the HR 100
series from NZXT is a go so first of all
the new nine generation coffee-like
processor lineup looks pretty promising
9600 k 9700 K although that one doesn't
have hyper threading and that's kind of
weird
and then the 9900 K which is an 8 core
16 thread part so it should check off a
lot of the boxes for productivity
because of high thread count and gaming
because of the high clock counts
especially because it can boost to 5
gigahertz on its own obviously with the
coffee like ecosystem you can expect
good overclocking I have my 8600 came
running at 5 gigahertz my 8700 K at 4.6
but I can push that to 5 the Earth's no
problem and the same is expected
hopefully with the ninth gen coffee like
CPUs and we'll touch on overclocking but
later for the 9900 K you know everything
is kind of there except value and so
this is where we start talking about the
price the pre-order price of 580 dollars
for the 9900 K now that price is
interesting because if you take a look
at the competition
you know the eight core 60
threat part from AMD would be the 2700 X
and that's around $300 and then they're
a bunch of bundles and deals that
include the motherboard so you can buy a
motherboard Z or X 470 and the 2700 X
CPU and still have a bit left over
versus buying the new 9900 K by itself
so value wise definitely it doesn't
favor Intel but also if you look at the
8700 K you know if your team Intel and
want to go with the higher clock counts
if you're using video production with
the new quick sync support 87 100k is a
fantastic chip you can still buy this
8700 K with a Z 370 motherboard and that
will still be less than the pre-order
price for the 9900 K the price in Europe
for this new chip is 650 euros that is
expensive my friends and so if you look
at a bigger picture the 9900 K may be
the best CPU gaming processor but
obviously it's also the most expensive
especially when considering you can
purchase entire CPU and motherboard
combos for less than five hundred and
eighty dollars now because the 9900 K is
on core and thread parity to the rise in
2700 X so if you want that many cores
and threads for productivity and gaming
- I've highlighted in the benchmarks so
you can kind of visualize on where the
9900 K sits in comparison to the 2700 X
here's the specifications for our test
bed system running the same cooler and
both chips running the same memory and
latency on both rise in an Intel let's
begin with the benchmarks starting off
with Cinebench r15 the 99 hundred K does
beat out a 2700 X and the 2000 points is
pretty strong well done this is in a
multi-core test in the single core test
because of the higher clock speeds we
definitely see a nice little significant
boost in there - versus the rest of the
inter lineup and obviously 2700 X as
well looking at PC Mark Creative Suite
test it does top the chart obviously but
only what 400 points more versus 2700 X
so the difference there is not that
significant but it does score higher
same thing with the home conventional
test where the 2700 X I'm guessing
because the slightly lower clock speeds
is kind of at the bottom of the chart
there for W prime and single-core test
performance is quite strong
thanks to those clock speeds but then
multi-core benchmark and the gap closes
between the 2,700 X so not really
significant difference there
moving on to either 64 CPU AES benchmark
look at how far below the 9900 K is
below the 2,700 X the same thing with
the CPU hash benchmark
yeah like 2.5 x performance on the 2,700
X which is quite nice in either FPU test
the 9900 K tops the chart so pretty good
performance there in either 64 4 works
so it simulates photo environment the
higher clock speeds are better here but
again the difference here isn't that
significant but versus the 2,700 X and
even the 87 100 K and definitely keep a
lookout on where the 8700 case it's so
that you can kind of compare on what the
two additional course at these
benchmarks so here's some real-world
processing benchmarks 7-zip 9900 K is
powerful but look at the you know
massive lineup above it it does beat out
the 2700 by quite a lot though and
whenever our that performance gap widens
quite a bit tops the chart very nice
moving on to pov-ray the 99 Herrera K
beats out the 2,700 X but the higher
core counts on the other CPUs above it
definitely benefit with this benchmark
and hen breaks the 99 hundred K again
beats out the 2,700 X but not that
significant and there plenty of other
CPUs that perform better in the GIMP
this is where the core clock counts for
the 99 hundred K it does atop the chart
right there along with the 87 100k and
3dsmax the higher core and clock counts
definitely benefit here the 19 100k
leaves the 2,700 X and the 8700 K quite
behind there in blender same situation
slightly higher performance versus 2700
X but many other CPUs with the higher
core counts above it that perform better
and finally Adobe Premiere this is what
QuickSync off the 99 hundred K performs
very well right along the lines of like
the really expensive 79 80 X E and I'll
definitely do
more Adobe premier testing with quick
Singh support utilizing that Intel UHD
630 graphics versus the 8700 K and the
8600 game and I'm hoping that because of
the additional two cores and higher
clock counts that I will see a
significant improvement in rendering
performance versus what I use now on the
8700 K but now let's begin with the
gaming benchmarks starting with 3d mark
firestrike the 99 hundred K performs
very well almost 25,000 points here but
the 8700 K tailors just a little behind
that 23.4 and almost 21,000 with e 2,700
X for the time Spidy X 12 CPU benchmark
the 9900 K is quite powerful 11,000
points over here while just under 9,000
for the 2,700 X and look at how below
the 8700 K is well for the entire time
Spidey x12 benchmark the 9900 K tops the
chart over here at 9600 81 points and
just nine thousand three hundred points
for the 2700 X so it's not that far
behind
moving on to battle 1 and DX 12 so yes
the 9900 K is the top performer it is
the best gaming CPU it tops the chart
over here but look at that it's only for
frame difference versus the 8700 K which
is much cheaper and then about what 17
frames versus 2,700 X and when you're
gaming it that high frame rate anyway
does it really matter and again when you
look at the value equation the 9900 K is
67% more expensive than the current
price of the 8700 K at around 390 380
dollars but it's only giving you 3
percent extra performance in bf1 hmm
moving on to Deus Ex mankind divided and
dx12 again the 9900 K tops the charts of
course but at what cost
moving on to GTA 5 again it's a chart
topper and the separate itself quite
nicely from Li 2700 X but then that 87
100k is right below and that's 6 FPS
difference really is down that
significant but a very powerful chip
regardless same thing in the overwatch
it tops the chart that what almost 300
frames per second but
so do the rest of them over 250 frames
per second on every single CPU in this
chart so that performance you know that
performance King when you're looking at
something over 250 FPS does it really
matter
moving on to Cod infinite warfare so all
the CPUs are powerful no issues here no
bottlenecking
and the same idea with doom at Vulcan at
that 200 FPS frame cap now if you want
to read the full review with many more
gaming benchmarks make sure to read it
in the scription below and you know the
past few weeks have been kind of crazy
with the RT x 27 to launch with mike on
uber and Beijing so these benchmarks are
not in the full scope of what we
normally deliver but definitely stay
tuned for more because the 9900 K it's a
it's a powerful beast of course but then
how does it compare to others that are
so much cheaper then that performance
gap really isn't really worth it for
that giant price hike moving on to power
consumption and this is actually pretty
impressive with a new 9 gen family
so the 9900 K has two additional course
versus the 8700 K yet it's more power
efficient at load and at idle too and
it's kind of they consume about this
much power as the 2,700 X at load so the
power bills are not as much as they
would be versus the other CPUs in the
stack and that's really good to see
power efficiency on both AMD and an
Intel with this eight core 16 thread
parts now I am excited to see what we
can do with the dhobi premier and what
type of performance we get where video
production where the core clocks are
much higher versus Rison and that's a
huge benefit with Adobe and the second
thing is so many cores and threats to
you know for all the processing tasks to
just happen which is awesome that was
for overclocking I have my notes here
from Patrick our motherboard reviewer so
he was able to push the 99 hundred K to
5.1 gigahertz at one point 3 5 volts and
he was even able to achieve 5.2
gigahertz stable with the exact same
voltage for gaming and day to day but
Cinebench r15 with crash therefore
deeming the overclock not 100
percent reliable so overclocking 9,900
gain is very similar to what you find
doing on the 8700 k but what we're told
is that the memory controller on the
9900 K is weaker than on the previous
8700 K chips so you need to give more
voltage to the memory controller to
achieve higher clock speeds on memory on
this new a9 processor and also he was
not able to run ddr4 at 38 66 megahertz
on the asus strix
z 390 email the board while every recent
Intel motherboard was able to achieve
that memory speed no problem so
therefore most likely something is
happening in the BIOS on that z 390
motherboard that will have to be
probably updated in the future in terms
of the actual speed performance
improvement with that 5.1 get hertz
overclock we had a nice Cinebench r15
score of 20 179 so giving us roughly
about the hundred point boost in
Cinebench r15 versus when the cpu was
running at stock and finally the peak
temperature that was recorded with the
99 hundred K at five point one gigahertz
was 87 degrees Celsius which is
basically identical as what you would
find with the 8700 K at five gigahertz
with that identical one point three five
volts and so there you have it the 99
hundred K is out it's powerful its power
efficient that overclocked swell just
like in 8700 K wood but the price point
that price Delta between it and let's
say an 8700 K or the 2700 X does not
reflect the performance difference
between those CPUs and therefore you
kind of have to ask yes it's the best
gaming CPU right now but from a value
perspective it makes no sense because
you can buy a motherboard and the chip
for that much money and performance
difference I mean it's there but
you decide if it's worth to you and so
my recommendation is still looking to
the 8700 K it's still cheaper to buy
that a motherboard then the 9900 K by
itself look into the horizon 2700 X
performance there is lower in gaming
because the clocks are not higher but
that's just the nature of aim D versus
Intel debate but in terms of its overall
umbrella performance is really good on
both 8700 K and the 2,700 X and so yeah
if you don't need the best of the best
just might as well set off something
that performs very similar to the best
but is a lot less alright so that is it
