possible without the innovative fantex
world-leading nvidia graphics memory
partner corsair and the retail partner
NCIX along with silverstone and in win
hey guys this is Eber here with Harbor
Canucks and we dropped by the
Silverstone booth at Computex and they
had a wide range of components at the
show floor they kicked things off with
the new esti series 80 plus titanium
power supplies that are targeted towards
better power efficiency I was really
surprised to see how they managed to fit
a 700 watt PSU into an XFX L form factor
here's a comparison to my HTC one just
so you get an idea of how this is
perfectly suitable for a micro ITX build
featuring high-end components that
require a lot of power the higher-end
Zeus series has received the 80 plus
titanium certification which means that
gamers with enthusiast level hardware
would be able to achieve the best power
efficiency the included monitoring
software displays a brief overview of
the efficiency the voltages fan speed
and temperatures an interesting feature
that I found on the software was the
ability to set custom profiles for the
fan speed of your power supply and I can
see this potentially becoming an
important sector for gamers or
professionals that demand for the
ultimate silent experience silverstone
also featured a variety of pci express
adapters for existing motherboard that
brings expansion to a whole new level
they have introduced a new ECM 20 dual
m22 PCI Express 4 and SATA adapter card
this allows users to connect their
existing SATA SSDs or M SATA SSDs to the
adapter which then transfers the
interface to PCI Express that will bring
a significant improvement in performance
we also took a look at the ECW a1 mini
PCIe 2 PCIe adapter with dual pen
antenna with circular magnetic base to
sum it all up this car can easily
improve wireless performance and
silverstone is targeting both these
adapters at an affordable price
this means users can still achieve that
fast SSD performance along with the best
wireless improvements rather than
spending a lot of money on an actual PCI
SSD or a higher-end Wi-Fi card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
