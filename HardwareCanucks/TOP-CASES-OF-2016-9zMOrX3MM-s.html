maybe should like an off-camera
character that I can talk to can't use
jack
maybe George woohoo it's gonna be a good
one it's this time of year again when I
go into our case review playlists to
refresh my memory and give you guys the
case the words of 2016 Oh as usual the
rules are simple we can only nominate
cases that have been released and
reviewed by us in 2016 and you can check
out our 2015 2014 and 2013 case or words
linked in the description now here's an
interesting Tim bid Harbor Canucks has
published a total of 174 case reviews if
you were to watch them from beginning to
end it would take you roughly 1300
minutes or 21 hours or an average seven
minutes per case you guys are welcome
for our efficiency alright enough
chatter the categories for case awards
are the best ITX option the best budget
case the best first-time builder case
the best tempered-glass upgrade case
seeing this was a very major trend this
year the most innovative case and the
new category the fail compilation this
one is fun one and finally the case of
the year let 2016 case awards begin oh
the new NZXT air RGB fans can be daisy
chained together for awesome lighting
cohesion in your build with vibrant and
accurate color illumination all easily
controlled through the hue plus via cam
software full details in the description
below and so the best ITX option for
2016 goes to the Nano s from fractal
design now it's a little unconventional
seeing is just a shrunken version of
every fractal case ever but this formula
works with a simple body and complete
the open interior that easily fits a
loaded system including a full-size ATX
power supply and you can even fit a 240
million radiator in the front all while
still having storage capacity for dual
SSDs and a three and a half inch drive
and yes for an ITX system it's an
overkill but that's what the market
wanted in 2016 which is why the
runner-up is the NZXT monta ITX that
follows a similar approach with a large
body for ITX system without compromises
like a dedicated power supply shroud and
clever interior frame to hide the cables
with a 240 mm already
support at the top and the front making
this the ultimate vertical incase in its
class and actually the balloon side
panels are this way on purpose for
additional space for cable management
and totally unique character and the
final runner-up is the century ITX that
unfortunately isn't available yet but
this case is the perfect example of true
dedication to small form-factor builds
with the 7 liter volume century like
stands and steel body that presents some
challenges with assembly however with
support for s FX and s FX l power
supplies full size graphics cards on the
top chamber and the ability to do this
with your system the next category for
the budget enclosure is surprisingly
empty
slim pickins out there but the corsair
ii 7y r is the cheapest case we've
reviewed at $59 the interior frame on
the - 7 yard is fantastic with a smart
power supply shroud that hides and
complements cable management this open
area has a lot of potential for good
cooling setups and storage options are
pretty good with dual SSDs and three and
a half inch drives this by no means
though is a complete package as top dust
filter is not included plus a crappy red
LED fan is present and the IO is facing
the wrong direction but at its core you
get the guaranteed solid building
experience for 59 bucks but rivaling
that is a $69 z9 neo Bizon with
surprising list of features like a nice
side window with a concealing power
supply shroud that has a drive cage
built-in with decent cable management
plus you can install SSDs on the
interior side although they're not
really oriented properly and they're
also two removable five-and-a-quarter in
drive bays something that is not found
on majority of 2016 releases the biggest
selling point here are 5 included fans
two of which are blue LED so each slot
is already occupied for excellent out of
box cooling moving on to the most
popular category for the best
first-timer build a case we have the fan
Tech's p400s that makes a fantastic
first impression with its Iron Men type
mask looks the built in RGB lighting and
front of the case with option to connect
an LED strip that will match the case
lighting and all of the completeness of
the p400 series with sound dampening
material and all
new places including top covers with
dust filters depending if you're
installing fans here or not and the open
interior is a very good recipe for
hassle-free assembly without any
hardware compatibility issues cable
management is easy with included velcro
straps and storage capacity is decent
with dual SSD caddies and the drive cage
this is the mid tower that has it all
and an awesome place to start for your
first build the runner-up is the Corsair
400 sea and I love this case because
it's a brilliant collection of coursers
best features including the large side
panel that swivels to open one of my
favorite power supply shroud designs
with its two-piece approach so you can
hide that drive cage and move the front
portion back a little bit more to make
room for the front radiator and
everything is covered with US filters
including the top panel and for storage
I appreciate the convenience of tools as
the installation and the removable drive
cage in front of the power supply the
assembly process is very rewarding and
would compliment first time builders and
very well the next category is the best
tempered glass upgrade case which goes
to the s 340 elite by NZXT simply
because for the $30 price premium you
get a lot of new including a glass panel
with a blackout perimeter to hide the
frame inside the glass is only slightly
tinted but without any color cast which
is good and installation is proper with
rubber inserts that hold the panels
first the Boxee frame looks absolutely
stunning with a piece of glass on the
side and on top of that we get an extra
SSD mount with proper cable orientation
and expanded top IO with HDMI
pass-through and extra USB ports and
improved cable management with
pre-installed clips to simplify cable
routing and also a magnetic puck that
can be used to hold headphones or help
with cable organization the s340 elite
is now the benchmark to beat on what it
means to upgrade a case the runner-up is
the corsair 460 ex that adds a glass on
all the immediately visible sides that
looks absolutely gorgeous especially
with the RGB fans that you can control
the at the top i√∂ for color only and
they highlight why that front piece of
glass is important and you're putting
your entire system on display with
slightly tinted and warm
a tonne glass that sits on long thumb
screws and not as easy to operate as
many other tempered glass cases but it
sure is gorgeous the compliment the
looks the corner support structure has
been minimized so it's not as visible
while the rest of the frame is based on
the 400 C and the third runner-up is the
gorgeous evolve 80 xt G from fantex that
takes a more risky approach by placing
glass on both sides on the main side
it's perfect the glass is shaped to
complement the front panel with the top
and bottom extensions and the standard
blackout perimeter behind which padding
is installed to prevent glass on metal
contact but on the right side there's
also glass revealing the cable guts and
something you might not want to show off
unless serious work is put throughout
everything perfectly which I see as a
welcome challenge moving on to the next
category for the most innovative case
this easily goes to the street come DB
for a unique aluminum cube that is
unlike anything I've worked with in the
past
it's a fan li's design first of all
everything is passively cooled it's an
ITX form factor with GPUs up to 200
millimeters supported there is a
proprietary power supply limitation
which is not so nice and not in easily
accessible IO at the bottom but this
totally unconventional approach to turn
the aluminum panels into the heatsink
for the CPU is so awesome people may
look at this and say it looks like a CPU
cooler which is technically correct
where you assemble the cooling
contraption that goes from the CPU and
that attaches to the side panel and
that's what handles all the cooling it's
not an easy case to work in but the
universal brackets are awesome that you
can use for drives to power supply and
other accessories that you can mount
anywhere around the square frame it's
cases like these that encourage
innovative features to be rolled out for
the mainstream market and highlight the
lack of forward thinking for many cases
in 2016 which is the perfect segue into
our next category of the fail
compilation highlighting the bad
decisions that did not need to happen
starting with the beat Phoenix Pandora
ATX that from a spec sheet look great
but with horrendous side panels that are
thin wavy sheets of metal with terrible
mounting that also carries over to the
weak metal frame on the top that cannot
even properly accommodate a radiator
because spacing is not correct the long
dust filter the front is removable but
it's only removal from the bottom who
thought this was a good idea and finally
interior SSD mounts stick out way too
much that would interfere with a front
radiator moving on to the rear tour
prism twelve eighty a case with so many
fails you're not world's first anything
and even if this was the truth it's
really nothing to brag about with the
garbage fans that are super loud and low
quality lighting that is de-seeding
compared to what you see on the site the
drive gauge is riveted despite having
fan slots right underneath with the dust
filter and nobody clearly built a system
when the SSD in the drive cage as the
drive caddy blocks the silent cables and
we also have a lot of space that is
wasted in this power supply chamber just
for the sake of it or what about the
silent bass 600 from be quiet recycling
a really old interior frame that is not
user-friendly totally restrictive front
airflow intake and only a tiny
ventilation opening at the top to choke
the fans all for the sake of silence by
forcing you not to install any fans
hey Corsair the 570 X feels completely
unfinished I don't care about all the
glass if I cannot properly visually
block the power supply chamber that is
open for all to see and also why is it
that a $59 case has a better power
supply shroud how does that make any
sense
what about lighting inconsistency on the
two illuminations may be linked them to
the RGB fans which is the whole point of
this case after all that would be nice
EVGA why does your case look like a rear
projection television I realize its
weight their friend from anything else
so let's not be overly judgmental but
with a case so large it feels
surprisingly tight to work in because
the bottom frame is non-removable and
the power supply sits way too far back
that might result in some cables not
having enough reach and the strangest
thing is case orientation that is
actually meant to face you like this
with a flock of cables running out on
the side and not the rear of the case
while the power supply cable is still
visible there feeding this hole
cleanliness approach hey Silverstone PMO
one NZXT called they want their designer
back also why can I not install any fans
above the frame when the plastic top
panel is so high this should not happen
if you want to attract the mainstream
builder with potential AIO plants
now listen cases released in 2016 means
they've been in production for last two
to four years the pipeline from idea to
sales is a long one which is why this
failed compilation in this video is
important to highlight all the errors
that we hopefully won't see moving
forward which brings us to my favorite
category case of the year that without a
doubt it goes to the be quiet dark based
900 Pro it absolutely nails on all the
market trends including tempered glass
fan controller built in RGB lighting a
wireless Qi charger at the top that
works beautifully and so this case truly
is pushing the boundaries for
customization and can adapt based on
user's needs with height adjustable
motherboard tray if you require extra
clearance at the top for like portable
or very thick radiators you can also
rotate the motherboard tray for an
inverted system while every single piece
of the interior is modular and can be
configured based on your needs with
individual drive caddies that are metal
multiple slots for the power supply that
all accommodate different motherboard
tray locations and all this modularity
doesn't feel like an afterthought it's
very well polished radiators up to 420
millimeters are supported at the top and
the front it's also carpet friendly as
the bottom panel is solid so in take
around site is consistent with the
design language and all of the feature
said that allows experimentation it is
also future proof and deserves to be our
2016 case of the year now it's very
interesting how fast built-in RGB
lighting and temper glass as the two
major trends for 2016 really spread
through the case industry and I'm having
a tough time figuring out what will be
that trend in 2017 I'm hoping for more
customization and modularity on a larger
scale so if you want an ATX system you
add a few pieces to the enclosure to
make it larger to accommodate for larger
motherboards and vice versa
that type of customization was so cool
but what do you think leave them in the
comments down below what would be the
next big trend in the case industry and
before we conclude a quick message from
our sponsor assembling your verdict your
gaming chair just got a whole lot easier
with a simple insert maker
ISM off the back seat onto the side
rails so you mount the side screws much
faster a true one-man job assembly made
easy by our gear now this would be our
fourth annual case of words we'd love to
wrap up the year with this type of video
but there are a few cases that have been
delivered to the studio quiet late did
not get the hardware conducts review
treatment which are the cooler master
master case maker 5t T stands for turbo
we have an ITX enclosure that I'm sure
will be fantastic the cooler qbx they
actually want in the word during copy
text and the defined see from fractal
that refreshes the interior with a power
supply shroud so stay tuned for full
videos on those cases in 2017 and on
behalf of myself and the entire higher
conduct crew we want to thank you for
being such an awesome community happy
holidays we'll see you in next year but
what do you guys think 11 in the get the
next year rolling without focus whoa got
really dark
