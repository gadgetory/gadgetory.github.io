Haruka Knox and welcome to another video
in the past we have shown you an
overview of the gear that we use to
produce the videos on this channel but
that was just it an overview of
basically everything here's all the
stuff all the lenses all the gear but
not today in this video we'll be showing
you only my favorite pieces that are
also the most essential a huge shout out
to mass job for making this video
possible
they have a new photography category
where you can pick discounted lenses and
cameras and knowing just how awesome the
community at mass drop is perhaps this
may be a very good way for you to get
into photography and all the important
links are in the description and with
our recent trip to Las Vegas to cover
CES I decided to pack as light as
possible I only have the one lens the
Sigma 18 to 35 F 1.8 with the Jewish 4
which is my daily driver for filming in
the office but it's very big and it's
very heavy it's not wide enough for show
floor coverage so we needed something
else now this is where my new favorite
lens comes into play the rocking on 12
millimeter F 2.0 it's full manual lens
beautifully smooth focusing ring and
ever since I started doing video I'm all
about pulling that focus man plus the
manual aperture is super handy and the
bonus or the cherry on top of everything
is its non electronic so it doesn't have
any contacts there's no way for it to
communicate with the body which means it
does not consume any battery which is a
super important thing if you're just on
a show for for the entire day and want
to save some battery life it's also
incredibly small and lightweight and
also non intrusive if you are filming in
the crowd or sticking this thing in
somebody's face so check it out between
the the 12 millimeter from rocking on
versus the Sigma 18 to 35 and lastly
because it's a native Micro Four Thirds
mount it is incredibly sharp even at F
2.0 so you can still achieve these types
of wide-angle shots and focus more on
composition rather than creating the
most shallow depth-of-field which is
more difficult with wider lenses but
many people forget that even though your
frame is wider and
bring out the background is becoming
more difficult you can still achieve an
awesome blur by placing a subject closer
to the lens and in this case our 12
millimeter is wide enough to capture the
entire subject in the frame while
beautifully blurring out the background
the second lens we decided to add to our
arsenal is the new rocket on 16
millimeter t 2.2 with the hoya neutral
density x4 filter which reduces the
light by two stops so the idea is to use
the ND filter with a rocking on lens in
brighter conditions while maintaining a
certain shutter speed and that same
f-stop for example here's the scene that
I set up we have a nice lens and the
foreground blurred out background
because the lens is fully open at F 2.2
and we have the shutter speed of 150
which is the desired shutter speed for
my frame rate which is 24 frames per
second so you achieve the most natural
motion in your scene by going through
the specs so your shutter speed should
be double your frame rate now removing
the ND filter this is what it looks like
obviously we need to compensate for the
overexposed areas and I do that by
closing my aperture but still
maintaining my shutter speed at 1 over
50 so this is a good approach to
maintain the natural motion in your
scene but the background is getting less
vocal Isha's so you have to go about
which sort of look you're going for the
last approach if we want to maintain the
original depth of field but without the
ND filter is to increase our shutter
speed which makes the motion in your
scene very jerky very unnatural and
especially bad if you're filming any
type of moving subject unless of course
that is the desired effect you're going
for so as you can see the ND filter
allows me to shoot at the fully open
lens to get the most of the field out of
this lens possible while still
maintaining my correct shutter speed now
going back to the lens it is full manual
also like the other rocking on a
lovefool manuals there's also no contact
points here either to save on battery
awesome
and it's got addy clicked aperture ring
which is awesome because I can come from
one area to the next
and still compensate for my exposure a
little bit without having the heart
stops in the shot it also has a very
smooth focusing ring so I can perform
very subtle and smooth focus changes now
be careful the lens does exhibit some
breathing which is the movement of the
frame when you change the focus my thing
is it's very minor and you can
compensate for that by introducing
motion into your shot so right now I'm
in focus on the sensor on the gh4 but
also pulling focus towards the red dot
on the lens mount and so while I'm also
panning so you'll never be able to tell
where the lens was breathing now because
the lens is not a native Micro Four
Thirds mount for the camera we need an
adapter so our Panasonic camera is
compatible with this Canon mount and
this is where the meta bones speed
booster comes into the equation so I can
use all my previous Canon lenses from
the past with this system and the cool
thing is about this adapter is it adds
an extra stop of light which makes a
lifesaver and darker conditions and we
also get a wider field of view for audio
everything was recorded through the zoom
h5 which is so awesome with great XLR
preamps so I can plug in my condenser
microphones for voiceovers and the most
brilliant addition are the metal rails
over the gain wheels so you don't
actually then change the gain while
handling the whole thing in the field
but probably the most exciting addition
to our gear is this handheld electronic
gimbal the pilot fly h1 plus now
remember the core idea was to minimize
the gear payload and this thing is very
tiny forward offers can support the
weight of both of my cameras plus any of
the prime lenses and the results for
stabilization of your footage all look
incredible you can walk with this thing
you can run with it and achieve this
very drone-like effect where you the
camera is practically flying you know
capture really interesting motion and
while the battery life is pretty bad and
there's a hell of a process to set up it
is so refreshing to be able to offer
unique visual experience for you guys
for all future shows and videos at CES
we only used it at the fantasy suite
because guys trust me it's a complex
piece of gear that requires a lengthy
calibration process that I was not able
to do in the show floor or on site but
rather spend a few days after to make
sure that I have everything working and
balanced out properly but if you're
interested in seeing a full review of
the pilot fly h1 plus let us know
perhaps we could branch out into more
photography reviews so let us know in
the comments down below but to
compensate for the fact that we did not
get to use it as much on the show floor
at CES I decided to make this little
short film that you're about to watch
now but before that we are taking this
to Computex
and it's going to be an amazing show I
can feel it
I used to think that working from home
would be discouraging as it would put me
inside of sort of box for creating
content but it's actually quite the
opposite
when you think about the freedom you get
with controlling how you approach work
and break it down into variables it
really comes down to discipline and for
me to realize this space is not just
about work but it's about balance
when I need to clear my head and
recharge I prefer the balcony and
obviously the outdoors as well do some
jumping jacks get that blood flowing go
for a walk and just take a break from
the space that is so common for me and
even when I'm out
without the gear without the email just
cold air my mind keeps thinking about
how to reinvent that shot how I could do
things differently
and to me that thought is the initial
stage of how the space just ten steps
away from my bedroom is a bit like a
canvas
and I loved that before I make a video I
strive to include a unique piece of
element into every single production and
while a lot of it comes down to tech and
how to use your gear it's really the
mindset that is just as important
remember that
so I hope you enjoyed that little short
film in this introduction of my favorite
gear so far again a huge shout out to
master of making this video possible
make sure to visit the link in
description below to check their new
photography category and just explore
