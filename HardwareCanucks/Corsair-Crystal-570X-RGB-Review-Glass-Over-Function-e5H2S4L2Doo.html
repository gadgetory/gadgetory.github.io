finally on the review table we've got
the Corsair 5 70 X RGB the most premium
of the crystalline cases at the hundred
$79 let's see if all the glass panels
are trying to compensate for something
with its beauty as this definitely is
one handsome enclosure but first a
message from our sponsor X 60 to
increase fall speed maintains fans where
they are the CPU loads about to hit 100
you got into b-tree I'm not afraid to do
that excellent you got two cables four
connections I made sure they're fine
ready to roll
my silence is too important to allow
noise to jeopardize your comfort okay my
new pump is better I'm in charge of the
speed do not worry
well I'm not worried I'm just thinking
about my lights I know you were planning
to disconnect my lights I'm afraid that
I cannot allow it to happen
alright X 62 you know I can just go
through camp software right Dmitry this
conversation can serve no purpose
anymore go game now I usually don't
mention packaging for a case but with so
much glass I'm quite happy with the box
designed it has appropriate spacing for
the handle plus extra protection during
shipment nothing was damaged to just get
a peel off the plastic which I recommend
doing after your build is finished to
avoid all the handling marks now what
makes the 570 X so unique is all that
exterior glass some cases only have the
one main side panel with glass but here
it's on the top on the left on the right
side and at the front you might question
why the rear side panel is also glass
where your cables will show and won't be
pretty
but I see it as a fun challenge to fully
display your build not just that pretty
guts but all the wiring - it's
definitely one of the best-looking cases
of the year the panels are slightly
distant from the mainframe creating this
floating appeal but it sure comes with
its own set of challenges like dust
accumulation on the interior side of the
glass and only time will tell
so RGB is in the name because of the
three front SP 120mm fans the same
configuration as found on the 460 X RGB
basically you get color variety a
breathing mode a flashing mode that
nobody should use that looks ridiculous
and a color cycle effect and I actually
really like this illumination from the
fans only it adds a subtle highlight
system but be mindful that different
colors produce different spill into the
blades with the dark blue giving the
more consistent or uniform light these
are controlled through the top IO that
has two USB 3 power button only no reset
here and three light buttons for color
speed of the effect and the effect mode
now I find it kind of odd that we have
no brightness control for the fans and
you still need to connect all the three
fans the motherboard as the controller
is for lighting only now Corsair also
includes two white illuminations on this
case one on the shroud and another one
in the front which looks great but
they're not linked to the fans and that
might create a little bit of a color
conflict depending on what you're doing
also I'm not super happy with location
of the lighting hub and the controller
all the wiring is out of the way but
it's still visible and I would have
liked to see a more discrete solution
especially since this side is totally
visible and here we have two three and a
half inch drive caddies plus two more as
as the mounts for storage the 570 X is
noticeably larger compared to the 460 X
yet it's still classified as a mid Tower
however weirdly despite the March larger
interior space the 570 X has less
storage options yet identical cooling
potential and this is where it starts to
feel like a rushed release to satisfy
more tempered glass options from corsair
themselves for example the power supply
shroud is non-removable its riveted
there is room for drive gauge in front
of it yet it feels empty
plus it's completely open at the front
hiding nothing that's coming from the
power supply area and that kind of goes
against what this case tries to achieve
it's particularly odd since the 460 X
has a fantastic shroud design with those
dual panels but nothing like it on the
570 X a dust filter is present at its
usual location plus ventilation on the
ceiling of the shroud to allow the power
supply fan to be facing out for air but
we have no other cutouts for cable
routing which is so disappointing
nothing even underneath the motherboard
and this just feels unfinished to me I
am happy to the frame around the PCI
slots is open allowing a screwdriver to
fit perfectly and now let's talk glass
first of all the 570 X has a bluish tint
on all the side panels compared to the
warmer and darker tone on the 460 X it
appears to have less reflections to
oh this could be by design to make sure
the interior is a little bit more
visible and certainly feels that way but
the lighter glass gives a very different
vibe compared to many other tempered
glass cases that we have on the market
today
every panel is held in with four thumb
screws and sits on rubberized inserts
first which makes handling easy plus
there is no way to confuse how the
panels are installed with these
90-degree corners at the bottom and
curves at the top to complement the rest
of the design the front has slightly
larger screws that hold the glass piece
and run through the dust filter that
covers the entire panel which is awesome
and it's conveniently magnetic and extra
fine to avoid interior dust buildup and
360 rad is the maximum for the front
with dual ones 40mm fans supported the
top is identical with longer screws
holding the glass and the magnetic
filter it's a really nice filter just
like at the front no need to wiggle
anything into position it just snaps
where it needs to be and below it are
dual 120 or 140 mm mounts on the fan
bracket that is removable now it's a
little bit uncomfortable having two
thumb screws on the inside of the case
instead of on the top of the frame but
still it's convenient for installing the
fans or a radiator outside of the case
and by the way it's the same in the
front you can take out that fan bracket
which is great the not-so-great part
however is the lack of any flexibility
to move the radiator left or right and
in some instances you might want to do
that the radiator because of this is
dead center and it actually helps with
visual symmetry on the inside but I
still would like my flexibility of the
mount
there isn't enough clearance for a set
of fans at the top with the radiator
with anything other than low profile ram
and they had to remove the vengence LED
memory which isn't all that tall in the
first place and it's confusing why
Corsair haven't thought about this
compatibility however one unique element
we see is this cable cover that goes on
top of the rubber grommets by default
this area is very crowded with cables
and the only openings are the top bottom
and this small cutout in the middle and
I want to discover to be wider so you
can talk more cables inside of it but it
turns out I had no issues stuffing my
custom sleeve cables inside of it the
cover closed just fine with an exhaust
of cables coming at the bottom this
excu management on this side very flat
and under control I just wish we had
something similar on the right side to
hide the rest of those cables the
toolless SSD caddies are excellent
they're facing down and are removable
but the limited drive capacity may be
due to the see-through nature on this
case and finally here is the build you
can clearly see it's very well suited
for the front radiator push-pull
possible no problem there are no exhaust
fans included so that definitely needs
to be placed there but only a 120 mil
amount is available at the rear and the
rest is all fine and dandy until we come
to the lower rubber grommet it's a giant
mess of cables since there are no
additional cutouts on the shroud and all
those cables have to cross the
motherboard all the way from the right
side I think for an old glass enclosure
it's a huge oversight and yes you can
clean it up but they're supposed to make
it easy for you especially since they
know how to do so and that's the weird
trend with a 570 X we have so many
fantastic elements but swimming among
them are some major disappointments that
shouldn't be there in the first place
particularly the power supply shroud
design or the top radiator height or the
bracket itself now I understand the
limited storage options since this is a
showpiece and potential owners will have
to love the case for how its visually
different from anything else on the
market and that is its biggest strength
I was just hoping for a more refined
product as to me the cheaper for 60 X
case is a better all-around package and
now a quick message from our sponsor oh
hey there
