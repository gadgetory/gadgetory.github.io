hurricane axe and welcome back to
another behind the damn episode I did
get a new haircut I look completely
different but I'm not really sure if I'm
liking this or not but let me know in
the comments down below also pardon me
for my voice seasonal allergies is the
thing it is what it is and I'm dealing
with it I did have two teaspoons of
buckley's this morning so that should
help ease my voice throughout this video
so yeah let's take a look at some of the
stuff that I'll be working on in the
upcoming links and of course I could get
your feedback on you know some of the
things that you'd like to see with
certain products so let's dig in right
after this Thermaltake premium is now
selling gaming chairs with carbon fiber
like leather material standard bucket
see design with lumbar pillow and neck
cushion good adjustable armrests with a
sleep recline built in the chairs are
available in multiple colors and
different sizes learn more in
description below alright first order of
business let's let's render this 4k
video for LG yeah that's Demetri by the
way in 4k glory he looks pretty awesome
and I like this shot this is actually
with my favorite shots for this video I
do have some upcoming stuff we'll talk
about that shortly but yeah let's let's
do that this keyboard I know a lot of
you guys have excited about this one
lobby guys have been requesting for me
to review this like I said it is coming
very soon I just need some more time to
play around with this dial over here
especially with premiere the limitations
is pretty limited but I'm you know
trying to see if I can add custom
profiles on this dial to help my
workflow with premiere I don't know it
might be a fail you never know I'm
complimenting that with the MX master
2's Mouse like I said this is not a
gaming mouse guys I tried gaming
battlefield 1 over the weekend with this
mouse and I failed terribly because it's
a laser sensor not an optical one so
yeah
not recommended for gaming but aesthetic
aesthetic wise it is pretty beautiful so
right over here what are we looking at
so this is the Cano Kino Kino Kino
computer bundle or computer kid bundle
so this is an interesting one Cato is
actually working with us on this video
essentially it's pretty straightforward
you've got a screen that you have to you
know put together
that's one kit so that's the module and
this is a Raspberry Pi
so let me focus here for you guys so
this is the Raspberry Pi you have to
sort of you know put this case in you
get to you know build a speaker and just
sort of you know build it as a Lego so
consider it as building something out of
a few blocks it also comes with a
keyboard and a trackpad that's also you
know Bluetooth not bluetooth it's
actually wireless so it plugs into the
Raspberry Pi via a USB adapter that's
somewhere over here it's right there but
but yeah overall I've been playing
around with this one I also have another
kid from cano and it's right over there
it's called a pixel kit actually it's
right over here what am I looking at so
this is a very interesting accessory for
the Kino because you can program these
LED lights to a certain level to you
know sort of play around with coding and
build yourself a really good program
that can you know run on this kit it's
really cool
I haven't actually tested this out yet
I'm gonna spend some time and play
around this this just showed up on
Friday so it's a day before the weekend
but but yeah that should be really
exciting okay so I do have the Galaxy
Note 8 I'm still testing this out in
depth
we're stay tuned for the review for that
phone as well I have mixed feelings
about this device I like it for a few
reasons I just dislike it for others but
it is an interesting device I've been
getting inconsistent battery life for
some reason on the note 8 you know some
days I get three and a half hours of
screen on time other days I can easily
go past four hours of screen on time so
it's a very very inconsistent and always
depends on usage so that is one of the
things but camera though oh my god the
camera is ridiculously good on the note
me it's expected because the si+ also
had a really good camera so I'm really
looking forward to testing even more
with the known 8 over here is a g6 this
is actually my primary daily driver but
I'm actually thinking of rooting this
device so there is this company called
you might have heard of CyanogenMod but
right now they're shifting towards
lineage OS so I'm thinking of rooting
the LG G 6 and you know putting a custom
ROM on it I don't know should I do it or
not let me know in the comments
it's something that I wanted I've been
thinking of doing it on the g6 so yeah
it may or may not happen the pile of
boxes just never ends still there look
at that it's just yeah this is uh this
is just quite a lot them and what I
would expect there you go there's a
motherboard box that's a $600
motherboard so my boxes don't end here
they're at the studio there's actually a
lot of them in the living room so let me
walk you through what exactly is going
on here so I have three monitors from
pic Co you may have may not have heard
of that company but they did send me on
three monitors one of them is an ultra
wide panel the other one is a 24 inch
1080p panel that one right there is a 32
inch 1080p panel with a refresh rate of
140 vote Hertz that's crazy and the
interesting thing is that all three
monitors come with free sync so that
should be interesting and what's even
interesting is that I have the Vega GPU
I have the limited edition Vega 64 lying
around so what I'm gonna do is set this
on my test bench and test out those
monitors because I know it's a little
bit of a weird combination because this
alone is very hard to get I mean you're
looking at $1,000 plus to get hold of
this card you know you pair that up with
some of these monitors it's it's
definitely yeah they're not a perfect
match but we're just doing it for for
fun so that should be pretty interesting
but regardless of that if you have
something like an Rx 480 or even a
lower-end GPO that can drive 1080p
titles at you know reasonable frame
rates both these panels should do really
well the 32 inch 1080p or you know the
24 inch 1080p not really sure about the
ultra wide though I don't think 480 or
narks for you or 580 can drive 1440p
properly now this is an interesting
monitor from thank you so it's a 32 inch
or 30 xx 32 inch PD 3200 you
it's a 4k monitor IPS technology geared
towards content creators it covers all -
all the bells bells and whistles what
I'm gonna do is actually replace my dual
monitor setups with this monitor so
that's one of the things that I wanted
to do today
and I'm welcoming you guys to join me
for disassembling my entire setup and
going with one single monitor it should
be fun before I move on to replacing the
monitors I want to give you guys a quick
update on the LG Graham 15 so as you can
see the screen has received quite the
damage I'm not sure how this happened
you know I use it for just you know
regular day-to-day stuff like checking
email and of course doing some other
social things here and there I did take
this with me on a couple of trips so the
first one was for the EMDR X Vega launch
video because that one was edited on
this notebook so this was primarily you
know my workhorse I also did take it
with me to the Galaxy Note 8 event and
that video was also edited on the Grand
15 notebooks I'm not sure if the travel
damaged the screen but this really
questions the durability of this laptop
because it's really frustrating because
now you know I really can't use my
laptop unless I put my windows on that
side of the screen because it's it's
like I mean you can you can do vertical
or sorry you can do a split screen setup
but only on that side not on this side
but this sucks I did email LG hopefully
they'll respond with probably a
replacement unit but I just wanted to
give you guys an update on on that
all right so we finally how our set up
all everything is redone I did clean up
my desk single monitor man I I missed
that setup I mean it's so simple it's
very clean I did set the resolution
scale to 100% and so far it's actually
pretty good I think this would be an
excellent excellent monitor I hope so so
stay tuned for that review so that I'll
be coming a very shortly but like I said
craft keyboards also coming up oh man
the setup looks amazing but it's
actually missing something hmm what
would that be oh yeah there you go plant
that's right you got to get that plant
there there we go that's complete guys
also a little update on my main work
session PC I am still using the Rison 7
1700 X now there are a few things that I
wanted to mention regarding my
experience with this Rison workstation
PC so first up is overclocking so I
managed to get the 1700 X 2 4 gigahertz
stable without any instability issues or
any crashes it was all going well
premiere kind of loved you know
rendering videos at 4 gigahertz until
for some reason after an update with
premiere my CPU utilization went from a
hundred percent or 90 100 percent to 50
to 60 percent which was really bizarre
and then what I did was overclock the
memory because remember when I overclock
the CPU I didn't overclock the memory so
overclock the memory to 2666 megahertz
it boosted the performance a little bit
but then for some reason a week after I
started experiencing slowdowns with
rendering so you know it was really
bizarre and then what I did is I I said
the settings to stock so I went to BIOS
set it to optimise settings left in its
dock so it's running yet its stock
sitting right now 3.4 gigahertz I
believe that is I was able to overclock
the memory to 29 33 megahertz and it
does seem to render videos a lot faster
like I said this needs a lot more
investigation Rison is very much an
interesting topic especially for a lot
of content creators out there
I think Dimitri's gonna make up a follow
up video with his experience with his
rising workstation PC so stay tuned for
that I also want to leave you guys on a
positive note
Mike aka sky MTL has can
and that he has his hand song with the
new 16 and 18 core processors from Intel
so these are the Extreme Edition
processors I'm looking forward to
covering those new CPUs and the x29 and
platform I haven't played around with
that platform all I have is X 399 and it
looks pretty promising so of course
pricing and you can go all zoom you want
in the comments down below but I'm
excited for the testing those new CPUs
from Intel so stay tuned for coverage on
those new products or the new CPUs but
yeah let me know what you guys think
about my new setup especially when the
new bank you monitor are you happy with
me switching from a dual monitor setup
to a single monitor setup I'm certainly
loving this new setup I mean it's a it's
a first setup it's it's great it's nice
to have a refresh so thank you so much
