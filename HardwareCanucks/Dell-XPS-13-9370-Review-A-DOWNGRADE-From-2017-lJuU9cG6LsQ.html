Eber here with Harbor connects and this
is the XPS 13 9370 the successor to be
very popular and successful XPS 13 9360
now at first glance you're not going to
know some major difference between these
two notebooks because dell hasn't
changed anything significant in terms of
the physical aesthetics but they've made
a few tweaks here and there to make it
look like the newer model and they've
also changed the port situation so let's
find out whether or not if this new
notebook is the best notebook to buy in
2018 right after message from our
sponsor welcome to you a new keyboard
training first attach the magnetic wrist
wrist it simply pops in don't forget
about the USB pass-through port and the
headphone jack to simplify your
connectivity you were the boss of the
meeting control which is right over here
fiery red key caps are included because
this is a gaming product with RGB perky
all the nation and under the hood we've
got cherry MX silver speed and blue
switches for those legit actuations and
finally don't forget about the voice
control enjoy your new x1 by thermaltake
check it out in the description below
okay so let's cut to the chase and
discuss the improvements over the
previous model since I'm sure most of
you are aware of how the 93-60 looks and
performs we've done a ton of content
around that notebook featuring an eighth
generation processor so if you're
interested in checking them out I'll
leave links in the description down
below with the newer model Dell has made
the bezels thinner by 23% compared to
last gen it's an incremental upgrade
that can only be noticed when you're
comparing these notebooks side-by-side
but if you currently own the older model
that shouldn't be your first reason to
upgrade because it's not that
significant the keyboard layout has
improved drastically Dell has enlarged
the keys by a slight amount but boy
doesn't make a huge difference while
typing there's less room for errors and
by that I meant you won't accidentally
miss certain keys while typing up
something it's just a little bit more
comfortable and faster to type with
compared to the United 360 now the
switch mechanism remains the same Dell
hasn't done any upgrades in that
department
or you get the same tactile feedback
along with the shorter
distance it's great I have no complaints
whatsoever the promise is made out of
different materials on the rose gold
variant of the XPS 13 9370 dell calls a
glass fiber and it supposedly can resist
stains over time but I personally can't
validate that because I haven't had the
chance to get my hands on with the rose
gold Arian because it comes to the
completely white interior but the model
that I have over here is the standard
silver and a gray or a silver model with
the carbon fiber finish and it feels
exactly the same compared to the 93-60
the same story goes for the trackpad you
get the same Windows position drivers
smooth finger navigation gesture control
is just amazing on both these notebooks
and having tested a variety of
ultrabooks here in the office the track
pads on the XPS 13 feel so much superior
compared to the competition it's just
one of the best in the market the
dedicated fingerprint reader has been
relocated to the power button it's a
subtle change and I liked it I had no
issues logging into the device it was
pretty quick and unlocking so that's
nice moving on to the i/o and that's
what threw me off on the new XPS 13
laptop so on the left hand side you get
two types each at about three ports each
of which share four lanes of PCI Express
compared to two lanes on the older
models and that's a little bit of a
performance improvement if you decide to
plug in an external GPU you also get a
battery indicator which is nice and
switching over to the right-hand side
you got your headphone / mic jack a Type
C DisplayPort connector and a micro SD
card reader now to put this in
perspective the older laptop it comes
with a full sized SD card slot it comes
with two USB type A ports and it comes
with the rest of the connection so you
only lose you only get a single
Thunderbolt three port but that's okay
but my question is why has Dell I mean
why do they decide to eliminate Type A
ports and a full sizes you card reader I
get the point that they tried to make
the notebook as slim as they could I
mean it's a little bit slimmer compared
to the older model but it's not
significant they both weigh roughly
about the same I'm not noticing a huge
difference in that part but really it's
just it's so disappointing to see Dell
illuminate those crucial ports I mean
they have included at this dongle that's
a Type C 2 USB 3.0 port but if you think
about it if you decide to if you want to
plug in like
some drives or something like that I
would have to connect this to this
dongle right here and then attach this
to the laptop to take full advantage or
even just get this whole thing up and
running and to me that's just that's the
big that's a big no because I'm not
willing to carry tangles around just
because you know this can easily be
misplaced and you'd be stuck out of
nowhere because you can't really plug in
hard drives or devices even your
wireless mouse that has a USB receiver
into into the numeric model because it
just it's not gonna work you need a
dongle for it to work it's frustrating
I really wish if they kept the full-size
type-a port I mean at least give us one
now the positive side charging this
laptop requires the same type C
connector so that's pretty nice if you
want to plug in an external power bank
to charge this up you can definitely do
that the same story goes with the older
laptop you can still use the single type
C port to charge the notebook which is
great but you know I just really wished
if they included type-a ports the
display hasn't changed drastically it's
the same 13.3 inch 1080p IPS display you
can still off to get a 4k option through
the Dells website the color reproduction
is fantastic viewing angles are just on
par with what you would expect from an
IPS panel one thing to note is that the
screen brightness is only at 400 nits so
just like the previous model you won't
get the best visibility outdoors and I
really wish that they improved that on
the newer model now as I mentioned
earlier you could choose to go with a 4k
display on the XPS 13 but I personally
wouldn't recommend that simply because
1080p is just perfect for the size you
don't have to worry about scaling within
windows and most importantly it helps a
lot with battery life now the only thing
you would lose going with the 1080p
display his touch support so if you want
to have a touch screen you obviously
have to opt for the 4k display but I
don't see myself using touch on notebook
it just doesn't make any sense I'm much
better off using a trackpad
speaking of which is I mean it's great
just using the keyboard in the trackpad
so that's something to keep in mind now
before you get into pricing and
performance I want to quickly touch base
on Dell mobile connect so this is a
seamless wireless integration between
your smart phone and your laptop now
this feature is only available
exclusively on Dell notebooks
particularly the recent ones that have
been purchased this year Dell
working on supporting older pcs and just
FYI Mobile Connect still works on the
93-60 because it still features the
agency PU what's fascinating about this
feature is the ability to send and
receive text messages and by that I mean
SMS messages along with taking or
receiving phone calls directly from the
notebook the cherry on top of that is
that it doesn't require a Wi-Fi
connection but if you are connected to a
network you can remotely access your
smart phone with a few clicks and it
works really well say for example if you
want to check Instagram or whatsapp
messages this is a great feature to take
advantage of the setup process is
actually fairly straightforward
so all you have to do is download Dells
Mobile Connect app from the Microsoft
Store and then download the drivers
which they direct to you right away and
this establishes a connection between
your smartphone and notebook and you'll
be up and running in no time
I do see myself taking advantage of this
feature especially when I'm traveling or
even when I'm here in the office here
and there when I have my smartphone in
the living room and I forgot to if I
want to send a quick text message I can
use this notebook without a problem and
it'll work right away ok so let's
discuss pricing on these notebooks so
the 93-60 starts at $7.99 and the 9370
which is the new model starts at $9.99
so it's a $200 difference between the
two models now here's the most
interesting part the model that I have
over here comes with an i-5 8250 hue
processor it's a fork or a third CPU and
comes with a gigabytes of RAM and a 256
gigabyte PCI Express nvme SSD now I can
figure the exact same specs on the 9360
and the price point was pretty much the
exact same at 11:49 so that to me was a
lot of interesting of course Dell has
these sales going on often so you could
end up picking up these notebooks at a
cheaper rate but it is interesting
you're not gonna be losing a lot in
terms of performance or specs when you
decide to go for both these notebooks
because remember you can still pick up
the older laptop with an eighth
generation processor you're not losing a
lot in terms of performance if you want
to pick up the rose gold and white
variant of the newer model but you're
gonna have to pay an extra $50 so that's
something to keep in mind one of the
things I wanted to test that was the
filmic performance on the newer XPS 13
notebook because with the older model in
93-60 I saw temperature CP temperatures
going
as far as 95c under full load which was
a little concerning because all Dell did
would the own laptop was switch the
seventh generation processor with an a
generation CPU and they were using the
exact same cooling solution which wasn't
efficient enough to cool the new
processor switching over to the newer
model Dell has implemented a thermal
core solution which is better and
efficient a cooling solution which
provides better thermal conductivity to
reduce CP temperatures and the results
do really do speak for themselves so we
saw CP temperatures idling around 32 C
compared to 40 4c on the older model and
of course low temps under my full 15 min
at a 64 stress test I saw CPU
temperatures going as far as 86 degree
Celsius compared to 95 degrees Celsius
on the Ottoman older models so
definitely a great improvement in that
part I did manage to monitor frequencies
while performing tasks during idle the
CPU did get from for 2.5 to 3 point 4
gigahertz which is right on par with the
specs unfortunately during my height of
64 stress test I did notice CPU
frequencies only going as far as 2.6
gigahertz which is still respectable
it's not a throttling under one point if
you Hertz it's right on par with the
specs but just keep in mind that don't
expect 3.5 gigahertz on all cores during
a full load test because the cooling
solution is just not capable enough to
hit those frequencies especially in this
slim form factor another thing to point
out is the acoustic performance on the
newer notebook has improved drastically
so with the older model I didn't notice
fan speeds ramped up quite often even
during idle scenarios I could literally
just hear the fans all of a sudden it
just boosts all the way to 100% whereas
with the newer model it stays completely
quiet you only hear the fans when you're
you know stress testing something or if
you're loading up a project or if you're
doing any heavier tasks that's when you
can sort of hear the fans last but not
least performance and honestly you're
not going to see a huge difference
between these two processors they are
the exact same for core and thread CPUs
with one featuring higher boost
frequencies but thinking about it the
older model can't really reach that
frequency considering its lackluster
cooling solution switching over to
gaming and that's where things get even
more interesting so take a look at three
mark cloudy for instance this certainly
looks a little bit weird I mean the i5
processor outperforming the i7 at some
thing that we have not come across same
story goes with overwatch so I did
notice the XPS 13 9370 featuring high 5
processor averaging around seventy five
point nine frames per second compared to
sixty seven point six frames per second
on the older model featuring an i7
processor I ran these tests multiple
times just to make sure they were
consistent and that was true and I was
sort of wondering to myself what was
really going on so what I did is I
loaded up gpu-z on both these notebooks
I locked the GPU core frequencies a
while gaming and interestingly enough I
noticed that the i7 model with the
integrated HD graphics the core clock
the GPU core clock was only going as far
as the 900 megahertz compared to 1050
megahertz
on the newer model so this certainly has
to do with a thermal solution on the
newer model and how improved and
efficient it is which is why it's giving
us that extra FPS boost in gaming so
that to me is just amazing I just want
to quickly go over battery life on the
newer XPS 13 models so they all decided
to go with a 52 watt hour battery on the
newer model compared to 60 watt hours on
the 93 60 and interestingly enough I
didn't notice a major difference or a
dip in terms of battery life on the
newer model as you can see with my idle
test which is basically refreshing a
Chrome web page on a loop 15 seconds the
new model lasted 11 hours and 35 minutes
compared to 10 hours and 7 minutes on
the XPS 13 90 360 featuring an i7
processor so for my performance and
power efficiency standpoint again it's a
lot better opting for the i5 processor
now under heavy load this is where
things get a little bit interesting
so I ran real bench on a loop until the
battery was completely depleted and we
see the XPS 13 93-60 lasted around three
hours compared to two hours and 21
minutes on the newer model and I think
part of this has to do with the lower
capacity on the newer model compared to
you know 60 watt hours on the older
model so that's something to keep in
mind so to conclude is the new XPS 13
9370 the best notebook to buy in 2018 or
is it the best number or is it worth
upgrading from the older model so if you
have own or if you currently own the XPS
13 93-60 with an A generation processor
I don't think it's worth upgrading
simply because you're not getting a lot
into
performance and the design is pretty
much identical the one thing that I
would recommend doing is replacing the
thermal compound to see if you can
actually reduce those temperatures in
some cases it does work so that's
something that you could look into
although be mindful that it could avoid
it could void your warranty but that's a
topic for another video but if you're
coming from an XPS 13 featuring a sixth
generation processor or a seventh
generation processor or even any other
Ultrabook or if you're shopping for an
ultrabook in 2018 and the XPS 13 the
newer model is certainly worth looking
into simply because the design is more
refined it features an a generation CPU
which is faster especially when it comes
to multitasking stuff and the thermal
solution is definitely a lot improved
compared to the 93-60 and that's awesome
lack of USB type-a ports and a full
sized SD card reader is definitely
deal-breaker to me because if I want to
transfer media from my camera to the
notebook I can't really do that I have
to I have to sort of rely on an external
solution or a dongle or an adapter and
I'm not willing to take that as of right
now but if you're okay with that you
should definitely look into this because
it's definitely a great notebook to buy
and I'm gonna wrap it right there I want
to hear your thoughts on the new XPS 13
19 370 what do you guys think about it
do you think Dell improved or do you
think delq have done better in terms of
the design and of course what are your
thoughts on the temperatures and of
course the performance would you
actually opt for you an for an i5
processor or an i7 processor let me know
