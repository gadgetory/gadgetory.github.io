of our tips and techniques for content
producers thank you so much for tuning
in on this last episode and for for this
part we're going to be finishing up with
something that I think is very important
to discuss competition and who do you
learn from or how can you make yourself
go further and involve even faster and
do different things so competition is
good in multiple ways first of all it
allows you to be dynamic it sort of not
allows you but it almost forces you to
be dynamic and evolve into certain
things do things differently and you
have to make those connections you have
to look up to certain people whose
content you appreciate and you like and
you have to sort of try and create
something that is simple like out of
their style and make it your own style
so there are a couple of youtubers that
I follow Phil a bloom chase jarvis and
dave dugdale are my three camera guys
then developed fantastic content in both
educational technical and creative all
the same time and it helps me to see
what they're doing and how you're
capturing things and translate that into
our technology reviews and our coverage
and that's why when when we're doing
certain things that as simple as a case
review you've seen all types of crazy
angles and crazy shots on lighting
setups that look fantastic on video but
they're really basic in terms of just
knowing where to position the lighting
stuff and throw this series we did
lighting subs so make sure to check it
out within filming tips and techniques
so make sure to check that out as well
and all that really encompasses into
your own style and looking up to seeing
what you like from other people and you
know borrowing some of that and making
it your own I don't mean to say
plagiarize their style I don't mean to
say plagiarize the exact same shots but
take that into account when you make
your content because that is how you are
going to try to evolve and try to be
unique and try to be unique with each
single video not the entire video but
try to do at least one thing differently
new with single production now i agree
competition is good as a matter of fact
back when I worked in Microsoft I used
to use the slogan competition breeds
excellence and i would say that all the
time in meetings mainly just because it
sounded bitch and bitch and but the
reason why I really said it is when
you're competing with somebody in
competition doesn't mean that you're
trying to trying to undermine somebody
you're trying to hurt them get to get
that out of your head success by hurting
another person is just stupid that's the
wrong way to do it there's a couple
YouTube channels that I'm not going to
mention that basically thrive on the
destruction of other channels and other
people and those kid that's not the way
to grow that's not a legacy that's not
something that's sustainable and
ultimately in the end it's just going to
get you into a lot of trouble so the way
that I look at competition is what I
look up to somebody who's a larger
channel to me or somebody who's doing
content that I want to do and I feel
like I can do something different in
that territory and I can really really
create that same kind of draw that
they've produced by being unique and
doing it my own way now from the tech
world something that is more relatable
to what hi reckonings does is obviously
we have this amazing community of
youtubers that share this audience this
amazing audience and I say share because
competition in itself is awesome but you
also have to remember that we are all
part of the community so we all kind of
feed off each other and we all seeing
what's working with different YouTube
channels and what I would do sometimes
is go into certain channel that I have
seemed to thrive recently like
awesomesauce network kyle has amazing
comedy and seeing what he's doing right
and actually that's helping me to seeing
what people are what what is popular and
what is getting the most engagement and
part of that is obviously his character
he is putting out his personality to the
table but also he is releasing content
and that is actually very good tip for
everybody is to release content that
people want to watch in doing so make
sure not to forget and not to derail
from your initial objective is to is to
portray your character and to do things
that you want to showcase I also look up
to TLD because his content is so crispy
man you could cut glass without crispy
footage taking some
techniques looking at the footage and
looking at how he is able to achieve
something that is so beautiful and tried
to recreate your own then you can notice
little things if you look at the footage
for example to try to do this next time
if you are content producer and you like
what you see pause the video try to
count the light sources and try to
seeing how the lighting is positioned
seeing what the camera is in relation to
the subject and try to visualize how
that scene was first come you up the
composition is like and how that scene
was first put together in order to
create something that would not create
but in order to realize how those things
were were shot and trying to recreate
that sort of similar composition later
on for your own video another took
youtubers that I follow for the
technology side of things is obviously
Linus is entertaining and educational as
well there's a lot of things you can
learn from people even though if it's
not completely relatable but we our
content sort of overlaps quite a bit
when it comes to hardware and there's
obviously Jerry thank you so much for
coming on to this episode but his
content is so personal and so it
actually has helped me to develop to
just sit in from the camera and talk to
you about my techniques about my style
and throw these episodes I think that I
have grown to to how to control myself
around the camera what to say and how
not to just completely blank out and
that all comes with practice and as you
watch these other youtubers you can take
little things here and there and try to
make sure that you can do a better job
for the future obviously regardless of
the content and so for all you guys
leave your thoughts in the comments
below of who you follow in terms of
trying to learn from them who is your
sort of role model in terms of all the
aspects creative aspects personal aspect
second you know informational aspects
and all those things because that's the
beauty of the video community is that we
have so much variety so you can really
take anything from anybody and make it
your own so there's quite a few people
that I look up to in the YouTube
community too many to list right here
because I'm sure my long-winded
responses of art
blown Dimitri's video way out of
proportion i'm sorry about that bro but
you know me I talk a lot so the top guys
I would say influenced me would be at
number one spot and it's going to
totally just give him a big ego boost in
the head would be JS to sense now Jays
to sense is a technology channel where
he reviews mainly computer components
does computer builds in his in his
expertise is in water liquid cooling
right and I found his channel early on
when his channel was actually larger
than mine he had more views he had more
subscribers and I really loved his
quality of video and once I finally
contacted him I came to learn that he
was achieving that quality of video on a
very cheap DSLR camera nothing special
for audio all of his lighting was like
Home Depot cans with CFLs in it and
paper draped over it and it looked
absolutely stunning and the first thing
I learned from him was that the quality
or video isn't always determined by your
equipment I was shooting on a canon 5d
mark 3 which is a 3500 dollar body
another thousand dollars in lands h4n
audio interface shock and Mike and I was
not producing the same quality that he
was and he was the one that taught me
that setting up lighting and doing stuff
correctly and and and I still haven't
picked up on some of the stuff like
smooth b-roll people love smooth b-roll
I don't know does I still hand-holding
I'm all over the place like I just drank
a couple starbucks before I do it but
but I've learned a lot from him in that
respect that you don't need a lot of
money to actually produce good quality
video but the goal is you do want to
produce good quality video you want to
be well lit you want to have good audio
right now we're in a lavalier mic so
that you can hear me really well when
I'm all animated moving my head around
with the shotgun mic that just didn't
work very well because I was always
facing in different directions but it's
making all these small little changes
and learning how to master the tools
that you have that they really up your
game and now now I'm a larger channel
than Jay I mean I think I'm like a
hundred thousand subscribers ahead of
him or something like that you know
because clearly I've got the better
channel actually he'd probably argue
that just cuz i got into 3d printing
when that was the huge craze and nobody
else was doing it and i'll probably
agree with them that's probably the
biggest draw to my channel even today is
the 3d printing or or things that are
combined to it and it's kind of like the
starting point for a lot of new people
coming into my channel so i'll totally
agree with that now the second person
might surprise you guys in
actually helped me a lot and that's
Linus Sebastian from Linus tech tips uh
he's actually a really cool guy I see a
lot of comments about him where people
get mad because he makes such short
videos now and he does he does a lot of
things that people don't necessarily
agree with but the thing that I you have
to realize from my perspective is I've
watched lioness grow a lie I mean more
than double his size since I'm God / I'm
more like tripled his size since I
started watching him and he's actually
talked to me on many occasions offline
where you guys haven't seen it gave me
pointers on how to do things for my
channel and at one point he may have
even lured you know alluded to me coming
and working for them but i'm not i'm not
a canadian so so that that didn't work
out but anyways he has actually been a
great mentor he's given me a lot of
really good advice and even despite all
the hate that comes in from the
community and people that really really
try to tackle him back to a simpler
version of himself he still just keeps
on storming forward now his format isn't
necessarily for me you know a lot of
what he does is very very professional
very very scripted very very well set up
he has employees he has editors he has a
building he has those things he runs his
youtube is a business and I have huge
respect for that and he is highly
successful at it now my goals with
YouTube are completely different but
that doesn't mean that he wasn't a huge
influence on me and gave me a big
confidence boost that I needed now the
last person I'm going to mention here is
going to be Logan from tech syndicate
and the reason why Logan's on there and
it's kind of funny because tech
syndicate is such a different channel
than like linus tech tips jzu says I
mean they're all over the place right
I'm picking these from weird spectrums
but the reason why I picked Logan is
because tech syndicate itself is awesome
in that they don't care about anything
when you look at them it's not about the
money it's not about the business it's
not about really anything they just want
to do what they want to do enjoy what
they want to enjoy say what they want to
say and they really don't give a
about what anybody else thinks and I I
have huge respect for that because they
could sell out any time and just grow
grow grow grow grow push the business
grow at hire more people do more things
but they don't they stay true to their
original mission statement and they just
keep on plugging forward and plus it's a
it's an awesome
group of guys not just Logan I mean you
got Davis cane you got Wendell so so
many guys that are just super super
intelligent and brings something unique
to the table and I've really liked that
and I and I love talking to Logan every
chance I get because you talked to the
guy for like ten minutes and you get the
vibe that he's the same guy for the most
part that you see on camera and he's all
about just doing what he's excited about
he's not about doing what brings in the
most money he's doing about what he's
excited about and he's actually really
good at it between those three they're
probably about fifty percent of my
overall influence and then there's
probably a hundred other channels that
are responsible for the rest I mean like
tested and the ben heck show and stuff
like that I mean there are a ton of
channels out there that have have
contributed to the influence that makes
what you see here the barnacles nerdgasm
but honestly guys without any kind of
competition we wouldn't really have any
reason to keep getting better I mean
after a while besting yourself isn't
that interesting it's always fun to
actually have other people that you're
in competition with like even Jays two
cents and I mean we we compete on a fun
level where we'll share statistics and
rub each other back and forth whenever
we have a success and stuff like that
and it keeps things really interesting
again it doesn't come from a hateful
place it's designed to motivate both
parties please don't ever go and try to
make a channel and try to become famous
by doing gossip putting other people
down being destructive trying to become
famous by trying to negatively associate
yourself with larger people to force
them they engage you I see this happen
all the time and and it seriously just
makes me want to cry that there's people
out there that they're so focused on
being famous and they want to be
somebody to the world that they're
willing to compromise their entire
morality to do it and damaged a lot of
people in the process so don't be one of
those guys now if you guys are wondering
this entire video is shot on a sony FDR
a x33 camcorder that costs about a
thousand dollars 4k capable I have a
hooked up to a Sennheiser microphone
setup that's actually a pretty expensive
set up but right now I'm shooting at a
manual f-18 aperture it's tracking my
face and doing autofocus so much easier
than using a deal DSLR and the reason
why I'm telling you guys this is because
if you're getting into YouTube don't
think
you have to go get a super high-end
camera you don't need a red cinema you
don't need black magic you don't need a
canon 5d mark 3 with a full-frame sensor
and a two-thousand-dollar lens you just
don't do your research it's YouTube that
we're not we're not producing video for
the imax theater here so definitely
don't spend a massive amount of money on
equipment first and then hope to be
successful use what you have use your
cell phone if it's got a good camera use
a wired lav mic that cost twenty bucks
use the minimal amount of hardware that
you can to find yourself figure out if
you like it and find that audience that
you're looking for once you do that then
start the improvements in building I've
seen a lot of youtubers actually go out
at the wrong way and they go out and buy
really expensive camera mikes big studio
lights and everything like that and then
they find out that they're just not
comfortable in front of the camera or
they get frustrated when they don't draw
an audience really quickly because like
me it's taken me six years to get to
where I'm at guys it's not like
overnight I just became huge I mean most
of my growth has happened over the last
two years but it's not like you're just
going to create a youtube channel and
become famous I mean unless you pour
gasoline on yourself and run around
naked on fire and an intersection
somewhere and somehow survive then
you'll probably be viral and and then
you'll be you'll be famous for that one
video which brings me to another really
quick point and that is don't try to
become viral the thing is well actually
let me rephrase that you do want viral
videos if you can achieve them but don't
make that your goal to create a viral
video because what happens you'll create
a viral video you'll bring in a ton of
subscribers will bringing a ton of views
on that video and then nobody else will
watch any of your other stuff if it's
not as good or as compelling as that
video and it'll become very very
frustrating TV I prefer to go the route
of slow and steady wins the race have
that nice steady positive growth and
have each video meet the expectations of
the majority of your audience and it
will as long as that audience was
brought to you by you being yourself
because it's hard to not be yourself and
being yourself as I said before and as
jerry has explained is crucial in order
to develop your own relationship with
the camera your own relationship with
the audience to make sure to follow that
advice to heart hey Demetri thanks again
for inviting me to be in this video the
last thing I want to say is guys just
like I'm doing right here with Demetri
collaborations are also there
very important I didn't talk about those
very early on but try to collaborate
with other people that are similar to
you that have like-minded goals now I'm
not saying go hit up PewDiePie and try
to get a collaboration be realistic try
to find channels that are in your in
your same size and in your same genre
but don't be afraid to reach out and try
to collaborate with people where it
makes sense because collaborations help
both people involved if done properly
and honestly it can give you a huge
boost in subscribership now don't
confuse collaboration with shout out you
don't want shoutouts everybody asks for
those in my video if I say hey ya go
follow at Shane blah blah blah on
Twitter five people will go follow you
though three of them are trulia and then
four of them will leave it's just it's
just how it works a shout-out doesn't
give any kind of tangible proof that
you're worth watching or you're worth
following what you want to do is find
people that will actually collaborate
with you people that will showcase your
abilities people that will merge their
abilities and your abilities together
towards a common goal those are the kind
of collaborations that you're looking
for and if somebody doesn't want to
collaborate don't get mad about it move
on because a collaboration needs to be
something that both people are mutually
and equally excited about if one person
super excited and other guys like me
trust me it's going to show in the video
all right take it easy Dimitri so thank
