drink because intel has announced a
bunch of brand new processors and
they're codenamed
whiskey Lake now you don't have to pour
yourself a glass of booze and take a
shot every time when I say whiskey so
just sit back and relax and this video
is definitely gonna be a lot more
informative for you especially if you're
in the market for a back to school PC so
the new whiskey light CPUs are
particularly geared towards the mobile
notebook space and what these new CPUs
can bring to the table could just
potentially take the notebook technology
just one step into the future it's tough
it's a small step but nonetheless let's
get into the details now we want to make
this video to give you guys a rough idea
of where these current whiskey Lake CPUs
line and current Intel Schlampe
and make sure you understand what
exactly you're looking for because if
you thought that notebook or purchasing
in notebook was confusing before well
it's gonna get even worse because Intel
will be offering more than 20 different
processors at the same time and I think
that's just a bit ridiculous and I'm not
kidding so let's start things off by
talking about where whiskey Lake fits
into the larger notebook product stack
so that you guys can get a sense of what
we're dealing with and remember every
one of these new processors are
considered to be a generation and are
based off intel's original 14 nanometer
skylake microarchitecture a few months
ago we covered intel's high-end
copulating mobile processors that were
replacing most of these 7th generation
cabling cpus basically these consisted
of 12 eight and four threaded products
for higher-end and slightly thicker
notebooks that favored performance over
all day battery life they all had TDP is
ranging from 25 watts to 45 watts and
used Intel's latest generation
architecture basically processors based
on coffee Lake promised better overall
performance in multi-threaded workloads
and higher clock speeds than kV Lake we
actually saw that with our launch day
coverage on desktop parts as well these
processors were used in gaming laptops
like the eurocom q5 and the gigabyte
Aero 15 X we looked at a while back and
in those cases a coffee like mobile CPU
was paired up with a high-end discreet
graphics card to provide an awesome
gaming and creativity platform
I actually still use my gigabyte arrow
15x4 trips like CES and Computex because
with that Intel CPU paired with the
discrete graphics card for in this case
it's the gtx 1070 max-q
you're looking at an awesome mobile
powerhouse and with the recent update to
Adobe Premiere taking advantage of
hardware acceleration it really renders
videos just as fast in fact faster than
some of the desktop systems and I've
encountered in the past alright so
here's where things get a little bit
more confusing in the last year Intel
also released a range of lower
processors for thin and light notebooks
with the cable 8r architecture the art
here stands for refresh so while there
are some improvements over the original
discontinued cable a chips the broader
revisions in coffee lake haven't made
their way into these CPUs from a micro
architectural standpoint think of cable
a car as a bridge between cabling and
coffee lik it's not really one or the
other
all of these processors from the i7 all
the way down to the i3 are carried with
the core you brining which means they
use a lower voltage to improve battery
life and lower temperatures that also
means giving users much less performance
than coffee lake based core H CPUs but
an ultralight notebooks like the LG
Graham so portability is more important
than record benchmark numbers I also
can't forget to mention the chord G
series which includes higher wattage
quad-core 8 threaded CPUs alongside AMD
bigger graphics but those plaques are
beyond the scope for this video since
they're mostly focused on other non
notebook markets now at this point
though you can actually start to see
where problems and mistaken identity
start because there are a whole lot of
processors on this page already while
the core H lineup is pretty defined with
CPUs that have 45 watt TDP s and offers
some impressive stats there is a core u
series here as well though unlike the
cable 8r parts they still have a TDP of
28 watts and use Intel's upgraded iris
plus integrated graphics all of that and
they still use very very similar names
for example the IEEE 78550 U is a fork
or eight threaded kb like our cpu with
the TDP of just 15 watts meanwhile the
i7 8559 you also has eight threads but
is a very different animal
the only way someone can tell a
difference is one by the single number
and trust me you guys aren't the only
ones going a bit crazy with all of this
but there's a good reason why I've taken
all this time to explain what looks like
Intel's homemade version of an alphabet
soup
that's because Intel it's gonna be
parachuting whiskey Lake processors
right smack into their KB Lake our core
u product stack now before you ask no
they aren't planning to replace any of
the existing CPUs with whiskey Lake
that's mostly because they are yet
another evolution of KB Lake with some
additional features rather than based
off coffee like enhancements let's zoom
into these sort of new CPUs to see
what's up there will be three new
processors here and they're baseline
capabilities are actually rather
impressive by using yet another
refinement to their 40 nanometer
manufacturing process Intel has been
able to increase boost clocks by a
pretty big amount in some cases
supposedly performance is up versus
cable HTP use by about 10% which has
happened without Associated loss in
efficiency or heat output other than
that baseline specifications are pretty
much identical but there are some
interesting things going on behind the
scenes the more interesting addition in
my opinion is the long-awaited
replacement for intel's original cabling
core why series these are ultra low
wattage cpus that have two cores along
with four threads all boasting an
insanely low TDP of just 5 watts expect
to see these inconvertible tablets and
other similar devices that need a huge
battery life but don't have the space or
cooling necessary for the 15 watt new
series now according to the information
that intel has sent us whiskey lake
processors are optimized for
connectivity and yeah I know that sounds
like a pretty broad marketing term
that's all fluff and won't have any
meaning in real life but there are a few
things that could change that opinion
perhaps the most important inclusion is
a suite of new power optimizing features
that should lead to better battery life
than cable a car Intel claims some of
these systems will run for more than 16
hours while playing the local 1080p
video but I'll need to test that for
myself before taking it as a reality
much of whisky lakes evolution takes
place within its platform controller hub
or PCH Intel is taking a page from their
Gemini Lake playbook by including
a CMV I integrated connectivity module
called pulser into the PCH this allows
for integrated 160 megahertz gigabit
Wi-Fi compatibility there's also a new
ultra low power quad-core audio DSP for
broader compatibility with voice control
digital assistants like Microsoft
Cortana and Amazon Alexa for example
with integrated Cortana and Alexa
support you can now be on the road
working on a presentation and without
missing a beat verbally ask Alexa what
the status of your home alarm system is
that DSP is so low powering so it can
always stay on when your system is
hibernating you can then have the system
wake up by just talking to it and yes I
know that sounds a bit weird but I know
I'm sure there will be other uses for
this feature as well there are a few
repeats here too Thunderbolt 3 isn't
directly integrated into the PC age and
no book manufacturers will need to add
an expensive Alpine rich chipset for
compatibility of course octane support
makes that come back to and while we
couldn't find great uses for it on the
desktop platform this technology will
come in handy for notebook users so how
will users be able to determine whether
or not if a notebook that they buy would
feature one of these new processors well
Intel is actually hoping to kick off a
customer education campaign in September
and October and I have no idea what that
means and what are the details but it
looks like there is or there has to be a
lot more information for customers to
digest because my brain certainly had a
lot of time and a tough time just
processing all of these new information
but I guess and I hope this video sort
of eased that out hopefully Intel's
partners are also supposed to add this
logo to their packaging and other
materials I'm having a bit of trouble
with this to the optimize for
productivity really looks like a
last-minute addition so hopefully
they'll have something of a bit more
refined ones systems launched speaking
of new systems some of the first that
will have whiskey Lake processors are
Dells upcoming Inspiron 7000 and 5000
series 2 and once they have ultra slim
aluminum frames nearly 16 hour battery
life compatibility with Amazon's Alexa
and octane support it seems like this
could be a perfect fit for enhanced
connectivity options offered by Intel's
evolved a platform and personally I've
never found a use for convertible
notebooks but with more and more
features but
pad into them I'm sure some people will
find these useful so there you guys have
it I know I spent a lot of time sitting
at the stage explaining to you
you know what whisky Lake what these new
aesthetic CPAs are because you know
Intel's current lineup is super massive
and I'm hoping that this video sort of
helped ease that and helped you process
some of this new information a place
that's what I hope and you can
definitely let me know in the comments
down below but like I said throughout
this video
I think Intel's current notebook lineup
is way too confusing for a lot of people
especially because of their sensible or
I guess their meaningless naming scheme
with their existing model parts and all
that kind of stuff it just doesn't make
any sense I feel like you know offering
20 or 20 or more processors at the same
time in the notebook space just make
customers it just it just makes it
difficult for customers to go on and
pick and choose what they really need
what's also obvious is that Intel is
really struggling to remain relevant and
launch new technologies there have been
long delays with their upcoming 10
nanometer cannon Lake architecture and
that means features that would normally
be rolled into larger revisions are
being drip fed to users in minor changes
like those in whiskey lake and even
Kaiba Lake are CPUs and to make matters
even worse slightly older parts can't be
discontinued because many of the
partners have only just begun
implementing the cable ik are you
serious processors into their new
notebook designs so with all this being
said I'm really excited to see what
whiskey lake has lined up for the future
and I'm really curious to test out these
new CPUs and see what they offer for the
average consumer I'm more particularly
interested in testing the battery life
because you know if you can have a
notebook that can last for a day perhaps
Indiana half with just casual use that
will be kind of fantastic and for
someone like you know perhaps a student
who just takes notes for classes I think
it's certainly gonna be a welcoming
addition but again Intel offering 20
more processors and notebooks these days
is just it's insane so I want to hear
your thoughts on Intel's new whiskey
lake offerings what do you guys think
about it and of course left Lea let me
know what you guys think about the
codename whiskey lake because it just it
to me it just sounds like
until just having fun naming all of
these things with different things
because we have coffee lake now we have
whiskey lake so what's next I have no
idea anyways I mean but with Humber
