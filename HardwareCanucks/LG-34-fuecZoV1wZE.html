hello everyone I'm Dimitri with heart
reckon ox and I am super pumped for
today's review because this would be my
first proper widescreen experience for
the desktop as I go ahead and use the 34
inch LG monitor as my daily driver for
two weeks and explore with the curve and
this white screen 21 by 9 IPS monitor
can deliver the exact model this panel
is 34 you see 87 see priced over $1000
USD so you are looking at the premium
investment one that is unique in so many
ways and let's just hope that we don't
stumble upon too many drawbacks so first
thing is this is a 34 inch curved ultra
wide form factor with a resolution of 34
40 by 1440 at 60 Hertz it is a bit of an
odd resolution and one that takes some
time getting used to but imagine a
typical 2560 by 1440 P panel with 34%
more wide pixels it is a beautiful 10
bit IPS panel that LG calibrates at the
factory for correct out of the box
colors and as an editor that's highly
appreciated
now before switching over to the LG
panel this is sort of what I was used to
dual 27-inch set up both 1440p panels
this way I can comfortably work on
multiple applications plus they are 144
Hertz G Singh displays for that
incredible smoothness so when I started
using the LG monitor the 60 Hertz hit me
hard with a long adjustment period and
this is where 75 Hertz g-sync or even
free sync would complement the panel
nicely to future-proof this monitor and
expand the usability into gaming which
by the way at this resolution delivers
fantastic and the unique experience the
physical characteristics of a monitor
are satisfactory with a tiny bezel and
edge to edge glass design with a larger
chin at the bottom and let these smaller
bezels all around to make this LG panel
standout with elegant and slim body for
the i/o at the back we have a power in
headphone jack dual HDMI and a single
DisplayPort plus a USB 3.0 hub with
incredibly difficult to reach ports for
the stand there isn't any kind of cable
management cables are just routed behind
and while it offers the basics with
plenty of height adjustment and some
angle the LG stand lacks rotation and
pivot which could have been really handy
and multi-monitor configuration and also
allow me to strengthen the monitor as
our sample was just tiny bit off angle
that once you notice it's kind of very
hard to avoid although I love the
low-profile and open design for the
stand base that allows me to put some
important items important in quotations
in the center for perceived organization
one of the weakest points on this
monitor is the on-screen display and the
uncomfortable joystick to navigate
through the OSD the layout for $1000
monitor is just disappointing that
requires digging around to find that
needed functions that are all buried
behind flawed navigation but the three
axis color adjustment along with six
axis adjustments are available which
luckily will not require your immediate
attention things to factory calibration
now the panel curve itself will be a
love it or a hated type of feature as
nothing on screen this straight while I
was enjoying the extra real estate for
my timeline in premiere the curvature of
all the horizontal lines on-screen made
the error inside of me unhappy as you
can see the bowtie effect very evidently
and I ended up moving the preview window
closer to the center to reduce the
bending lines for that footage it's
weird but I never thought that I would
dislike the curve for editing and also
viewing angles suffer when looking at
the monitor at an angle so for optimal
brightness and color uniformity you
better sit directly in front and view
head-on and also here's the panel
uniformity chart with the top-left
corner being significantly darker than
the rest of the screen and for the price
that's just disappointing however would
this monitor does best is multitasking
having two applications side by side for
a comfortable work environment plus
anything that takes advantage of the
wide screen real estate this is a dream
monitor for Excel work amazing and
visually outstanding for gaming as well
as the screen curvature is subtle but
adds an awesome layer of emerge
as the edges sort of wrap around you for
media consumption that is natively 21 by
9 it is outstanding experience one that
makes me want to find more 21 by 9
content to enjoy in this full-screen
aspect of playback however the majority
of content is still in the 16 by 9 one
of these black bars on the side it's
fine to enjoy a youtube video but you
wish that there was more content
produced in this 21.9 aspect for the
consumer if you think that you will love
the panel quality and resolution of the
LG 34 you see 87 C then you are 100%
correct this is a multitasking single
panel dream one that does not favor two
creators that work with Photoshop or
modeling software because the lines are
just not straight if only LG made this a
g-sync
or a3 sync monitor then it would have
been a little more future proof for
gaming purposes as you need really
powerful GPUs to drive the games at this
resolution for smooth frame rate and in
conclusion the LG 34 UC 87 C will
definitely put pressure on the more
conventional 16 by 9 monitors
unfortunately the lg monitor is not your
all-around versatile monitor because it
is expensive content is just not ready
for the 21 by 9 aspect ratio and also
there's more to be desired with the
stand however if you are ready to
experience the curve and all the
benefits that carry over with it
then there's no doubt you'll definitely
love what you see and this concludes
