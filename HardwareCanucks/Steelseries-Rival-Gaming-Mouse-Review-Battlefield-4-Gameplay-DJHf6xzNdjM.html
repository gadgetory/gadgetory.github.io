and there's a new Mouse on the block
from SteelSeries and of course we gotta
check it out this is the rival a very
basic no bells no whistles on here
with what seems to be like an
appropriate price of $59 the rival is an
optical mouse and while still some
people prefer optical sensors over laser
for its supposedly more accurate
tracking I think it really boils down to
economics when it comes to mice in the
current gaming scene the 65 counts per
inch sensor will be plenty sensitive for
higher resolution FPS gaming and the
mouse actually tracked pretty accurately
on both dark and light surfaces
ergonomically the rival suits my
preferences perfectly with rubberized
textured sides that help with steady
grip without too much pressure from your
thumb at 128 grams I would call this a
lightweight with a pretty balanced
weight distribution I am however used to
heavier mice so it is unfortunate we
don't have an adjustable weight system
the slightly curved body and extra
support on the right side make for one
really comfortable Mouse whether you
prefer claw grip so all fingers are
placed naturally or even palm grip with
elevated top for larger hands the rival
does feature customizable LED sections
with the logo in the back that's pretty
vibrant and of course multicolored and
then there's the scroll wheel they are
subtle but having the ability to color
match all your peripherals is definitely
something of an expectation for a gaming
product we also have a replaceable piece
at the rear with two rubber name plates
included SteelSeries does allow
downloadable templates for 3d printing
for really personal customization to be
honest it is pointless serves absolutely
no functionality and I would have
preferred
either weight system to be included or
even a slightly lower price tag as for
the buttons SteelSeries uses their own
switches so left and right click provide
excellent tactile feedback with sturdy
scroll wheel and sensitivity switch
right behind with two settings I prefer
to run that eight hundred and sixteen
hundred CPI for battlefield to make my
aiming quicker inside
course and I found having just to
sensitivity modes perfect without need
to psyche through the side browser
buttons continue to travel even after
they're registered and have a soft roll
off this will prevent any disturbance to
your tracking accuracy and while I don't
usually use these side buttons for
gaming remapping void to my mouse for
communication was very helpful also if
you guys played the hardcore mode in
battlefields for the lack of a mini-map
can really test your skills but you
still have access to the full map by
pressing M on the keyboard so IRA mapped
that to my mouse and now I can quickly
glance to the full map which was very
helpful without disturbing my aim and
not needing to leave my WASD zone with
my left hand now I did have issues with
the first sample we received
particularly with the distance between
the left and right click when holding
the right button and pressing your left
click they were kind of grinding against
each other with the left-click going
underneath the other the second sample
as you can see had the larger distance
so there was no longer an issue but the
sensor now would not track on the white
surface when you left the mouse while
tracking on the first sample was perfect
now even for $60 Mouse I would expect
that a quality control also the rubber
coating left a bunch of finger marks
that isn't exactly Pleasant and this
happened only after a few days of use
now in a better note SteelSeries engine
software is a very good hub for all
their peripherals here you can remap
each button to anything from your
keyboard there are media controls and of
course macros on the right side there
are two sensitivity settings below which
you can adjust acceleration and
deceleration I would recommend that for
gaming but I did find it quite useful
and desktop mode and when I was editing
you can further configure angle snapping
and the polling rate of course you can
create profiles which is very simple and
these profiles will auto lunch with an
application so you can have gaming and
editing profiles switching in the
background depending on usage so the
rival certainly is one strong contender
with excellent ergonomics and
lightweight that you can really get used
to I love how the switches feel and the
CPI switch is perfect with just two
modes lighting is subtle and the optical
sensor showed no
raishin with pretty excellent tracking
and the software is definitely one of
the best the one aspect I'm not pleased
with is quality control
first there was grinding with left and
right click and then the artifact on the
sensor on the replacement Mouse also the
rubberized coating while comfortable
showed unpleasant signs of wear just
after a few days of use the rival
however has been my primary Gaming Mouse
for over three weeks as I love to shape
and very pleased with tracking results
so if it is within your budget it's
definitely worth checking out
well that concludes our view of the
SteelSeries rival optical Gaming Mouse
