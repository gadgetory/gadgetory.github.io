talking about my final dual system
configuration inside the evolve X you
know my first try going air-cooling
wasn't exactly satisfactory to me you
know my initial idea of going full air
meant that I have to avoid any drivers
from all-in-one coolers and pumps and
things like that and I really just
wanted to go a full Noctua route because
their fans are fantastic their coolers
are fantastic however for my 80 600 K
the ITX configuration that tiny little
cooler while sufficient enough for maybe
a pea use and lower tier i3s and I fives
I just wasn't able to keep up with my
4.8 gigahertz overclock and so we had to
step up our guns now based on the
initial video everybody was commenting
about why not go you know with a custom
loop why not go with dual all-in-one
coolers which is what I did here and I
really just wanted to get into the
mindset of someone who would use two
systems for their everyday tasks and
really try to utilize that hardware so
yeah let me share my experience with you
right after this the new animatic slick
tech TR for AI a liquid CPU cooler now
features this beautifully diffused RGB
lining around the CPU block that can be
customized via this control box or
through your motherboard it covers 100%
of the IHS plus it comes in two forty to
eighty and three sixty millimeter
variants learn more in the description
down below so obviously one of the main
advantages of having dual systems inside
something like the evolve X is the fact
that you're saving on space you have two
functioning systems one power supply
they revolt X so that is an additional
expense but it is a 1200 watt unit and
there is also platinum efficiency which
is awesome but the $250 it is an
expensive unit however the fact that it
can power two systems it is an added
value versus other 1200 watt power
supplies that are also platinum
efficiency you're looking around like
150 to 200 dollars so significantly
cheaper than the revolt X so you're
upfront cost of doing something like
this is going to be much higher versus
if you were to just build two systems in
two separate cases and of course if you
go into the full custom water cooling
look for the do
systems all that additional you know
cost on water cooling gear is going to
offset the additional price you'll spend
on the power supply so that's not really
an issue
and I'm thinking majority of people who
would gravitate towards doing a dual
system inside the Evolve X might
potentially just go with like a
low-power you know high-efficiency ITX
system that you can maybe use for an ass
or your banking or for security reasons
also let's not forget you would need a
KVM switch to actually optimize your
workflow with dual systems when they're
so close together and the KVM switch
allows you to use one set of peripherals
so you route everything into it and with
a click of a button it switches between
the inputs from one system to the other
and you can also get them really
expensive ones that allow you to reroute
HDMI and other video signals too but for
you know if you're using one monitor
simply switching the input is enough for
my own personal use but a KVM switch is
crucial now that's what the assembly
process this is my third time building
inside the evolve X so the first thing
you must do is just completely assemble
your ITX system pre route everything so
that is working fine and only then
insert your ATX components and the rest
of the hardware it is important to
double check to make sure the ITX system
is working and it is hilarious to see
you know monitor being powered by the
GPU and then the entire body of the case
completely empty and really highlight
the unique position of that ITX
configuration inside the evolve X it
almost like hides your system and you
know mounting an ATX motherboard and the
rest of your hardware in there it
doesn't really compromise on clearance
you know it is a bit more difficult
routing certain things above the ATX
motherboard but all in all it is a
pretty decent assembly process for
cooling I went with NZXT Krakens I love
how they look the pump and that whole
mirror design on the interior especially
because there are two of them I wanted
them to match so I have the X 42 which
is a 140 millimeter radiator for the ITX
system and the X 72 for the ATX system
which is a 360 rod so plenty of cooling
I kept the original noctua fence for the
front nice static pressure through that
dust filter so I get the best air flow
and there the front so they are Brown
but
really visible when you're looking at
the side which is what I wanted because
the original plan of going full knocked
or you know it didn't exactly render a
beautiful system versus now I pretty
proud of what came out of it my GPU of
choice for the ITX system is the gtx
1060 it is blower style so that will
help with cooling because it is right
against the glass I didn't want anything
too powerful and I really just wanted to
test out the temperatures when both
systems are fully engaged in some type
of workload situations both for the CPU
and the GPU and I'm actually quite
surprised at the temperatures all the
hardware is adequately cooled both CPUs
are at 4.8 gigahertz which is amazing
and the only Carter item here is the
Titan XP I'm guessing it is because it
is getting that hot air from the front
all-in-one cooler plus the backplate of
the gtx 960 so airflow is a bit
challenging in that section but I don't
know 82 degrees Celsius is kind of what
you'd expect in like a normal shot see
anyway so I'm pretty happy and the one
thing to keep in mind is that you can
actually offset the vertical GPU for the
second system slightly away from the
panel to give you a little extra
breathing room but that is only possible
if your main GPU is does no it's not too
tall and if the PCI cables don't
actually interfere with the second
vertical card and that's for noise
levels because everything is kind of
contained and the only added noise
making element is the pump and the
additional fan for the X 42 it is still
pretty quiet and you can't tell that two
systems are on right now now as you can
see I matched everything in green and
that is just because the Jedi Order logo
on the Titan XP that is in green and you
cannot change the color unless you turn
it off and so I just decide to go full
on green for the whole system you know
the coolers look fantastic in green the
memory looks awesome in green you can
even have lighting underneath the
motherboard on the Asus boards on both
them actually so that's fantastic and
the only mismatch people the only
mismatch is that GeForce GTX logo on the
gtx 960 that is more like yellowish
versus everything being like totally
green I do have a knock to a fan for my
exhaust which is brown
but because of the hey looks Lux Digital
RGB fan frame it lights up the blades
and really kind of hides the brown frame
which is a really good alternative that
I didn't think would be a possibility to
like camouflage the Browns fan inside
there but it looks absolutely awesome
and for cable management I literally
spent no time I simply closed those
behind doors onto which you can mount
three SSDs onto each so that's awesome
for extra storage if you are doing let's
say an as for the ITX system and the
only kind of weird thing that pops out
is the riser cable because it's it's not
totally flush against the frame unless
you really pull at the bottom tabs but I
don't feel comfortable doing that and so
the only thing is they stick out more
than the cables and there's something to
keep in mind
now I also reverted back to using an air
cooler for the main ATX system just to
see what type of opportunities would
open up you know the knocked oru 12s
there's a fantastic cooler and it's also
pretty low profile so it does not
interfere with anything above it and
with this configuration you could remove
those sliding covers beside the
motherboard and insert hard drive cages
so if you're using actually you know the
ITX system for nass solutions to
populate hard drives in there that is
one option and that would also clear up
any heat generated by the old one cooler
at the front and therefore you'd have
nice fresh intake instead of it being
slightly warmed up and if you're not
using a GPU for the top ITX system it
will clear up some of that space for the
main motherboard area may be going sli
so that things don't get really cooked
in that section and this whole
experience of building this dual system
configuration three times now has been
kind of eye-opening because I realized
that it's not for me and I would never
use the second ITX system for like
majority of recommendations that you
guys had suggested in the previous video
I do have a NAS in a separate room but I
realized the potential of building
everything in one to potentially offset
some of the cost and everything being
your own
I don't game while I'm rendering so that
does one the most popular
recommendations
I'm doing other things and I'm not like
thinking about oh let me jump into you
know a pub G match while my videos
rendering which only takes ten minutes
anyway I don't stream but I realized the
potential of offloading some of that
processing to the second ITX system
instead of your main ATX but also you
know the system hardware here is pretty
powerful so I don't think it would be
too much of a bottleneck and the main
thing I can actually see myself using
that second system for is building a
hackintosh so they can have like nice
Mac OS experience and you know standard
PC and editing all that stuff or maybe
banking and security purposes just doing
all my really critical and for you know
important things in the ITX system and
nothing else there and then having
everything else offloaded to the ATX
system but that is kind of it maybe I'm
not going outside of my comfort zone and
really trying to figure out how to
utilize that second ITX system but I
just realized it is not for me but I'd
love to hear you know your thoughts and
if you have any dual system experience
in one enclosure what is the purpose of
each system so let me know and
potentially help others to come up with
ideas on why or why not they should go
with something like this improve your
workflow it's stream deck mini by Elgato

more check out the stream deck mini down
below all right guys I'm Dimitri thanks
for watching we'll see you next video
I'm very proud of the color
