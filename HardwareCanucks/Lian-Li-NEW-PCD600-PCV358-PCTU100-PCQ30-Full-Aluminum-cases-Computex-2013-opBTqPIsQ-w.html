lynly we are the Computex 2013 booth we
have their they're announcing their new
double-wide series that this is the d600
so Eric tell us a lot about what's
what's the history behind it what's the
purpose for the d600 double-wide series
will you leave now this case is meant to
be so you can see everything on one side
of the case you have your motherboard
you have a graphics card you have a
power supply you have lots of room for
like your water cooling setup and then
on the other side you have your storage
so you have all your hard drives and you
can put all your wires on that side so
you end up with a beautiful water
cooling setup or some whatever you want
to do the imagination is the limit and
you can look at it so if we look at it
let me open it right here you can see
that we have a you get an idea of what
you can do with this case so we have it
we set up a water cooling set up with
this cool kind of angled look inside of
it and then on the other side we just
threw all the wires and I was gonna say
it looks a very clean case so obviously
the advantage of having all the wires
were always stacked in the back and
having your hard drive cage in the back
as well minimizing the clutter of here
so now given this Leonie is known for
sort of its modding potential so how
where does this case the case fit in
within that well as the only it's all
aluminum so it's very easy to cut into
it's really easy to modify also with
this case it can be taken apart
extremely easily and we
she really thought about in designing
this case so even just taking off the
front panel like so you could take it
out and actually this entire cage on
this side can be completely removed you
just take out a couple of thumbscrews
and you slide this whole thing out
so super easy to work with and that's
why I Lili is known for this kind of
like great modding potential kind of
kids so a triple 360 degree right here
240 in the top and then a 360 in the
back again so pretty good water cooling
potential here so what's the release
they expected and we also as we went for
the factory tour we were told that you
guys accept feedback from gamers from
from bias from customers so have you
gotten anything back regarding this and
any do you have any updates already
planned for this well we might actually
add more kind of holes for water cooling
potential but actually as this case is
just announced we would appreciate
feedback so you can hit us up on the
facebook on also on our forums you can
check out our website for that let us
know what you think about it let's know
what you think could be improved or
better and we'll consider that as we
develop it further right alright so this
is the Leonie d600 the double wide
series pretty cool pretty cool stuff for
water cooling now let's go check out
with some other two cool cases that they
just announced here at Concord X 2013
alright so moving on we have another
cool case from me and Lee this is the BC
B 3 5 8 so while we have girls dancing
the background Eric tell us what's going
on over here ok so this is the PC B 3 5
8 it's a micro ATX
and it's in this cube form factor and
it's similar to the PCV 3 4 3 5 4 and
the 3 5 5
so with this case a couple updates are
there with your evil side panel just do
pop off panels that mean they use a lot
of mini ITX cases we have this 240
radiator support which is a secured by
four screws like so and then when we
open it off actually did you see the
huge difference so it removes acquittee
moves like this on this hinge and you
have access straight to the motherboard
straight to the graphics cards who
easily inside this case and on the
bottoms we have all the storage and
there the cajon clear it will just to
list as well up to six three and a
half's and three two and a house here
what's the hydrophone for the CPU cooler
I mean this you know this would be sort
of directed for a water cooling internal
right like all-in-one right so we got
two fans on the front just slide them up
and then take them off with a fan filter
right there we have an additional 120
exhaust fan in the back as well
so what's the expected release date and
pricing options so this hopefully by the
end of this year and it's a prototype
model but the pricing will be similar to
the three five four and the three five
and they came out which I believe was
around about 150 or 160 USD so another
cool model here from Lian Li the BC V 3
5 8 all aluminium cool thing is you can
lift off the panel basically work within
your keys this way very easy workflow
for internal modifications if you want
to swap on the graphics card or your
memory for example so thanks Rick we're
gonna let those girls take over the show
now so continuing will be Li one other
cool case that we noticed here was the
BC tu 100 now we actually went to Lian
Li factory tour and we actually saw this
case being assembled which you guys
could check out later in this video so
Eric tell us a little bit about why this
case is so small it looks like you guys
made some adjustments from the original
200 be the original kind of briefcase
chassis was this tu 200 now with this
case back when it was made whose about a
year and year and a half ago there
wasn't these small form-factor powerful
gaming cars like there are now so taking
this into consideration we wanted to
shrink down to a mini ITX case that as
small as possible but still is extremely
useful gaming and as you can see
extremely portable it's very tiny yeah
looks like a little mini money box
almost right so as you can see this is
the silver full aluminum case it also
comes in the black version one thing to
notice that the actual silver panels are
a little thicker so they're not they're
thicker a lot more durable a lot more
sturdy yeah and also these warnings kind
of protect it from any Nick's or knots
right so as you can see front into a
full airflow very elegant case 2 USB 3
ports audios and your power button also
acts as a reset I guess yes also no
actually just power yeah and I should be
take a look on the inside just to open
it you just press this knob like that
and then pull the thing out let's
quickly pop off the instrument you just
put it back in so in this case right
here we have our this new Asus 6 M&amp;amp;E car
we have a small form-factor power supply
and you can fit up to 2 2 and a half on
the bottom right here and again with the
slim optical drive for not using it and
these days that where you are you can
put another 2 and a half inch drive
there and this 120 fan blows air kind of
like brute force throughout the case
yeah what are the power supply options
here so you have to you have to keep
with a small form-factor power supply I
can't remember the exact dimensions for
the link but it does not come with it ok
I see and this case actually without any
of the internal components of weighs
less than 4 pounds so it's really so
another another great case from me and
Lee this is the PC to you 100 all right
so I'm back here with Eric we
repositioned so that we get a little bit
of show in the background but we also
have a very interesting mini ITX case
here this is a pc q 30 so Eric tell us
what what this is and what's the idea
behind this stuff but at the same time
with these new small powerful graphics
cards you can actually use this as a
gaming PC so we make normal cases we
make standard mid towers full towers
mini ITX but as we have our own
you can do tweaks as much as we want
every year we'd like to do something a
little bit different and this year with
this case we use something we made
something that's interesting unique to
look at without being super awesome
tatius at the same time very practical
so this is the silver version this is
coming in at black as well yes it's a
silver and black in the black inside an
ounce so what type of feedback or
whatever responses have you received
from this because lien ly is known to
produce something unique something out
there like the snail for example it was
both lovers or hated thumping
relationship so what are we seeing with
this case
oh this case we really just try to
target people that are looking for
something different and cases at the
same time if you're something different
this is the case for you okay cool and
we have the motherboard in the
background 2 PCI Express slots and also
this is some ventilation holes for your
graphics cards just exhausting Aaron oh
thanks slim so when is this going to be
available what's the price range in
North America the end of this month and
then MSRP is 139
we thanks Eric this is the pcq 30 from
Lee and Lee so it thanks guys for
watching and stay tuned for more complex
coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
