increasingly competitive with companies
wanting to produce something unique
something that will stand out from the
rest of the square boxes Corsairs
presence in the market is highly
welcomed as the company stands behind
quality but most importantly it is
another brand that drives competition
and innovation
so the c70 is the first chassis within
the Vengeance series that is inclined
towards gaming the case all around his
military characteristics almost looks
like an ammo crate with a dark green
coating full metal construction even for
the front panel and the latches that
secure both side panels it got something
many cases miss out on and that's
character so let's take a look if the
$150 price tag is worth it the front
panel is also military themed with the
power button resembling something that
would be a board and army vehicle then
we have our audio ports USB 3 ports with
an included USB 2 adapter and the reset
button that looks like a restricted
button that can only be pressed when
necessary
it's these minor details that bring the
overall theme of the case together the
front panel has three optical drive bays
with dual intake fan slots the panel is
removable from the inside and has a
removable dust filter unfortunately no
front fans are included the top panel
has two built-in handles and to really
simplify the transportation of the case
and you to its light weight this is
going to be a very attractive for land
parties although the handles are quite
thin we've had no issues carrying in
fully loaded system and you can also
mount dual fans at the top which is
pretty standard for mid towers and
looking in the back we have water
cooling cutouts an exhaust fan io area 8
PCI slots and a power supply mount and
at the very bottom of the case 2
removable dust filters are located one
for the back and one for the front and
the chassis is also slightly elevated
for stability and air flow the side
panel has an acrylic square window with
fan mounting options to cool your CPU
and your GPU however many gamers like to
display the internals and it would have
been nice to have the option to replace
the window either with a mesh for
airflow or a clean acrylic that would be
used to display all the gaming hardware
now to get inside the case just unsecure
the latches and pull off the side panel
it's that easy no need for screws or
needing to reach the back of the case
not only does this help to keep in
character but just an easier way to get
inside so let's take a look inside it
does look familiar and that's because
Corsair has stuck to their internal
design simply because it works they've
kept the same army green on the inside
with black accent on the rubber grommets
and the fans the optical drive base use
to list mounting below which are the two
hard drive cages with the two included
fans and on the other side we have a
large CPU cutout and rubber grommets
around the motherboard tray with an
included exhaust fan so let's check out
the back what we see here from coarser
is a bit more focus on cable management
with the extra cable tie notches and
these three large cable clamps that
they're not exactly aimed at holding all
the cables but would do the job just
right for smaller ones and you can
easily remove them in case they aren't
what you need to do a clean job now back
inside the hard drive cages are
removable with thumb screws either which
can be installed individually either to
get that little extra airflow for your
GPU or for water cooling as the bottom
cage sits on this platform that can be
removed to reveal dual fan intake which
could be utilized perfectly for a dual
radiator but due to the relative small
stature of the chassis longer power
supplies will restrict the installation
of the second fan but it's always nice
to see this option to be available the
hard drive cage itself can mount a
single 120mm fan which would help in the
thermal Dept in each of the tools drive
bracket supports 2.5 inch SSDs so let's
take a look at the fully assembled
system this mid tower has no problem
handling cable mess the interior looks
clean and everything is well organized
at the back and with the help of the
cable clamps it actually handles the
thicker 24 pin cable without too much
trouble and putting in the our 11 a half
inches graphics card there's still
plenty of room left with a cage
installed twelve point six inches of
clearance is available so it's quite
future proof in the hardware department
so to summarize the c70 brings to the
market and other quality and product
chassis with character the
military-themed design is quite
attractive inside and out the top
handles are really useful for easy
transport of the case and the cable
management for a coarser chassis to no
surprise is hassle-free and with
included cable clamps the job is
simplified and the entire chassis is
well ventilated with great airflow and
support for two dual rods is a bonus now
while it does offer a number of unique
features the $150 price may not be
justified due to the competition
revolving around the same price tag even
coarser itself has better quality cases
for that price
so really the c70 is aimed for those
craving that military look and something
that's easily transportable as the
internal design has practically been
kept the same also the initial fan
configuration will deliver poor airflow
performance and that's because the fans
must be installed at the front panel
instead of the hard drive cages the
Vengeance c70 will appeal only to a
certain gaming market based on its
appearance but no doubt this will be a
popular LAN party chassis and that
concludes our view for the Vengeance c70
thank you guys for watching and we'll
see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
