that is joining the harbor Canucks team
for Computex is downstairs checking into
the lobby and his had a pretty rough
travel time Hardwick Canucks is at
another fantastic Computex show all
thanks to in video fantex NCIX and msi
already bossing you around this setup is
a little bit unconventional we have to
ask for third bed
ash here hey ash sup guys is going to be
in this bed far away from Eber because
this is going to be this Ebers snoring
location ash what do you think of this
little doorway into the toilet arena
this is so we're back to the hotel we
have our ash here beaver behind me and
another special persona on the bus with
us your head
alright so ash here is preparing for a
little bit of something creative I've
always wanted to see this man work with
this camera or whatever camera
so you take this there you go
that is your shots complete
Bieber getting ready his hair nice and
tidy going out in the city and then
there's ash looking gorgeous as always
we were supposed to leave it to three
months me Eber and ash for like for a
little party but he politely has asked
us to step out due to the very
uncomfortable bathroom situation we got
you ash reaction so just came downstairs
and look at who's commenting on
Instagram we know what you're doing ash
so cut off your phone and come down a
little quick update that's been more
than three minutes how long's been more
like 20 minutes
ash is still upstairs we should probably
go check on and so look who decided to
show up and you know what he's saying
he's blaming it on the lids
look at this player what about Eber our
year is to be do my camera
there's Sam
well look at who we span Haley this
first encounter 3 or 4 m3 like you my
fine
it's really cool feature actually
because once you switch to that effect
on the keyboard within it's a really key
feature again it's a really it's a
really cool feature actually because
once you switch you can be effect of
picking up an audio no and something's
going on right now
dimitri is testing patches my lenses
through there
that's all capabilities when it comes to
identifying which lens is the best so
not the best which lenses this has the
smoothest focus to remain so if ash is
going to close his eyes is you want to
touch one of the lenses not knowing
which one and then we'll do you yeah and
then we'll do me oh yeah I'm gonna give
me a whole lens no okay just different
what's the other one here okay once you
definitely smooth it or look smoother
one is definitely less down so you would
say this is your lens over my you know
I'm not saying it's my lens that's the
one that's moving so right now it is
1:30 a.m. I'm everything on here this is
ash right there doing some more and we
have Eva here taking a little quick nap
maybe we should take a little snap
all right let's do this
this is you another time that's what I'm
not falling asleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
