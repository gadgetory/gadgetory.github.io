tidy going out in the city and then
there's ash looking gorgeous as always
we were supposed to leave two three
months me eber and ash for like four

us to step out due to the very
uncomfortable bathroom situation we got
to ash reaction so we just came
downstairs and look at who's commenting

because once you switch to that effect
on the keyboard within it's a really key
feature start again it's really it's a
really cool feature actually because
once you switch into the effect of
picking up an audio no no then
something's going on right now maitreya

that's all capabilities when it comes to
identifying which lens is the best so
not the best which lenses this has a
smoothest focus remain so if ash is

touch one of the lenses not knowing
which one and then we'll do you and then
we'll do me I'm gonna give me a whole
lens no okay just a front what's the
other one here ok once definitely
smoother or look smoother one is
definitely less down so you would say
