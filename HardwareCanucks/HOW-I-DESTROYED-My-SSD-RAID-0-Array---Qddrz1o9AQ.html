using for the vlog stuff this is the
rode videomic pro so now let me tell you
a story of how the case behind me
ruined 400 gigabytes of information and
how I lost a bunch of files that were
never backed up luckily everything is
online and it's you know a portable
format but the raw files and all the
source files are lost forever so what
I'm talking about is go watch the review
for the NZXT monta case where in the
beginning I wanted to create this very
suspenseful introduction where system
shuts down and I freaked out what the
hell's happening and then the case pops
up
so within that power-down that was
activated by me by shutting off the
power brick that that houses the
monitors and the computer and so what
happens is then when I shut down the
power brick the PC and the monitors all
turn off to create this very cool effect
and you can see the power brick is right
over there so in doing so I want to be
authentic I didn't want to be done in
post and therefore I was wondering like
okay this was gear spinning it was like
how can I make this happen quickly so
that I can sort of move on with the edit
and you know get the rest of the stuff
sort of ready for for the review in
doing so and powering down the the
entire system my raid 0 array my lovely
raid 0 array in the system had failed
the drives are okay but the raid failed
in doing so I destroyed 400 gigabytes of
information that was not backed up
luckily these were files that were
uploaded on online for the worse their
respective channels already for you know
publishing but we're not saved as source
files so last seven videos that I've
produced basically nothing existed them
than what is being imploded or has been
uploaded on to the internet which is
very upsetting
looking back to your responses on to the
the introduction of the you know the
montevideo which is right there still it
wasn't worth it because i should have
been more careful in terms of how i
approach you know power-down like that
obviously lessons learned in two
scenarios first is raid 0 is very
dangerous in case the power outage as
raid can fail despite the drives working
totally fine and then second things
should have been backed up obviously and
that's something that i am taking a lot
more serious now that it has a
to me in this very you know
consequential disruptive personal matter
so now it's time to disassemble the
monta because we have a new case on the
block this guy literally just came in
yesterday this is the Nano s from
fractal design the new mini ITX
enclosure
everybody's going mini ITX it's very
nice I have received many requests to
clarify why my microphone solution like
the you know my AKG microphone and the
zoom are on top of the h4 40 the 2015
edition you guys are asking about the
review for the case actually for the
last ever since I received the case it
has been my platform for recording the
audio when I'm in front of the camera
because you know when I sit down and I
want to have a nice background behind me
like these monitors and the camera let's
say is in front of me like this I have
no microphone stand that can reach this
high so I have to stack things on top
and so far it's been working great so
it's time to move on to another case of
you just finished the NZXT monta the
entire view was shot on the camera that
you're watching now the g7 and that's
because gh4 despite of it being an
amazing video camera on the first place
as well it still doesn't shoot as good a
video as the g7 which is so unfortunate
because the gh4 is you know double the
price but the few things about it onto
the review videos you know recently this
new plant and i kind of tried to use a
little bit of symbolism into in the
video because i have the big plant and i
have the little plant and so using both
plants in the video kind of you know
gives us a little bit of a balance of
this case targeted towards ITX so think
of aloe plant ITX obviously the one
smaller than system formats but in a
very large enclosure so that was the
idea behind using something like this in
conjunction with this also just as the
other little plant these are fake
because first of all i they look
despite being fake on video it's all
plastic anyway I don't have to water
them and I can store them on top of the
computer case without having to worry
about these leaking through so the
takeaway from this video is multiple
things coming on to a channel multiple
reviews with the Nano s the 400 see from
Corsair if you haven't seen the monster
of you yet go check it out and also I
will be more careful now from now on
with my introductions perhaps nothing
super crazy that will destroy
information but at least I have got rid
of my raid 0 array and I have installed
extra backups in case you know things go
down again and fortunately so guys
thanks so much for watching this behind
the scenes I'm green tree with I reckon
axe make sure to subscribe for more like
it now you know why and how my raid 0
got destroyed with 400 gigabytes of
information just lost in the year
because of my stupidity and that one
single power jack which is right there
somewhere this is what the office looks
like once again after been in total
filming mode I'm going to begin working
on another case from you now and we'll
see you in the next video
