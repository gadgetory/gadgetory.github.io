Canucks and welcome back to another view
fractal design cases have always stood
out for their elegance and functionality
with every new case though it doesn't
feel new because they keep the same
external design and pretty much the same
internals as well with a few minor
upgrades so you're looking at the arc XL
a chassis with a core focus on cooling
and priced extremely competitively for a
full tower at $130 and starting with the
front we have a removable dust filter
with dual front fan intake and one thing
I keep seeing on pretty much all cases
is heavily restricted air flow due to
drive cages and it's something I would
certainly like to see changed the
plastic front panel resembles brushed
aluminum without carrying that heavy
price tag and there are four optical
slots all the connections are located at
the top with three speed three fan
controller audio jacks PR buttons and
four USB ports the top also features a
convenient removable panel when they
built-in dust filter with many fan
mounting options with support for a 360
mm rad and I like how the 120mm fans are
offset to allow better clearance with a
240 mm on the radiator so it doesn't
interfere with the motherboard this is
an excellent feature and I would love to
see this integrated more often there's a
bit more venting in the back for the top
portion of the arc XL an exhaust fan for
a total of three fans included and nine
PCI slots the chassis is also elevated
on large rubberized case feet with a
massive dual fan dust filter to cover
the bottom intake now I love dwindled
cases I'm sure you guys do too
especially the ones from fractal design
without any fan girls and the darker
tint that will make you build look
beautiful so getting inside we get that
modular drive cage system with two thumb
screws meaning you can rotate the cage
for more direct airflow or remove it
completely for just better cooling the
drive caddies here are metal which I
prefer as they are a lot sturdier than
flexible and weak plastic caddies
they're also SSD ready and feature
rubber grommets for the 3.5 inch drives
now you can further reposition the
bottom drive cage away from the front
panel to allow thicker 240 millimeter ad
to be installed in the second position
there's 45 millimeters of clearance and
in the third over 150 millimeters of
clearance for your front radiator and
surprisingly without compromise now yes
you lose out on the top drive gauge but
still longer power supplies will fit up
to 200 millimeters we have plus the
rubber grommets will help with clean
wiring of those drives this gauge does
block the lower to PCI brackets which is
a problem for larger motherboards like
the XL ATX but other than that it
shouldn't interfere now turn in case
around we have SSD brackets and sort of
just holes which makes mounting and
replacing them a lot easier there are
large rubber grommets and cable tie
mounts all over so cable management
shouldn't be a problem now one thing I
dislike though is how the side panel is
mounted as that gets rid of your ability
to tuck the cables at the bottom and
this space is unofficially located on
the inside which cannot be utilized for
anything but luckily we have a full inch
of room to work with
at the back the power supply is elevated
with Robert standoffs but only in the
front which I don't particularly like
but it does the job and mounting our
motherboard inside this four tower feels
large and roomy on the internals with
clean cable work and with the GPU
mounted the arc XL looks great and
there's absolutely nothing negative to
say about the assembly even with our 11
inch GPU the rotated cage fits in just
fine and everything cleaned up very well
in the back my only hiccup during a very
user friendly assembly was the audio
cable which wasn't long enough to reach
our motherboard but overall this fractal
design case is absolutely one of the
best choices for a functional full Tower
and if you're looking for a more silent
solution the defined XLR two features
identical internal layout but with more
sounding damping options the arc XL is
designed for air flow and water cooling
and delivers to that perfectly with
front and top water cooling options
without compromise module drive cage for
user flexibility the rear SSD brackets
and all with an excellent price of 129
dollars that I want to see a more open
design for the drive cage to allow less
restrictive air flow which are
he goes to all case manufacturers and
not just fractal design the short audio
cable is something to keep in mind and
perhaps a new frame design to allow
wasted space in the bottom of the case
to be utilized in the rear for cable
routing but despite these small flaws I
still think this is one of the best full
towers in its category and deserves the
damn good and the damn good value award
so thanks guys for watching and we'll
see you in next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
