Canucks and my experience with the 1+3
has been phenomenal and many would agree
that this is one of the better value
smartphones currently on the market but
it is being replaced with one plus 3t
with better specs and a higher price
point now the original one plus three is
approaching its end of life status and
that means it will no longer be sold as
a stock runs out so which of these two
should you pick up now find out after
this
introducing the new OC CVX 500 s all
state drives from Toshiba it offers
great well-balanced speeds build with
mlc nand flash for superior endurance
and is also backed by five year advanced
warranty program learn more about the VX
500 at OCC com
now so interestingly the 3t is only sold
in the new gunmetal color with a soft
gold option coming later the slightly
darker tone is subtle but it's clear
that oneplus is moving away from the
staple silver color to have some
stronger device recognition I think the
move to upgrade the internals to a
Snapdragon 820 one grown the battery
capacity to 13% bump up the storage
option to 128 gigabytes and also improve
the selfie camera to 16 megapixels
versus eight on one plus three and all
of these kind of place the 3t ahead of
the specs game without modifying the
thickness or the physical
characteristics of the device and you
know what the $40 difference between the
64 and 128 gigabytes is very reasonable
and good news it seems that they've
updated NAND flash on the 3t scoring
significantly higher than the one plus
three and the 3t also scores better than
my galaxy s7 this means boot up times on
the 3t is about 12 seconds faster
compared to the one plus three updating
applications doesn't take as long but
aside from that there are no other
significant differences in everyday use
because of this storage the six
gigabytes of RAM is kind of a big deal
the smartphone has more memory than 37%
of the playerbase on Steam during the
month of November but does that actually
make a difference for multitasking and
yes it does you have 14 applications
running in the background which allows
you to return to any of those
applications without the need to load
them again the entire speed and
smoothness equation is really on point
no complaints with operation I love the
capacitive fingerprint sensor that gets
me into my phone much faster than having
to physically press the button on my s7
that now appears quite heavy physically
nothing's changed I think that's for the
better I don't mind the 1080p resolution
and AMOLED blacks are fantastic out of
the box white balance was kinda on a
cold side but that can be adjusted plus
an sRGB mode is available but with that
mode things look a little bit dull
without the vibrancy you'd expect from
smartphone the camera bump is still here
that is very well hidden with a cover of
which there are plenty and helped
tremendously with holding the slippery
device now sure you are covering the
beautiful aluminum but you know you
could go with the darker woods that look
awesome or the plain sandpaper which is
my favorite it's great to hold plus a
reminder of something unique to one plus
the alert slider is amazing we did not
disturb in silent modes that you can
easily customize I use this most often
when going to bed instead of scheduling
they do not disturb time or muting it
when I'm in the meeting and more Android
phones need to have this slider all
buttons feel satisfying aside from
learning not to lock your phone while
adjusting the volume because their
opposite of each other and that's the
only crappy thing about the handling the
applied screen protector on the 3t is
wider and thus not as annoying when
sliding from the side and I mentioned
this because on the 1 plus 3 it is way
too narrow and you can constantly feel
it during use when sliding from either
side the speakers at the bottom sitting
beside the type-c connection with USB
2.0 speeds and the headphone jack I
could not tell the difference in audio
quality compared to the one plus 3 but
it is more powerful than the s7 with a
slightly warmer sound signature as for
actual phone elements no complaints with
the call speaker but the vibration motor
is terrible
it is even weakened with the cover
installed so basically I cannot feel it
in my pants pocket while standing
although a pretty loud bottomed speaker
is there to compensate - charging is
awesome but how fast is it with the
larger battery I didn't test with the
screen on full brightness on airplane
mode
we went from 1% to 98% in one hour and
17 minutes but you know I realized this
scenario is kind of unrealistic so I
redid the test charging with the screen
off with Wi-Fi on and in 15 minutes we
juiced up pretty well and that is
awesome to see
the main camera can't you draw I love
that Snapseed app now supports raw
editing and exporting final images are
surprisingly fast but still I find the
auto white balance to be inaccurate as
for the front selfie cam toe they have
doubled the megapixel count from the one
plus three but I find more selfies on
the 3t to come out blurry plus the
shutter delay is definitely more
noticeable the front camera on the one
plus three is faster with better detail
and most of the time despite having only
half the megapixel count the software as
expected is very clean we have lots of
customization available although you
still cannot have five columns of icons
on your main screen which is such a
shame for such a large display however
they have improved some things like
swiping from the top to access settings
that don't need to expand fully unless
you do that extra slide but they've
removed the recently closed app drawer
at the bottom a function that I found
really helpful on the 1+3 also another
thing I've noticed the scroll speed on
the touchscreen I think is a little bit
too sensitive especially coming from the
s7 so for scrolling apps like Instagram
or Twitter I keep missing the post and
have to scroll back up you can't adjust
to it but the overall touch interface
just doesn't feel as good as on my s7
and so the biggest strengths on the 1 +
3 T over the 1 + 3 is having faster NAND
storage plus having that optional 128
gigabyte capacity bump the front selfie
improvement camera didn't need to happen
it is not worse but as an overall usage
experience from the software and just
like physical daily usage scenarios they
feel practically identical as a
percentage of the price increase you're
looking at 13% for the base model but
even still it remains competitive the 3t
my eyes is worth it due to that faster
land and the larger battery and so one
plus is clearly riding the wave with
offering more expensive devices while
maintaining their original position in
that value segment so well done and that
is it for the review of the one plus 3t
I love the device but my daily driver
still is the galaxy s7 because of a more
consistent primary camera and also just
a smaller size it's just a little bit
more comfortable as my daily driver
versus something a little bit larger
like the 1+3
