connects and not too long ago I posted
my review of the razor blade stealth
which is a thin and light 13-inch ultra
book and I really liked it I mean the
design and the way our razor just
upgraded a few things here and there was
absolutely great but the price for the
updated version that I had was just a
bit too expensive basically the base
model had a whiskey Lake i7 85 65 u8
thread CPU eight gigabytes of RAM and a
256 gigabyte SSD but the graphics model
which I had came with 16 gigabytes of
RAM and nvme SSD rather than a SATA base
drive and a discreet MX 150 GPU that
version is about $200 more expensive but
it got me wondering if the discreet
graphics card really made a huge
difference you see in videos MX 150 has
been rolled out to a few ultrabooks and
some entry-level notebooks and I think
that trend is supposed to accelerate
through 2019 but I want to throw in some
more tests to see if it was really worth
the extra cost over the lower battery
life that we used to get with Intel's
integrated solution so let's find out
right after this excuse me please
explain is easy to systems fully powered
by a single power supply just like me
and you two bodies powered by a single
mind
just imagine the good we can do the
revolt X by fantex a high performance
unit for multi CPU GPU
and dual system configurations with
80-plus platinum efficiency with
entirely silent fan mode a 12 year
warranty and clean cable management
explore the opportunities with the
revolt XPS you by fan thanks links below
all right so let's first get into what
the MX 150 really is because the name
doesn't really give any hints even
though that it has been out for quite a
while now as a matter of fact it seems
like nvidia went out there way to
rebrand and older architectures so it
looks something different
basically this GPU uses a slightly
evolved version of the GP 108 core from
Nvidia's GT 1030 GPU that means it uses
the Pascal architecture and has 384 cuda
cores 24 texture units and 16 ROPS
they've also been some modifications to
lower core voltage is improve power
consumption and level out clocks
consistency those are all key aspects
for ultrabac designs like the ways of
late stealth the big question mark is
clock speeds and memory those two specs
are determined by laptop manufacturers
and are largely based on their internal
cooling solutions for example the razor
is running the MX 150 at fifteen thirty
one megahertz
and has four gigabytes of gddr5 memory
which gives it a TDP of roughly 25 watts
others slim 13-inch notebooks with this
GPU runs at just a thousand 37 megahertz
and comes with just two gigabytes of
memory but they also have a TDP of just
10 watts
that means Razer is sacrificing some
battery life for increased performance
this also brings up a pretty interesting
point guys when a notebook says that it
comes with an MX 150 GPU you will need
to pay very close attention to whether
or not if you're getting the 2 gigabyte
10 watt version or the 4 gigabyte 25 one
model because the performance difference
will be very different another
interesting point about the MX 150 is
that it doesn't have invidious Envy ENC
hardware based video encoding engine
that means it can't be used to boost
performance tasks like video transcoding
you'll need to use a CPU for that it
does however have NB Dec decoding so
playback or video playback will be
accelerated by the GPU with all of that
taken into account let's get on to the
tests all these were run on the stealth
16 gigabyte model with the MX 150 either
completely disabled or enabled for
gaming I decided to pick a handful of
simple popular games that don't
necessarily take a ton of resources and
which people might likely be interested
in playing while they're away from their
main PC you can see that the MX 154
gigabyte delivers a huge amount of
additional performance against the
integrated graphics card which was
pretty much expected with it games that
are slight shows with Intel graphics
becomes perfectly playable and mind you
this is all at 1080p resolutions so if
you tweak around with settings here and
there I think the MX 150 would be
absolutely a perfect companion
especially if you're travelling and if
you just want to throw in something on
an ultrabook
now I also want to dig in a little
deeper into some other tasks you see a
Finan like 13-inch altered book with a
price tag like the stealth would
typically be expected to pull double
duty for content creators and
professionals
while they're away from their office
because they normally used a workstation
PC to get their job done but can DMX 150
really make a difference in terms of
rendering performance and other tasks
that would typically bring an ultrabook
with intel's integrated graphics
solution down to its needs let's start
with handbrake for video transcoding and
here the MX 150 couldn't even be used
because it lacks the N VNC encoder
however until squick sync hardware video
encoder does an amazing job and cutting
down times versus just using the CPU
there's also very little change in
Premiere Pro since this program also
uses the NBN C to accelerate rendering
times but I also have to mention that
Intel's QuickSync doesn't come in handy
here since it used to reduce rendering
times and I think the reason and I think
this might be you know it's just my
theory I think what's happening here is
that when Adobe recognizes that the
system has you know Intel CPU and
integrated GPU as well as a discrete
graphics card and when you enable quick
sync Adobe things that okay I'll just
offset some of the loads equally or
distribute it across the discreet
graphics card the integrated GPU and of
course a CPU but since the MX 150
doesn't have an Nvidia encoding engine
it just freaks out and I think that's
what I think and it just offsets all
that load to the CPU and the integrated
GPU just sort of kind of it doesn't get
utilized to its best and I think that's
why it takes significantly longer to
render you know 4k videos or whatnot so
I don't think the MX 150 is you know a
greater solution when it comes to just
play back or not play back but just
rendering performance in Adobe Premiere
now v-ray is a rendering program that
can be added to a huge number of
applications like Sketchup Maya cinema
4d and more in those cases it is usually
used to render high detail scenes which
means it takes a ton of system resources
here the MX 150 makes a huge difference
since CUDA can be processed through the
rendering quickly while the CPU is left
aside for other tasks blender is a bit
different with the 1/3 CPU and the MX
150 being pretty close in rendering
times so it doesn't look like Nvidia's
card gives an advantage here alright
guys so while I was running v-ray and
blender I did notice that the CPU was
only being utilized by like
five to ten percent in order to process
the final image and the reason for that
is basic pretty simple those programs
primarily use GPU to accelerate or
render the final output now that got me
thinking would it be possible to run
parallel rendering tasks that could use
voltage CPU and the GPU without actually
sacrificing on output time now I know
this might not sound like a big deal but
for professionals this could be a huge
time saver because think of it this way
for many design and architectural
projects you will obviously require
multiple renderings at different angles
now there's a revision made at some
point those renderings will obviously
have to be reprocessed and if you're
doing one at a time it just takes
forever but think of it this way if you
can pop out two at a time while
traveling or if you leave the CPU to do
other tasks that could be an awesome
reason to look into something like at
the MX 150 now in order to do this I
open up two instances of these programs
and a set one for CUDA and the other one
for CPU and the results are pretty darn
interesting
you see when processed individually the
CPU took about 12 minutes to complete
and the GPU took about 15 minutes
however when the MX 150 in the CPU are
running on two different renderings in
parallel both will be done in just over
15 minutes sure the CPU does take a
little bit longer but in this case
you'll be able to almost double your
output now v-ray uses a bit more
processor resources when the GPU is
rendering so when both are running at
the same time the CPU time increases by
quite a bit however you are still much
better off running two scenes together
on different pieces of hardware then
waiting around for 2cp renderings to
complete one after the other all right
guys so what about battery life now I
wanted to mention right away that while
I made sure that the MX 150 wasn't
working during the IGP tests it can't be
completely turned off so it isn't
drawing any power even when it isn't in
use it remains in hibernation which
still requires some battery flow so take
that into account dedicating the IGP to
graphics tasks obviously does extend
battery life and not having the MX 150
at all would probably result in even
longer times a GPU with a 25 watt TDP in
a slim and light notebook will obviously
have a pretty big impact on how long it
can remain unplugged so take that into
account before
jumping onto the MX 150 train so I guess
it's time to wrap things up you see at
the very beginning of this video I had a
very simple question is the MX 150
really worth it over
Intel's integrated graphics card and the
answer to that really depends on what
you're looking for in a 13 interested in
light ultrabook you see if you're
someone who things that you're going to
be using applications like v-ray or
blender if you're an architect or
designer that sees yourself taking
advantage of you know those extra cuda
cores to accelerate your rendering
output or if you're just thinking of
doing some light gaming here and there
and if you're looking for a pretty
compact notebook then the MX 150 is
actually worth it although keep in mind
keep in mind that you need to make sure
that what model you're getting because
there are a lot of notebooks out there
that come with the two gigabyte 10 watt
TDP GPUs and of course there's the 25
one 4 gigabyte model which is found on
the razor blade stealth so that's
definitely something to consider but in
my case I really can't use something
like the razor blade style because for
video rendering or for content creators
or video editors the MX 150 is of no use
because it doesn't have the in encoding
engine and it just wouldn't really make
any sense because it's your rendering
time so it almost quadruple so that's
where I would look into something with
that's a little bit more powerful like
GTX 10 series card or even the latest
r-tx GPUs although they're they're very
expensive so yeah and guys remember
parallel rendering is just not for
notebooks featuring MX 150 graphics
cards because you can apply the same
concept to your desktop workstation PC
or even your a laptop that has capable
hardware because if you can utilize
every single piece of the hardware to
accelerate your particular rendering
task then it's a win-win also don't
forget if you're just looking for
something that can do casual tasks like
browsing the web watching you know
content or something like that just
normal stuff they're better off going
with the laptop that doesn't happy and
x1 to GPU because yeah first and
foremost you're gonna get longer battery
life and it's gonna cost you a lot less
so that's it for me thank you very much
for watching let me know what you guys
think about you know in videos MX 130
GPU and what do you think of it slowly
trying to enter into the Ultrabook
market because I see that or at least I
think it's dot it's going to become the
Train
for 2019 so I want to know your thoughts
about that and of course what do you
think of the performance and of course
things on parallel rendering the idea of
that I mean both hybrid connects thank
