hello everyone this is Dimitri with
Haruka Knox and Sennheiser's game line
has just expanded with a few new
headsets covering both open and closed
style designs the game Xero is a closed
style headset keeping the sound in
without any leak and most importantly
providing an incredible amount of
isolation during your gaming sessions it
has a few very appealing features that
we haven't yet seen on the gaming
oriented headset and also the premium of
$280 this is not in your casual gamers
bracket but as this is targeted for the
pros let's find out if it's worth it we
also have the game one in-house so leave
a like if you want to see comparison
video but one thing that really threw me
off was how thin the game 0 box was
inside we find a pretty stellar case
that houses the headset with a pocket to
contain all the cable and this is one
aspect of the 0 that I find really
awesome the fact that these are
collapsible in such a thin profile
there's also a carrying handle on the
case and I just love the ability to
protect your investment during transport
the games 0 is a white on black design
that doesn't really feel like San Heiser
in my opinion I know they're trying to
stand out within the gaming realm but
the glossy white is really not my style
especially since there are three color
variations of the white on the earcup so
perhaps if it was all uniform it might
have looked better
the metallic red accents give the game 0
and more of a game or look again a big
question mark in terms of design
although that just my personal
preference the large boom mic is
somewhat of a staple for science or game
series there's definitely no going
around that and while it is flexible
although I do have to position quite far
from my face so it doesn't pick up all
day all knowing all the air coming from
your mouth it is also noise cancelling I
currently have a video playing at normal
volume in the background also you can
still hear it pretty clearly when I stop
speaking I also really would have loved
a removable or retractable option for
this large microphone it is muted
however when in the upright position
with a satisfying click there's a very
convenient volume knob on the right
earcup perfectly within reach although
it feels quite loose and I was not
expecting that for the asking price the
overall build quality is pretty great
with solid plastic headband and metal
joints there are also small pads between
the ear cups and the support frame to
avoid plastic on plastic grind the game
0 is also adequately flexible and size
adjustable and like I mentioned earlier
foldable either for the carrying case or
just to throw in your bag the ear cups
are oversized for this to be an over ear
headset with extremely comfortable and
soft leather padding this definitely has
to be one of the most comfortable closed
headsets that I've ever tried the deep
ear cushions encompass your entire ear
and the drivers are angled so you never
make contact with the internals and I
can appreciate the red lining also to
fit with the color scheme the cable is
unfortunately non removable and it is
long at 3 meters so most of it is always
going to be bundled up with velcro it
connects through standard three and a
half millimeter mic and headphone jacks
that are color-coded and putting the
headset on the large ear cups and
appropriate clamping force is going to
be an absolute pleasure for hours and
hours of gaming and the leather does
concentrate the heat a little bit so
occasional venting is definitely needed
they are slightly on the heavy side that
312 grams but the way these hug your
head wood supporting headband and the
weight was absolutely not an issue the
game zero is a hundred fifty ohms
impedance headphone so the resistance on
the current is quite high for a gaming
style headset and I would strongly
recommend using a sound card with these
I ran them through my Asus DX sound card
and was totally blown away at how well
these isolated even at low volume I
don't have to say that the sound is a
tap on the hollow side so I would not
use these as my main music driver but it
is gaming oriented and I understand why
it is this way being a closed style
headset most of which suffer from tiny
soundstage Sohn Heiser has tweaked the
frequency response to sound more open
resulting in a more reserved and distant
mid-range this means quite a bit of
detail is lost as a treble
tension is quite boring there's no pop
there's no energy for music and I do
prefer the brighter and the more flat
response of my HT 5 5 8 and the K 7 12
pros the female vocals in here job did
not really stand out and I strangely
couldn't place her within the space
where with the HD 5 5 eighths I could
feel her presence close to the
microphone the zero suffers with the
same distant vocals and no church in the
wild thus creating a larger soundstage
that in game is absolutely important for
immersion that it turns out comes out a
compromise for its ability Drive music
properly the bass extension with zero is
very well controlled and non-invasive
within the mid range for example
Dragonborn from skyrim soundtrack was
very powerful however left me wanting
more of a rumble and low-frequency bass
and young and your fault now this being
a dedicated gaming headset it does sure
sound like one so I fired up battlefield
4 Crysis 3 and Assassin's Creed 4 Black
Flag and immediately understood why
these have been tuned with the distant
mid-range the 0 have an impressively
large soundstage for a closed style
stereo headset the incredibly large
audio environment in battlefield 4
translated really well in detecting
distant gunshots hearing the chatter
from the enemy requesting ammo and math
packs giving you a good sense of
distance between you and your targets
and jumping into Assassin's Creed 4 I
noticed that music playback was very
much muted compared to the HD 5 5 8 as
the mid-range is recessed with the zero
however other audio elements within the
game like birds singing stood out quite
well so while you do gain a sense of a
larger audio environment detail within
the mid-range is lost and the zero are
particularly conservative with soft
treble bass response is excellent for
music playback and even better for
gaming as it is quite powerful and
absolutely amazing in Crysis 3 it's well
controlled clean and totally transforms
you into the key
and to conclude I think the best part
about the game zero especially being
gaming oriented is the comfort with
large over the ear cups with soft
leather cushions combined with just the
right amount of clamping force and the
weight make this one of the most
comfortable headsets that I've tried and
tested in a long time the collapse oil
feature is also very appealing plus the
included case is a nice addition sound
quality wise I'm very impressed with the
roomy soundstage for a closed aisle
headphone and with a little of EQ
tweaking you can get some pretty decent
mid-range and treble results however the
way these drivers are tuned with the
recessed mid-range and the lack of
trouble actually takes away from a
proper gaming experience as the zero
tends to sound hollow with much less
detail compared to the HT five five
eight or the game one for example I'm
not a big fan of the color scheme
although this is more personal complaint
and this with every game series had said
the bulky boom microphone is non
removable and while the sounds
acceptable for gaming noise cancellation
is quite poor and also close to $300 I'm
actually a little bit disappointed with
the way these drivers are tuned but you
can certainly extract like I said
additional detail through the equalizer
with more detailed mid-range and the
brighter high-end and taking all of that
in how do you feel about the game zero
we do have the game one in-house so
