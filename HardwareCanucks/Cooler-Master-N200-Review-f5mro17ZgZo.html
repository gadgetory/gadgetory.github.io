harmonics review we are noticing a trend
with many keys manufacturers and that is
the direction to deliver more affordable
cases while still providing decent
features for various configurations so
we're checking out the cooler master and
200 a micro ATX case that will set you
back about $50 and considering some
constant sales going online you'll most
likely stumble upon a deal you can't
refuse now it's not the most of
attractive cases but the front mesh with
piano gloss on the sides is actually
quite nice
keeping through this minimalistic look
we do have a single v in the quarter and
a 3.5 inch drive bay and unfortunately
installing an optical drive won't keep
the front looking uniform moving on to
the connections nothing unusual here
just your power reset buttons audio
jacks and three USB ports only one of
which is USB 3 still would be nice to
have more there's no removable dust
filter unfortunately but cleaning the
mesh regularly will keep the dust away
removing the front panel we find dual
intake options for 120 millimeter fans
which can be installed on either side of
the frame now you see this has potential
for a push-pull water cooling setup but
on that and bit later at the bottom we
find decent rubberized case feet along
with the dust filter for your path of
life now given this is a micro ATX case
only four PCI slots are available at the
back obviously with the bottom mount
power supply every our exhaust fan is
included with smaller mounting options
available now our additional airflow can
either be delivered from the side panel
or from the top both of which can be
utilized for improved cooling the table
salt has a removable dust filter
attached with these rubber nails of
course it will be a pain to clean if the
fan is installed but you can always
position the dust filter above the frame
now the case internals are very well
designed for storage and also water
cooling you can mount up to fours as
these with everything in place one below
the 3.5 inch tube a and
on top the hard drive cage very simple
to install and swap out now two more
SSDs can be mounted at the back wall
using rubber grommets and cutouts are
placed appropriately for all your
connections now the 3.5 inch drive just
slide inside the cage and are mounted
with screws and I really would have
liked to see a dualist approach on the
hard drive cage which would really
simplify your entire assembly and of
course for water cooling lovers this
micro ATX case just might be it removing
the hard drive cage and the top 3.5 inch
bay clears up room for a dual radiator
to be installed and also being able to
install fans outside of the frame I push
a pull configuration is possible but you
can also mount the hard drive cage a
little further back leaving 2.5 inches
of internal clearance for your radiator
now given this is a small case not much
room is given in the back almost none
actually so the cable tie notches will
definitely come in handy also notice the
8 pin CPU cutout is missing meaning you
have to route your cable underneath the
motherboard just keep that in mind
during assembly now the internal design
is the way it is to avoid compromises
you can still have plenty of storage
while installing larger GPUs so anything
up to 14.5 inches is no problem also the
front intake installed you get there for
free graphics card and for the
motherboard area as well now the top fan
may cause some clearance issues
particularly if you have a wide CPU
heatsink something to keep in mind if
you are ambitious on making an
enthusiast gaming rig out of the end 200
so in summary the N 200 is an impressive
case in almost all the aspects with
decent airflow internal spacing and
storage options water cooling support
and of course a very affordable price
tag now on the downside mounted optical
drive will disturb the uniformity of the
front panel and of course liquid dust
filter on the main intake is a bummer
but all in all ku master has delivered
an excellent budget oriented case with
excellent features and damn good value
so thanks guys for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
