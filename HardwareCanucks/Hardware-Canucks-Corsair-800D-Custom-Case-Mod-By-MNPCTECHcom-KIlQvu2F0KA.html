showcase this time around bill owen from
m and pc tech com a company that
specializes in professional case modding
has designed and built a completely
unique hardware canucks case mod based
on the corsair obsidian 800d chassis
mmpc text work takes modding to a whole
new level past the simple side window
cutouts and spray bombs black interiors
the most noticeable change is obviously
this vibrant red paint job they view
specialized house of kolor candy apple
red which has a bit of a metallic flake
to really make the color absolutely pop
all paints are top quality automotive
brands so not only is it stunningly
beautiful but incredibly durable so
let's get into it and take a look at
some more of these awesome changes now
with a heavy dosage of red there has
been a little bit of the original black
artistically left in areas such as the
hot swap drive base and up at the top
for the front panel connections now up
in the top panel we have this really
cool adaptation notice anything
different that's right the original
spacing for 320 millimeter fans has been
removed and in its place is M&amp;amp;P ctx
triple 140 millimeter aluminum rad grill
now this has been customized with the
official hardware canucks fan grill and
check this out sort of a fun feature
we're able to rotate the center grills
however we want now he's also included
perfectly sized socket screws to fit
through the fan grill fans and right
into the radiator without any damage
custom cut from one eighth inch aluminum
it's the hardware canucks window frame
you'll also know something but different
about the window itself while the stock
800d has a curved window this has been
squared off to open up the interior and
fit the outline and of course displaying
the hardware connects logo also again
using socket screws to hold it all
together jumping to the back we again
see that no part of this design or mod
has been left out and an excellent time
to show off the one-of-a-kind customized
harbor canucks fan grill made from three
sixteenth inch aluminum and available
for 100
20 millimeter and hundred and forty
millimeter fans as we have here there's
also an anodized black version if silver
doesn't fit your color scheme these are
super cool and you can find them over at
triple WR birkin XCOM in our store
another quick tidbit as you'll notice
the conspicuous fan logos have been
covered up with this carbon fiber styled
sticker it may not seem like a big deal
but it's paying attention to these small
things that can really set your case mod
apart so now we get to take a look
inside which has not had all been
ignored the feet underneath the case
have received a solid coating of paint
along with the bottom and divider we
have our black PCI slots water tubing
holes and a new fan at the front the one
hundred forty millimeter Hardware
canucks fan grill with again a new fan
and so we head to the top to get a good
look at the custom rad setup now in
order to fit this enormous 420 or triple
140 ml radiator a few altercations were
made the unused drive bay behind the
front ports was adapted to make room for
its extra length this allows for the
entire thing including all of the fans
above to be mounted internally case
modding isn't always just about the
looks it's often about making practical
changes to the case design in order to
get the most out of your computer but
hey there's no reason not to spice up
the aesthetics while you're at it not a
single detail has been overlooked with
this beauty the quality remains as
impressive inside as it does on the
exterior and even the places where
nobody is going to bother to look are
absolutely impeccable the finishing
touch comes when we get a chance to
power the system up and see all of the
new white LED hundred forty millimeter
fans from Xigmatek this thing is going
to be a lot of fun thanks again to bill
owen from mmpc tech for pulling off such
a stunning design that we feel really
captures what harbor canucks is all
about the quality and attention to
detail on this mod is outstanding in
fact it's damn good we're going to be
doing a full system assembly were
clogged with kick-ass water cooling
setup inside this rig so click the
annotation link to check that out now to
