review so many large products like cases
but it's not about the size of your
space it's about your attitude and many
people who have come to check out the
space they were like this is it and I
see that as a compliment because being
able to establish the variety in
compositions and shot diversity so that
it doesn't all look the same means that
I'm doing something right and I see it
as a challenge the challenge of
utilizing every meter of your space so
that nothing goes to waste
and so I used my desk my floor and my
carpet and my empty wall and my super
busy wall and my mouse mat too and even
my packaging foam right there my storage
shelf is used for shots and also this
shelf is used for shots too you can use
your mirrors for a little extra variety
and you can even use your monitor for
extra background color you can use your
window for the silhouette work and
obviously your body for whatever
potential product that might fit within
your seat
creativity is fueled by the best
instruments it doesn't always come easy
and in the process you often realize how
important quality is the Rd 400 bio CC
gives you quality and speed with M de tu
interface the Shiban and flash and a pci
bracket making it possible to focus on
what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty also fred loves to be on camera
because he adds a splash of color to
your scene and he's easy to hide in my
composition so he's not like right in
your face but if you're looking for him
you're most likely hard to find him I
also use my living room sometimes for
shots
clean it up make sure that the couch is
clean use a tighter lens yeah and while
I do have this dedicated space with a
white wall in the white table for that
clean product photography and video it's
awesome to be able to mix in the floor
color the carpet texture the the
sunlight on it this metallic shelf you
know just play around with it and see
what you can come up with smaller space
also means it's easier to light so I
used to have two giant soft boxes that
really closed off the space and they
always fired into the top to create this
really nice ambient spill for the rest
of the room but with a single light this
whole room becomes a giant softbox
because of the white ceilings and the
white walls which means no giant softbox
needed for the light itself meaning I
can breathe in my room but what if I
require this particular look that a
softbox delivers well this is where this
reflector five and one comes in see I
can reflect my sunlight which is nice
and simple but I can also block it with
this black cover I have a gold piece
that I can reflect for a little extra
warmth I have a white piece or for the
white reflection but now I'm starting to
use this thing more and more it's a
giant diffusion to create that really
large nice catch light in my eye without
actually having this giant softbox on
the light because this is a lot thinner
and a lot easier to
in my smaller space which is why I'm
starting to use this a lot more often as
you can see the actual diffuser is a bit
bigger than my shooting table and
imagine having a softbox of this size in
my space would just not be possible so I
use the diffuser attach it to a clamp on
another light stand to create this very
nice large diffused light that creates a
really good cache light in my eyes and
so this has been my most recent lighting
setup one light firing in diffusion and
while you can see it does require a
little bit more room the actual storage
of this stuff and like setting it up is
super simple and then on this side we
had that nice diffusion so if I'm right
in front of it I get full fill as you
can see my eyes are quite that that
giant light in there and by rotating I
couldn't create that nice soft shadow
roll off and then because right now we
have a lot of sunlight coming in I can
close the windows or wait for the Sun to
go down to completely control my
lighting situation so the white balance
and there's no like light mixing and the
only softbox that I currently own is
this light dome mini the thing is super
tiny which is why I bought it from my
space because I thought that it would be
perfect but the actual light diffusion
is not soft at all it's quite harsh
which is why I use this much cheaper
solution which gives me a much better
result now my lighting stands are full
plastic but I'm working with what I've
got so far
so my light right now is sitting on this
plastic pole I'm a bit worried and I'm
very careful with it
the diffusion is fine to be held up by
this thing but as you can see there's
that big black line through diffusion
which actually creates a cool effect in
the catch light which is why I'm using
the microphone stand now to hold the
diffusion if I don't need this black
line in the middle so I use this mic
stand normally for the microphone when
I'm doing things in front of the camera
but it's got this loopy thing BAM
diffusion now without the black line on
either side and this is what I look like
when illuminated just by diffusion from
the sunlight from the window that light
is currently off
and yeah very nice and soft nice big
catch light in my eye too and so that's
how I like my space one light one
diffuser and currently using as much
natural light as possible the diffuser
is blocking some of that sunlight coming
in that you can see is very hard from
the wall but yeah the next issue that we
stumble upon in such space is audio now
despite this room being somewhat filled
you know that whole wall is here that
whole space is filled up I have a carpet
there's still a lot of echo so one
solution obviously is a shotgun
microphone that has some noise
cancellation properties and now I've
started to place these packaging foam
materials in each corner of my space and
I'm not sure if they're doing anything
but I think I can hear less echo and
they're just in the four corners I mean
the foam is quite small and there no
it's nothing on the acoustic foam it's
just packaging foam but I'm hoping that
it's actually doing something and I've
also realized that if I open my window
it becomes less actually because there's
a bit more ambient noise and that helps
to drown out some of the echo just a
little tip that I use because a lot of
complaints have passed saying that
there's a lot of echo in the audio and
please if you have any suggestions on
how to treat this space without covering
the whole walls with acoustic foam
please let me know in the comments
because audio is very important and I
think that's one of the areas that my
videos have been quite lacking recently
well look at that I've never actually
utilized this angle before I like it
so now let me tease a few upcoming
projects the one plus 5t has been my
daily driver I love taking pictures with
this thing especially in portrait mode
the actual bokeh roll off like the
out-of-focus elements is fantastic so
I've got the sandstone white edition and
I'll be comparing it versus an actual
camera for portraits stay tuned for that
video
oh yeah also a few packages have just
arrived that I'm super excited to share
with you guys that are sure to keep them
busy for the next few weeks let me show
you so on the cases front the NZXT th400
the micro ATX version I'm waiting for
some hardware for this micro DX test
because I don't have much
micro-atx hardware so stay tuned for
that and this guy just arrived today the
Corsair 500d the new obsidian and which
one would you like to see first let me
know in the comments we also get a ton
of requests to review budget peripherals
so here are something that I'm hoping
will satisfy that exact request I'm
really bad at unboxings alright so what
I have in front of me are mice gaming
mice in particular that I found on
Amazon that you guys can buy and they're
all in between 10 to $15 this one
doesn't even have any graphics on the
packaging I like it
stay tuned for that video once I
actually do some full testing on each of
these so I have one two three four five
six seven eight
I'm supposed to have nine oh well but
probably one of the more exciting
products for me would be in this box
it's from some hyzer oh you guys know
how much I love my audio products oh wow
look at this looks kind of funny to him
isn't it
alright good people so hope you found
this video helpful let me know which of
these products you want to see on the
channel first we always listen and we
always try to deliver I'm Dimitri thanks
so much for watching we'll see you in
