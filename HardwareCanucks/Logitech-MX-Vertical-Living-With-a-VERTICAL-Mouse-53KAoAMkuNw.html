that prioritizes on economics rather
than offering a bunch of features now
this isn't the world's first vertical
Mouse in fact if you do a quick Amazon
search you've actually come across some
interesting options that constant nearly
a fifth of the price of the MX vertical
so yeah this thing costs $100 which is
expensive but it also kind of competes
or I guess it's priced similarly to the
MX master 2's from Logitech a very
popular Mouse among content creators and
designers so I've been using the MX
vertical for the past two weeks and I've
gotta admit it has been an interesting
experience getting used to a curvy shape
something that looks out of the worlds
when you compare it to a traditional
Mouse so let's talk about the MX
vertical get into the details talk about
some of the quirks and of course I will
put it up against the master 2's because
I do use that on a regular basis as well
right after a message from our sponsor
the new master keys MK 750 keyboard
comes with a comfortable magnetic wrist
rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection Coolermaster
doing it right check it out below all
right so before I get into this review I
have to admit that this is my first time
using a vertical mouse so consider this
review to be a first time users
perspective switching from a traditional
mouse is something a little bit more
ergonomic or that's what they claim to
be so we'll get into that a little bit
later on in the video
let's getting soft with the design and
this is certainly a unique looking Mouse
there are a lot of curves going around
the body to come to be accommodate your
hand and what's really fascinating is
that Logitech has still managed to
maintain that same design language as
the MX master 2's it's simple and
minimalistic and it also acts as a good
prop for b-roll now do note that it's
only available in this graphite variant
so we could expect different color
options added in the future but let's
switch gears and talk about this form
factor the Palmer's area is angled at 57
degrees which according to launch tech
is the ideal posture for your hand that
reduces the pressure on your wrists so
check this out here's a shot of me
trying out the MX master 2s and it looks
pretty normal
my palms are rested horizontally with
appropriate thumb support and I can
comfortably glide around here's a g43
gaming mouse and I'm more
comfortable using a call style and I'm
used to it now here's the MX vertical
and right off the bat you can tell that
it's a a tall Mouse and B my hand is a
bit elevated off the surface
specifically my thumb and it's at a very
comfortable position it almost feels
like holding a joystick and the one
thing that I did notice is that I didn't
actually have to put any pressure
towards my wrists when holding the MX
vertical which is something that I just
started to realize after switching
between the MX master 2s because when
you have your wrist placed at a
horizontal angle you are twisting your
wrist a little bit whereas with the MX
vertical it's a it's a it's a
comfortable hand gesture kind of
orientation so you're not really
applying any pressure to your wrist
which ultimately actually ends up with
reduced strain over long-term use and
that's something that I did notice when
using MX vertical so from an ergonomic
perspective I really appreciate what
Logitech has done here with the MX
vertical and if you're someone who
spends a dangerous amount of time
sitting in front of the computer screen
then it probably would look taking a
look at something like this because a it
reduces the stress that you add on to
your wrists and again it's super organic
very comfortable certainly get some time
getting used to from your traditional
mouse so that's something to keep note
of unfortunately the MX vertical is only
geared towards bright hand users so
lefties I really feel sorry for you the
thumb rest features these textured
rubberized surface to assure a solid
grip which is a nice touch but I will
mention that if you have small hands you
might find the MX vertical to be a
little bit too big for your taste so I
would highly recommend you trying it
this out at a retail store to see if
you're comfortable with it and then pull
the trigger when we have to build
quality and to be honest I'm not that
impressed for a mouse that costs $100
especially when compared to the MX
master 2s the vertical just feels a tad
bit cheaper now don't get the looks of
the vertical deceive you when it comes
to the build quality and how much it
weighs because it's actually 10 grams
lighter than the master 2s and I think
part of that has to do with the
materials used to construct the body and
the bottom surface of this mouse now
that being said the MX vertical is put
together really well and there are no
signs of creaking which is amazing but
when you're coming from something like
the MX master 2's you're definitely
going to feel the quality when it comes
to you know the build by itself so
that's again something to keep in mind
the primary left and right buttons
feature good tactile feedback and
they're just a perfect size for your
index finger and middle finger I didn't
have any issues with my ring finger
getting in the way for my secondary
button so that's awesome the scroll
wheel is well-defined but unfortunately
it doesn't feature logitech's signature
hyper scrolling so if you want to scroll
through long documents faster and if you
are used to the hyper scrolling on the
master 2's you're definitely gonna miss
it on the MX vertical and I think from
an engineering perspective it actually
makes sense because the scroll wheel is
actually angled and so there are a lot
of gravitational forces kind of taking
place when you start scrolling if you
enable hyper scrolling on a mouse
especially in a scroll wheel that's
oriented this way then it's not going to
be as consistent when compared to a
scroll wheel that's kind of you know
sitting in a horizontal position so
again laws of physics the forward and
backward buttons felt a little bit
cheaper to me it felt like using buttons
from a thirty to fifty dollar Mouse and
it lacks refinement when compared to the
master 2s which is kind of unfortunate
the cursor speed button is used to cycle
between two different pointer speeds and
what's really cool is if you hold down
this button and move the mouse towards
the right it'll increase the DPI
sensitivity in real time and since it
increments of 50 and the button by
itself is fairly easier to reach I'm
also really surprised at launch tech
didn't really implement a side scroll
wheel on the MX vertical because there's
so much room wasted here because you
know your thumb is basically sitting
here doing nothing so it would've been
amazing to have you know the verticals
or the horizontal scroll wheel just like
the MX master 2's but also the gesture
button which was implemented on the
thumb rest that's also missing on the MX
vertical so again from a future
perspective you are kind of missing a
lot of the button mechanics or I guess
features the buttons on the MX vertical
compare the master 2's there are three
ways to connect the MX vertical to your
computer one of them is by pairing via
bluetooth up to three devices or you can
use the unifying USB receiver or you can
even use it in Wired mode with these
included USB type-c cable
speaking of which is refreshing to see
on a mouse so let's hope gaming brands
follow this along very soon now battery
life on the MX vertical has been great
so far
I haven't killed it yet because I've
only been using it for a couple of weeks
and Logitech claims that it can stay
powered up to four months on a full
charge which is amazing and I do believe
them because I've been using the MX
2's for about a year and over the course
of that period I have charged it maybe
three or four times and it has held up
really well I've taken it women with me
to trips like CES and Computex and you
know I haven't had an issue with battery
life with this mouse so far so when it
comes to the MX vertical expect great
battery life movie on to the sensor
performance and the MX particle comes
with a four thousand dpi laser sensor
for the most part tracking felt very
similar to the MX master 2s but it does
not come with the dark field technology
so tracking on surfaces like glass is
totally out of question I use a cloth
mouse pad for testing mice in general
but I did test DMX vertical on a white
surface and tracking seems to be just
fine remember both the master 2's and
the vertical feature laser sensors and
they're really not optimized for tasks
like gaming so there is a little bit of
acceleration and lift off distance
tracking as well plus it's not as fast
when it comes to responding to your
movements and you know what I expected
that for a mouse of this caliber
remember this is not targeted towards
gamers but rather someone who spends a
majority of their time being productive
like designers are content creators the
last thing I want to cover here is a
software experience just like typical
Logitech fashion it's a much simpler UI
with basic controls and I like what
they've done here you're beat it with a
physical overview of the mouse where the
user can assign commands to any of the
four buttons the point and scroll tab
lets you adjust the sensitivity and a
few more dpi settings the lack of a
visual indicator for dpi levels is a bit
disappointing but I think for an average
consumer it's really not a deal-breaker
I should mention that this mouse does
support Logitech flow just like the
master 2's and for starters it's a cool
feature that lets you seamlessly switch
the cursor between different computers
as long as you're connected to the same
Wi-Fi network treat your ears with the
incredibly comfortable
HD 5/8 X Jubilee headphones from mass
drop and some Heiser delivering sound
expected from $500 headphones but only
for a hundred fifty bucks making it one
of the best price to performance scans
available check out and join the drop
down below so that's the MX vertical
from Logitech now would I spend $100 for
a mouse of this caliber probably not
especially if you're someone who's just
debating on switching between horizontal
to vertical and if you're coming from a
really basic Mouse because it is an
expensive investment and you may not end
up liking it because you know maybe you
have small hands or maybe you're looking
for
a lot more a lot of the buttons
specifically because you know the MX
master 2's come with a horizontal
vertical scroll wheel
whereas this doesn't and I really wish
they could have included something like
that within the thumb rest because
there's just a lot of space wasted in my
opinion if you were to ask me so they
certainly have a lot of improvements to
make whoopee master with the MX vertical
and I hope they do with the next
revision so I'm really looking forward
to that but if you really like to try
out something and if you are you know
say someone if you are used to vertical
Mouse then this is something that's
worth looking at because I love the
design it's really nice it's lighter so
it's super comfortable as well so yeah
that's pretty much it I want to hear
your thoughts on the MX vertical what do
you guys think about it
are you considering or would you
actually consider switching from
something like you know the MX master 2
s or a traditional basic Mouse
to something like this given its
elevated design and the fact that it
doesn't really add that much stress to
your wrist are you actually willing to
try it out for yourselves
