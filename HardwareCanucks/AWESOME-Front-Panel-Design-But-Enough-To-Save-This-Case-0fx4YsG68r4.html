hard-working ox both of you this time
we're looking at a mid tower from Lang
cool this is the BC canine so that was
seven years ago our last land cool case
review and now we've got another alright
so lamb cool used to be lien Leaside
brand for lower tier cases but still
made out of aluminum and with good
quality construction but lamb cool as a
brand has kind of dissolved into Liam
Lee as a series now and that's where we
have the revival of the Lanco brand this
is the land cool one so they are trying
to address airflow built illumination
elegant aesthetics and ease of use so
let's see how they did shall we
right after this the new fatality h3 70
performance motherboard is well-equipped
for agent processors with 10 power phase
design dual ultra Enda two slots for
storage and fantastic audio interface
and dual RGB headers for addressable and
twelve volt lighting accessories check
out the full asrock 300 series lineup
down below alright so the land cool one
has got me excited because this is
supposed to be their budget series and
liam lee is already in this really
competitive price point category at $130
for the bc 11 air and the dynamic make
sure to check out reviews for those over
here but the land cool one comes in two
variants the standard one at $89 and the
lancome one digital at $99 it has the
type c connection for the front io and
also that beautiful RGB illumination for
the front panel now design wise I think
they've gone into the right direction
and it's funny because the front panel
is what kind of differentiates this case
for many other mid towers because
internally it's basically the same thing
as we've seen from any other mid towers
but on the exterior it has this like
elegant appeal without being too flashy
for the digital model because of that
interior center illumination we also
have the brushed aluminum which looks
awesome and those chrome edges which
look fantastic at certain off angles but
it also gives us the perception of good
airflow because of that
Center cut out so you can see the fans
underneath you can see the dust filter
you know the panel is still spaced out
from the frame which is nice but the
whole idea is like being able to see how
the air would enter inside your case and
therefore gives you like alright so that
thing looks elegant without completely
choking the fans the top panel continues
with that symmetrical design it is a
simple mesh there is no built-in dust
filter but that's fine because most
likely used for exhaust anyway so here
we have mounts for three 120mm fans or
dual 140mm fans with their respective
radiators
but I wouldn't install a radiator up
here because there is just not much
height available from the top
motherboard to the top fan mount so
it'll be fine with a set of fans up
there for exhausting air but as soon as
you mount radiator there then you might
encounter compatibility issues and just
like clearance issues towards that 8 pin
and anything above the motherboard
because the case is not really high
enough to support like you know
comfortably support a radiator up top
now the i/o for my digital edition of
the case includes dual USB 3 ports a
power button and LED switch so you can
cycle between different colors and modes
and we also have the type C connection
up top
now this front LED is an addressable RGB
LED so you can plug it into your 5 volt
addressable connector on the motherboard
as long as you have the appropriate
cable extension with the motherboard so
this is good news if you want to color
match case lighting with other hardware
I do like the tempered glass side panel
and how it's mounted with two thumb
screws at the back so the entire side
looks absolutely clean however for the
rear side panel we have two unusual
thumb screws at the top but it's awesome
because the side panel kind of like sits
at the bottom and then you compress all
the cables so even if you have a giant
mess that's sticking out you'll still be
able to close the panel without too much
hazard now in order to get the front fan
mounts you have to first remove the RGB
cable for the front panel it's a little
bit inconvenient but whatever there we
have also dust filter and mounts for
three 120 fans or dual 140 s with their
respective radiator sizes now the
interior has no surprises at all we've
seen this layout over and over again a
basic power supply shroud with the law
section at the front that you can remove
so you can fully insert the three
tierod at the bottom and a bottom drive
cage can be moved or removed to
accommodate that setup now the thing is
you have to remove that entire drive
cage in order to install your drives
because there are no drive caddies which
is weird for $100 case the motherboard
stand-ups are pre-installed and we have
a ATX motherboard support up to 280
millimeters the rubber grommets are in
good location but they're so soft and
just passing a single cable and they
fall out it's a minor thing but for a
hundred dollar case I was not expecting
that and it's also super frustrating
working with something when the rubber
grommets are not cooperating and they're
constantly falling out or their spot and
actually there are many elements
throughout my experience that kind of
made me realize that this is their
budget series for example there are no
thumb screws on the PCI slots we have a
plastic cover on the vertical slots and
also the front panel while they've put a
lot of work into it for airflow and
design aspect
it just feels cheap it's just very bulky
plastic piece that you have to hammer
inside the frame that so it can enter
and maybe because of that one of the
aluminum pieces already is kind of
coming off because the plastic itself
bends but the aluminum doesn't and so it
just doesn't feel that great now a few
more subpar elements include really thin
metal on the top fan mount it just bends
way too easily and also molex power for
the LED connection why move on to SATA
please and then coming behind the
motherboard tray it's nice that we have
two additional SSD caddies but again no
thumb screws so you have to use a screw
driver at least we have separate mounts
for them if you don't want them to be
exactly behind a motherboard but it's
like the offset closer to the front and
here we also get that led hub for the
LED button that cycles between the
colors so you need to have that
connected and powered in order to have
that full illumination control now the
one unique element about the interior is
the top of the power supply shroud
because we have these two plastic pieces
that are basically SSD mount so you can
put them there and they're a nicely cut
out for the SATA cables to pass through
which is awesome so cable management
will be pretty easy but also if you're
not used
four SS the amounts you can remove them
and install fans
I'm guessing facing up for additional
intake and additional airflow for the
GPU which is awesome also the case comes
with dual 120mm fans with 1000 RPM spec
and finally there is a power supply dust
filter at the bottom easily removal from
the back and my system assembly went
pretty smooth I wasn't expecting any
hiccups you know the interior is pretty
spacious accommodates my 360 rad in the
front no problem and I've really kidded
one of those included stock fans up top
so I have to exhausting and you can see
just how little room there is height
wise at the top so mounting radiator up
there will most likely not be
comfortable and also I noticed from my
motherboard setup and where the front
are your connection is those cables will
interfere with these SATA cables for the
SSD if it was mounted on that spot so
just something to keep in mind now for
temperature testing the front panel is
not a restriction you know there's
plenty of airflow from the center and on
the sides too but the dust filter just
like we saw with the O 11 air is a
performance hit it's not significant
it's only three degrees from my tests
and I've ran this thing for 40 minutes
because I warned that liquid inside the
AO to heat up and in the back totally
fine the cable management here I do like
that we have velcro straps so you can
use them up and you can also use that
front section that's like invitation to
hide all your cables or anything beside
your power supply - and so after
spending two days with the Lanco one
digital it's an okay case but in a
general scheme of things it's not
exactly competitive feature wise or
price wise it may be competitive price
wise with in Lian Li because they don't
really produce anything below 100 parts
that's where the Lanco series comes in
but when you look at the market overall
it's kind of difficult for this thing to
stand out I feel like what needs to
happen for the land called branding is
for it to trickle down after the $69
territory for it to be competitive on
the mass scale because right now the $99
price point is quite tough to compete
and we have the H 500 I from NZXT which
is a fantastic enclosure check out our
review we have the $69 P 350 X which
basically has all the same features as
does in terms of the internal layout but
it is $30 cheaper now granted this thing
looks elegant and it has that different
aesthetic to everything else so that is
its competitive advantage right now
alongside you know without restricting
air flow but I would love to hear what
you guys think about the land cold one
introduction into the current market
space and would you buy one for $89 or
$99 for the type-c plus the digital RGB
and the front why or why not the new
mark to coarser strafe and k70 keyboards
are fully loaded with custom
illumination convenient media buttons
USB pass-through extra set of key camps
and ergonomic rest rest for each
keyboard so you can type or game
comfortably but a variety of MX which is
available so you can check out which
keyboard suits you best in description
below now it is exciting to have another
player in the space and how will others
react to this introduction hopefully
with better features at lower price
points alright guys I hope you guys
