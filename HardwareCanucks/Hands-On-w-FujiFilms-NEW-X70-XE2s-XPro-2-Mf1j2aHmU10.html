great technology selection and service
we had fujifilm invite us to an
exclusive event here in Toronto to
showcase a few cameras that were
announced recently and a new telephoto
zoom lens but before that I have to give
credit to the guitarist and the juggler
at the event that made the show more
lively so let's kick things off with the
new fujifilm x70 it features a 16
megapixel aps-c x-trans CMOS to censor
found on the very popular x 100 t along
with the fujinon 18.5 millimeter f 2.8
lens that's roughly 28 millimeter angle
of view and a built-in digital
teleconverter that lets you switch
between 35 millimeter and 50 millimeter
options there's a manual focus ring on
the lens which is a nice addition if you
want to take control off pinpoint
focusing the 3-inch touchscreen can be
tilted 180 degrees so it's perfect for
those high quality selfie shots it's
bright and quick to respond to touch
gestures like going through pictures
taken and even zooming which is pretty
cool the x70 is targeted towards people
who travel a lot and would like to
capture memories of various events in
high quality at your fingertips next up
is the XE to S it has the same 16
megapixel trans CMOS to censor found on
the x70 yet it comes with an X mount
system the body is lightweight durable
and compact they have equipped the body
with an updated hybrid autofocus system
that can track and capture moving
objects a lot faster compared to its
predecessor the XE to the shutter speed
and exposure compensation dials are
placed perfectly in line together so
users can access them quickly and the
side groups were comfortable when I held
them fujifilm has really stepped up
their book quality the 3 inch screen is
bright and clear plus it's rounded with
all the necessary buttons to get you to
the menu or playback the pictures taken
you can shoot 1080p video up to 60
frames per second but we will have to
test it for ourselves to see how well it
performs compared to the competition so
stay tuned for the full review the last
camera to showcase at the show was the x
pro 2 this is fujifilm's recent addition
to their flagship line of cameras and a
lot of pro photographers that I spoke
with we're considering this as a solid
upgrade from their existing gear first
it comes with a new 24 megapixel x-trans
CMOS 3 image sensor that not only
improves image processing but also
dramatically improves image quality from
its predecessor the exper one there's a
dual function dial you can use to
control both the ISO and shutter speed
which is convenient and this is the
first mirrorless camera to offer dual SD
card slots so you can either have it
store images sequentially or have one
store raw and the other jpg I was very
impressed with the electronic viewfinder
on the X Pro to the screen was clear and
I enjoyed composing some shots with it
the expected availability of this camera
is set to be around the end of this
month and it's priced at 17 hundred
dollars for the body a new lens has been
added to Fujifilm's line of lenses this
is the XF 100 to 400 millimeter at 4.5
to 5.6 telephoto zoom lens it comes with
optical image stabilization and it is
designed for aps-c format X mount
mirrorless cameras the lens barrel and
the exterior elements are made out of
aluminum the focus ring was smooth and
it didn't show any signs of resistance
and the body itself didn't weigh that
much considering the range of lenses it
is it to be priced a little south of 2k
and it is expected to be available by
the end of februari so what are you
going to stink of fujifilm's latest
addition to their camera line and lenses
