can't pass that where's my credit card
where's my credit card oh wait
Google has all my info I'll just use
Google pay or G pay whatever that's
called oh man it's getting scary to give
my information to Google anyways hey
guys
Eber here with Hardwick and axe happy
Thanksgiving to our fellow Americans
Black Friday is here and some of these
deals that we've come across are insane
and really hard to pass over excited to
share with you guys and as always we'll
make sure to leave links to all of these
products discussed in the description
down below we're gonna break this
segment down to three portions so
there's gaming keyboards mice and
headsets so you're more than welcome to
click on either of these segments if
you're interested in those areas just to
quickly give you guys a quick note all
of these items are less than $100 which
is actually really cool there's one
particular item that's a little over a
hundred but it's just really hard to
pass and it's a really good product so
without any further ado let's get
started now before we get to these hot
deals I just want to quickly mention
that we have checked price history with
all of these products through camel
camel camel to make sure that they have
reached their lowest price point at
least in the last 12 months which is
great
and we also wanted to include some of
these products simply because we've
personally tried and tested them and
they're by far some of the best
peripherals that we've personally come
across so you know getting them at these
prices is just something that you really
can't pass and lastly you know we chose
Amazon simply because some of these
items are on sale needed States
primarily but you can actually
potentially find them on sale in your
country so Amazon sort of opens up that
gateway which is pretty cool but make
sure to follow us on Twitter so that
we'll be posting some deals that we may
find that's worth a while and lastly you
know by the time you're watching this
video I mean depends on when you're
watching it with after Black Friday or
perhaps next week some of these prices
may not be as stated in this video so
again that's something to keep in mind
okay guys so deal number one is the most
affordable peripheral here and that is
the Coolermaster Devastator 3 combo so
it's a keyboard and mouse N and the
original price is $40 but there is a $15
mail-in rebate cartoon
so that'll bring down the price to $25
but when you add the Black Friday promo
code for $10 on top of that it'll
actually bring down the price to $15
which is again a killer value for this
set especially if you're someone who's
looking to upgrade from your existing
OAM keyboard and mouse combo this is
absolutely a fantastic option and one of
the cool things about this set is that
number one it's noisy be set so you can
customize the colors to your preference
there's lots of lighting effects built
in as well now another cool thing about
the mouse itself is that it's
ambidextrous and the sense of
performance is fantastic which is again
something that you really can't pass for
$15 next up we have the Logitech G 613
light speed wireless mechanical keyboard
the original price for this guy is Ron a
hundred and thirty dollars but it is on
sale right now for sixty-five dollars
which is a killer deal one of the great
things about this keyboard is it's a
wireless B it features Logitech
signature romaji switches so if you're
thinking of picking up a keyboard and if
you want to try the new Logitech
Normangee switches this is again a great
option to get into and it also has
bluetooth so you can actually connect it
to multiple devices and start typing
across them right away seamlessly
without any issues and it's got
dedicated media playback buttons so
again all in all a fantastic deal now
this next deal is something that you
really can't pass especially if you're
looking for a flagship all in all
mechanical keyboard and that is the
Logitech G 9 10 orion spark originally
it retails for around a hundred and
eighty dollars but right now it's on
sale for 89 or 90 dollars which is 50%
off from the original original price and
some of the great things about this
keyboard is that it features dedicated
media playback buttons it's got
logitech's romaji mechanical switches
which is great
RGB lining which can be customized per
key which is awesome it's got dedicated
macro buttons a wrist rest and it also
has a phone stand built inside the
keyboard which is again a really cool
feature so all in all something that you
really can't pass especially if you're
looking for a feature packed mechanical
keyboard now this next mechanical
keyboard is certainly one of my personal
favorites and that is the HyperX alloy
elite it's a full-size mechanical
keyboard originally it retails for
around $80 right now it's on sale for
$60 and
you can get two variants out of this so
there's cherry MX red or MX brown it
doesn't feature RGB lining but one of
the cool things I like about this
keyboard is its design build quality
it's got dedicated a numpad and
dedicated media playback buttons which
is certainly something that you really
can't miss it's also got a USB 2.0 past
report so that's pretty awesome and for
$60 certainly it's a killer deal for a
mechanical keyboard and now we're
entering into the realm of gaming mice
and POI I have a lot of deals to share
so I'm gonna kick things off with the
Razer DeathAdder Elite originally
retails for around $70 but right now
it's on sale for $40 which is $30 off
it's again a legendary mouse a lot of
people have praised it and given it
great ratings just for its sense of
performance and it's purty nom --ax so
that's awesome
next up is the Logitech g600 Wireless
Gaming Mouse originally retails for
around $80 but right now it's on sale
for less than $40 and one of the great
things about this mouse is while it's an
older product it's still lasts long it's
got great battery life you've got a lot
of macro buttons that you can program
and interestingly enough this would
actually go really well with the
Logitech G 613 wireless mechanical
keyboard so if you're thinking of
rocking or thinking of transforming to
the wireless lifestyle within your desk
I think this is a great big movie on we
have the HyperX pulse fire search RGB
Gaming Mouse I recently took a look at
this Mouse and I absolutely loved my
time with it it was a great deal for its
original price of $70 but right now it's
on sale for $40.00 which is fantastic
it's a killer deal you really can't miss
it one of the great things I liked about
this males is its ambidextrous design so
both the left hand right hand users can
use it without a problem the RGB
lighting is super nice and subtle it's
built really well the sense of
performance is fantastic so you really
can't go wrong with a mouse that costs
around $40 now if you're thinking I'm
actually picking up a keyboard
I think the HyperX pulsefire another
pulsefire the HyperX Alawis elite would
go along really well and if you combine
them both I think you're looking at a
pretty awesome package for around $100
and now we're gonna wrap things up with
gaming headsets and I'm gonna kick
things off with the HyperX cloud alpha
gaming headset its original price is
around $100 but right now it is on sale
for $75 which is great I
personally use one and one of the great
things I like about this headset is its
design and build quality it is built
like a tank it's very comfortable the
HyperX signature memory foam is just
super awesome and you wouldn't have an
issue at all for longer gaming sessions
it sounds phenomenal for the price the
microphone quality is also really good
for what it is and it's also very
flexible to you so you can connect it to
your Xbox one or ps4 controller and have
that flexible setup without any issue so
that's awesome and again for 75 dollars
it's pretty it's pretty great next up we
have the launch tech g6 33 Artemus
spectrum gaming headset its original
price is around $150 but right now it is
on sale for $70 so it's well over a 50%
off which is grain it is a wired gaming
headset but it's got a lot of features
like RGB lining if you're someone who's
looking for that it's also got great
sound quality and comfort and the one a
seven point one virtual surround sound
is definitely something to be
experienced Dimitri did take a look at
this headset well make sure that we've
reviews to all these products that we've
mentioned in the comments or in the
description so you can check it out but
certainly a great headset for what it is
and again for $70 if you're someone
who's thinking of picking up and
experiencing 7.1 virtual surround sound
fantastic buy and now I want to share
with you a product that's just a little
over a hundred dollars but it is a
fantastic deal that you really can't
pass and that's the Sennheiser game one
headset it's original prices to run $250
but right now it is on sale for a
hundred and twenty dollars and man this
is the go to the flagship gaming headset

because it's got a fantastic microphone
certainly something that we still
compared just modern headsets to so
that's awesome

build is just very sturdy it really will
last you for a really long time so again
Sennheiser has nailed everything with
the game one headset so certainly an
awesome buy for Black Friday and finally
we have another item from Sennheiser and
that is the GSP 300 closed-back gaming
headphones these retail for around $100
but right now they're on sale for $80
