knocks and welcome back to another
review now you all know we've covered
many cases from lynly and I just have to
say that every single chasse he delivers
to the exact same superb build quality
that we've come to expect which is
totally deserved for the full aluminum
body that you have to pay the premium
for so this is the PCV 358 another cube
case on the market that incorporates a
few unique features and carries an
unpleasant price of $179.95 elation
features dual 120 millimeter intake
he'll only power button and a slim
optical drive slot both left and right
side panels feature extra ventilation
with connections located on the right
with only 2 USB 3 ports and audio jacks
and also don't forget the very much
appreciated USB 2 adapter coming around
to the back get a power supply bracket
that allows easier installation of the
unit plus an exhaust fan for the bottom
chamber and four PCI slots for the micro
ATX motherboard the Vee 358 is elevated
with good quality case feet but notice
no ventilation for your power supply
which may be a problem now notice the
side panels don't have any thumb screws
and only the top panel has them so
leonie has made the side panels tooless
just pop them out and you are good to go
the top panel however after removing
three screws folds out completely
providing really good access to the
entire case the aluminum hinges are very
robust and don't show any signs of
weakness which is also excellent to see
the two front fans are tools as well
they sit on rubber grommets to prevent
vibration and just easily pop out bus
have individual twisting dust filters
that can be removed for cleaning also
lien ly includes molex to 2 pin fan
headers for each of the fans to keep all
the wiring in the bottom chamber now the
side radiator bracket is something I
would love to see more often as
all-in-one water cooling solutions
become
so very mainstream the bracket is sturdy
and allows a good swivel angle plus it
is easily removable so you can install
your radiator off the case the bottom
chamber features two hard drive cage is
easy to removal with just two thumb
screws and already pre-installed rubber
grommets for your 3.5 inch drives the
problem here is they do not support SSDs
which does limit your options cooling
for the bottom chamber really shouldn't
be an issue considering the rear exhaust
fan is right there plus the two front
intake fans will mainly deliver cool air
to the bottom chamber now it's not all
lost for SSD lovers but we only get two
SSD mounts on the motherboard tray using
the convenient mounting system with
rubber grommets but depending on your
radiator set up one of the SSD spots
might be rendered useless as was the
case in our scenario this is
particularly disappointing considering
the main purpose of the bracket is to be
used with a radiator now there's large
rubber grommet to pass your cables from
the bottom chamber but it is mainly
blocked by the drive cage and I wasn't
able to pass the 24 pin cable unless I
first remove the cage and this is sort
of my biggest critique of the chassis
the bottom chamber is just non designed
well there's this large underutilized
space behind the fan that is in most
scenarios would be just left empty and
now I have loved to see either an SSD
cage to be placed there or just
relocated second drive cage I speaking
of which there is 20 centimeters of
clearance until the drive cage for your
power supply but as you can see it is
very tight with our 18 centimeter unit
and really only way to do any cable work
is to remove the drive cage which of
course can later be put back the power
supply is elevated on a rubberized
platform but the usual bottom
ventilation is missing which is in this
appointment and while finally starting
with the assembly it is fairly easy to
work in in terms of routing the cables
and the case will support GPUs up to 13
inches it was a bit Columba some to
close the top panel just because of the
front panel connections and high PCI
Express cables but overall it was pretty
straightforward now you are limited to
CPU towers up to 13 centimeters but the
case really is design
for an AI yo water cooling system and
with an excellent swivel bracket to
simplify your installation process but
even then I wasn't completely satisfied
with the v3 58 just because there are
some unpleasant compromises now on a
positive note this is Leonie so you are
getting in the outstanding built quality
product the side radiator bracket is
totally awesome and functional for an AI
or water cooler and they can certainly
pack a punch when it comes to hardware
support and this relatively compact
enclosure with long GPUs and a total of
six mechanical drives and while here
comes the negative train my biggest
critique is the layout design for the
bottom chamber there is this empty space
that is underutilized and could
potentially house an SSD cage the drive
cajon from the power supply pretty much
blocks the rubber grommets which makes
cable routing into the main chamber more
challenging and for a chassis of this
caliber I certainly wasn't expecting
that
Plus only two SSD mounts is very
limiting especially since the one closer
to the radiator may be completely
blocked and wrapping it all together is
the price it certainly is a bit on the
high end but working with the full
aluminum chassis is an absolute pleasure
and I guess that is the price that you
pay but let us know what you guys think
of this case and this whole cube concept
I think it has a place within a certain
niche but is this the right way to go
