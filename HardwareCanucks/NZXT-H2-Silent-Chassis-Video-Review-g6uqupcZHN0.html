product showcase from Hardware Canucks
and this time we have a modest mid Tower
from NZXT that is targeted to those
looking for something that's going to be
cool and quiet but won't break the bank
it's the h2 classic silent chassis the
case rings in at about 90 million
dollars and should be available as of
March 2011 so let's take a look the
front panel is hidden behind a plastic
molded front with brushed aluminum
looking faceplate and chrome accents on
the edges the front door is held firm by
very strong magnets so there's no clips
to break but unfortunately the door only
opens to a little past the 90 degree
angle it's not really an issue except it
makes it a lot more prone to getting
broken if it's been left open they've
also added noise dampening foam to the
back of the door the features of the h2s
front panel highlight some of the more
innovative features of the case the five
and a quarter inch drive bay covers come
off with just a clip so you don't have
to take apart the entire front panel
just to get at them as we move down
there are two hundred and twenty
millimeter intake fans sporting a very
cool feature with just a couple of clips
we can completely remove both the fan
and its housing and not have to mess
around with wires it's for lack of a
better term a wireless power system that
only requires the to power contacts to
be touching in order to power the fan
behind the fans you'll have full access
to the hard drive cage which features
screwless removable hard drive caddies
the system is really quite brilliant and
probably one of the best that I've ever
seen in a case of this category except
for one thing why did they not opt to
include a hard drive hot swap option for
at least some of the front drive bays
here we have very easy to access hard
drives at the front we can get at them
within seconds there completely - lists
there's no cables to mess around with
and yet the user is still going to have
to go through the pain of removing their
side panels in order to hook up the
power and serial ata cables inside the
computer however moving on ports and
power at the top with rubber power
button audio USB 3 3 USB 2 a 3 speed fan
can
stroller and reset button ironically
NZXT has chosen to include a single
hot-swap feature sunken into the top of
the case that supports both
three-and-a-half inch and two and a half
inch drives and finally at the back a
cover over an optional 120 millimeter
fan space held on by simply magnets at
the back we have the USB 3.0 motherboard
plugin haven't quite moved over to the
internal header system yet 120
millimeter exhaust fan motherboard IO
spacing 7 PCI expansion slots water
tubing holes bought a mounted power
supply and underneath the power supply
an externally accessible removable dual
fan dust filter topping off our last
look at the exterior we did notice an
unfortunate amount of blotching on the
plastic front panel which is in sharp
contrast to the nice and fairly even
powder coat of the metal side panels
taking off the side panel we see NZXT
T's idea of what they call advanced
noise dampening technology both panels
have a quarter inch or so of quote
unquote premium noise dampening foam
internally however there is very little
to gripe about about the layout at the
bottom there is room for either longer
power supplies or an additional 120
millimeter fan there are eight three and
a half inch or two and a half inch hard
drive bays the motherboard supports five
different options and there are three
five and a quarter inch drive base all
with two lists retention systems judging
by the interior the h2 seems to have a
great layout for anyone from mid-range
gamers to small low powered mini ITX
home servers that need lots of storage
additionally there are grommeted spaces
in the motherboard tray and a large CPU
backplate opening giving hope that
installation should be hassle-free with
that we assemble a system into the h2
and as you can tell it cleans up quite
nicely and I'm pleased to report it does
it very easily despite its small stature
it's entirely possible to fit in many
modest aftermarket coolers and it can
support video cards up to 11 inches in
length though you can expect to lose
about 3 harddrive spaces
as we rotate to the back you'll see that
NZXT has given thought to the cabling
and pushed the motherboard tray in
slightly for plenty of room of the back
and they provided a great natural cable
storage area in behind the hard drive
base despite the fact that it looks like
a bit of a rat's nest the back panel
fits over top of everything cleanly with
all of our spare cables jammed in behind
just don't ask us to add any new
hardware and that is the NZXT h2 silent
chassis while being a relatively
standard design the case does bring with
it some unique features and ideas that
make it an interesting product to dig
into easy access quiet operation the
polished look and good value
unfortunately it seems like a little too
much emphasis may have been placed on
value and the h2 winds up feeling a
little unfinished I think that had the
company been willing to further develop
the key features of the case consumers
would have been willing to pay for it
but to you as a consumer if you feel
that this is the direction you need to
go for your case and price is incredibly
important then it may just fit the bill
the silent computing case market has
very few contenders but for the most
part all of them have very strong
products ultimately the h2 is stepping
into an important market with a
comparatively underwhelming product and
that is it for this episode of the
harbor Canucks product showcase we hope
