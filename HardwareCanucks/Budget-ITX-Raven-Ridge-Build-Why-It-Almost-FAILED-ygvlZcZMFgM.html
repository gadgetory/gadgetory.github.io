connects and a few weeks back we
explored AMD's Raven Ridge apos and came
to conclusion that they were worthy
enough to handle 1080p gaming at medium
to low settings and remember this was
without the inclusion of a graphics card
because about the Rison 5 at 2400 G and
the Rison 320 200 G featured Vega
graphics if you're interested in
checking out a full review I'll link it
right over here but today I want to put
together a gaming pc featuring one of
these ap use at a pretty affordable
price point actually I don't even know
if I should use that term at this point
because a current state of component
pricing is downright ridiculous and I
you guys know what I'm talking about
either way let me walk you through my
parts pic but also do know that I will
be mentioning some of the alternatives
that you'd go with throughout the video
and of course I'll be talking about my
experience building this guy but most
importantly I have to go through some
interesting troubleshooting steps and of
course we'll talk about that shortly so
let's dive in right after this welcome
to you a new keyboard train first attach
the magnetic wrist rest it simply pops
in don't forget about the USB
pass-through port and the headphone jack
to simplify your connectivity you're the
boss of the meeting control which is
right over here
fiery red key caps are included because
it is a gaming product with RGB / key
elimination and under the hood we've got
cherry MX silver speed and blue switches
for those legit actuations and finally
don't forget about the voice control
enjoy your new x1 by thermaltake check
it out in the description below ok my
choice for the APU was the horizon 520
400 G that costs around a hundred and
seventy dollars it features four cores
with a threads comes with a base clock
of 3.6 gigahertz with a boost up to 3.9
there should be more than enough to
perform day-to-day tasks like web
browsing and consuming high quality
content
not to mention this apu does support 4k
HDR playback you can also get away with
some light content creation maybe a
little bit of photo editing as well
thanks to the inclusion of a threads the
horizon 320 200 G isn't a bad
alternative for $99 as it features a
slightly lower clock speeds as well as a
lack of a threads compared to the 2400
gene there are also a difference in
specs when you look at the Vega GPUs
integrated on both chips
alright so my motherboard of choice was
initially this
by an a/b 350 and gaming Wi-Fi ITX if
you recall I did use this board last
year to build a mini ITX horizon 3 PC
but I encountered a few problems with
this choice for this APU build the
existing bios for this motherboard
didn't really support the hip new Raven
Ridge apos so if you're planning on
picking up this motherboard especially
if you're thinking of picking it up from
you know Craigslist or Ebay or whatnot
you might be out of luck because you'd
have to install a new Rison or previous
generation rising base CPU get it to
post update the BIOS and then switch
back to the APU because the latest BIOS
adds support or it enables the display
i/o on the motherboard as well as add
support for the Raven Ridge APU now do
not that most new motherboards that have
stocked up on retail channels should
come with the latest BIOS but you could
be out of luck it's like it's like I
don't know I don't know if it's like
winning a lottery at this point you
might even run into the same issue if
you pick any other b250 motherboard if
it has an older BIOS so and make sure to
check that before pulling the trigger
the original BIOS for Raven Ridge was
pretty terrible but it has improved
since launch unfortunately I didn't have
a spare rise in CPU here in the studio
so I had to switch out that gigabyte
board for MSI be 350 I pro AC micro ITX
motherboard it's a pretty basic board
nothing too much to talk about other
than you get the necessary i/o ports RAM
support up to 32 gigabytes and 32
hundred megahertz a single inductive
slot and Intel dual band wireless AC but
there is one major problem msi hasn't
actually made this board available to
the market yet and i'm not kidding
it costs $89 but it still isn't in the
market at least this was one of the
board's that was sent to us as a
reviewers kid when we were testing out
Raven Ridge so I'm not sure when they're
gonna be available but there are some
alternatives of course if you find some
of these new lead 50 motherboards that
are coming on stock that should
technically have the latest bios you
should be just fine but you could also
offer a standard ATX solution and then
you know go that way it's actually a lot
cheaper than going with a micro ATX
motherboard what's even interesting is
that b250 motherboards are frequently
sold out and the demand for those boards
are pretty high and the prices also
start to fluctuate at this point it's
actually really surprising to me because
we thought that GPUs were being on
demand at this
point and of course prices on GPUs are
let's just not have that conversation
right now but no be 3d motherboards are
in the equation guys so let me know in
the comments down below if you have a
micro ITX solution or a micro ATX
alternative for a be 350 motherboard for
memory I chose team groups dark pro 16
gigabyte ddr4 dual channel kit clocked
at 3200 megahertz the company is making
a huge comeback into the North American
market after being known as the
overclocking King back in the DDR days
the dark Pro kit features a stealth
black design along with a high
efficiency forged aluminum heat spreader
for maximum heat dissipation and at 3200
makers clock speed they should boost the
gaming performance significantly
especially you know with Raven Ridge ap
use now you may be wondering why I went
with 16 gigabytes instead of a gigabytes
and there are a few reasons for that one
modern applications like chrome actually
take up a lot of system resources
especially on the RAM side so if you
have like 15 tabs open and if you open
up task manager well you're definitely
going to notice that within the RAM
segment most importantly you know if
you're playing back 4k content
that also relies heavily on memory usage
as well so it's a good way to
future-proof your system especially in
you know next couple of years another
reason is that this motherboard only
comes with two slots so if you populate
it with a gigabyte dual channel kit and
if you want to upgrade to 16 gigabytes
saying the next couple of years
you'd have to invest on the memory kit
later on so it's another investment now
you could go with a single eggy bed
module and run it in single channel mode
but that would significantly affect
gaming performance now I also want to
spend some time and talk about memory
pricing because this 16 gigabyte RAM
module at 3200 mega Hertz costs around
two hundred and twenty three dollars and
you know as I was putting together the
parts list I noticed that the memory was
the most expensive component of the
entire PC and you know that actually
kind of opened my eyes because you know
it we're almost coming to a point where
we have to set aside a certain budget
after looking at the memory pricing
because normally we would set aside a
certain budget for the CPU and GPU and
then the rest of components sort of
follow along but at this point in 2018
it's the other way around we have to
first find memory and of course a GPU
and then the
rest of components kind of follow along
it's kind of all over the place - I'm
not really sure if you know what's the
perfect solution to this bunt but yeah
it is it is a little frustrating anyway
so let's talk about storage I chose the
OCZ TL 100 two and a half inch 240
gigabyte SSD as our main boot drive for
quick access to applications and for
storing my game library Western Digital
is one terabyte blue caviar hard drive
should do the trick
the teal 100 is currently unavailable
but a perfect alternative would be OCR
200 series as the 240 gigabyte variant
only cost $70 now you don't have to
necessarily go with an SSD for this
particular build you can use the
standard 1 terabyte hard drive as your
primary boot drive to store your OS your
Documents and whatnot but if you want a
little bit more performance it is a
worth or it is recommended to go with an
SSD I think the best possible
configuration would be 120 gigabyte SSD
and a hard drive so there are there are
a variety of configurations you could go
in terms of storage for this APU build
powering the whole system is
Silverstone's
st 45 SF small form-factor 4 PSU with an
80 plus bronze certification and it
retails for about $60 there should be
plenty enough to power the Rison 520 400
g + it's also super quiet during idle
and load operations the case of choice
is the Silverstone SG 13 Mini ITX
enclosure it highlights the strengths of
ITX design plus at $50.00 you just can't
ask for more there's plenty of room for
proper airflow although you won't find
dust filters which is a bummer and the
included hard drive bracket only
supports a single three and a half inch
hard drive or two two and a half inch
SSDs in my case I'm onto these drives
vertically to accommodate both the SSD
and the hard drive so I just keep that
in mind if you're picking up this case
so now that we've taken a closer look at
the parts list for this build along with
the operating system a basic set of
peripherals the total price rounds up to
about 870 dollars without taxes now if
you eliminate the SSD for just a hard
drive in the OS along with peripherals
provided you have them all ready you can
say we're on $230 and perhaps invest
that into a gtx 1050 the options are not
limited which is awesome alright so
let's put this thing together actually
it's already assembled but just a little
montage
so this is the final build and as you
can see it is pretty compact I'm not
sure if I can fit this entirely on you
know on camera but this looks like a
pretty compact case I think this should
be an excellent option for an HTP see if
you're thinking about that or just a
regular you know desktop system this is
pretty compact it's got two a USB 3.0
ports on the front you've got your audio
outputs as well your i/o is at the back
and overall there's plenty of airflow
it's a very simple build doesn't come
with fancy RGB lighting or whatnot so
it's it's just meant to be it's just
meant to be here at your desk and you
know just to get your job done of course
we don't have to talk about performance
so let's let's move on to that now for
clocking I decided to use Amy's rising
master software but before I get to the
settings I want to quickly mention that
Amy's public version that's available
for download directly from the website
ironically doesn't support these ap use
and that I found I found that to be
really frustrating because you know it's
been almost a month since these new
hippies launched and they still haven't
managed to update their you know their
public version of the software it
doesn't make any sense I am I'm pretty
it's disappointing I ended up using the
beta version that was sent to us as part
of the reviewers kit and after several
BSO DS remember overclocking his game of
trial and error but with Raven Ridge
it's more of an error than success so it
takes time to dial in the proper
overclock I managed to get a stable
three point nine five gigahertz on the
CPU core speed and fourteen eighty eight
megahertz on the GPU I tested boats talk
and overclock settings with the same
memory speed so here are some numbers
starting with the Adobe Media encoder
test I rendered a one-minute 4k h.264
video and noticed that the higher clock
speeds are heavily utilized and they're
able to deliver pretty good results
Cinebench r15 showcases similar results
as well overclocking the CPU did score
30 points higher than stock settings
blender doesn't really need an
explanation in fact I wouldn't even
consider this apu for 3d rendering but
this just shows how much performance you
can get by just overclocking the APU
what about gaming well as you can see
the IGP overclock certainly helped boost
the overall performance of the system in
3d mark 5 strike we see nearly three
hundred point increase from stock
settings and be aware this score would
have been a lot lower with memory speed
set to 2133 megahertz doom at 1080p set
to medium averaged around 46 frames per
second and with the IGP overclocked it
gave us roughly a couple more frames per
second so it's not too significant but
worth mentioning or watch a 1080p set
the high settings yields a 63 frames per
second at stock settings versus 66 with
the overclocked remember overclocking
the GPU does a bit for performance but
the GPU is very limited in its
overclocking capabilities and it's
likely to ensure the SOC package remains
within its TDP limits and the stock
cooler that comes with the apu does a
really good job keeping temperatures
under control so you don't have to
invest in an other aftermarket cooling
solution so at the end of the day could
I call this APU build a success probably
not because the motherboard of choice
isn't currently available in the market
so I'm not sure what I could substitute
it with at this point but as for the
rest of components it seems like a
really good fit for an overall well
averaged gaming PC now the price point
can be debatable I'm sure you might have
your own arguments in terms of you know
picking up line components or whatnot
but I'd love to hear your thoughts on
that in the comments remember there are
three factors that made this build
almost a failure number one component
pricing especially with memory and the
second point almost ties into the first
but it's the fluctuating motherboard
availability and lastly overclocking
challenges would this build make a lot
more sense with horizon 320 200 G and a
gigabytes of RAM again let us know but
most importantly I have one more point
to add on to this apu build there is an
upgrade path down the line for example
this motherboard technically does
support the Rison 7 you know 1700 X or
the previous generation Verizon
processors if you want a little bit more
performance you can just drop in a rise
in CPU and again you know that CPU
horsepower if you need to so this bill
could be a great foundation for that and
I'd love to hear your thoughts
I mean bear with harbour connects thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
