is brought to you by and cix technology
connected hey guys it's jacob at the EV
j sweet we're looking at some of the new
products that we're showing off at CES
2014 so the first thing we have here is
the EVGA hadron hydro case this case
actually is shipping today this case was
designed to accommodate water cooling
and also be a very small form-factor
secret you can see in there we have cpu
we have a CP water block we have a GP
water block everything being cooled up
for dual 120 millimeter radiator we also
sell the water cooling kit separately so
it includes a cpu block includes the
water pump a reservoir to being even
coolant and the radiator of course to 19
and the cooling kit is 179 we also have
some other products that were showing
off something brand new for CES is the
EVGA x10 gaming mouse this mouse was
designed with the highest quality
components including real carbon fiber
but we also have a version does not have
carbon fiber if you prefer to have the
non carbon fiber look but this does have
real carbon fiber we also use very high
quality switches and we actually use
silver wire inside the cable so silver
wire is approximately five percent
better conductivity than copper so we
just wanted to make sure that we have
the best components in this mouse so it
also uses a vago 9800 laser sensor which
gives you 8200 DP is has adjustable
weight system and it also has adjustable
sizing system so if you use a torque
wrench and put it in there and turn it a
bit you'll increase the size of the
mouse or decrease the size of the mouse
to accommodate your hand better so it
does have the customers ability for the
user what's the price difference between
two mice we haven't finalized the
pricing between the two mice but the
pricing should be relatively close but
the main difference is you'll be paying
a little bit more for the copper version
just because that one will be a little
bit more rare and copper it's just more
expensive to manufacture material right
it also has a weight
yep they have adjustable weight systems
if you take on the top cover me to show
us how yep so you just in its magnetic
so you pull off the weight the cover
here and the weights insert right in
here and then you can just kind of snap
that back on just like that the LED is
also full RGB so you can change the LED
lighting to you know red or yellow or
blue or just turn it off if you prefer
to have no lights on your mouse right
another new product that we recently
launched is the EVGA display port hub so
it's a pretty simple device what it is
is you take one display port off your
graphics card and it gives you three
display boards so you can connect up to
three monitors from one display port
maximum resolution 1080p each at 60
Hertz so for most of the monitors on the
market today if you only have a single
display port on your graphics card or
laptop it's a pretty good option it's
it's ninety nine dollars and your
computer with your
right so the computer recognizes all
three monitors independently so just as
if you had three monitors connected
windows were recognized it just as three
monitors you can configure the
resolutions independently change the
locations of the monitors and the red
and the refresh rates all that kind of
stuff does it need external power yes so
right there is where the power is so
sometimes this doesn't happen very often
but sometimes if you're in Windows for
whatever reason the the monitors are not
being detected you can hit that button
to Rida tect the displays that are
connected okay so this is the EVGA
geforce gtx 780ti kingpin edition so we
work directly with kingpin he is a very
famous overclocker and overclocking
community he helped co-develop this
product with EVGA a couple of things
that we did is really optimize it for
the enthusiast overclocker so for
example up on here you see we have dual
8-pin plus a 6-pin power input gives a
lot a lot of power necessary for the GPU
and also have a connector here for
monitoring the voltages in real time
with a voltmeter that you can wipe right
that's right yep and we also ship it
with a back plate so it comes with a
back plate already on the board there's
a lot of improvements under the hood is
well that are really geared for the
enthusiast overclocker a couple other
things we do is we increase the fans
side so we increase it by just a little
bit give it a little bit more cooling
power but ultimately this card was
designed for the extreme overclockers so
those using liquid nitrogen or water
cooling it also has 14 power phases so
we really beefed up the power circuitry
and so here say here's a shot of the PCB
we also hand-picked the GPUs that are
put on this board so the ones that go on
kingpin card they are a little bit more
cherry-picked you know maybe maybe
better overclockers and of course this
card supports up to 4-way SLI so this is
the car that he was able to break 1900
megahertz on so this has 3 gigabytes
right
as as of today the only card that has
six gig is the GTX Titan alright so
that's been CBG at CES 2014 thanks for
stopping by and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
