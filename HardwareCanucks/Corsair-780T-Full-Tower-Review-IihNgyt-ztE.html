great technology selections and service
hello everyone I'm Dmitry with haruka
NOx and the release of the 380 T from
Corsair has marked an interesting design
direction for the company especially
with a splash of a bright yellow
bumblebee color option if you're not yet
satisfied with the full tower offerings
from Corsair then you are in luck as
they have just released their latest 780
the next-generation design after the
very popular 600 T case priced at 189
for the white and yellow versions and
$10 less for the black and I gotta say
that I'm loving what they're doing in
terms of exterior design with the
chassis looking pretty cool with these
angular yet rounded edges and you can
actually use the top portions that are
sticking out on both the back and the
front to carry the case our sample
arrived with a little defect on one the
sides with plastic pieces slightly
sticking out but this is a
pre-production sample and things like
this should not pass through quality
control so don't you worry if you're
looking to see what they did differently
internally don't get your hopes up as
this is a merely an exterior
modification to the 750 d and the 760 t
with just two optical bays instead of
three and just some minor internal
adjustments the front io panel looks
modern with the inclusion of four USB
ports audio jacks and PR buttons that
appear to be inspired by some type of
car start button plus we get the fan
controller for five fans that are SATA
powered Corsair is not afraid of going
big in the large form is well supported
by wide the rubberized case speed so the
780 T is very stable and fully dustproof
with two easily removable filters at the
bottom for the power supply and the
optional fan mount if the drive cage
platform is removed the front filter
pops out to reveal to 140 Millner fans
included with triple 120 millimeter
support and single 200 millimeter fan
Plus Corsair always makes sure to design
the least restrictive frame and that is
excellent to see although one of the
installed fans was totally blocking the
screws
you need to remove in order to pop out
the drive cage so that was a bit
inconvenient and not really
user-friendly on a better note though I
do love how easy it is to get the inside
the enclosure with almost car like
handles that are tooless and we get this
massive side window that would reveal
all the goodies inside to close it you
have to align the two notches at the
bottom and basically snap the panel back
in place the filter up top is removable
we get so much room for triple fan
support and being able to install fans
above the frame for extra internal
clearance and they're also small rubber
inserts to prevent noise from vibrations
for those fans but one thing they did
miss out our cutouts to pass your cables
through if the fans are actually
installed above the frame this is again
another artifact in the 780 t that I was
not expecting to see you can't even draw
the fan cables behind the motherboard
tray from the top and this will
certainly negatively impact the appeal
of the 780 t even the front has the
small cutouts on the side of the fans
but strangely the top doesn't so just
keep that in mind the full Tower will
support EA TX motherboards with its nine
PCI brackets at the back and finally
they are getting the hint of flexible
rear fan mount in case you need to
maneuver the fan to accommodate for
thicker radiators and of course we have
a 140 millimeter fan included and
getting inside the full black interior
there is a deja vu moment as we've seen
this layout time and time again with
their full towers it's not a bad thing
per se and you know it's a very spacious
design with module drive cages and
rubber grommets spread around so the
drive cages after removing the screws by
the fan and some more on the side
there's also another question mark of
why these are not thumb screws to
simplify your workflow but here we get
modular mounting all depending on how
you want to set up your internals we get
extra flexibility to offset the platform
to allow radiators to be installed at
the front with three inches of clearance
available and then this way you can
still utilize one of the cages Auto GPU
clearance that drops to ten and a half
inches for the bottom by PCI slots
the fault setup over there's plenty of
space for your graphics card with just
under 14 inches available until the
drive cage and here is where an extra
fan on the side of the drive gauge would
help to drive airflow but unfortunately
that's not an option
removing the platform completely you can
install a 240 mil new radiator at the
bottom without compromising your storage
potential as both drive gauges can be
mounted to the top frame with plenty of
space left over for thick radiators and
push-pull setups also with the radiator
at the bottom over 200 millimetres is
available for your power supply taking a
quick look at the drive caddies there
nothing special with size SSD mounts
that will require you to remove one of
the pins on the bracket to insert the
SSD and speaking of us as these there
are three dedicated brackets on the side
of the chassis designed to show off your
drives they have holes to secure the SSD
to the bracket and the bracket to the
cases wall there's nothing unique behind
the motherboard tray just a few cable
tie points and lots of room for any
cable work especially since you can just
tuck away majority of them into this
plastic sleeve at the bottom the large
opening in front and power supply for
some reason is not vomitted now even
though it doesn't show through the side
panel it would still be nice to include
for an overall cleaner looking basement
starting with the assembly the
motherboard standoffs are pre-installed
with a longer middle standoffs for a
quick motherboard alignment nice now for
this price I think we've been sort of
spoiled at how fan Tech's treats its
customers with a full plastic toolbox
included so it was a bit of a letdown to
see a standard cardboard box with just a
simple ziplock bag included with the 780
t and so here's the finished build I
think any type of system would appear
miniscule inside the 780 t and it has
its advantages of course like a complete
a seamless assembly process and plenty
of space for water cooling so the full
potential of the case is yet to be seen
with some awesome enthusiasts custom
loops and perhaps multi-gpu setups we
have just under four inches of clearance
until the memory modules up top so
that's plenty for
chan poll and thick radiators and those
SSD brackets on the side peek through
just to show off your fast drives now I
didn't even bother doing anything with
the cables in the back as the large gap
at the bottom does a create job
containing them all and also the side
panels are actually reversible you know
just a thought for potential modding
opportunities and so let's wrap this up
the 780 T is everything that is already
good with a course there's internal
spacious layout with modularity water
cooling support and straightforward
assembly while spicing things up with a
touch of exterior modification to the
better with simple to remove and good
looking side panels plus the inclusion
of that fun color I just love the
bumblebee however there are a few
moments of dissatisfaction as you can't
pass fan cables inside if they are
installed above the frame up top there's
no rubber grommet on the large cutout
that I found strange and I was expecting
a simple process to secure the drive
cages to the frame without needing to
remove the front fans now there's
nothing seriously wrong with the 780 T
but I really wish Corsair would diverge
their attention towards space efficiency
and away from these gigantic cases as a
slimmer and the more compact mid tower
equivalent of the 780 would be welcomed
with many more arms in this market I
think than another full Tower but what
do you guys think do you agree with me
on this and what are your thoughts on
the exterior of the 780 T and this
bumblebee direction and as always thanks
