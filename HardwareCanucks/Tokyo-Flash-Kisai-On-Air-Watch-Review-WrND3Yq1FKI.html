accent today we're taking a look at an
interesting watch from a company tokyo
flash their slogan is to redefined where
you think about time and that clearly
shows through the selection of multiple
different and very complicated watch
faces now one cool aspect about these
models is then they're totally unique in
form of design the concept art is
presented and the fans cast their votes
so what we have here is watch from Kisai
series called on air which is actually
one of the most popular design choices
one thing I was very surprised to find
for watch like that to go for $200
considering it's not a smart watch but
perhaps its touch in the face may change
my mind so let's check it out the build
quality on the actual watch is pretty
solid with stainless steel frame and
clean brown design that sort of hides
its complexity the glass remains scratch
free even though I've hit it a couple of
times but it's the steel wristband that
doesn't impress me the tusks are flimsy
it's got a lot of play between the links
and the locking mechanism is also just
mediocre requiring additional force to
be properly locked in place so this was
not at all what I was expecting for the
$200 and before we get into any features
are you able to tell the time from this
watch right now I know it's a little
confusing but the hour-hand position
represents the actual hour and the
numbers that make up the hour hand are
the minutes so the numbers are quite
wide it's a little difficult in the
beginning but once you realize that
those are numbers it's pretty simple to
tell time so this one here tells us it's
11:18 a.m. while this shows 542 p.m. now
might be fun to ask your friends to
guess the time but for the week award
the watch it was actually quite
difficult telling the minutes by quickly
glancing at the watch the contrast
between the hour clock and the
background isn't much so you always have
to find the right angle to see the
numbers correctly there is a backlight
which is blue it actually makes it more
difficult to see what time it is so I
wasn't really impressed
now the LCD does incorporate four touch
sensor areas that individually
controlled backlight date time and alarm
you
so I've left the right to unlock to
watch and then presented with these pop
top icons to set the date you hold the
date icon for three seconds and use a
circular motion to adjust a month that
will be told by the location of the hour
clock and the numbers inside to tell you
the date you change the date the same
way with the circular motion and the
same goes for adjusting time of the
watch to set the alarm you hold the
alarm icon for three seconds adjust the
hour and then there's a semicircle in
the middle when it's on top that's your
p.m. and once at the bottom its a.m. and
you set the alarm time the same way as
before it's not the most convenient
that's not the easiest and certainly the
14 page manual that definitely came in
handy but my main issue with the Kasai
on air is its touch interface it doesn't
always work and requires variable
pressures and different zones that I
found kind of strange there is sound
feedback that can be turned off
certainly a useful feature knowing when
something is registered but aside from
that it's not seamless navigation and
time reading as I was sort of expecting
now I can appreciate the uniqueness of
this watch meaning there's a limited
number of this exact watch that will be
produced but everything else about this
watch contradicts its $200 price from
the mediocre wristbands and the clamp to
poor backlight and very uncomfortable
touch interface it's very difficult to
tell time not because of how the time is
displayed
but because the contrast is so low
between the hour hand and the background
that makes it quite hard to distinguish
so the value is extremely difficult to
justify but what do you guys think of
this concept of complicated time is it
cool and would you ever get one let us
