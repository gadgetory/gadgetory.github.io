connects and this is the Samsung Galaxy
S 9 not the s 9 plus but it's little
brother the s 9 and it's a successor to
the very popular galaxy s 8 and the S 8
plus I was actually fortunate to test
those devices last year and let's just
say that I had a lot to discuss in terms
of Samsung's design and software choices
and for those of you who watched a
review should get a rough understanding
as to where I'm coming from and what my
expectations and preferences are when it
comes to a flagship Android advise
personally I had mixed feelings about
the s8 and it was just not my favorite
device from last year but against mantra
reviews are always subjective but let's
talk about the s9 and what improvements
Samsung has done to it to make it a
compelling upgrade over last year's
device or any other smartphone so let's
dive into it but first a quick message
from our sponsor welcome to you a new
keyboard train first attach the magnetic
wrist wrist it simply pops in don't
forget about the USB pass-through port
and the headphone jack to simplify your
connectivity you're the boss of the
meeting control which is right over here
fiery red key caps are included because
it is a gaming product with RGB / key
elimination and under the hood we've got
cherry MX silver speed and blue switches
for those legit actuations and finally
don't forget about the voice control
enjoy your new x1 by thermaltake check
it out in the description below alright
so what are the new changes let's
analyze it step by step and ultimately
you can decide if it's worth your hard
earned cash first and foremost the
design and honestly it's not that
different from the s8 at least when you
look at it from an arm's reach the
insulin still features curved edges
smooth metal unibody construction
corrala classified both at the front and
the back which again is a fingerprint
magnet
I have already noticed scratches at the
back of my sample with just a month of
usage and it looks ridiculous so a case
or skin is highly recommended although I
do want to mention that while a case
could protect the rear end of the phone
it wouldn't necessarily protect the
screen at the front and here's why you
see the curved screen design sort of
blends in with the metal
the device so when you install a case
that tiny gap is still prone to damage a
friend of mine bought the s8 last year
and she has already been through two
replacements which is mind-blowing
considering it's only been a year and
this is a picture of a recent s8 device
with a case installed and it still has a
cracked screen now I know what some of
you might be thinking why not install an
Otterbox case or any other
military-grade material to give it the
ultimate protection it needs but that
would add more weight it would take away
the physical aesthetics order the
beautful aesthetics of the device and it
just wouldn't make any sense purchasing
the s9 in the first place because the
design is the most attractive element of
the smartphone I think we've reached
peak smartphone design in 2018 I mean
Samsung brought their a-game to the
table with the introduction of the s8
and we saw competitors sort of take
inspiration from that and implement them
in their own flagship devices sure they
all look beautiful in person but from a
practicality standpoint I just can't
recommend phones with curved screens and
glass backs it just it's just not my
taste but I'd love to hear your thoughts
on that in the comments moving on to the
display well nothing has actually
changed in that area you get the same
5.8 inch Super AMOLED screen with a qhd+
resolution the screen to body ratio
remains identical so nothing super
exciting but hey it's still one of the
best displays I've encountered on a
smartphone colors are super vibrant if
you've owned a Samsung device in the
last few years this should feel like
home I'll be it a little bit better
due to the improvements in contrast
ratio and a wider color space support
Samsung does include options for
different color profiles my pick was the
basic mode as the colors seem more
neutral to my eyes especially coming
from the pixel to also fun fact the
pixel to screen gets a lot brighter than
the s9 so Ewing content outdoors might
not give you the best experience on the
s9 when compared to the pixel - that
being said nice lens brightness can be
dimmed a lot lower than the pixels so at
least that's nice I still can't get over
the curved screen while watching content
remember on my essay review I mentioned
how the edges got reflective and it kind
of got in the way when watching content
or just watching video or something it's
the same story with the s9 and I didn't
like that
now given the screen
so much flush to the metal frame there's
no room to hold the phone comfortably
and I've run into times where I've
accidentally skipped to another part of
the video because the playback meter
within the app in this case YouTube
automatically detects my thumb's
position and registers that timestamp
which I found to be really annoying this
is one of the downsides of a bezel as
smartphone there's just no room to
comfortably place your fingers around
and I think a case might come in as a
solution once again because it adds a
little bit more room around the edges
for better ergonomics but those are just
my thoughts by the way Bixby is still
here
I don't think Sampson is gonna let go of
their virtual assistant anytime soon and
they've been adding updates to it since
the s8 launched to be frank I have never
bothered using it at all since I'm
heavily invested into the Google
ecosystem and I'm a lot more comfortable
using that over Bixby and there are a
few reasons for that for example on my
pixel 2 I can simply squeeze the device
to activate Google assistant and it can
ask a certain question or maybe control
my smart home devices and it's pretty
fast it's consistent it just works
whereas with Bixby well that's a
different story because you have to ask
it as you have to ask question a certain
way to get the right answer and another
thing is that it's not compatible with
my smart home devices because Samsung or
the Bixby is directly linked to smart
Samsung smartthings which is Samsung's
smart or Samsung's separate smart home
ecosystem so that's another entity and
it just wouldn't work so that's another
reason why I didn't even bother using
big space however Samsung has pre-booked
Google assistant into the s9 so all you
have to do is just hold on to the home
button to activate Google assistant and
you can ask it certain things and it'll
just work right away but the problem is
that you're having you're kind of
competing with two virtual assistants on
the same device it's either Bixby or
Google or Google assistants so it's like
which one would you pick it is confusing
you could ultimately turn off Bixby if
you really want to and stick with Google
assistant on this device but if you want
to take advantage of some of the
features that Bixby has it's it's a good
way I mean one you could ask it to open
a certain app and perform certain tasks
or Bixby vision is a pretty cool feature
essentially you can use the camera to
point at certain objects and big speed
is a really good job
pulling up results that are relatable to
that object so for example if I point
the camera to a gaming keyboard it'll
pull up appropriate results which is
pretty awesome and I don't think Google
can do that as of right now it does have
that feature but it just can't detect
certain objects so that's something to
keep in mind now one of the things that
I mentioned in my essay review was the
inability to reprogram this physical
bixby button to something else you still
can't do that on the s9 unfortunately
but you can't actually turn that button
off or physically disabled that button
so Bixby has finally given you the
option to go into the settings and turn
off that button to trigger Bixby so if
you accidentally keep hitting this
button and when it triggers Bixby then
you can completely just turn it off so
that's nice but the problem is that it's
just one physical button that's just
sitting there doing nothing you can't
really reprogram it although I'm pretty
aware that there are third-party
applications that can do that it's just
that it would've been a lot nicer if
Samsung could offered that
reprogrammable function on this button
so yeah it's it's big space so I really
don't know what else can I talk about I
should also mention that the fingerprint
reader the back has been relocated to a
more comfortable spot it's easier to
access when compared to the s8 but oddly
my review sample has some difficulties
recognizing my finger at times but hey
I'm glad that they've listened to us
from last year's terrible placement the
insulin still features ip68 water and
dust resistant rating it's a must-have
feature in 2018 at this price point and
Samsung gets bonus points for keeping
the headphone jack because most flagship
phones don't come with one and the
internal DAC is fantastic you won't have
a problem driving high-end headphones
like the sennheiser HD 598 Plus Samsung
does include a pair of AKG headphones
out of the box so you don't have to
invest in a pair later on
unfortunately I can't comment on how
those headphones sound because the
provider for my review sample decided
not to include one with my sample so
it's like yeah but but hey at least
they've included one in retail models so
that's nice okay so my software
experience with the S sign was alright
the main interface is relatively easier
to navigate around with albeit I'm
typically not a fan of om skins on top
of Android but you can easily fix that
with a third-party launcher like Nova
and customize it the way you like
unfortunately it's still running android
8.0 and awaiting the 8.1 updates so
hopefully Samsung will roll that out
soon
that being said expecting ton of Samsung
related features on top of the OS Bigsby
is one of them there are a handful of
other advanced features like smarts a
one handed mode and other gesture
controls there's a separate theme store
where you can download custom themes and
wallpapers although you have to pay for
most of them the apps edge folder lets
you instantly access apps you use most
often although I typically leave them on
my home screen so not really sure who
would take advantage of that Samsung has
still pre-loaded the s done with their
dedicated browser email calendar gallery
and some other apps most of them can't
be uninstalled and if you're getting the
device to a carrier expect even a lot
more bloatware one of the things that
completely threw me off while using ys9
was the ability to turn on mobile data
on the go and as much as silly as that
may sound hermia for a second you see
enabling data on most Android
smartphones is pretty straightforward
all you have to do is pull down the
quick settings tab and tap on the data
toggle it instantly enables data and
it's a quick and easy way especially for
people who have limited data plans
that's not the case with the S 9 because
Samsung for some odd reason decided to
remove that toggle from quick settings
so if you need to turn on data you'll
have to navigate yourself through the
main Settings app tap on connections
then mobile data and then tap on the
toggle trust me it's been a brutal
experience going through that process
and I honestly have no idea why Samsung
decided to remove that feature it was
there on the essayed I just don't why
they were moved it on the s9 it just
this doesn't make any sense I mean I
mean Samsung moving on the S line still
features a three thousand milliamp hour
battery just like the s8 I'll keep your
expectations pretty low because battery
life is respectable but not great like
the Google pixel - there's so much stuff
going on with the s9 like the Super
AMOLED qhd+ display a faster processor
and of course Samsung skin-on running on
top of Android you can definitely get
away throughout the day without plugging
in as long as you're not planning on
using it heavily
for example streaming music via
bluetooth or constantly watching Netflix
or YouTube I was able to get around
three and a half to four hours of screen
on time and my usage consists of
casually checking social media watching
a few YouTube videos messaging the usual
stuff I need to emphasize that battery
life heavily depends on your usage so if
you are a heavy user you're definitely
not gonna expect the greatest results on
the s9 so I'd recommend a portable power
bank just in case and the good thing is
that it actually charges via USB type-c
and exports call comes quick charge 2.0
protocol now if I compare to something
like the Google pixel - I think this is
still a lot better in terms of standby
time because Google has done a fantastic
job optimizing the software with the
hardware so if you're looking for
another alternative I definitely
recommend the Google pixel 2 over the s9
just in terms of battery life because
it's a lot better than this guy all
right our last topic to discuss here is
camera performance and Samsung has added
a few features to make it look like a
compelling upgrade over the Galaxy s8
but let me walk you through what exactly
they've done here so it features the
same 12 megapixel sensor like the s8 but
they've added a variable aperture mode
meaning you can switch between two
different F stops in this case between F
2.4 and F 1.5 which is incredible
considering how much light it can let in
in darker scenarios now do I see myself
taking advantage of this feature maybe
maybe not I should most of my pictures
in Auto mode with HDR on a smartphone
and in this case the esslyn
automatically detects lighting
conditions and adjust the aperture
accordingly but if you want full control
of that as well as shutter speed ISO
white balance etc Samsung's pro mode is
the way to go and there is this so this
is an example of a our emoji I'm not
exactly sure how I'm supposed to react
to this definitely the tracking is
pretty weird it's not as accurate like
what you find with an emoji zone on the
iPhones but I guess this is Samsung's
way of responding to Apple's offering
and I don't see myself using this
feature at all so I don't know I I don't
know how to react to this another thing
to mention here with the air emoji stuff
is that once you've created your avatar
Samsung automatically generates a
handful of animated emojis with
different expressions so if this is
something that you're interested in the
s9 could be a good option
video recording has also improved now
you can shoot up to 4k at 60 frames per
second
1080p up to 240 frames per second and
720p up to a whopping 960 frames per
second or in other words known as super
slow motion you can shoot that boat in
auto or manual so for instance if you're
in auto mode all you have to do is tap
the record button and the sensor will
automatically detect objects that are in
the square and when there's a motion
it'll trigger slow motion whereas with
manual you'd have to tap the slow motion
icon to capture that motion the results
are pretty interesting it's not the best
quality out there because it's 720p but
the option to shoot 1080p at 240 frames
per second is a fantastic alternative
it's a lot better in terms of quality
and while you're losing a bit on the
frame rate sign I think it's okay
pictures on the other hand work good
there's great dynamic range and the
sensor does a really good job capturing
detail although I've ran into times
where it would accidentally over expose
for a particular shot destroying the
shadows the colors are of course nice
and vibrant just like what you'd expect
from a Samsung device but personally I
still prefer the image coming out of the
pixel too just because it does a much
better job processing HDR and exposing
properly I've taken a few samples for
comparison so let me know what you think
about it in the comments
all right so this is the video test from
the Samsung Galaxy S 9 currently
shooting 4k at 60 frames per second but
my premiere timeline is 24 P so I guess
you might notice a little bit of jitter
as you can see the sensor does come with
image stabilization so does a really
good job stabilizing the footage here's
a quick test of the auto focusing it
works really well and as I'm walking
down this pathway I'm actually really
impressed with the video quality coming
out of the guest 9 there's good dynamic
range auto focusing is great colors are
nice and vibrant but surprisingly it
doesn't get that it doesn't over expose
that well so or it doesn't blow out the
highlights which is great but let me
know what you guys think about the video
quality in the comments now portrait
mode has sort of made its way into the s
9 but it's renamed a selective focus
essentially this allows the user to
shifts focus between subjects after
taking the picture you can't necessarily
adjust the blurriness of the background
like the note aid or the s9 because both
those devices feature two cameras but
once again it's nowhere as good as the
pixel two same story goes for the selfie
camera to the sensor on my sample for
some reason over exposes a little bit
for the highlights not exactly sure
what's going on but overall I'm not that
impressed with the camera performance on
the s9 so I think it's about time to
wrap my thoughts on galaxy s 9 it's a
minor improvement over the SI if you are
a current SI toner
I wouldn't recommend hopping onto the s9
right away because you're not really
getting that much in terms of paying
that premium for one the design is
almost identical sure they relocated the
fingerprint reader which is crane but
rest aside you're getting the same
display with the same resolution one of
the cool things that actually included
dual front-facing speakers or dual
speakers this time so you have a one
firing it from the bottom and one of
them firing from the earpiece so it
gives you a nice dual stereo imaging
which is green which the SI didn't have
and the camera improvements might not
seem like a major one unless if you
really need to take advantage of super
slow motion and maybe the variable
aperture mode if you see yourself taking
image of that and of course taking range
of Samsung's Pro Mode and of course
maybe get accustomed to the Samsung
related features then
the s9 might seem like a pretty good
option but I just personally can't
recommend this phone and there are a few
reasons for that one
I'm not really a fan of Samsung's
software experience it's not the best
I'm I'm you know I'm more of a stock
Android type of guy I prefer the
experience coming out of the pixel to
over the s9 and to be honest you're
really not getting that much in terms of
features when compared to pixel two for
example the battery life is a lot better
on this guy when compared to the s9 the
camera is of course a lot better on the
pixel too when compared ds9
and while the display might seem a lot
better on the s9 compared the pixel 2
because this has a 1080p display
compared to a qhd+ display
I'd really don't care about that it's
just what I care about is something that
functions and I think basil 2 is
functional whereas the s is not because
the curved screen not a fan of that it
gets super slippery glass backs not a
fan of that it gets super slippery it's
a fingerprint magnet not my best and the
one major thing that threw me off
totally while using this device was you
know Samsung just decided to remove that
mobile data toggle on the quick settings
app it's just I'm not sure why they
decided to do it but I'm really
disappointed in that decision it just I
just can't pricing on the s9 starts at
seven hundred twenty dollars and it can
vary depending on carriers and in Canada
there are two color options that you can
choose from there's a titanium gray and
lilac purple
I prefer titanium gray but I also would
have preferred to see midnight black
into the Canadian market but
unfortunately we don't have that option
quickly on our performance I know I
haven't mentioned that in the review but
there's just nothing really to talk
about because it's got a flagship
processor in it four gigs of ram and it
just flies through multitasking expect
blazing fast performance you're not
gonna notice any slowdowns and I didn't
notice any slowdowns over my testing
period so that's nice although one thing
that I'm kind of aware of or a little
worried about is the device is receiving
constant updates later on I'm not sure
when the 8.1 update is gonna roll out in
the s9 hopefully they'll roll it out
soon but that is something to keep in
mind so that about wraps up my long-term
review of the samsung galaxy s 9 I'd
love to hear your thoughts on this
device what do you guys think about it
if you're an existing SI
would you actually consider I'm going to
the s9 or if you are coming from the s6
or the s7 or if you're thinking about
switching from an iPhone
would you consider the s9 let me know
the comments down below I Mira with high
reckon axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
