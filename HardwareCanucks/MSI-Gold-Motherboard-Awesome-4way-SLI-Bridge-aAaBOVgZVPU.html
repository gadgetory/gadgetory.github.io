possible by our partner nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to corsair
phanteks and NCIX msi is turning 30 this
year they were started in 1986 and part
of the special edition motherboards
they're introducing this year to
celebrate 30 years is this golden PCB to
make sure the motherboard like this
stands out from the rest it is based off
a lower and chipset so it's not exactly
targeted for enthusiasts but you could
question plenty of design decisions on
this particular motherboard first the
PCB seems to be almost infused with some
sort of gold flakes or some sort of
glitter as it surrounds all the
components and it actually looks golden
person and I assume with the right
lighting inside the case you can achieve
a very unique look the red msi accents
unfortunately still make it on here with
the red PCI lanes and the memory slots
which would have been great to cover
perhaps in silver or just keep black for
this motherboard to maintain as some
sort of strong character and not be so
multicolored but perhaps we just need to
make sure that we are heard so they
change up the color scheme because that
is exactly what they did with the x99
godlike gaming motherboard initially
this was announced computex and this was
an RGB colour motherboard with the red
accents and people flipped out because
they wanted something more neutral if
they were to color match lighting on the
motherboard to the rest of the stuff so
we have this carbon fiber edition that
eliminates all the colored accents and
leaves you with a gorgeous black and
reflective metal scheme while keeping
all the lighting features so you can
still achieve the perfect color balance
then we saw this awesome 4-way sli
bridge from MSI this is a step up from
there very popular two-way SLI bridge
and obviously by the name this can fully
support for nvidia graphics cards but
they don't have to be from msi do note
that this bridge can also support 3-way
configurations although the third card
goes to the very last lot which might
hinder performance based on the
bandwidth of your motherboard what's
really interesting about this bridge is
the included one hundred forty
millimeter fan with a bracket that
directly passes heir to the GPUs which
in turn increases the airflow and keeps
those powerful cards cool as other
why's the cars are kind of choking for
air being so close together there's also
an adjustable spring standoff that can
support GPUs of various sizes which is
very thoughtful FMS I the actual bridge
houses the built-in LED logo and the red
and black design screams quality as well
as a visual appeal this is perfect for
those crazy red and blacks pecked out
