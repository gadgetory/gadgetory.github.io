room problem is I don't have space to
accommodate a mini ITX build plus I
don't need that much power considering
my gimmie PC can do whatever I throw at
it let's see what are the options out
there maybe a compute stick umm 200 part
actually how about a nook
now that mobile cable a chips are
available I think this should be fitting
all right let's do this but first a
message from our sponsor the z9 neo buys
all the right features on a budget with
a large windows side panel 5 included
fans and the excellent interior layout
with super simple cable management get
it now link in the description below
folks meet the as Rugby box s a tiny and
simple looking mini PC that retails for
about three hundred and fifty dollars
which for bare-bones kit itself is
relatively affordable when compared
against something like the Skullcandy
nook Dimitri look at a while ago with
this you get the basics of a chassis CPU
cooler motherboard and a few other items
but you'll need to buy the memory
operating system and storage so there's
an additional cost involved azrog does
offer a fully equipped B box as with all
these components already installed but
that would cost you about $150 more I
also want to make myself clear this is
not meant to replace a gaming PC and it
won't compete against the skull canyon
neck either rather the B box S offers
performance that's well suited for basic
tasks like web browsing word processing
high-definition media consumption so
let's find out if it can keep up to the
above mentioned tasks powering the B box
is a 7th gen cable a core i5 7200 u dual
core quad thread processor clocked at
2.5 gigahertz that turbo boosts up to 3
point 1 gigahertz this is a company by
Intel HD 620 graphics which ones that up
to one gigahertz asrock has also
included an MDOT two Wi-Fi card from
Intel that supports 802 11 AC and
Bluetooth 4.0 standards now since this
is a bare-bones kit you will need to
populate your preferred Ram modules
which by the way can be maxed out
- 32 gigabytes there is an extra m2 slot
that supports these MDOT - base drives
plus you can mount a traditional two and
a half inch hard drive on the bottom
panel with the included bracket and
connected to the logic board through the
combined SATA and power cable which also
comes in the box so in my case I opted
for coursers value select 16 gigabytes
sodam ddr4 kit clocked at 21 33
megahertz and their 240 GB by force le
two and a half inch SSD so in total
we're looking at at additional $300.00
with the operating system on top of the
$350 investment for the B box alright I
know this is a bit of an overkill but I
wanted my new mini PC to be relatively
future proof the extra parts cost can
vary depending on your configuration but
remember acquiring a fully functioning
Windows PC with a built-in wireless card
in this form factor for $800 is amazing
installing the RAM and SSD was fairly
simple but the included SATA cable could
be prone to damage as closing the bottom
panel with the SSD mounted required a
little bit of pressure users have
reported the system not recognizing
their two and a half inch hard drive so
I would be extra careful with this step
luckily I never experienced issues with
lowering of Windows 10 and the
appropriate drivers on the SSD as Rob
has also included a base amount bracket
for the B box and it can support both 75
and 100 millimeter options taking a peek
at the i/o you'll find a 3.5 millimeter
headphone and microphone input a single
USB 3.0 port and a USB 3.1 gen2 type-c
port the IR blaster for the included
remote is also located in the front side
and it is important to place the unit
facing this side for best control the
rear i/o consists of a Kensington lock
Gigabit LAN port two USB 3.0 ports a
single display port and two HDMI ports
do note that one of these HDMI ports is
limited to processing 4k at 30 Hertz
either way you can run dual monitor
setup without compromising quality and
that's a thumbs up now in terms of
native 4k playback the B box handled it
smoothly on my Dell 4k monitor the core
i5 CPU is plenty powerful to handle
content from YouTube Netflix and other
media streaming services however the
fans do kick in when loading up the
video from YouTube but it settles down
quickly during play
but it normally stays silent when
performing idle tasks like web browsing
the included remote is a nice addition
as it features all the basic controls
you need like volume adjust play pause
skip tracks and navigating buttons if
you're considering using the beat box as
an HTTP see this is a game changer I
install Kodi which is an open-source
home theater software through the
Windows Store and after tinkering around
with various add-ons through the app I
was up and running in no time
you can use this remote to navigate
through the app skip through movies TV
shows adjust the volume and put the B
Box to sleep which is super convenient
so you don't have to rely on a Bluetooth
keyboard or a mouse for that I just wish
they added a custom button to the remote
which could have been programmed to open
a certain application I did push the
core i5 to its limit to test and see how
it can handle CPU intensive tasks
starting with Cinebench a popular
benchmarking tool the B box scored 45
frames per second on OpenGL on the CPU
side it hit a little north of 300 points
for the CPU test which is respectable
and it's actually right in line with
something like AMD's 810 78 70 K
processor remember this is an ultra-low
voltage processor and it consumes a
maximum of just 25 watts Photoshop CC
2017 went surprisingly well for my
thumbnail edits but you have to be aware
that this program requires a lot of RAM
to process changes and in my case 16
gigabytes was just perfect for the task
Premiere Pro was able to playback my C
100 footage at full resolution without a
problem but adding an adjustment layer
with limitary color required toning down
the playback resolution to a quarter I
wouldn't touch editing 4k footage as a
CPU will struggle to play back in real
time but casual 1080p editing would be
okay for the sake of testing the
integrated GPU I did run a few games but
they ended up performing poorly even at
1080p with minimum settings for example
C is go experienced stutters
occasionally so I lost track of my aim
and I didn't do that great through the
game play or watch which really does
require a discrete GPU to run did pretty
well but turning down settings resulted
in characters that were pixelated and
visually the game looked awful for some
basic titles like hearthstone the B box
with the 7200 year processor would be
adequate but in fast paced titles where
framerate is key don't expect miracles
looking at the temperature side of
things I ran I 264 to stress test the
CPU and the integrated GPU the chip ran
a little over 80 degrees Celsius by
stressing just a CPU yielded 74 degrees
Celsius and during idle the system ran
at 53 C let's take a listen to how the
system sounds under both scenarios
performing simple tasks like web
browsing with multiple tabs open work
flawlessly and the built-in wireless AC
Wi-Fi card perform just as expected
providing strong throughput over my five
kickers Network I would even consider
the D box as a separate work machine for
myself to write scripts email and do
research without relying on my
workstation PC that theoretically draws
a lot more power compared to this I'm
tired of paying expensive hydro bills
you know so to conclude my experience
with the B box PC was very satisfying
it's an excellent machine to get basic
tasks done and the seventh gen ultra-low
voltage core i5 processor proved its
potential you know just being able to
upgrade the RAM up to 32 gigabytes and
also house to storage options in such a
compact form factor is incredible the
included remote is a wonderful add-on
and I definitely enjoyed using this to
navigate through Kodi and other apps
this is definitely a worthy option if
you're looking for a compact htpc there
are many other applications for the
system too for example folks who want a
basic PC for their children businesses
that want to save on electrical costs
and even professionals who want to keep
their primary system crunching away on
data it is an affordable compact and
very efficient solution my only gripe
about the B box is the included SATA and
power cable users have reported about
them being damaged during installation
so asrock if you're watching this you
better take notes I would prefer a more
durable cable in the next revision oh
hey there NC XCOM is Canada's leading a
tailor for anything your mind desires
just keep within those categories which
are plenty and get tempted by the weekly
deals visit ncx comm for all them sweet
deals so what'd you guys think about the
as rugby box s are you satisfied with
the performance of this tiny and cute
looking PC or are there any alternatives
that you might be interested in let us
know in the comments down below
I'm Ebert with hurricane axe thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
