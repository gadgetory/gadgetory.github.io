chassis from fractal design this is the
define XL black pearl which very much
resembles some of antics p series cases
thus serving as a perfect example of
head on competition the chassis is a
larger sibling to the highly popular r3
case that truly showcases what fractal
design really care about and that is
functionality with great cooling at the
reasonable price so with expectations
set quite high for this case let's take
a look this full tower is priced at one
hundred fifty dollars and weights close
to 40 pounds the heavy construction is
due to a fully steel frame and body with
the front panel being the only plastic
element on the exterior and with this
much steel incorporated into the chassis
it feels extremely solid while this is a
full tower offering plenty of features
it is targeted mainly towards users that
require silent operation without any
severe compromises the front panel has a
shiny mirror finish and a slight hint of
brushed aluminum it's held on by magnets
and opens up just past 90 degrees with
potential of ease being damaged if not
properly closed the front intake air
flow is delivered through the venting
strips on each side of the panel which
is covered in noise dampening material
and the front has four optical drives
with removable covers with a fan bracket
that supports a 120mm fan also a 3.5
inch adapter is included with a
complimentary bay cover moving on
another panel covers the two intake fans
that doesn't open too wide but enough to
remove the fan bracket that holds the
fans now this isn't really an issue when
removing the bracket but it could have
been made easier it supports to 140
million fans with one included and has a
built-in dust filter the panel
connectors are at the top to keep the
front panel clean with your audio power
button with a blue LED two regular USB
ports and two USB 3 ports the connector
an internal 20 pin cable and
unfortunately no USB adapter is included
and the reset button is hidden behind
the front door the top panel is plain
without any fan outs while still having
support for the top mounted fan which
we'll see later on
in the back we are venting for the top
fan rear exhaust fan I oh area seven PCI
slots with the extra vertical one for
the included fan controller water
cooling holes and plenty of additional
venting and a bottom mount the power
supply with a removable dust filter the
side panels pack quite a bit of weight
to them due to the thick steel and
they're also covered in noise dampening
material you're also able to mount
either 120 or 140 mm fan to introduce
more air flow for the internals by
taking off the noise absorbing material
or if silence is crucial to your needs
leaving the noise absorbing pad on the
side panel is an option taking a look
inside the chassis internals is divided
into three main chambers separated
mainly for airflow and user-friendly
assembly the optical drives are mounted
with provided thumb screws unfortunately
no to list system here below which a
modular hard drive cage which can be
rotated for a more optimal airflow over
the drives or remove completely to allow
direct airflow into the top chamber and
obviously mounting for extremely long
graphics cards all the hard drive base
have silicon grommets to absorb
vibration for the 3.5 inch drives and
the bracket is backwards compatible with
the 2.5 inch drives as well fractal
design continues to incorporate this
type of mounting system which isn't bad
but a 20 small thing would definitely be
more convenient moving on the power
supply is raised with rubber feet above
which we have a plastic plate that can
be removed if the power supply is
installed with the fan facing up are you
a fairly large CPU backplate opening
with plenty of rubber grommets around
the motherboard tray the case comes
equipped with two exhaust fans 180
millimeter fan for the top and 140
millimeters for the rear exhaust now the
180 millimeter fan is angled and
channels the air fault through the back
this is mainly to provide an isolated
enclosure for silent operation while
providing plenty of air flow with the
large top fan
but unfortunately this angle design has
several major problems one of which is
the tedious removal of the fan it
requires you to remove two screws on
each side of the chassis and further
unscrew the fan from the bracket this
also requires a lot of clearance and a
potential removal of your cpu heatsink
in order to pull out the top pan second
the fan is in place in the conventional
cut out for you a thin CPU connector
meaning you have to route you're a pin
cable through the only available rubber
grommet at the top and an apron cable
extension is required in order to have
reach which unfortunately fractal design
does not include and lastly no other
stuff and mounting options are available
at the top meaning potential is lost for
any internal water cooling of course
this chassis is not targeted towards
water coolers but having a lot of room
in the top and inside the case makes it
ideal for such a setup checking the back
we have a cpu cutout door that can be
open when needed then we have plenty of
cable time mountings and a full inch of
room to work with for all your cable
management and starting off in the
assembly the power supply bracket must
first be rotated as our power supply
will be facing downward taking cool air
from the bottom and when sliding the
power supply in place we discovered
another major problem and that is the
placement of the cat out for all the
power supply cables power supply is
longer than 180 millimeters will not
have clearance unless of course using
modified and we are pleased to report
installing our system into the defiant
excel was a quite a breeze came at no
surprise due to the large internal area
to work with this side is a small hiccup
in the power supply chamber and routing
the 8 pin cable and coming around the
bag cables can be tucked in behind the
bottom hard drive cage but can also be
spread around the back with the help of
the pole the cable tie mountings and
graphics cards the length of 13 inches
are supported with the hard drive cage
in place so hopefully we won't need to
remove the cage for installation of
longer video cards and to finish up the
CPU cutout is too small for motherboards
with high CPU placement but it shouldn't
be of a concern for recently released
motherboards so to wrap things up the
define Excel packs in a lot of features
like the minimalist design with noise
dampening material all around plenty of
storage area and hardware possibilities
with a decent cooling configuration
right out of the box and all that with
an excellent solid construction however
it seems as a fractal design has lost
the sight of the full potential this
chassis is capable of 41 having fan
mounts right on the top panel would make
the chassis appealing to a larger market
especially for water coolers as the main
cause of this problem revolves around
the angled fan and on top of that this
would not allow clearance for some
aftermarket coolers and the relocation
of the 8-pin cat out requires a long 8
pin cable and an extension should have
been available and while most
motherboard manufacturers are shifting
towards the USB 3 support the USB 3 3 SB
3 adapter should have been included as
well the defining cell is a little bit
of a disappointment strictly because the
chassis has a lot of potential that was
not utilized this narrows down the
market to only those who want the large
enough of closure as a small server that
will run quiet and cool without any
additions from the user and that
concludes our review of the fractal
design define XL thank you guys for
watching and we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
