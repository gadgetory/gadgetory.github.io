design case oh man we finally get
something with tempered glass so I've
been looking around for a compact ATX
enclosure that has tempered glass and it
was air flow focused and I think the
mesh if I see is the perfect sort of
candidate especially since I'm trying to
go with the all my storage on the
exterior so be using this thing along
with that for my main workstation rising
PC let's get started invest in storage
that makes a difference choose toshiba
rd 400 and vm e SSDs that are incredibly
fast and reliable
backed by advanced warranty programs so
you can focus on what matters
Rd 400 check it out from the description
below
all right so the metruff is a slightly
modded defined see nothing on the
interior has changed only some stuff on
the exterior but I'm extremely happy
with the price markup for that tempered
glass Edition which is not enormous
you're paying only $89 for the massif IC
which is only a 5 euro premium over the
windowed version of the defined C so
this is fractals response to many
current case trends including edge to
edge tinted tempered glass panels with
the standard 4 thumb screw mount and not
your typical front panel that is no
longer brushed plastic that's fractal is
known for but instead it's pretty much
fully open for airflow purposes and I
like the subtle design choices that
they've added like a tasteful aluminum
fractal logo without which the front
will appear to blend and I do like the
angular protrusions on the front mesh
that are not extreme and there are only
visible at an angle what I don't like
though are the glossy plastic bits
surrounding the new front mesh and I
initially thought the only way to remove
the front dusters to pop it out from the
frame that has the i/o attached to it so
it's not exactly user friendly but the
removal of this front mesh is actually
pretty unique there is enough space for
your fingers to get underneath the front
panel and push onto the dust filter and
it simply pops out like that so you can
clean it nice I do like the blackout USB
3 ports at the top still waiting for
that type C port from Prattville toe and
now they have a reposition the power LED
that's hidden on the front panel
the magnetic top dust filter is good to
eliminate percolating dust and properly
offset mounting points are here for dual
140 or 120mm fans now one of the main
reasons I like this range so much is the
size it looks kind of like a micro ATX
enclosure next to my evolve ATX but
since I'm on the air cooling my CPU this
reduced length of the chassis is
actually more beneficial especially
since you can populate 3 120mm fans in
the front or dual 140 millimeter on the
interior two fans are included the power
supply shroud is fully enclosed the
motherboard area is depressed inside
with these angular rubber grommets that
allow clean your cable exit and for
water cooling you can do a 360 rad at
the front as long as you move back the
drive cage and
a short power supply and you can also do
a 280 or a 214 on the radiator in the
front without removing the drive cage at
all and for the top you can fit up to a
2 a team in Radiator and I had to move
the rear fan down a little bit for it to
fit for additional storage 3 as these
can be installed on this bracket at the
back and I really love this channel for
cables on the front and I appreciate the
captive thumb screws for the solid side
panel so now the basics are out of the
way let's put my rising system out of
here and dig here alright so the
assembly went flawless I opportun love
the minimal style of the case it's much
smaller than my previous one and
therefore allows me to actually house
that external drive enclosure right
beside it without interfering with much
of my setup but I am having some issues
with the drive enclosure so I'll have to
troubleshoot that on why this is
happening some drivers are disconnecting
and some drivers not being recognized so
yeah and that's for the case in total I
get five fans two for intake two for the
CPU tower and one for exhaust to keep
air flow in the scores on ttle direction
I have five PCI slots occupied and cable
management for the interior is really
fantastic and behind the motherboard the
double loop velcro straps really save
the day
to clean up cables fast you don't have
to spend hours on it really ten minutes
and that's all you need and everything
is flat for the case so the side panel
closes without any force I do love the
tinted tempered glass that has no color
cast which is awesome it's pure black
with good reflections and lighting
shining through and overall I'm very
happy with the system transition and the
case down sized happy to report fractal
design is back in the game with this
damn good case say goodbye to cables
it's time to enjoy wireless audio well
the course they avoid RGB gaming headset
with the light and comfortable frame low
profile mic on headset volume control
and mic mute plus dual size illumination
check out the void RGB by Corsair
the perfect way to hear your game and we
always gotta finish it with the
and we going to fish they would spread
because the mesh if I see
is Fredd worthy make sure to subscribe
and check out these other viral videos
thanks so much for watching let me know
what you think of this enclosure in this
whole transition stay tuned for my
concluding thoughts on this drive
enclosure and soon as I finish
troubleshooting it and we'll see you
