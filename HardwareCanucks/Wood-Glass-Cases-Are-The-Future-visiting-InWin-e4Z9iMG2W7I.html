fantex schoolmaster in hematite what's
up guys don't lead you our connect and
it's in when we found a very interesting
case now incorporating words inside the
brain or on the outsiders brain report
but it's a very interesting direction as
i mentioned in my video for what we'd
like to see in the case direction moving
forward different materials you know we
got tempered glass different textures we
got aluminum and different strains
losses of aluminum surfaces and now
we're finally getting something that is
totally unique if i eyes that goes to
the consumer market and that is word so
this is the 806 it's based on the frame
design from the halo 5 which is quite
nice and they've got a couple changes to
the frame so for example if you come
closer a little bit i can actually open
the side panel with a picture button on
the back versus having some thumb screws
on the top terms of the layout is pretty
much identical the main attraction at
this point would be this curve would
look at this and would and they have
different wood here on a little guide
they have the cypress wood and over
there another case is maple wood so very
nice a little diversity on the color and
texture so what do you think here now we
have laser edged logo on the front here
nice and screws that are visible so
gives the carry case a little bit more
character and the front are you may
receive feedback people do not like it
so now it's aluminum brushed aluminum
surface here along with the bottom and
it cites deport well done in with so
this is the 806
i'm super excited to see how would get
me into it as more and more into the
case market but so far from what I see I
like it though there's going to be a
slightly more expensive version from the
805 which cost $200 so we'll see how
much this thing cost but the thing is
is not or you know going for this upward
direction is not new in manufacturing
process because the furniture industry
already knows what's up so it's about
taking those processes that are already
in place them integrating them into the
cake industry so we'll see how they do
it and continuing with the wood
direction this is the prototype gaming
qa1 I'm sure they'll change the names
here but it's cool because the top of
the case has another piece of panel of
the wood so this is the cypress wood and
it's awesome to see this type of
direction where we have different
material so we have almost like a clear
clear acrylic at the bottom that is
illuminated
so let's have a nice touch I don't know
if that's going to be the you know the
final product but it's a kind of a cool
little that's what you guys think also
the white surface here with tempered
glass so there's a lot of materials
integrated into the one enclosure
perhaps they also do like the wood
bottom tool so there's a little bit of
cohesion between the top of the bottom
you know kind of locked at design
structure in place we have tempered
glass panels that is to list of simple
pens that are removable and if you like
the party on the GTL booth is getting
way too loud so
we're going to food and as we try to
conclude here it in wind
well everything around us is throwing a
bunch of noises our way this caught our
eye this is in win-win but when we went
win-win father you get you get it so if
this means mod has had some ridiculous
properties like an actual camera in the
front that can recognize face
recognition and voice recognition and
hand room with recognition so you can
look at it you can unlock the computer
and you can move whatever
maybe we'll it starts going to start
moving at some point but the camera you
can monitor your hands and the whole
system will rotate so it's kind of a
kind of a neat thing obviously simply
for show Kikwete only hide out this is
you know good for consumers anyway but
how much we wait until the thing starts
to rotate so you can see what it does so
that's how it's rotating let us know
what you guys think about the words
enclosure and the wood panels for
England future cases I'm going to make
you our connect space much for watching
this to you in exist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
