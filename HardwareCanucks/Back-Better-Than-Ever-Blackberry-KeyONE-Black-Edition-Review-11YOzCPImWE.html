it's a blackberry some of you may be
thinking to yourselves how are they
still competing in the smartphone market
especially 2017 well to be honest I'm
not really sure how to answer that
question but here's what I think the
company has been working really hard to
design a smartphone that can compete you
know pretty well against Apple Samsung
and Google offerings it still provide
the core features that BlackBerry
loyalists are still fond of here's a fun
fact the key one is my first BlackBerry
smartphone and interestingly enough when
it showed up at the studio I thought to
myself that I would never consider using
it as my daily driver but here I am a
few weeks after reconsidering about
switching to this guy completely because
it is an awesome and solid Android
smartphone so let me walk you through my
experience using the key one as my daily
driver for the past few weeks right
after a message from our sponsor so it
was kind of a love at first sight you
know there's really nothing like this
exterior I love the metallic color the
tinted glass panel the RGB fans at the
front it's basically a see-through case
and who doesn't love that your graphics
card can go vertical the top is radiator
friendly and the right side is so unique
when exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
age 500 feet way cooler master check it
out
inscription below alright so let's get
pricing out of the way the key one
starts at $550 us and that's the Silver
Edition that comes with 32 gigabytes of
storage and three gigabytes of RAM the
Black Edition that I'm testing is
unfortunately only available here in
Canada and a few other locations and it
costs $800 Canadian which is an
expensive investment for us the primary
differences between the black and solar
models is the minor spec bump so you get
four gigabytes of RAM versus three sixty
four gigabytes of storage versus 32 and
the rest of the specs remain identical
also do not that Blackberry phones use
Android right now rather than a
proprietary operating system and I'll
talk about the experience later on ok
the first thing I need to address here
is the design and the build quality of
the key one let's actually start with
the design and that's kind of obvious
when you take a glance at it for the
first time it looks like a blackberry
you'll notice that a feature is the
signature physical keyboard the smaller
screen to body ratio and compared to
some other smartphones that are taking
the bezel-less approach
the side buttons are chamfered which
might seem like a minor thing but it
really adds to the aesthetics of the
device BlackBerry has implemented the
convenience key that's located right
beside the volume rockers and it can be
programmed to perform any action you'd
like for instance I can have it open an
app or set it to turn on the flashlight
or trigger Google's voice search or even
completely turn it off so Samsung you
better be taking notes now the problem
with this button is its placement and
much rather have it switched for the
power button that's on the left side of
the phone because that would organ amah
Clee make a lot more sense at least for
me but I can assure you that from a
feature standpoint it's a hell of a lot
better than the big speed button found
on Samsung devices the main chassis is
constructed out of aluminum and it feels
rock-solid in the hands guys
this is seriously built like a tank and
I wouldn't worry about long-term
durability although the lack of water
and dust resistance is disappointing
especially for a 2017 release so I'm
hoping that they'll include that in the
next revision the soft textured back is
a welcoming change from glass backs that
I've encountered from other flagship
smartphones this year plus it helps grip
the phone a lot better but be mindful
that it could pick up grease over time
the four point five inch IPS LCD display
was definitely an odd transition for me
personally since I've been using smart
phones with larger displays for a really
long time either way the screen features
a resolution of 1620 by 1080 so that's a
3x2 aspect ratio and that actually takes
a significant hit with screen real
estate there's really nothing much I can
say other than the fact that you'll be
restricted with the amount of content
being displayed on screen especially
when browsing the web or checking social
feeds and then there's consuming video
that took me a while to get used to
because for one the physical keyboard
gets in the way between you and the
content and the smaller screen means you
won't be able to enjoy native 21 by 9
content as much as you would would say
something like the Galaxy S II or the
new iPhone now in a positive note you
can take advantage of the scroll feature
built in with the keyboard to keep your
thumb from reaching up and smudging your
screen but if you do get the screen
dirty and you know you will I recently
found this the eye roller it claims to
sanitize your device's screen while
removing all the surface dirt by simply
rolling over it at first I thought that
the eye rollers claims were too good to
be true but look at how well it works
sure beats carrying around a bottle of
cleaning solution and a microfiber cloth
you can find a link to buy the eye
roller in the description down below if
you're interested coming back to the
display on the key one the colors are
just as expected for an IPS LCD panel
they're nice and vibrant I'll be it not
as super saturated as AMOLED displays
I prefer IPS over AMOLED because they
look more natural to the eye the viewing
angles were great plus I didn't notice
any weird color shift while tilting the
display however the screen doesn't get
as bright as I'd like it to be in broad
daylight conditions so if you're intend
to use a key one outdoors more often
you're not gonna be pleased moving on
let's talk about that keyboard because
it's one of BlackBerry's key selling
features in fact it's one of the main
reasons why there are still some
blackberry enthusiasts out there now for
me switching from a virtual keyboard to
a physical one took some time to get
used to but interestingly enough I
started to love typing on it over time
everything from the tactile buttons to
keyboard shortcuts like copy and paste
worked fantastic it also has a few more
tricks up its sleeve like being able to
customize all 52 buttons to quickly
access apps or important contacts
directly from the home screen but be
mindful that it only works when you're
using BlackBerry's stock launcher now I
typically run nova launcher on every
Android device that I test and
unfortunately I wasn't able to take
advantage of those shortcuts I found
that to be a bit odd but it is what it
is the tiny space bar also acts as a
fingerprint reader and it's fast when it
comes to unlocking the device there are
also other touch enabled gestures like
scrolling through webpages or emails but
that was a bit finicky with some other
apps like Nova and Talon just to name a
few the flick typing feature does a
pretty good job predicting words so you
can flip up to register the desired word
or flick backwards to erase it if you
made a mistake and I've taken advantage
of that a lot of times during the
process of getting used to this physical
keyboard that being said I still missed
a few features from the virtual keyboard
one of them was Glide typing where I was
able to quickly draft words by simply
gliding through keys and Google was
pretty good at that and it was pretty
fast too the other one was instant
access to emojis and gifts and jebal was
pretty smart enough to implement that
within the keyboard now you could still
access emojis with the key one but it
involves a few more steps to activate
that plus it consumes half of the
already smaller 4.5 inch display I also
wished a blackberry included a dedicated
number Oh for a quick accents but that
would shrink the display even further so
it's covered that and I've also had a
few instances where I would accidentally
trigger the home button while scrolling
using the keyboard now they could fix
this by replacing the capacity of
navigating buttons with an on screen
option so a that could eliminate those
accidental triggers and be it would
actually add some more screen real
estate now be mindful that these are my
personal suggestions but I'd love to
hear your thoughts on the physical
keyboard are you sold on the whole
gesture implementation leave a comment
down below the software experience on
the key one was great
blackberry did partner with Google to
run Android OS on their smartphones and
if my memory serves me well I think the
privilege and roid with the key one
you're getting an almost close to stock
Android interface and I appreciate that
I was able to customize the UI just like
every other smartphone I've tested so
that was awesome out of the box the unit
runs on Android 7.1.1
but BlackBerry has promised the 8.0 Oreo
update very soon now there are a few
more features banked into the OS one of
them is blackberry hub essentially it's
a one-stop central hub that consolidates
your messages emails calendar events
social media notifications and phone
calls personally I didn't take advantage
of that since it isn't as robust or
feature-rich as those individual
applications but it's a nice inclusion
nonetheless and then there's bbm which
really isn't exclusive since you can
download this app on any other Android
device BlackBerry has pre-loaded the
detect privacy monitoring app which is
guaranteed to receive monthly security
updates plus it constantly monitors apps
so it alert you if an app is accessing
your camera microphone or accessing
contacts and while these might sound
similar to what Google Offers BlackBerry
has built a solid foundation on top of
the software to ensure users data won't
be compromised we actually have an
entire section on their website
discussing how they have taken some
security measures with the key one and
I'll leave a link to that in the
description performance on this device
was fantastic
the model I have in hand is the black
edition that sports the Snapdragon 625
CPU so not the higher-end
835 but in all honesty it performs just
fine for what I do like checking email
browsing the web watching YouTube videos
the normal drill multitasking was fast
and I didn't notice any slowdowns thanks
to the inclusion of four gigabytes of
RAM as for storage you have 64 gigabytes
to work with plus it can be expanded via
ready now by far my most favorite part
about the key one is its battery life
it's got a 35 milliamp hour battery so
while that might not seem as big as the
one found the pixel to excel si plus and
most definitely not even closer to the
new razor phone I was easily able to
power through a couple of days with just
a single charge how well the answer
actually lies within the design given
the smaller screen to body ratio and a
much more power efficient CPU this thing
can easily get you six and a half to
seven hours of screen on time plus it
supports quick charge 3.0 and it charges
via USB type-c my usage normally
consists of checking Twitter Instagram
messaging responding to emails catching
up in a few YouTube videos and that's
about it but that could vary from one
user to the next last but not least
let's talk about the camera and I'm just
gonna say it out right now it's amazing
and if that sounds surprising to you
especially coming from a BlackBerry
smartphone well you're in for a surprise
so the rear camera sports a 12 megapixel
sensor with an F 2.0 aperture and
interestingly enough it's the exact same
sensor found on the pixel Excel not to
be confused with the newer to excel I
turned on HDR for the best results and
left everything else in Auto and the
samples you're witnessing right now are
coming straight out of the camera
without any alterations in post all I
can say is that there's great dynamic
range details precise colors are not
super saturated but most importantly the
sensor does a really good job exposing
the highlights and it is a really good
job in low-light as well the image
processing is a tad better on the pixel
accel to be honest but the key one does
a really good job producing a cleaner
and sharp image here are a few more
samples
alright guys so the rear facing camera
can shoot 4k up to 30 frames per second
but it doesn't come with image
stabilization you can only enable image
stabilization when you're shooting in
1080p but that's about it I mean the
quality looks really good I mean I like
the dynamic range like I said it's using
the same sensor as the one found in the
pixel and like I said we've got great
detail here let's take a close-up shot
see how it looks I think this is a solid
camera well that was my experience using
the BlackBerry key one you see this
device isn't for everyone out there
especially for the ones who consume a
lot of media content because the 4.5
inch display is just too small for that
task but if you're still a true
blackberry loyalist rocking say
something like the Prive or even an
older device like the pearl or the bold
upgrading to the key one makes a lot
more sense in 2017 the physical keyboard
is fantastic to type with and the
built-in gestures is a smart
implementation the build quality is just
far beyond what you would expect on a
2017 flagship and when you pair that up
with androids the latest operating
system you're looking at a device that's
designed to get work done now if you're
willing to give the key one a try just
be aware that there's a lot of things to
get used to and the first one obviously
is a keyboard you're gonna have to take
some time to get used to physical
buttons and of course getting used to
that smaller display but other than that
this is just an awesome Android
smartphone in fact if you're looking for
a BlackBerry smartphone powered by
Android without a physical keyboard the
BlackBerry motion is a great alternative
albeit they just announced it recently
and it's only available in Canada I'm
hoping that they will include
availability in the u.s. at some point
later down the road but it's great that
we have these options from a company
that's kind of almost non-existent for a
lot of people out there but I'd love to
hear your thoughts on the BlackBerry key
one what do you guys think about this
device are you willing to spend five
hundred fifty dollars on something that
isn't as popular or sort of shares
similar aspects of a full-sized flagship
smartphone from Samsung or Google let me
know in the comments down below
