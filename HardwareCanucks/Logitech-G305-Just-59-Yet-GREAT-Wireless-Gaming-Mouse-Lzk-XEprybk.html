at Ebers place we're working away he's
actually working on a headset from
Logitech the G Pro this mouse is what
we're reviewing today it looks like the
Logitech G pro Mouse but it's not so
this is the g3 or five light speed
wireless and I absolutely love the shape
this is fantastic for FPS gaming I can
slide and flick and all that in csgo
with this guy no problem but now there
is no wire so is it any good no but you
gotta come lower cuz I don't think
you're you were visible just like your
body just passed through hey alrighty
but let me do my thing alright so one
thing I want to say before we start is
that large tech has moved on to
environmentally-friendly packaging so
there are no additional plastics and
stuff that comes with the mouse at
simple box the mouse is inside this
little baggie and that's it that's
awesome
I appreciate that direction but let's
jump right in this is a fantastic shape
with light body I've been using the G
Pro for a while now as my daily driver
alongside the rival 310 my two favorite
current gaming mice and this is going to
be my third so it's appropriate for all
types of grips I personally use a hybrid
grip so it's perfect for me while Ebor
has a claw grip and that works well for
him too with larger hands and if you
have smaller hands palm coverage is
usable now it is a 99 Grand Mouse with
the battery installed so it's like the
heavier than the 85 gram G Pro and if
you use a lithium double-a battery then
you're saving on some weight and you
also get an extension in battery life
with lithium batteries and despite the
centered battery it's well balanced and
I can easily switch from the G pro Mouse
to the G 305 without feeling any
handling difference now for $59 you
might notice the plastic nature of the
body the sides are slightly textured
while the top is super smooth and that's
my one the complaints I have I wish that
we have slightly more rubberized texture
like we have on the g4 or three that
feels a little bit more premium and
comfortable to hold however in terms of
the actual usability and you know this
thing will not fly out on your hands
even if you have sweaty hands now based
on the feedback from the community
they've added an additional Teflon foot
at the very bottom here because they
found out that the mouse would wear here
actually and so that's a nice way to
mitigate that issue but the glide is
smooth and the bottom surface comes down
on the Mount so if you lift a mouse a
lot like I do recovery from flicks and
other fast movement is never a concern
now removable top plate here is genius
this is where you find the low
compartment for your nano receiver this
is awesome for mobile users the only
thing is I wish that the nano receiver
had actual text of g3 or 5 to indicate
what product the receiver is for now say
what you will about gaming products but
this one has no RGB illumination
anywhere I appreciate that
no power indicator either you just have
to look at the bottom for the blue color
on the power switch now the buttons here
are different from the G Pro half the
lifespan compared to the G Pro still 10
million clicks is plenty they feel
awesome
with good actuation distance and fast
clicks from the right button for that
double zoom the scroll wheel is awesome
with defined steps and like nano click I
use that all the time and the browser
buttons travel all the way into the body
with that nice satisfying click eNOS
clickety clackety and lastly we have 5
dpi profiles with individual colors I
always leave just 2 enabled for desktop
at 800 dpi and gaming at 400 all right
so now the sensor it's their new hero
sensor it's been used on other
Lightspeed mice already its trusted it
performs fantastically well and it was
actually designed for wireless operation
as we are told it is able to turn itself
off between 1 millisecond increments to
save on power that's pretty cool which
is why you are able to squeeze 250 hours
of continuous operation that's about 10
1/2 straight days of simply using the
mouse at 1000 Hertz on a single double-a
battery and that is a huge incentive to
try on wireless if you've been skeptical
in the past where battery life is no
longer this daily concern you get 10
half days on single operation of
continuous usage so you can easily spend
that over a month time yeah so this
thing is actually pretty awesome for
games absolutely no issues with
controlling no you know spin outs and
stuff on that I like that they refine
the body easy access for the battery
nice compartment for that USB receiver
overall a fantastic little thing the
only thing is of course there is no
Bluetooth but they would have added at
least $20 if the
out of the Bluetooth module and it would
make Mouse heavier now Ebers been using
the g4 or three miles so it's also
wireless so he tried the g3 or five what
do you think of the the new one I think
it's a little bit on the smaller side
because I have big hands so it just
isn't it feels a little weird when
compared to the g4 three the other thing
is the weight so the g4 three is a
little bit on the heavier side that's
because it comes with customizable you
know weights compare it to the g5 or 305
so yeah I mean I'm like I'm organized
the g4 three is my I mean it's it's
something that I prefer when compared to
the g3 ho 3 or 5 GTA 5 see I'm the exact
opposite I prefer lighter and smaller
mice perhaps maybe because I've gotten
used to the jeep role already I do agree
with uber about the shape of the g4 or 3
it's very comfortable very ergonomic for
editing and like really long sessions
but I'm still the g pro shape type of
guy for just editing and the occasional
csgo match where you dominate now it's
for performance this is easily my
favorite wireless mouse to date I am so
happy we're in the days where battery
life weight and performance meets this
awesome affordable price point of 59
bucks this is a mouse that I can
comfortably use for csgo I aim well I
flick without any spin outs or weird
behavior and the lift off distance is
appropriately low so there's no jitter
when the mouse comes back down and so my
only two complaints would be the plastic
sides I wish we had a little bit more
texture like on the g4 3 and the
receiver to actually indicate it's for
the G 3 or 5 Mouse now the software
control is one of the best
I love the battery indicator we have
full dpi control as usual and button
assignment they don't have drivers for
Mac OS just yet but it should be
available soon alright so the g3 or five
Lightspeed is everything I want from a
wireless gaming mouse if you're
comfortable with the shape it'll be
difficult to find the better product and
we're giving it the Harbor Canucks damn
good value award alright guys so that is
it for me and the g3 or 5 let me know
what you think of the $59 price point
you know Ebro for example mentioned that
you would appreciate a rechargeable
battery inside so you can plug in the
cable and charge it but I feel like
having a battery built-in that you can
swap out
I don't know I guess their lithium
battery would definitely add more cost
and the lack of bluetooth obviously is
kind of a you know not a ideal for
mobile users but that again would add
the cost and the weight so the $59 price
point I feel is justifiable for
everything this thing encompasses
alright so make sure to check out this

for watching and we'll see you in the
next video
alrighty Bert your Rison system again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
