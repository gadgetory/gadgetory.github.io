that aims to categorize their products
for easier distinction the target
audience is a mainstream gamer as the
feature set on the prodigy products is
simplified without overly complicating
things so their philosophy is if you
already own a prodigy product chances
are you'll stick to the same line if
you're looking to expand your gear well
we'll see
this could be you every time you turn on
your PC super-chill CPU happy you
crackin x61
ye NZXT purchase discount in the
description below and so today we got a
keyboard and a mouse review the mouse is
available and wireless and wired modes
unfortunately this is not a combo
although I wish that Logitech would
somehow entice this prodigy loyalty with
a discounted bundle maybe sometime in
the future the g2 13 keyboard is a
seventeen dollar rubber dome full RGB
lighting plastic body and spill
resistance rated with only 60
milliliters of liquid at $17 I think
they've missed the pricing opportunity
since that's way too close to mechanical
keyboards that offer better typing
experience although the water resistance
feature isn't yet available on
mechanical boards so that's definitely a
positive on this one we have dedicated
media controls on the right side a
built-in wrist rest that helps with
comfort but it's not removable it's also
the same plastic material as the body
itself and that exhibits a lot of flex
and yeah it really feels like a low
budget keyboard build wise RGB lighting
is present with a few color presets but
the illumination is quite them
especially at an off angle and the white
color is also more blueish honestly
there's nothing wrong here this is what
I was expecting from a rubber dome
switch that large that compares to an MX
brown with 4 millimeters of travel
distance 50 gram of actuation force and
I was surprisingly happy with the keys
for one they're quieter when you bought
them out and that could still type
superfast regardless of their Robert own
design the rebalance is very quick and
you can still feel the softness of the
actuation that isn't as crisp as on the
mechanical keyboard lastly it has
anti-ghosting matrix which means keys
are divided into zones for anti-ghosting
and in my overall playtime I had no
issues using multiple keys with the
standard FBS layout so good stuff spill
test is next and I have a full cup of
water that is definitely more than 60
milliliters but I dumped all of it on a
keyboard spreading the water now there
are no exit ports at the bottom so you
would have to angle it and most likely
leave it upside down to dry but the good
news is the keyboard was perfectly
fine after all this water now let's move
on to the mouse the g43 it comes in
wired and wireless options with a $30
price Delta I'm so happy that Logitech
is sticking to the 3366 sensor because
optically it's fantastic so it's a
matter of shape preference for this
mouse now I've gotten accustomed to the
slimmer and shorter body of the G pro as
my daily driver but the shape of the g43
really reminds me of the Zoe EC series
the body is quite high and widens on the
right side which for my grip was okay
but I would say it's more suitable for
claw grip ergonomically it is very good
and I just needed time to readjust to
the larger shape there are rubber pieces
on each side to help with lifting the
mouse without applying too much pressure
and by the way both mice are identical
in shape the main difference is the
weight the wireless comes in at 107
grams the wired at 87 grams so there's
the 20 gram difference but both have
this new weight compartment at the
bottom that is magnetic with a 10 gram
weight included per mouse installing the
weight definitely made the mouse heavier
but without affecting the body balance I
really like the new scroll wheel design
with a thin led in the center and this
rubber surface scroll steps are a little
bit on the soft side but none are missed
which is awesome while the middle click
is too tough for me I prefer a light
middle click the primary switches are
excellent comfortable travel distance
nice contours for your fingers and the
well-placed dpi shift behind the scroll
wheel the browser buttons are quite
large with my thumb sitting below them
which is great for lifting the mouse
while perfectly in reach when I need to
use those side buttons the wireless
model comes with a 1.8 Mir cable a
weighted brick and a USB dongle this
brick portion is to extend the wireless
reach if needed and it's also great to
have on your desk for charging the mouse
although I wish it was somehow
stationary without the need for like a
mouse bungee but I still love that the
receiver is this tiny USB dongle that is
appropriately labeled to avoid confusion
and also in wireless mode we have about
20 plus hours of game time without any
nice the cable itself is pretty thick
which is due to braiding that actually
prevents any mini kinks so that's good
and the only thing that I miss here is
labeling on the USB tip to let me know
which peripheral this is so I know the
3366 sensor very well and I put a dpi to
800 and run a quick aim test and the
mouse performed excellent exactly what I
was expecting and to give you some
preference only my wrist moves when I
aim and I lift the mouse if I need to
aim beyond my wrist movement and I
prefer the wired for this reason alone
since it's much lighter but aside from
the different weights my aim on wireless
model felt identical now what's really
interesting is how Logitech promotes the
g43 and you can clearly see the
difference between that and the G pro
the 4:3 is a fantastic mouse but weirdly
it's common flashed to sell for the
mainstream with RGB lighting and the
weight and I'm sure they'll have a new
series name to attract more hardcore
gamers software-wise it is all synced up
with all of your large the gear which is
great for the keyboard you can assign
macro commands only to f1 through f12
keys then you can change the lighting
either per zone or for the whole thing
and while on the mouse it's all the
basics what button assignment up to five
dpi levels polling rate per zone
lighting that I recommend you set to OFF
on the wireless mouse and there's also a
battery tab to check available juice for
the wireless mode as well and finally
surface calibration I highly recommend
you do this for the sensor to determine
the optimal lift off distance which is
really low by the way and that's perfect
and so the prodigy mouse and keyboard
being in the same line together feels a
little bit weird to me because the
keyboard is only a K and the main
selling feature is its spill resistance
which to be frank is not good enough we
recently reviewed the Zalman keyboard
which is fully waterproof it's much
cheaper and the plunger switch offers
also a pretty excellent typing and
gaming experience regardless of it being
a non mechanical switch and I wish the G
213 was about $20 cheaper so it could
distance itself from very competitive
and excellent mechanical options
available the G 4 or 3 on the other hand
is a proper gaming mouse with nice
buttons great shape fantastic sensor and
very well priced too for wireless and
wired options that I wish was in the Pro
line since the keyboard I feel like
almost undercuts the perceived quality
of the prodigy line and that's a shame
and that is my experience with the g2 13
and the g4 3 now stay tuned because the
g2 31 man that's good thing they are all
under prodigy series because all these
model numbers are ridiculous but stay
tuned because this is their new headset
which is also part of the project series
we'll be testing that coming shortly
thanks much for watching we'll see you
