introducing the new ODB x500 all state
drives from Toshiba it offers great well
balanced speeds build with mlc nand
flash for superior endurance and is also
backed by five years advanced warranty
program learn more about the VX 500 at
OTC calm thoughts up guys this is
Dimitri and we had a special delivery in
Vegas to check out be quiet new budget
mint hour that's the pure base 600
priced at $89 currently the cheapest
case from the company now we immediately
don't require that this price bracket
may be too close to their already
established silent based series but the
revamped interior frame on the pure base
is far superior to tasks found on the
sound base 600 despite it looking quite
similar but with a solid panel instead
of a window now the focus here was
simplicity it's kind of a boring looking
case but I appreciate everything in
terms of design with easy to remove
front panel that has this brushed
plastic look with to find the quarter
inch drive base something that is
missing from many other cases and
filters ventilation strips on each side
vio is attached to the frame and not the
front panel which is great
includes dual USB three on your jacks
power reset buttons and hard drive
activity plus three speed fan controller
that is SATA powered for up to 3 fans
and we have a couple of quality pure
rings - 140 motor fans included one for
intake and one for exhaust the interior
frame actually reminds me a little bit
of the dark bass 900 but on a smaller
level with understructure airflow and
absolute triple 120 millimeter fan setup
or dual 140 millimeter fans at the front
the top panel is pretty much completely
solid aside from these tiny ventilation
looking strips that are merely for
visuals which is disappointing but below
the panel you can do triple 120 or dual
140 number of fan setups with their
respective radiative sizes now be quiet
cleverly intuited the top panel with the
frame allowing users to raise the cover
just enough for airflow to exit or enter
without the need for a dust filter if
you're exhausting air it's kind of an
all-in-one solution that I think works
really well I also like the catching
screws on both side panels and also pre
applied foam material on all the panels
that might only slightly help to reduce
the high frequency noises from your
system looking inside the mid tower form
is spacious for today's modern builds I
don't like the lack of rubber grommets
though on a $90 case or the empty
inserts for the metal drag cages that be
quiet could have easily included covers
for however the modularity elements are
present so you can move those metal
drive cages around that are attached via
thumb screws that are captive which is
great and you can also remove the five
the quarter inch drive base for extra
clearance core radiators and stuff and
there's also enough clearance between
the frame and the drug addicts
themselves to fit a 240 normal radiator
and the front behind the motherboard
tray we find two SSD caddies all black
cables and plenty of camo tops and
seriously no rubber grommets even just
for the main cut outs it's so
disappointing
and there's being only a preview video
since I haven't built a system in it I
can say that the pure base 600 is a very
basic but capable case with a smart top
panel excellent air flow options and
basic a i/o support although it's an $89
price point they might not be thinking
straight
given the enthu Pro M is a thing which
is cheaper and offers more premium
elements and then also the define s from
practical design with a window it cost
the same amount but here's to us hoping
they launch with a more competitive
price point but let us know what you
think of the pure base 600 is a 2017
release is it too late to the party stay
tuned for our full review in the near
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
