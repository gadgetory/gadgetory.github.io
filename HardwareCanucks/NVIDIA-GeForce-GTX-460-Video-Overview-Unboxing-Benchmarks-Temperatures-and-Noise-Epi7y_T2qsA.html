you today we have the fresh off the line
GTX 460 video card which is sort of the
evolution of the 480 and 470 cards that
we saw released earlier this year the
460 is a mid-range card priced at only
$199 with an entirely new core that
should solve the problem of the high
heat and high power consumption we saw
with the earlier cards so let's take a
look at the technical specs and see
what's new
just a quick side-by-side comparison
here against the other 400 series cards
what you'll see is the GTX 460 is
actually one of the faster cards when it
comes to clock speeds you have the
graphics processor and memory speeds
just under that of the GTX 480 however
where it balances that out is with the
336 processor cores and only a 256 bit
or 192 bit memory bus it's also made a
few sacrifices in other areas of the
card the other thing to the especial
note of is the TDP not to be confused
with actual power consumption but the
460 is only pushing up to 160 watts
which means this is going to run a lot
cooler and take a lot less power
all right on to the ever-popular
unboxing as you can see we have the EVGA
model of the card one thing I should
mention this isn't 768 megabyte version
there is a second 1 gigabyte model which
offers a 256-bit memory bus about it
easy little mortals stencil so opening
it up we have our EVGA 400 GPUs sticker
we have the driver CD as well as the
user manual installation guide that fun
stuff this is kind of cool EBG is
getting away from the plastic clamshell
packaging and usually recyclable
recyclable paper products which is kind
of nice of them we have the HDMI adapter
we have a sorry a DVI to VGA adapter the
molex into PCI Express the power
adapters and that is it we have the card
itself
little packaging here this is kind of
interesting it's definitely a lot
shorter and the cooler is a lot less lot
less ominous than the GTX 480 with the
heat pipes of the side it is quite a bit
shorter actually what we have with the
with the fan here a little bit of a
larger fan and there's actually sort of
a dip in the cooler if you can see it
there
into the fan so maybe that's for noise
to reduce the noise we have the we have
the dual power plugs on the back there's
not much else exciting about it we have
the dual DVI on the outputs as well as
mini HDMI and the exhaust point and we
have just the single sli bridge that's
about it let's fire it up and we'll take
a look at the benchmarks start off our
temperature testing here's our baseline
sitting about 30 to 33 degrees at idle
room temperatures sitting about 24
degrees Celsius or with at 75 degrees
Fahrenheit so what we're going to do is
run it for just over an hour through
3dmark Vantage there looping only the
GPU tests are going to see just how hot
this thing is going to get all right so
I've been looping the 3dmark Vantage
here for the past hour or so and we're
looking at a maximum GPU temperature of
just about 62 to 63 degrees alright so
for our very quick and entirely
subjective noise test we have the camera
a little less than a foot away from the
video card it's at 40% which is the idle
percentage
it actually didn't once go over 40% at
any time during the testing so here you
go we'll present a little bit of a worst
case scenario where we bump it up to 50%
here and if it's extremely warm then
we'll bump it up to 60% here
so when you hit 60 it's sort of
overtakes the noise of your CPU cooler
fan but it's nothing like the mini jet
engines that we hear with the higher end
Nvidia and ATI cards so very good on
that front and so there we have it the
quick and dirty on the GTX 460 video
card you can head over to triple WR XCOM
and get the full smorgasbord of
benchmarks but as far as this review
goes the GTX 460 looks like a pretty
kick-ass little card which you get for
under $200 is DirectX 11 support all the
extras 3d vision cuda process and image
quality improvements any card that
completely destroys its closest
competition in games all I can say is
that unless ATI manages to pull
something out of their hat in the next
few months this is probably going to be
the best gaming graphics card that we
see in this price category all year
thanks for checking out hardware
connects tech bytes guys and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
