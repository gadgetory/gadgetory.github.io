Eva here with her broken axe and this is
the 2018 LG Graham ultrabook and this is
by far the lightest 15 inch notebook
that I've ever held in my hands I mean
I'm not kidding this is a pretty
lightweight notebook and one of the
things that LG has done here is I mean
it's nothing it's nothing major I mean
they've done a few design shifts which
we'll get to shortly but they've updated
the internal hardware so this time it's
annoyingly newyorkb like our eighth
generation
use series processor and this particular
model that I have over here is specked
out it costs $2,000 so definitely it is
an expensive or premium notebook or
premium price that you're gonna be
paying for notebook like this so let's
find out how well it performs and what
it's like using the LG Graham right
after this finally an ultra slim body
keyboard with mechanical red or blue
switches designed and perfected for work
and play that the Sorel Graham XS
evolved to fit right in check it out
below ok so as always let's start with
the build quality and design so LG
hasn't made any major changes in this
department with the 2018 model the main
chassis still features the same premium
nano carbon magnesium body and while
they've claimed military grade
certification on their official website
I can't scientifically validate them but
here's the thing when you decide to pick
up the LG grand notebook the first thing
that you would notice is just how
lightweight it is and that's thanks to
the magnesium alloy construction that
they've done here the problem is that it
doesn't feel as robust or premium as
some of the other ultra books I have
taken a look at for example the HP
spectre NV 360 and the Dell XPS 13 those
notebooks are built like tanks I mean it
comes with an aluminum unibody
construction it's just it feels a lot
more solid in the hand and you can
easily toss them in your backpack and
you wouldn't have to worry about just
long-term durability
that's something that I'm it's it's not
sometimes questionable with the LG gram
because I do remember with last year's
model my screen for some reason this was
just you know throughout usage the
screen for some reason just didn't show
up I mean half of it was completely like
glitched out and the other half was it
kind of worked so I think it has to do
with obviously the way how you handle it
over time so I'd highly recommend
getting a sleeve when you decide to pick
up the gram and I'd be extra careful or
cautious when handling the grand
notebook the screen does exhibit a lot
of flex and not even going as far as I
can in terms of force with that and it's
definitely something to keep in mind I
wouldn't you know easily toss me about
better be again very cautious that's
something that I want to reiterate with
the handling part of the gram notebook
and a couple things worth mentioning is
that the previous LG logo used to be at
the top right hand side this time
they've eliminated that and replaced it
with the gram to emphasise the notebook
and it's at the center I like that the
webcam has also been shifted from the
bottom to the top so you don't have to
worry about pointing it at your nose LG
did manage to make a little bit of room
at the top bezel but realistically
you're not going to notice a huge
difference while staring at the screen
speaking of the screen the Graham
features a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS display
with minimal bezels of course so just
like the previous generation and I think
the whole bezel s approach is an
expectation and ultrabooks these days
because we saw them implement last year
with the Graham the XPS and a few of the
ultrabooks and we're slowly starting to
see them in gaming notebooks so you know
the gigabyte aro 15 X as an example MSI
just came up with a recent stealth
notebook with bezel s design so it is an
expectation and once he got restless
it's really hard to come back because
the good advantage of that is you're not
losing a lot in terms of screen
resolution you're getting the exact same
screen real estate but in a relatively
compact form factor and that's awesome
the display by itself is pretty good the
viewing angles are great and that's
expected given the IPS technology the
one thing that I did notice is that the
contrast ratio is a lot better and
balanced compared to last year's model
so the whites are not blown out and
that's a welcoming change but I did wish
of the screen could get a little
brighter as it was
little difficult to view outdoors
needless to say this is a great panel to
view content on and you can definitely
get away with some light content
creation so if you wanna use Photoshop I
think you wouldn't have a problem at all
do note that this is a touchscreen
display and there's a significant amount
of wobble while interacting with the
screen so I'd recommend staying away
from using that plus the screen is
glossy so expect a ton of finger prints
over time while handling taking a look
at the ports on the right you get a
Kensington block two USB 3.0 ports a
headphone jack and once again we see a
micro SD card reader honestly I'm not
really sure if I can comment on this
implementation because on the previous
brand review I did mention that that was
a terrible implementation in my opinion
I mean a lot of people prefer full-size
SD card readers especially if you're a
content creator most cameras these days
except full-size SD cards so not having
that full size SD card slot on an
ultrabook
is a disappointment I mean they do have
the room to implement it's it's just
that they decided to go with something
that not a lot of people use I mean let
me know the comments down below would
you have preferred a micro SD card slot
or a full-size SD card reader on the
granite notebook or just ultra books in
general love to hear your thoughts in
the comments switching over to the left
there's power in an extra USB 3.0 port a
full-sized HDMI port and a USB type-c
port which thankfully this time supports
Thunderbolt 3 so you could take
advantage of plugging in an external GPU
but I'll leave a link to date to these
video in the description down below
where he walks you through his
experience plugging in an external GPU
to the notebook and he should he
experienced some performance issues with
that so it's something that you should
look into you can also use the type C
port to charge the notebook but
unfortunately LG does not include a USB
type-c charger but whether you have to
use the dedicated port and this included
power adapter which surprisingly is
lightweight so you can easily toss this
in your backpack it's super compact
which is great but it would have been a
lot nicer to include a Type C charger I
should also mention that the 14 inch
version of the gran notebook does not
support Thunderbolt 3 but rather it uses
C it supports the USB 3.0 protocol so
that's something to keep in mind
oh and LG gets bonus points for
including a USB type-c 2 rj45 LAN port
adapter so I'm sure that will come in
handy during travel the grand 15
features a
sighs keyboard including a numpad which
could be useful if you work with a lot
of numbers and the key is exited good
tactile feedback with pretty good amount
of travel distance so typing in general
was a pleasant experience I will say
however that the keys found on the HP
Spectre x-360 are a little bit better in
terms of tech Tillet II but that's just
a personal thing the power button also
acts as a fingerprint reader and it's a
nice and subtle implementation quick and
easy to unlock the device so that's a
nice feature
they also made the keyboard backlit with
two-step brightness adjustments similar
to last year's model the trackpad has
also improved a lot compared to last
year because LG made the right choice to
go with Windows precision drivers over
those crappy elon and synaptic drivers
so you'll get the best experience with
gesture control and the surface is
really smooth for finger navigation the
primary left and right buttons are
integrated at the bottom they are a
little bit on the mushy side I'm not so
quickly a fan of integrated buttons I
prefer them dedicated but that's just
again personal preference the speakers
are located at the bottom so they aren't
downwards firing if you're listening to
a lot of music that's heavily emphasis
on vocals you're not going to be getting
the best experience because as soon as
you plays it on your desk the vocals
just completely just gets muffled down
you're going to be listening to a lot of
bass I think the bass will sort of
overpower that I wish they implemented
some sort of front-facing speakers so
that it's more directional so you can
actually get a good experience out of it
but needless to say they're pretty good
it's just not as good as something like
the HP Spectre x-360 because the
speakers on those were incredible
alright so let's get into the internals
of this notebook so as I mentioned the
beginning of this video this particular
laptop is loaded with specs I mean it's
a $2,000 notebook so it comes with a
core i7 85 fifty-year quad core
processor it comes to the base clock of
1.8 gigahertz with a boost up to 4
gigahertz it comes with 16 gigabytes of
RAM clocked at 2400 megahertz in terms
of storage this now becomes a to 512
gigabytes SATA based end up to SSDs for
a total of 1 terabytes and that's an
interesting choice because most ultra
books specifically the competition they
offer nvme solutions so if you're
looking for the fastest read and write
performance that's something that you
should look into because this as you can
see the read and writes needs average
between 450 to 550 megabytes per second
which is in terrible by the way because
from my day-to-day users just browsing
the web
opening up applications it was speedy
and I didn't have any problems on that
department but if you are looking for
the fastest reading read performance
this notebook isn't up for you another
thing worth mentioning is that accessing
the internals of the notebook was quite
challenging and required the removal of
the adhesive rubber feet which was of no
good use after so keep note of that the
good news is that once you get in both
the SSDs and the RAM modules can be user
replaced but it isn't recommended by LG
so with all that out of the way how does
this notebook perform well just as
expected it's right on par with the rest
of the ultra books featuring the agent
item CPUs Cinebench r15 running the CPU
test yielded a little shy of 550 points
switching to OpenGL we get around 51
frames per second thanks to the decent
integrated view HD graphics real world
tests like handbrake luxe mark and GIMP
perform just as good as the XPS 13 that
I tested a while back featuring an 8th
gen course and CPU remember guys these
quad-core hyper-threaded processors are
nothing short of amazing they're an
excellent upgrade for multitasking
scenarios now I wouldn't recommend
intense video editing on the lg gram
since the lack of a dedicated GPU
severely affects many times casual 1080p
edits are ok but I decided to stretch
the CPUs performance anyways by
rendering a one-minute 4k video and as
you can see the system took a little
over 12 minutes to complete the task
definitely way over that one-to-one
ratio
what about gaming well remember this is
an ultrabook after all so I would keep
your expectations low because the
integrated UHT graphics is not that
great overwatch set to 1080p at low
dished out roughly 60 frames per second
which is pretty comfortable but if you
throw in demanding titles like
battlefield 1 or 49 you're not gonna
expect those exact same frame rates at
that resolution the thermal performance
on the grand notebook was a little
disappointing
so during my Ida 64 stress a few tests
and noticed that the CPU temperatures
were hitting as far as anyone seen but
the experience throttling so clock
speeds we're hitting as far as 2
gigahertz which shouldn't be the case
because they turbo spec on this
particular CPU should reach as far as 2
gigahertz on all 4 cores but that was
not the case but remember this is a very
full 100% work load so if your
application takes advantage of
course if the utilization is around 85
to 90% you can definitely expect clock
speeds a little bit higher and of course
during idle tasks like browsing the web
or watching videos you can definitely
hit see those clock speeds head as far
as 4 gigahertz so definitely keep this
in mind it is unfortunate that LG
decided to go with a single fan solution
to cool both the CPU and the integrated
GPU I would have preferred a dual fan
setup just like some other notebooks but
it is what we get battery life on the LG
Chem notebook was excellent in fact I
did manage to put this up against the HP
Spectre x-360 and the XPS 13 featuring
agency B use one thing to note is that
both those laptops which are 61 our
batteries compared to sending to water
hours on the grand new book so expect
around 11 hours under light load use and
our tests involved refreshing a web page
in Chrome for 15 seconds until it
completely depleted the battery under
heavy load which involves real bench
running on a loop this notebook lasted
for around three hours so it's right on
par with the XPS and the HP notebooks
which is pretty good so definitely
expect good battery life out of the LG
cram notebook you wouldn't have any
problem taking it or just using this
notebook throughout the day and so this
brings us to the conclusion the grand 15
by LG is by far the lightest 15-inch
ultra bug that I've ever held in my head
and this is an interesting laptop
because for one we're typically used to
seeing 13 to 14 inch ultrabooks sort of
you know mop and go around the market
but a 15-inch ultrabook is definitely
interesting and if you're someone who is
looking into getting an ultrabook with a
slightly larger screen I think the 15
inch is a pretty good option but there
are a few things to keep in mind one the
build quality you have to be really
cautious while handling this because as
you can see the screen it flexes and I
can't really guarantee you the best
longevity out of this because I
personally have to test it myself and
the other thing is thermal performance
if you're planning on running
heavier tasks like for example if your
application particularly uses all four
cores at 100% load or you're definitely
going to notice CPU throttling and
that's unfortunate and the other thing
is if you decide to plug in an external
GPU and like Dee mention in this video
you're not going to be getting the best
performance out of it and obviously
that's due to the thermal limitation on
the positive side they've improved the
trackpad the keyboard is nice and
tactile I wish that the display was a
little brighter but it's still great
it's an IPS panel viewing angles are
great but you know for $2,000 I was
expecting a little bit more that's just
my personal opinion because I wouldn't
spend $2,000 on a notebook like this
especially when you decide to load it up
with specs you can definitely pick up
the 14-inch Berrien for a lot cheaper
but you are sacrificing a little bit on
that because you would obviously lose
the thunderbolt support the number-3
support with the USB type-c and a few
more so I'd love to hear your thoughts
on the LG um notebook specifically this
15 inch model would you be willing to
spend $2,000 on an ultrabook
or are you much better off picking a
gaming laptop at that price point let me
know in the comments down below i'm eber
with high breaking outs thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one
