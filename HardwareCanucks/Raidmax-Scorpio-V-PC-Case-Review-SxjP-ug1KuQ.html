great technology selections and service
so out looking completely designed
concept body kid design out looking hey
guys this is Dimitri some funny
translation over there we've got another
rate max enclosure on the Ryu table this
is a Scorpio V priced at seventy five
dollars we have recently reviewed their
vampire case that proved very
disappointing with the lack of features
and just plain dysfunctional so I really
hope we don't find ourselves in the same
position with the Scorpio V and starting
with a paint job it is unfortunately
mismatched the shade is clearly
different between the plastic top and
front panels versus the steel sides and
also this typicalgamer look is not
something I prefer personally but it's
not terrible with a decent side panel
window that is revealing although it's
not tinted up top we have a large power
button and the reset or I decided a
total of four USB ports two of which are
USB three with standard audio jacks and
a speed control with two settings with
support for fans and this hub is molex
powered only without PWM support also
I'm a little surprised to find the hot
swap spot for two-and-a-half and
three-and-a-half inch drives but of
course that's much appreciated on such a
sort of value enclosure you just have to
consider the way the mechanical drive is
sticking out the front cover opens at a
little over ninety degrees that's really
flexible and feels very flimsy and
plasticky with three optical base right
behind it and then built in dust filter
on the panel itself so I'm glad at least
that's included a single 120 member fan
is present here with the option to
install a second one right above it now
notice how restrictive the front intake
is especially since the drive cage is
non modular plus the second fan area is
mainly covered by the front panel so
expect terrible cooling straight out of
the box the top dust filter is removable
and there is enough clearance for a set
of 120mm fans to be installed above the
frame which is very important there is a
cutout leading on both sides of the
model portrayed for appropriate cable
routing so that's very much appreciate
but the holes are directly in the center
so it was a very tight squeeze for our
radiator so getting rid of any push-pull
setups coming around to the back we have
eight PCI slots a 120mm exhaust fan and
the Scorpio V stands on tall case feet
with little rubber pads and at the
bottom a couple of dust filters one for
the optional intake that's removed from
the side that's a very nice
consideration and the power supply
filter removed from the rear the side
panel window is a welcome feature on
such a value enclosure again and I don't
mind the black and white combination for
the internals I'm happy to see rubber
grommets it really shows that they don't
cost much to include and the fact that
some companies decide to omit rubber
grommets on more expensive cases just
doesn't make any sense I'm talking about
the Corsair 230 T or the deep cool pan
juvey to a few other small details that
I appreciate are the rubber grommets for
the bottom optional fan and some foam
raisers for the power supply and also
the ability to install a couple of extra
fans on the drive cage wall for improved
thermals although it will reduce GPU
clearance from just over 12 inches
without the fan to about 11 inches with
one now we've really gotten used to
modular drive gauge design and being
able to clear up some room for better
front intake which would have been very
nice here as otherwise we have some
storage overkill with eight Drive
caddies with Tula's mechanical mount and
centered SSD mount behind the
motherboard tray you notice the colored
cables now even for this price I think
it's fair to expect companies to include
all black cables for a cleaner looking
system they're also not that many cable
tie points either just a few on the left
side and none in the center where I
usually like to secure my 24 pin cable
the eight pin cutout up top is well
positioned sometimes it's misplaced on
budget cases like we saw on the
commander g 41 and there's very little
spacing between the panel and the back
although this sleeve is convenient for
smaller cables so here's the completed
cable management that with a little time
can't pay off and coming inside the
building's clean and really the drive
gauge should have been modular to allow
a more drag
and less resistive front intake and
really aside from offering the basics
there isn't anything to get excited
about overall the Scorpio V combines
some useful features such as the hot
suave up top along with the fan
controller the window is nice to have
plus the chassis is fully dustproof and
on the inside the rubber grommets for
cleaning the routing and full 12 inches
for GPU clearance now on the flip side
the white color mismatch is quite
evident I would prefer all black cables
for those top connections I would have
also liked to see a less restrictive
front panel for the second fan and
offset fan holes up top for better
radiator compatibility but the most
important thing missing is modular drive
case design as otherwise front intake is
completely choked plus for those not
needing eight slots for storage all that
space is left underutilized and
therefore wasted and looking at cases in
a similar price bracket it is hard to
recommend the scorpio v as it doesn't
have that quality finish and really
lacks on cooling and storage flexibility
and would suggest you take a look at the
following cases and just explore other
options so as always thanks for watching
