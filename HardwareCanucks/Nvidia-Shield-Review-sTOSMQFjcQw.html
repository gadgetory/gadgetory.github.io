back to another her honest review so the
Nvidia shield is definitely a unique
device which is meant to show off the
integration of different technologies
from Nvidia like Tegra zone GeForce
experience and the seamless
communication between the two the shield
is not meant to replace nor compete with
consoles while providing a similar
casual gaming experience the shield is a
whole new portable solution for gamers
but at $299 this really is a novelty
item considering you require dual band
router for perfect connection and a GTX
650 or higher to enable PC streaming
because earlier graphics cards do not
have the built-in h.264 encoder specs
wise the shield houses a Tegra 4 quad
core processor with up to 1.9 gigahertz
2 gigabytes of ddr3 RAM 16 gigabytes of
built-in flash memory within 28.8 watt
hours battery and it's running pure
Android jellybean 4.2.1 the 5-inch
touchscreen is 1280 by 720 pixel display
with a PPI of around 294 so you never
see any pixels plus the viewing angles
are excellent with basically a 180
degree screen tilt to suit any holding
style there's also quite a bit
resistance on the screen so it doesn't
flop around which makes this a perfect
fit for the shield my main complaint
here is the bezel size which is quite
large and minimizes the total real
estate of the display also it's quite
easy to make out the touch grid and
brighter conditions but of course that
does not affect functionality the form
factor of the shield is something every
gamers want to be familiar with as it
resembles some sort of console
controller and the body is very
comfortable to fold but actually quite
heavy and 579 grams
ergonomically its top notch but I find
the shield quite large and nowhere near
to what we've come to expect as portable
I mean you can't fit it in the pocket
and will require a bag of some sort now
luckily Nvidia does sell the optional
carrying pouch for an extra 40 dollars
with a small pocket to house the
charging brick and the USB cable with a
cleverly placed cut out the back to
charge your shield the two joysticks at
the front are extremely smooth but not
too light either and there is some
resistance as they always return to the
middle and the rest of the buttons at
the front have a clicky feel and we've
never experienced any key gems the
trigger and bumper buttons are well
within reach and also very responsive
and never Jam so overall it's a well
designed gaming controller from the
balanced weight to how the buttons feel
to the materials used the five buttons
in the center are your controls for the
Android so adjusting the volume
revealing all your running apps back and
play button and in the center this is
your shield button which when held
reveals a few system options and when
pressed once opens up Tegra zone this is
also the only button that is illuminated
although I think all the five buttons
should be to allow flawless navigation
in darker environments all the
connections are located at the rear with
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack micro
USB mini HDMI and a micro SD card slot
for expandable storage now at the time
this review the micro SD slot
cannot be utilized to store games or
apps which is rather disappointing but
the future update will get rid of this
limitation now throughout our testing
the shield held up pretty good with
temperatures with rear exhaust that
helps to keep the shield cool although
not completely silent as fan noise was
audible the shield has an amazing pair
of stereo speakers that are not only
loud but extremely clear and non
distorted at higher volume also lowering
the lid slightly will allow bit more
directionality control now there isn't
much customization with a shield like
there are no other color options but the
top magnetic shield like cover can be
swapped for a glossy or a carbon fiber
tag which at $20 a piece is a ridiculous
price for such a useless tag
alright so finally let's talk of how the
shield handles regular Android games and
later for PC streaming so giving this as
an Android device we get a very similar
Android experience just on a different
form factor opening it up accessing
Google Play to populate the shield with
applications is easy but the issue is
recognizing which app supports shield or
controller going to the description of
each
tired app is inefficient and currently
there's no icon to indicate whether or
not a controller support is available
but this is where Tegra zone comes in
handy as the shield store is basically a
shortcut for all the supported games
that can be purchased through Google
Play and this works seamlessly and while
there's a good variety of shooters
racing and adventure games available
with excellent graphics and performance
the supported games list is quite short
and quite frankly they either get dull
quickly or are too short now luckily
these games are around 2 to 5 dollars so
you pretty much get what you pay for now
let's talk about the main selling point
of the shield and that's PC streaming it
takes upon a similar idea as the Nvidia
grid using a host PC to process and
render out a display and wirelessly
transmit the video stream to the shield
with the help of a built-in h.264
encoder on Kepler's GPU this is possible
with us today using the Asus Dark Knight
dual band router with PC connected
through the Ethernet port and the shield
through the 5 gigahertz band to avoid
any wireless interference with the 2.4
gigahertz band opening up Tegra zone it
will start searching for compatible pcs
sometimes it doesn't find it upon
initial boot but after it's connected
there are no issues and it quickly
navigates into a menu where you can
access steam and already installed
supported games launching steam you
enter big picture mode where you can
navigate into your library to view games
and other added executables I've added
premier which you can see opens up
perfectly and this opens up
possibilities for other gaming services
like origin for example to be used with
shield flawlessly tapping the screen
with two fingers while streaming will
give you the option to quit the app in
use and open up a keyboard that will
definitely come in handy for logging in
obviously because the screen size the
touch interface and the controller not
all games are going to be favorable for
the shield for example strategy games
like Company of Heroes is a complete
write-off but dirt 3 is another story
basically racing games and shooters are
blended well within the shield
environment and to write an enjoyable
experience while away from your PC
playing your favorite games now battery
life was also impressive with around 6
hours of android games and 12 plus hours
of PC streaming which is plenty enough
on one charge when it comes to input lag
the shield as long as your network isn't
honked by traffic performed almost
flawlessly even from 6 meters away with
a few walls in between there was no
noticeable lag which means gaming on the
shield is fun and it's not meant to be
competitive but instead casual gaming
experience off your PC of course PC
streaming is not without its issues but
considering it's only in beta mode we
are expecting certain things to improve
like audio channels sometimes work mixed
up suffering framerate during heavy
traffic and drop connection during
initial scan but the shield portrays a
good representation of the future of
portable game the shield is a blazingly
fast Android device with absolute
amazing pair of stereo speakers
excellent battery life and the really
nice touch interface as a gaming device
it works as ergonomics are top-notch and
despite its heavy weight you must often
have it on your lap or on some surface
the shield controller is very well built
and provides responsive navigation with
the joysticks and the more proper
experience for Android games that
support the shield also the ability to
stream your PC games into the shield
without lag and enjoy casual race match
or finish Crysis 3 level with the help
of a seamless integration of GeForce
experience Tegra zone and steam however
there are unavoidable issues with a
shield starting with a large bulky an
efficient size that could definitely see
improvement in future revisions starting
with a larger screen more sleek and
lighter body and perhaps more
customization in terms of color
now while the Android and PC gaming list
is quite short at the moment it is bound
to grow and expand the gaming potential
of the shield and in order to have the
full shield experience GTX 650 or higher
and a dual band router is a must
which add up to the overall price of the
package but it is undoubtedly a unique
demonstration of what Nvidia is capable
of it's definitely not for everyone but
we can sure appreciate the potential the
shield brings in to
portable gaming environments so given
you guys have now seen shield work and
it's hopeful promising future when you
consider gating it
