insanely innovative fantex our trusted
memory partner Corsair and NCIX
EVGA was not just showing off GPUs this
year they're also launching their new
z10 gaming keyboard with Cherry MX
switches the armrest is removable kind
of has a magnetic clips to attach the
body the looks are fine it successfully
walks the line between minimalist and
aggressive with really clean lines and
materials but most importantly it
carries that EVGA design element with
brightness controls that is actually the
same scroll wheel as found on their mice
along with the volume wheel on the right
side to keep everything consistent
within their peripherals line included
our media controls there's a game mode
to disable Windows key a built-in
display so yeah we are still unsure how
the display will function but computer
statistics will be displayed like GPU
and CPU search we're told but from what
we saw it is just a prototype though but
the contrast was really poor the
resolution is bad and from what it
seemed it lacked multicolored support
the space bar is oversized that made it
easy to press and overall we are excited
to see the finished product and get one
on our testing bench to put it through
its paces but since this is still in
production if you've got any feedback
for EVGA first gaming keyboard please
feel free to share with a comment below
so thanks for watching make sure to
check out the rest of our CES content
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
