super convenient because you don't have
to tangle it within wires and there are
so many awesome uses where Wireless
comes in very handy number two they're
becoming affordable and number three as
far as the sound quality for the
Bluetooth signal goes it is very much
satisfactory so in today's video let's
talk about whether or not Bluetooth
headphones are right for you and so we
had go stack send us a pair of they're
so drawn bluetooth headphones and be the
sponsor for this video and let's see if
we can get the sole to drop to earth
with this pair but they actually offer
plenty of decent features including aptX
bluetooth codec a crazy long 540 hours
of standby time and also passable 14
hours of playback before recharges they
are sold on Amazon for around $90 which
I would say is okay given the fantastic
packaging of this pair with a pretty
decent carry case included that is
actually compact enough for me to use it
with two cables included one 3.5
millimeter jack to use the headphones
with a cable in Wired mode and they
micro USB for charging which you plug in
at the bottom of the right ear cup and
that's also where you find a microphone
which is built-in for answering phone
calls I'm actually quite happy with the
build quality there isn't anything to
worry about when the headphones are
folded the joints are solid and they
don't give in when held in by one or the
other side they stretch very well
without anything creaking and even the
pleather stitches on the headband are of
quality the button layout on the right
ear cup is within reach for your fingers
with an LED for visual indication on the
status of the connection and also
charging the top is the power button
that functions as play pause and
answering phone calls with the multi
type of press functions built-in while
the two arrows underneath control your
volume with a single click and track
selection either forward or backward if
held in for three seconds the buttons
are cliquey and protrude just enough to
be easily found by your fingers combine
this with light plastic ear cups with
some aluminum accents on the outside and
you have yourself a very attractive pair
complemented by low profile design so
wearing them on your neck is totally
fine
with unobtrusive head movement and
putting them on you can see they don't
stick out and nothing weirdness
happening with the headband so that's
good news and comfort wise I was pleased
with an overall fit and the clamping
force thanks to the soft padded ear cups
and the double-sided padding on a
headband now the only thing that wasn't
to my liking and the ear cup is the
shape which is rectangular high twice it
is perfectly fine and covers my ear
entirely without pressing on top or the
bottom
but width wise they are a little bit too
narrow so unless you have tiny ears they
will be pressed one way or another sound
quality is next and I gotta say I'm
impressed
there's no muffled audio in here
whatsoever to the most part the detail
is preserved you get a nice bright
treble extension and the bass is
pronounced that hits all the right notes
with me at higher your volumes you get a
bit of harsh on the high end with the
treble but that can be resolved by
turning the volume down and it is less
evident if you plug the headphones in so
in Wired mode you actually get a bit
tighter bass extension to and smoother
high-end the sound stage is pretty
closed off you get the sound here you
feel it here you don't feel it you know
slightly further away from you signal
strength is very good within a 10 meter
radius from your source signal with a
few things sort of on the way signal is
perfectly fine but get outside of that
10 meter radius and now you may
experience hear crackles here and there
and some interruptions I noticed that
the volume integral adjustment on the
headphone is a little bit too big when I
want to add just a little bit of power
to my audio it seems to add too much and
also my cell phone died before these did
with full 10 hours of listening no
problem and also one thing is there is
no battery indication on the Android
software while it does show up in iOS
and also there is no NFC which is a
bummer but those are just some things
that you have to live with but as an all
encompassing package the so drop
delivered very well with good build
comfort and sound quality with nice
value-added features now we did a bit of
digging around on Amazon and we found
several identical physical pairs of
headphones for a little bit less cash so
this gives a bit of a diversity for the
consumer and other options if the black
and silver isn't to your liking or if
the saw drops are out of stock and it
really seems like Bluetooth headphones
are catching out to the quality that
surpasses our expectations I can listen
to my podcast when I'm cooking I can
listen to music when I'm filming and I
can also watch a video on my smartphone
without having to worry about any of the
wires which is so convenient and you yes
you do lose a bit of audio quality so
there is a bit of compromise but I feel
like for the wireless convenience it's
all definitely damn worth it so that
concludes this review I'm Dimitri with
hair reckon ox make sure to show that
like button some wireless love and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
