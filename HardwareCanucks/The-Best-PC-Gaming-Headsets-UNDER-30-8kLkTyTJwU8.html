gaming peripherals you guys loved our
cheapest gaming mice we could find on
Amazon you can check out that video
right over here but today we're stepping
things up for the cheapest gaming
headsets we could find let's begin so
these my friends all range from twenty
to twenty five dollars what a lovely
budget price point and I spend less than
$100 and all five of them and you can
check them out the description below if
you'd like to buy some of them but here
is my favorite gaming headset for
reference the GSP 300 and I'm curious to
see how the cheap gaming headset stack
up against something serious let's check
it out gratis so you're looking for
something with class good value
comfortably populated an ATX motherboard
are you it's all about the user
experience and great airflow who knew
your temperatures would drop that low
route the cables behind the cover
illuminate your hardware with built-in
LEDs the age 500 I is for you to
discover this one's in real life not in
your dreams say hello to the link below
the HR 100 series from NZXT
is a go all right so these are the
cheapest gaming headsets that I could
find on Amazon that were around $20 had
good reviews without me needing to
resort to overseas sellers or Aliexpress
now unlike with the cheapest mice video
that was a challenging one because none
of them had like consistent model names
throughout versus here they do so on
Amazon regardless if you're buying them
from the UK Deutschland can in the u.s.
they all have the exact same model name
but the brand may be slightly different
and because these headsets have been
rebranded a thousand times with
different company name make sure to use
our links that we provide to get the
exact headset and model number now
usually what you gain peripherals you're
guaranteed to find some fun marketing
gaming BS lingo and so three of these
headsets have the pro gaming headset
text written instead of just gaming
headset because of course they are
clearly not for amateurs the k1 has a
protein cushion and I've seen a lot of
gaming marketing you know lingo and
protein is a first for me I'm surprised
that a no BS marketing approach for the
u3 power clarity comfort all sound like
excellent terms
unlike the Saenz gaming headset ok this
is quite hilarious listen to this
softness and good air permeability
protein ear muffs multi points pressure
head beam accord with human body
engineering specification oh and
apparently has been designed
specifically for the Asian market and
the design of the heart by wire what is
the heart by wire now keep in mind all
these around $20 so don't expect much in
terms of accessories they all have a
manual and the extension cord of some
sort or a mic and a headphone splitter
and one even comes with a driver disk
and we all know what to do with those
right just throw them away now for build
quality they're only kind of a similar
boat and that the frames are completely
plastic no metal pieces anywhere but
this might actually be a good thing
since despite my severe bending test I'm
not hearing any creaking or parts simply
breaking off and that's quite surprising
the only outlier here include the saves
headset with a fragile feeling ear cups
and the unpleasant plastic on plastic
contact and the u3 headset with a
totally loose sized extension on a
microphone side that drops by its own
weight the toughest pairs are the two
blue ones that have the somewhat caught
on the frame but they all very much feel
like toys and something might crack in
the potential fall from your desk one
compared to the GSP 300 that there's
also pretty much all plastic but it
feels strong and the same can be said
for the coarser HS 50 at only 50 bucks
that has a metal frame but it is much
closer in price to the cheaper headsets
now in terms of design I would say the
best-looking pair out of the five is the
U 3 with an all matte and rubbery
texture i'd say the current gaming
brands could take some pointers you know
an all black design nothing flashy aside
from this kind of giant Fox looks like
on the side but the thesis white and not
colored and yeah I appreciate this
design unlike the glossy plastic found
on the side
and this one has like a bit of
everything red glossy plastic matte
headband with some matte red accent as
well so it's kind of all over the place
but at least it is low-profile but you
know it wouldn't be a gaming product
without some illumination so the G 2000
and the GM one shared the blue LED
illumination it actually looks kind of
cool in my opinion
on the June mm and spreads throughout
the entire ear cup while on the GM one
it only shines through the sides and
weirdly it kind of reminded me of the
proto molecule from my favorite sci-fi
show the expanse check it out if you
haven't it's awesome but it is powered
via USB while the audio is analog so if
you want to have the bling and that
visual aesthetic you have the power to
be a USB while everything else plugs in
me a 3.5 millimeter Jack's and lastly
the key one is kind of all over the
place with glossy color and transparent
elements this one actually supposed to
come with a USB version as well to light
up the transparent element with red but
this one only comes with analogue so I'm
not sure why but yeah just not a pretty
headset because of like it's just bulky
plastic for the sake of being large one
thing they all share in common is a
basic inline remote for volume control
and mic mute that they're all within the
comfortable reach with the Saints
headset taken the tactile approach with
buttons instead and the mute button for
the audio since it's the only USB
headset I'm surprised that four out of
the five pairs have a braided cable I
guess it adds this perceived value but
they're all quite thick and quite heavy
so I prefer the lighter non braided
cable on a GM one now comfort wise it's
a bit of a weak point for all these
headsets either because the ear cushions
are not deep enough or the frame itself
is not appropriately structured to
create a good seal the good thing is
that none of them are super tight and
being plastic also helps with the
lightweight nature I wouldn't wear them
for hours and hours and hours but having
them for like a gaming session for
standard use is absolutely fine
the saint's headset is the most
comfortable with good pressure and seal
they can even rest on your neck without
poking you in weird ways the G mm is
kind of your average fit but I can feel
the drivers inside and the ear cups have
no motion so they're slightly open at
the bottom not creating the best
but they are also fine for your neck the
be excellent gm1 are so loose they have
almost no clamping pressure and the
plastic is pokey
when around your neck so not recommended
while the key once it's fine on my head
with good pressure around the ear cups
but the headband has these weird wings
at the back that are super uncomfortable
when the headset sits around your neck
and lastly the u3 have good clamping
force but the ear cushions are quite
thin and the headband material is pretty
harsh especially when in contact with
your skin so not pleasant
around your neck and just for reference
here's the GSP 300 with an incredible
fit and seal that is made for a human
the head and takes into account the
potential of being worn for hours
without any fatigue whatsoever while the
$50 HS 50 kind of shared the similar
nature in terms of not having too much
clamping force as the cheaper headsets
but still a lot more comfortable than
any of those combined alright so when it
comes to microphone quality this is a
$24 g mm it sounds better than some
gaming headsets like much higher in its
price points so this like impressive
clear sound definition it doesn't have
much you know a noise cancellation in
the background so if you're clicking and
clacking away in the mechanical keyboard
then you know tough luck but and also
another thing is that it is completely
non modular you can move it up but it
doesn't it cannot be moved closer to
your mouth so it's like stuck in long
position and it's not flexible but sound
wise it's really good so this is what
the key one sounds like it has slightly
more compression in the background and
the slightly less detailed pickup but
still quite good and this one is
actually slightly flexible so you can
position it closer to your mouth or it's
further away so mobility on the
microphone is better this is what the be
excellent gm1 sounds like there is more
compression going on so you do sacrifice
a bit of vocal clarity also the
microphone is pretty short and not
flexible but I mean pretty decent for 20
bucks the teammates will definitely hear
you and yeah not the worst in this
collection this is the U 3 this one
sounds the most distant like the
microphone is like really far away but
still has some clarity and the thing is
it's very stiff on its arm so
by rotating up I can just remove the
heads by itself so that is one of the
disadvantages when it comes to budget
game peripherals and lastly the sades
gaming headset this one has the most
amount of background compression so it's
a good thing but also you kind of lose
on the vocal clarity a little bit
because this is running off a USB so the
processing is done by the headset and
not by my sound card on the motherboard
and just for reference here's the GSP
399 our headset that I use as like the
benchmark for a good quality microphone
that has nice body
richness to the vocals that has good
clarity good compression in the
background without sacrificing that
vocal detail really good microphone
overall but how does the $50 HS 50 stack
up so this one actually sounds a bit
more harsh in comparison to GSP 300 and
also I would say like the G mm sounds
bit more clear and like not as nasally
so this like impressive clear sound
definition and quite frankly I'm a bit
surprised that we haven't seen better
microphones on more expensive pairs
because for 24 dollars the microphone on
the G 2000 sounds better than this guy
but let me know which one sounded best
to you in the comments below
alright so audio impressions are next
the G mm actually has good body to the
sound without sounding too tinny it does
lean towards the muddiness because of
course the bass isn't like super
controlled and tight but you can still
feel it's got a little more power in
there and the only disadvantage here
would be the lack of soundstage they
sound quite closed off and also they
don't create the best seal which is
where I think the bass could have been
improved but for $24 these have been
quite impressive
moving on to the sades gaming headset
that $23.00 this one has a fun sound
signature this one has the best bass out
of the entire five pairs because of a
better seal it resonates really nicely
inside the ear cup you can feel the
power and the treble is not harsh nice
detailed presentation but beyond 80%
volume I could hear the story and things
start to fall apart a little bit and
this is the most powerful headset out of
the bunch I would say 70% volume is
where I would leave it for maximum
because
it gets way too loud and I would say
this is the best sounding pair out of
the five pretty impressive for $23 the
be excellent gm1 is next
$20 the be excellent name is I Ronny
because it is far from it super harsh
treble dry the bass has left the
building because the seal is
non-existent because they're so loose
and just don't you know they're almost
like little tiny speakers beside the ear
that don't create anything for you this
is the headset that you would buy if you
want to prank someone totally avoid this
one moving on to the u3 these are
actually quite satisfying delivering the
best stereo imaging out of all these
five pairs so your special spatial
awareness in games is actually quite
good
the bass is quite flat with a nice
treble boost so I would say that is your
at least my preferred sound signature
for games
so the u3 not bad and lastly the k1
these are okay they deliver bright
extension so there's emphasis on treble
which is good amount of detail but you
can hear the distortions at higher
volumes which is unpleasant but these do
deliver the widest soundstage out of
five DS which is quite impressive but
with really Airy bass so those lower end
notes are just not grabbed you don't
feel any body to the sound it's quite
bright not harsh and low unless you go
to really high volumes so these are just
okay alright so my two picks from this
roundup would be these to the Saints
gaming headset because it has the best
sound quality the best bass the best
isolation and I would say they're also
the most comfortable out of the bunch
despite being kind of wonky in the build
quality and the G mm because the
microphone $24 is quite impressive
the fit is okay isolation you know it's
not it's not as good as the Saints but
it's still better than the rest and the
sound quality is actually pretty decent
too now if you were to double your
budget the $50 HS 50 is a no-brainer
these will last you longer because of
the metal construction they have a much
wider and cleaner soundstage better bass
and better fit overall the microphone is
good too and they're also low profile so
you can actually wear them outdoors and
not kind of be stuck with this like
gaming aesthetic on your head this is
for home use only of course and the
are a bit more versatile and if you're
really stepping outside of your comfort
zone the $100 of GSP 300 is a no-brainer
in that next price level because the
microphone is incredible they are super
comfortable audio characteristics are
awesome and they create an incredible
seal to the bass is excellent
so just an overall balanced headset that
you know is gaming centric but
definitely worth it for 100 bucks Wow
could this be the one this actually is
the land cool one the case with a
fantastic front panel design with a
brushed aluminum plate complimenting
airflow and the gorgeous RGB
illumination through the central cavity
we've got a Type C port at the front a
capable interior for water cooling an
airflow and a totally flush glass panel
on the side and to spice things up the
lien these trimmer cables give off
unique RGB illuminations for 24 and 8
pin cables controlled via the case
lighting or through its own controller
hub for this interesting color spill on
the interior and you can check them out
in the description below and so in
conclusion it is always fun to venture
out into the budget territory and
hopefully discover a jam or two and I
think we did with these two pairs and I
would say like all of them have their
strengths in terms of like the design
elements and microphones are actually
quite impressive for under $25 and the
only outlier here would be the be
excellent gm1 just yeah avoid this one
because it is oh I don't want to called
products garbage but this is kind of it
alright guys hope you enjoyed this one
let me know what you think of what type
of you know headset you're running and
if you're on the budget
below $25 you definitely have some
