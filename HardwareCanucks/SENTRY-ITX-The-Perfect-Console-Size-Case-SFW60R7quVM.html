case review history 20 cases has passed
through this studio in the last 12
months
that's insane but I'm so happy that this
is finally in my hands because I love
the ITX direction this is the century
from Dr Weber this has been in
development over two years and this is a
really awesome community project and I'm
super happy and honored to be involved
and obviously involve you guys as well
let's go ahead and open it up and
building it test it and talk about it so
I've never really done an unboxing of a
case before so I hope this should be
interesting
these guys are polish so I know a Polish
word nice MOV tape it means awesome and
right away some this is the PCI bracket
looks like we have a stand the whole
thing is steel so it's quite heavy Wow
so this thing is absolutely thin like
woah look at this bag that they give you
you know in Europe everybody's super
happy with the plastic bags like these
so I'm gonna keep this so this case is
only 7 liters in volume and to give you
a little bit of perspective what that
means something in relation to this ITX
tower slim form factor we have the note
2 or 2 from fractal design that is just
over 10 liters so it's a little bit
larger and then the RBZ or two from
silverstone which is 12 liters so that's
almost twice the size it's a little bit
larger than a ps4 let's say the ps4 is
like 4 and 1/2 meters but damn this is
Wow
creativity is fueled by the best
instruments it doesn't always come easy
and in the process you often realize how
important quality is the Rd 400 bio CC
gives you quality and speed with M de tu
interface the schieben and flash and a
PCI bracket making it possible to focus
on what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty
so yeah I'm not gonna lie but I'm pretty
excited about the century but its
success ultimately comes from ITX
enthusiasts who are patient of this not
yet finished product that's still
undergoing community feedback and
realistically the century won't be
available for at least none of like six
to twelve months and I'm afraid that
might diminish hungry customers the
model we have here is the most finished
yet with the inclusion of magnetized
screws refined frame bending so all
mounts align perfectly as they don't use
robots or molds but human operated
vending machines the target price for
the final case will be one hundred
ninety five dollars which is steep but
the doctor zebra guys want to satisfy a
specific niche market with a limited
number of production units so from the
economies of scale this price makes
sense and I really want to emphasize
just how thin the case is being slightly
wider than the i/o shield of the
motherboard itself and here is next to
the Intel nook or a reference GPU and it
isn't meant to house an extreme system
given the totally passive cooling design
so those looking for an elegant http C
or an ITX gaming system will sure
appreciate what you can do with this
entry let's do some more shots access
denied
review in progress Hey yes get off my
case Dimitri and the name is actually
quite fitting it even looks like a
century especially with the illuminated
power button in the center that is in
red the cool thing is my unit is number
9 which is very interesting to think
about and this is the only spot on the
entire case where any branding is
visible and I really appreciate this
minimal frame design so let's begin with
the feedback first which revolves around
getting inside the actual case and they
use hex screws for the exterior panels
that are not the most convenient to work
with busts you gotta be very careful as
the screws protrude a little bit and can
easily scratch a surface here is me
spending over 3 minutes just to open the
main side panel and then the extra top
piece that lets me put a graphics card
and I understand the nature of compact
ITX enclosures and the inevitable
compromise
is on the assembly process but man
something really should be done to
simplify this first step and so here are
all the pieces it's powder coated steel
quite heavy for so little material but
it feels incredibly solid nothing is
flexing and we've got ourselves a
mysterious situation as the first panel
arrived with a6 welding point piece
broken that can easily withstand the
weight of a monitor and more and we're
still investigating how this happened
but this uniquely highlighted why this
insertion piece matters all right so
we've received the replacement panel
it's fully intact now and when its
installed it goes like so and so the
insertion cover goes behind the GPU and
it actually serves two main purposes one
it prevents the actual metal here from
getting too hot
based on the heat from the backlight of
the GPU and two because this insertion
cover fills in that space behind the GPU
it allows less air to be accumulated
there and therefore it actually improves
performance and cooling of the GPU and
we'll talk about that later but from
these three pieces alone you might
question the high price which is fair
but remember it's not for the mass
production and that increases the cost
significantly and along with the cover
they also sent us this the bag that's
supposed to fit the century and it's go
actually quite exciting imagine going to
a LAN party people are going probably
thinking like you have a nice gaming
laptop in there but mm-hmm not today
you got the fully fledged gaming PC
inside this bag which is quite awesome
the possibility of something that is
portable in this form factor that is as
powerful to go inside the bag like that
that's pretty exciting now the bag is
optional but included accessories are
this flexible PCIe extension it
removable USB 3 hub three brackets for
drive mounts and more screws with
plastic case feet for horizontal
orientation and these hole covers if
you're sticking with a vertical mount
now in terms of the layout it is quite
similar to the RB 0 2 so we have a power
supply with the motherboard in the
bottom chamber and the GPU above in its
own compartment there are no dust
filters here and I always choose
filtration on a tiny case because
getting inside
isn't very easy to clean but the body is
still so magnetic filters are not
totally out of question and I wanted to
leave my full assembly process here as
you can see I was following the very
clear and excellent instructions manual
very good job on that dr. saber and this
build is like almost a deja vu moment
with the RV zo 2d layout the steps to
insert the hardware even the
compatibility with various hardware felt
very familiar I installed a non modular
SFX power supply that has short cables
already which is great
I used a low profile Intel CPU cooler
and stashed all the unused cables in the
pocket above the power supply without
any issues the PCI extension is flexible
and is secured between two metal pieces
and zaber made it flexible on purpose to
prevent any potential damage to the
motherboard slot from heavy cards if a
hard extension is used like we saw on
the our VCO 2 but this extension is very
well secured to the case so that doesn't
worry me at all for storage in the mid
section to SSDs can be installed it's a
fairly simple process but make sure to
wire everything underneath the SSD first
since the second SSD spills over the
motherboard area and you also have to be
mindful of the drive bracket and its
potential clearance issues with higher
CPU coolers in my case the CPU socket is
closer to the PCI line and only 37
millimeter low-profile coolers are
compatible something that the century'
configuration tool clearly indicates
which is so cool again props to doctors
neighbor for fantastic documentation if
you need more storage the dual brackets
can be used to house for more SSDs that
with the GPU under 200 millimeters will
slot in that free space as for maximum
compatible GPUs anything up to 305
millimeters or 12 inches will fit which
is pretty great but keep in mind the
extra height needed for the power cables
the GPU compartment is actually quite
open so if non blower style cards are
used the entire case will share that and
so now comes the not so fun part of
closing the side panel again took me
three minutes to do this making sure
that all screws are first aligned
properly and then making sure they're
all tight
then comes the base which is two lists
you just align and slide the mound
screws towards the front nice and easy
and the sentry looks complete it's a
very satisfying moment having to be
finished with an ITX case of this size
my next order of business was to figure
out the cooling and how well a gtx 1060
founders nation and the i5 4690k would
handle being inside the century now with
a panel off the GPU had 82 degrees
Celsius with a 18 10 megahertz both in
vertical and horizontal positions with
the broken side panel the one without
the insertion cover the GPU remained at
82 degrees Celsius down clocking to 17
34 megahertz in vertical and 1683
megahertz in horizontal positions with
the replacement panel we've had a
constant 18 10 megahertz on the core the
case standing vertically while
horizontally the clock has dropped a
little bit to 17 on 9 megahertz both
remaining in 82 degrees Celsius the CPU
got to 69 degrees Celsius at 3.9
gigahertz without throttling which is a
thumbs-up in my books which just shows
that with appropriate hardware this case
is designed for you don't really
compromise on cooling nor the
performance and the case being only 7
liters in volume
it still feels spaced sufficient to
accommodate the hardware it's designed
for and even supporting larger SFX
L power supplies but you might need to
remove the fan grille for the side panel
to close CPU coolers up to 47
millimeters in height are supported as
long as the socket itself plays nice
with the SSD bracket in the middle and
then black hex screws are included for
the USB hub on the front so everything
is uniform here I just use the silver
ones my main point of feedback would be
dust filtration it needs to be present
at least somehow integrated and the side
panel on/off process has to be minimized
and simplified but the Sentry achieves
its purpose perfectly to be a console
sized ATX case with unique character
fine cooling but as I mentioned earlier
there's being a community driven project
only those patient ITX enthusiasts are
likely to be their customers access
granted
century gaming station online but if you
need something immediate in this sort of
form factor the rv0 to or the note to or
to are your best options right now
thanks for watching we'll see you in the
