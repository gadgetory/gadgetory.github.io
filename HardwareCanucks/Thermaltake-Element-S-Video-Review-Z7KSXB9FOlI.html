Harvard next product showcase we're
gonna be looking at the thermal take
element s the latest mid tower chassis
from Thermaltake lately many of the
cases to hit the market have really
attempted to redesign the traditional
case into more of a work of art or even
a sculpture of sorts with the element s
thermaltake intends to bring the case
back to basics the look and feel of the
case really gives off a simple yet
modern design and it has the price tag
to reflect that Thermaltake also
promises that this isn't just another
boring box under the options it provides
really covers almost any use from gaming
to server looking at the dimensions it
fits well into the mid tire category
it's nine inches wide 20 inches tall and
21 inches in length the case weighs in
at a modest 22 pounds mainly due to its
solid metal construction and relatively
minimally use of plastic
the front door is about the only piece
on the element that has any color for
the most part the outside is a softer
matte black and the red trim on the
front adds just that little bit of
elegance the door opens to reveal a
covered and meshed panel and at the
bottom a single 120 millimeter fan with
an optional slot for a secondary fan for
the front ports we have the usual
there's 2 USB 1 eSATA HD audio and then
power reset activity LEDs also on the
top panel situated directly over the
motherboard is a large 230 millimeter
exhaust fan spins fairly slow at 800 rpm
so it's incredibly quiet the side panels
are nearly identical on both sides no
fancy windows no crazy designs there are
two simple air intake slots there's also
another version of the case and it adds
a second 230 millimeter fan on the
outside panel which is better suited for
those who need serious airflow jumping
to the back we have a fairly typical
layout at the top and exhaust point for
the 230 millimeter top fan as well as
another 120 millimeter exhaust fan just
below that there are two optional areas
for 60 millimeter fans for those who are
comfortable with the noise and 7
expansion slots the case has a bottom
mounted power supply and two holes for
water cooling tubes moving to the
interior a quick analysis of the edges
of the side panels and we see rubber
strips have been added around the edges
in order to reduce vibration noise a
relatively simple addition that makes a
big difference
opening it up there really isn't a speck
of any color except black anywhere on
the case our bottom mounted power supply
has its own little chamber with plenty
of room to fit most longer power
supplies and to keep wire clutter down
to a minimum
the cables can also be run underneath
the hard drive bay through a hollow
opening it's great for storing cables
there's also a bottom vent for airflow
and while it'd be difficult to see the
chamber piece actually has rounded edges
as does the rest of the case in order to
keep wires and fingers safe if necessary
the chamber piece can be easily reamed
looking at hard drive bays for such a
compact case it's nice to see so much
room there's seven three and a half inch
bays in a toolless removable tray and
the airflow design allows for excellent
harddrive cooling potential an
incredibly unique feature of the element
that you really don't see elsewhere is
that Thermaltake had the foresight to
include SSD drive bays on the removable
power supply chamber moving up to the
drive bay area you can see the
compromise that was made in order to
achieve so much hard drive space there
are only three five and a quarter inch
bays as we turn to the motherboard tray
their support for M ATX and ATX
Thermaltake has done an absolutely
top-notch job with the layout of the
area they have angled cable openings to
the tray over the areas where connectors
are most likely to attach to the
motherboard and other accessories as
well as openings to the far right four
side facing SATA connections and other
plugins and to top it all off they have
included the coveted opening for
heatsink backplates found on practically
all heavy heat sinks about the only
thing the tray is missing is the fact
that it's not removable which for some
very particular individuals is
apparently a highly valued asset and at
the top are 230 millimeter fan situated
directly over the CPU area a perfect
position for drawing out the warm air
installation wiring in the element s is
incredibly easy the construction and
design of the case allow for not only
very clean wiring but it really helps to
cut down on the time spent on
installation in the end even a novice
system builder is going to be able to
wind up with very few cables cluttering
up the middle and hindering airflow
speaking of airflow air is pulled in
through the fans on the front as well as
through the openings on the side it's
then dispersed through the fans on the
top the back and bottom of the chassis
it's a fairly typical flow design but
with the number of fans moving air
circulation and heat should not be a
problem installation of most every
component is fairly standard however for
the hard drives Thermaltake is opted for
a simple tool list design special thumb
screws are used to slide the drive into
the grooves and it locks into place with
a clip the rack itself then fits back
into the case I held in by more thumb
screws and more clips as we rotate
around you'll notice how the hard drive
bays are inset a lot for cabling up the
back of the chassis the ATX tray also
has the perfect amount of room between
it and the side panel for relatively
thick cables to be run across without
hassle and so that about wraps up the
element test product showcase we hope
