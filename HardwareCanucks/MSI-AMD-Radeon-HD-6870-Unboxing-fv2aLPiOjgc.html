hardware connects coverage of AMD's
Radeon 6800 series now make sure you
watch the full video review for more
details benchmarks and our opinion also
check out triple W Hardware Cox comm for
the even more extensive written review
let's get into it
so the 6870 that we're going to be
unboxing is from msi again all of these
specs are referenced design so it's
going to be standard no matter which
model you choose hopefully there will be
some overclocked versions in the future
though but the standard card is going to
retail for about $239 us and it includes
all of the regular features such as one
gigabyte of gddr5 the DirectX 11 this
has two mini display ports so you
actually be able to connect up to four
monitors on one card using Eyefinity as
well what you get with the MSI card is
Emma sized afterburner program which is
an overclocking program that actually
works fairly well the other thing you'll
be able to support hdmi 1.4 it has all
of the audio-visual connections such as
7.1 surround HDMI all of that good stuff
so let's actually open things up here
take a look at AMD is new sixty eight
seven but first the accessories right
the all-important accessories user guide
we have a couple of molex to PCI Express
power adapters this one includes a
crossfire connection we also have a DVI
to VGA connection and an HDMI into
DisplayPort connection and finally just
a quick intro into driver installation
how to install the card and all that
stuff from MSI you can see MSI has done
some pretty nifty little artwork here on
the fan shroud advertising there
afterburner program and the fan itself
is much like we saw with the 58 seven
series we have the what I like to call a
little mini wind turbine here and there
isn't a lot of air ventilation around
the fan shroud so air gets sucked in
through there and there's a plate
underneath that is going to cool all of
the internals including the chip and
then we get the exhaust point out there
and while we're here we have the outputs
which is dual DVI
HDMI and a couple mini DisplayPort
adapters you're going to be able to
attach up to four monitors through I
finna D on just one car that's pretty
cool we also have the crossfire
connection up there and lastly we have
the power connections here there
sideways mounted which is great if
you're running out of space but you will
need to have two of them a little more
air venting there now let's just take a
quick look at the size these things are
10.5 inches long compared to the 5870
which was a little over 11 inches so you
can see you're going to be able to leak
out a bit more room on the 68 70 and
it's likely to fit in a lot more cases
because ten point five is still an
average or large sized ATX standard so
you shouldn't have as many fitment
problems with as many cases with this
card and that is the look at MSI's 6870
video card make sure you check out the
full review for more details benchmarks
