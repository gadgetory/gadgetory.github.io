you by fantex nvidia corsair NCIX
silverstone and in win make sure to
support them for helping us bring this
great content to you
so g.skill is now in the peripherals
game they are known for their memory but
knowing their ties within the gaming
industry it was just a matter of time
until they finally release a full gaming
set of gear the two headsets on display
at computex were the SR nine ten that is
the real surround sound 7.1 design with
five drivers on each earcup and I'm sure
gaming companies love to experiment with
lighting so we see transparent pieces to
reveal the drivers inside that are
angled for proper acoustics or these
we're told and they will also be
releasing a stereo version with virtual
surround sound utilizing Dolby Pro Logic
as for the fit itself the headband is
flexible they decided to go with the one
size fits all type mount the SR nine ten
was a little heavy for me and I told
them having more resistive headband
would allow the headband to hold the
headset and not have all the pressure
being held by your ears but the earpads
are really nice and soft they were also
deep enough to not worry about hitting
drivers inside there is a retractable
microphone I love this low-profile
design and the USB dongle for the real
surround sound model that lets you
change the volume of each channel and
from my initial play with a stereo
version i love the bass response but
like with any gaming headset i'd want to
first give this a proper rundown and
also pricing we are told will be
competitive so under one hundred dollars
for the stereo version and around 150
for the real 7.1 g.skill also introduced
a mechanical keyboard the ripjaws km 780
utilizing MX cherry RGB keys and multi
lighting mode of course on the left side
there's a set of macro keys and the soft
rubberized palm rest is removable
reminds me of course their texture that
feels really good on the right side
there are all the media controls with
volume wheel and the volume meter that I
actually appreciate so you don't blast
the volume as it has audio pass through
and the back along on the USB jack I
found this clip on the side of the
keyboard really interesting it sort of
grabs your mouse cable and reroutes it
along the motherboard cable for a
totally cleaner setup and aside from the
RGB switches will also have MX Browns
and reds
but aside from that it will really come
down to pricing and maybe competitive
lighting features for the new ripjaws
keyboard to stand out within a very
saturated keyboard market right now and
lastly is the MX 780 mouse that is a mix
between a Logitech roccat and razor
incorporating these modular magnetic
bits on the side that you can replace to
change the size and the shape of the
mouse the rear portion can be raised
with an allen key and all for lighting
zones can be individually adjusted it
will use the avago 9800 sensor it is a
highly regarded sensor within the gaming
community and while we didn't have all
the modular portions of the mouse the MX
780 is certainly appealing in that way
so make sure to subscribe as we will
have full reviews of all these products
as soon as they launch so thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
