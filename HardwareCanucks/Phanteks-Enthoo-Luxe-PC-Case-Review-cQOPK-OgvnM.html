teamed up to deliver something
incredible stay tuned for more details
this video was brought to you by NCI X
great technology selections and service
all right it's very clear we're excited
to receive the interlocks and I'm
positive many of us are extremely happy
on fantex presence in the chasis market
as they have continued to dominate the
features two-dollar ratio and almost set
of benchmarks of how we view new
releases from the competition
at least from now on we've labeled the
entry Pro the chassis of the year and it
hasn't even been close to losing that
title so let's see whether or not fan
techs are kind of competing with
themselves almost the interlocks comes
in black and white with a slight price
difference surprising considering the
different color versions of the Primo
have remained the same but still at $139
for the black the logs brings a few
luxury features to the table as the core
frame and design remain identical to the
enter pro and to those with limited
budgets that's good news as the enter
pro at $100 is an outstanding choice so
what are these luxury features fantex
has incorporated well for one the
aluminum exterior panels are sandblasted
for a different look with this grainy
texture instead of sort of the brushed
aluminum that we constantly see and in
certain angles it's quite sparkly and
unlike brushed aluminum it does not
leave as visible handling marks so good
stuff the side panel remains the same
with this dual window design for the
main chamber and another revealing the
fantex logo just speaking a little bit
through that I absolutely love at the
front we get three optical base and
behind this cover that on our sample
didn't fully open but this is a
pre-production sample and everything
should be ironed out for retail there
are four USB ports audio jacks reset
button the power button is sort of
isolated up top with the
rounding illumination pretty cool and
speaking of elimination the antelopes
comes equipped with ambient multicolor
LED system that runs along each side of
the chassis both at the top and the
front panel with a very soft lighting
strip that's not too harsh and allows
you to call master locks to the internal
color scheme it is an elegant
implementation that works well and the
only critique from the build that we did
are the greens don't particularly match
the light green on the GPU and I think
full hue adjustment here might be the
solution the front panel pops open and
you can easily disconnect the
illumination wiring for convenient
workflow in two hundred millimeter fan
is included and dual 140 and 120 Miller
mounts are available for the front
intake the dust filter on the panel is
removable plus the actual aluminum piece
can be unscrewed as well and I wish
these tall standoffs as you can see were
attached to the removable piece instead
of the panel for example if you'd want
to clear up some that resistance for the
front intake you would have their option
but it doesn't look very nice at the
rear we get an exhaust fan with flexible
mounting thanks to these strips eight
PCI slots with side resin out and the m2
lock stands on large rubberized feet
with dust filters spending the entire
bottom one removal from the front and
the other from the back the top dust
filter utilizes these click to release
notches that gains you access to the top
fan configuration with a 140 mm ref and
included and support for 360 or 420
millimeter radiators fans can be
installed above the frame for extra
internal clearance or for push and pull
setups and moving on to the core
features of the frame the side panels
swivels to open so no need to line up
any notches and this makes closing the
panel that much easier especially the
rear panel would once all the cable man
with is done brilliant the internals are
fully enthusiasts ready with quality
rubber grommets and abundance of cutouts
around the tray and pre-installed
motherboard standoffs to make things
easy
also notice the power supply bracket for
compartment separation there's only one
grommet at cut out however for routing
the GPU cable but I think they could
have done a bit more with it like an
additional large cutout up top for extra
functional
it is now touched with thumb screws
instead of screws as we saw in the pro
for easier installation and removal all
the storage is hidden behind this plain
black metal piece and accessed only from
the rear the cages are modular that are
held in with thumb screws which support
four six drives in total and each caddy
utilizes wing-like design to secure the
mechanical drives to avoid flexing the
caddy
and this is these are mounted in the
center being water cooling ready the
enter locks ships with a reservoir
bracket that's mounted on the internal
wall of the cage with multiple mounting
holes for different types of reservoirs
each gage can also support the 120mm fan
although you will have to remove the
supporting beam first as it doesn't
allow clearance and this way you gain
some additional airflow and don't worry
we still have over 13 inches for GPU
clearance so you can still utilize those
fan mounts if needed the m2 locks also
ships with a pump bracket that's right
this case is super water cooling
friendly the bracket is rubberized on
both sides that can be installed on the
floor of the case and that's why I would
love to see the power supply bracket
with appropriate cutout to perhaps allow
the pump and tubing to exit while hiding
the power supply the pump bracket can
also be installed on top of the cage
platform and removing the platform we
get room for a 240 ml radiator
while still having about 200 millimetres
of clearance for your power supply very
nice fan tags coming around to the back
it's a familiar scene with Velcro cable
management strips and all the
preliminary cable routing is already
complete suite there's also a fan hub
that can be repositioned slightly below
the default location it supports six
fans you either have a full 12 volt SATA
power
or connect through a PWM connector for
speed control through your motherboard
and that is exactly how the fan controls
hubs should be implemented the bottom
portion is slightly wider to accommodate
for thicker exiting cables plus
additional cable tie mounts for easier
installation and dual SSD spot although
we only get one bracket and for this
price I would expect to but still it's a
good way to stash away your SSDs and one
thing I also really appreciate is the
included accessory box
for all the screws that puts every other
accessory box to shame seriously and so
let's check out the build the internals
are roomy cables are totally under
control compartments are separated for
hassle-free assembly and the system
looks gorgeous I love the small cutouts
right underneath the motherboard and
everything up top looks super clean as
well so it is very easy to recommend
this for the first time builders as it's
not only enjoyable but very much
rewarding as well once fully ready and
thanks to the ample space of the back
cables can be left as they are but of
course with some time that can be made
to look even more organized if you want
to place back the power supply cover you
can to hide the unit although with all
black cables this still looks stellar
and placing the window panel back on you
can see the potential for really awesome
lighting as it is quite revealing and
all in all the antelopes by the name is
just the more of a luxurious revision
with its lighting effects and
sandblasted aluminum but it still
carries all the outstanding core
features as we saw with the end to pro
such as flexible water cooling support
fully dustproof easy cable management
that cleans up very well the inclusion
of the power supply bracket for that
stealth lock pwm fan hub and totally
modular design that allows you to remove
the top panel and the hard drive plate
and optical cage for a really cool
modding potential however as we've said
in the past I feel the power supply
bracket needs to have additional cutouts
to allow airflow or cabling to pass
through if the bottom fan slots are
utilized and while I can appreciate the
custom lighting the colors here are very
specific that might not exactly color
match to the LEDs on your hardware and I
think full hue shifter is more
appropriate
everything about this damn good case
those screams quality and while I
personally think that $40.00 markup is a
little too much for lighting and
aluminum additions those who want only
the best have now gotten two choices so
you got to choose between deluxe or the
pro if you want this entire amazing
package but what do you guys think would
you choose the lock so the pro is the
$40 worth it for these additional
features LED comes down below
