Hardwick and X and today we're
investigating something that's a little
bit interesting and it involves mining
now before you start throwing away our
keyboards mice or cell phones that mean
hear me out for a second I'm completely
aware of how cryptocurrency is affected
the GPU market I mean from a gamers
perspective it's actually very difficult
to find a GPU due to demand and even if
you do you're gonna be paying quite a
penny to buy one because let's be honest
prices on GPUs these days are
ludicrously high now recently I came
across something that involves mining
with thread Ripper CPUs and that
triggered me for a second so I decided
to investigate that in depth and to my
surprise it's actually a lot more fun
than GPU mining so allow me to walk you
through my experience mining with a CPU
but first a quick message from our
sponsor so it was kind of a love at
first sight you know there's really
nothing like this exterior I love the
metallic color the tinted glass panel
the RGB fans at the front it's basically
a see-through case and who doesn't love
that your graphics card can go vertical
the top is radiator friendly and the
right side is so unique when exposed
thinks these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
aged 500 P my cooler master check it out
inscription below alright before I get
to the setup process and reveal the
results there are a few things that you
need to be aware of first and foremost
I'm completely new to this so if I miss
out on any key information please let me
know in the comments down below
secondly there are so many ways to
approach mining the first one and
obviously be by using a graphics card or
multiple GPUs if you want to increase
your hashing rein remember them higher
the hash rate the higher your payout at
the end of the day now if you want to
take things to the next level you can
actually use your smartphones to mine
I'm not kidding there is an algorithm
specifically designed to mine on your
CPUs it actually on your smartphones
because it can take advantage of the ARM
processor that's built inside your
smartphones I think the currency that it
mines is electro neum and it uses the
Kryptonite algorithm which is what we'll
be working with but not on the cell
phone on the thread Ripper processor so
I would never mind with my phone by the
way I just wouldn't because this is
no just no actually why I wanted to do
this was to see if these new algorithms
and processors could at least compete
with GPUs in some way so let's see how
that looks
remember each cryptocurrency runs off a
specific algorithm for example theorem
runs off the eat hash algorithm lit coin
runs off the script algorithm and in our
case we're gonna be mining Manero using
the Kryptonite algorithm kryptonite was
designed initially to take advantage of
the CPU resources and it requires about
two megabytes per instance meaning it
fits in the l3 cache per core on modern
processors now interestingly enough the
thread refer 1950 X and the 1920 X
feature a whopping 32 megabytes of l3
cache that means theoretically the
mining workload can be spread across 16
threads at two megabytes per thread
which is the optimal requirement for the
Kryptonite algorithm this would then
leave us with an additional 16 threads
to play around with a while mining
Manero for instance you can browse the
web watch youtube videos heck even edit
a video which is pretty awesome
setting up the software is actually
pretty straightforward all you have to
do is download the XMR stack zip file
from this github link i'll make sure to
leave this link in the description down
below next up you extract the folder and
run the XMR stack dot exe application as
admin and follow the on-screen prompts I
actually decided to take a different
approach to this by editing the config
text file that was initially generated
after executing the application because
by default this program configures the
CPU and the GPU for mining and I ran
into some issues using both so here's
what I did I opened up the config file
and a manually entered my pool address
in my case I was using nice hash and I
highly recommend using the service if
you're a new to mining next up I entered
my wallet address this is something
that's custom made and designated to
your nice hash account the pool password
by default is set to X leave it as is
and finally make sure to set the value
of use underscore nice hash to true the
last thing you want to do is rename the
XMR stack CUDA dll file to something
else if you're using an NVIDIA GPU or if
you're using an AMD card
rename the open CL file this essentially
allows the program to skip reading the
GPU and head straight into using CPU
resources for
Mining once that's done you run the
application as admin and give it a few
minutes to connect to the pool service
and you will automatically witness the
results what we're looking for here is
the hash rate so the higher the hash
rate the higher your Bitcoin payout
would be at the end of the day now to
put it in simple terms I'm basically
selling my computer's hashing power to
generate or to solve different
mathematical equations which then
creates new cryptocurrencies and in
return I get paid in bitcoins at least
that's how nice afterwards now I'm not
really sure how other pooling services
approach this but definitely put in the
time to do your own research if you
decide to use a different service as for
hardware I'll be using AMD's 1950 x16
core 32 threaded processor an Asus
Zenith Xtreme x3 9 motherboard 64
gigabytes of course there's vengence RGB
memory a GTX Titan X P and B quiets dark
power / 11 1000 180 + platinum rated PSU
I did run these tests at stock settings
meaning I haven't done any overclocking
with the CPU and the memory I'll be
comparing the results from the 1950 X to
Intel skylake X is offering a namely the
18 core I nine semia and a DX see
Extreme Edition processor and the I 970
900 X 10 core processor what's
interesting about these Intel CPUs is
the amount of l3 cache they feature take
this 18 core for example this CPU has
24.7 megabytes of l3 cache and when you
run the crypto net algorithm each core
within the 79 80 Hz CPU would start
fighting for the l3 cache bandwidth
hence resulting in a lower hash weight
when compared to the 1950 X which AMD
has graciously given at 32 megabytes of
l3 cache so the application spreads it
evenly across 16 threads and as a result
you get a much higher hash weight which
in my case was around 1,300 hashes per
second when compared to 877 on the 18
core and just for kicks here's how these
70 900 X performs now another thing to
take into account is profitability
because if you decide to get B 1950 X
just reminding you want to make sure
that you get the proper ROI at the end
of the year not to mention this includes
power consumption and how much you're
willing to pay every month or every year
just so you can make a few extra bucks
by selling the hashing power on your PC
the first thing to calculate
is the cost to run the system on a daily
basis and for that I'm gonna be using a
simple formula you take the energy and
kilowatt hours that your system draws
multiply that by the cost you pay per
kilowatt hour which gives you the cost
to run the system per day in a dollar
figure let's start with the 1950 X the
total power drop from the PC was around
180 watts while mining multiply that by
24 hours can where that two kilowatt
hours then multiply that by the cost in
my case I chose 14 cents USD per
kilowatt hour but this can vary
significantly depending on where you
live as a result we get roughly 60 cents
per day or $18 per month and here's how
much power the Intel CPUs consume I
gotta be honest though that 18 core
processor is seriously one power-hungry
CPU as it draws almost 230 watts and
that's just with 16 threads running at
full utilization honestly you're much
better off with thread Ripper if you're
serious about mining with CPUs now nice
hash does a pretty good job projecting
the payout on a daily weekly and monthly
basis I did take the payout average for
about 2 hours per CPU and the results
really do speak for themselves however I
do have to warn you that the
cryptocurrency market is highly volatile
so the Bitcoin payout can vary depending
on its market standing sometimes you
could get paid more other times you'd be
losing money depending on how large your
running costs turn out now for
demonstration purposes I'll be
calculating the profit with a designated
Bitcoin value so case 1 let's assume 1
BTC is worth 7 thousand USD and case 2
with 1 BTC worth 14,000 USD as you can
see with in 1950 X the projected payout
is roughly $70 and when you take the
difference of $18.00 for power costs I
end up with a profit at around 52
dollars per month
calculating case 2 with the 1950 X
yields us with a profit of around 120
$2.00 I did the exact same analysis for
with me Intel CPUs and just as expected
the profit doesn't seem to justify the
investment especially with the 18 core
$2,000 I nine CPU take case 1 for
instance with a Bitcoin value of 7,000
the estimated profit is around $23 per
month and the ten core I 970 900 X just
doesn't make any sense for mining case 2
rooks
reasonably favorable to both Intel CPUs
but then again you're much better off
with Indies threaded by nineteen fifty X
since it proves as efficiency for mining
and remember we're calculating these
profits based off an assigned static
value for one Bitcoin so if you're
interested in mining with your throat
upper CPU know your risks before
investing because quite frankly crypto
corrector currency market is highly
volatile it can it can crash
you never know it's totally unexpected
it's not consistent so yeah I would
definitely understand just definitely
know what you're going to invest in and
and then move on from there another
thing that I'd like to reiterate is the
fact that we're not actually mining
bitcoins because I don't think that's
quite frankly possible at this point
because it is quite difficult to do that
especially what we're doing is were
using our hashing power to my new
cryptocurrencies and the pool service
that we're using in this case nice hash
is paying us back in bitcoins now you
could use your GPU to mine
cryptocurrencies I think the most
profitable cryptocurrency to mine is Z
cash but again that's totally varying
depending on an hourly basis but there
are other alternatives another thing I
need to point out is the ROI because if
you're just planning to invest on these
high-end components just from mining
it'll definitely take you at least two
years or maybe even more to cover the
cost for the hardware initially so do
keep that in mind with that being said I
decided to compare profits to a gtx
980ti i used the nice hash calculator to
get the average BTC payout per day and
then i did the exact same case analysis
by factoring in the power costs which by
the way are significantly higher than me
it's about two per CPU so under load the
total system power drop or the 1080i was
around 290 watts and when you do the
math it really isn't that profitable
when compared to the 1950 x quick
disclaimer though these numbers for the
1080i were based off mining z cache
rather than Manero and these are just
estimates nothing exactly is consistent
and those of you who are wondering if
it's possible to use all 32 threads on a
threader per CPU to mine Manero it's
definitely possible but it's not ideal
so for instance if you do want to set
all 32 threads all you have to do is go
into the cpu dot txt file
and reassign or set the threads in
numerical order so in this case you
would do 0 to 31 to give you you know
all 32 threads and then you save the
text file and then you run the program
which then utilize all 32 threads but
the problem is that the hash rate as a
result is significantly lower than using
16 threads or even 24 threads and the
reason for this is that all 32 threads
are fighting for that l3 cache bandwidth
and in this case kryptonite uses 2
megabytes per instance which really
doesn't make any sense
to run on a 32 thread system so yeah
that's that's basically the end of it so
at the end of the day what I recommend
mining with a CPU honestly if you own a
threat river based system I think you
should probably consider it because say
for example you're starting up a
business and you're working in a studio
space you could potentially mine with
your 1950 x16 core processor while also
doing other tasks like browsing the web
doing productive things or you know
editing a video because you've got 16
threads to work with or if your primary
program utilizes all 32 threads well you
could use your system for that but then
when you leave the studio you can just
set your system to mine and then come
back the next day because normally the
after hours season or the after hour
times are a lot cheaper to run when
compared to the regular nine-to-five
hours so there are a lot of scenarios to
to use your CP for mining guys and I'd
love to hear your thoughts on this what
do you think about CPU mining is it
something that you'd be interested in
and you could actually mine with your
existing PC I mean if you have a 1920 X
or a risin 7 1700 X that's possible you
can do it but make sure but just
understand that you're not gonna be
getting the highest hash rate when
compared to the 1950 X so yeah let me
know if I missed out on any key
information once again in the comments
down below
I'm ebar with horican axe thank you so
