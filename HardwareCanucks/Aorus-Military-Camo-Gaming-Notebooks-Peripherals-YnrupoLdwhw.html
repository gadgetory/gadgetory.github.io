possible by our partner Nvidia it has
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX military themed hardware with
quality camo was only a matter of time
until this finally made its way onto
hardware and peripherals we were not
surprised to see this corner while
visiting horas and they tell us they
want to hear your feedback on this type
of direction with design so let us know
if this is something that you like with
the comment below the camo is not just
stick on vinyls or stickers but ORS uses
a method of water transfer which is kind
of a delicate procedure of dipping parts
into water that has a floating layer of
an almost adhesive design that sticks to
the surface you dip so with that the
camos have two unique properties one you
still maintain a similar surface feel so
in this case either plastic or metal
it still feels almost the same to the
touch and second because each part is
depth
individually you get a totally unique
pattern with each application so there
are talks of special edition camo
notebooks and peripherals and the camo
pattern that you will receive will not
be found anywhere else I personally like
this direction as the new coating or
this material would hide any handling
marks or blemishes over time especially
since many notebooks today feature dark
aluminum or black metals that are really
easy to just get dirty with your hands
and it also gives you a chance to own a
unique looking notebook so let us know
if this is yay or nay from your point of
view and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
