Herick nugs and it's always exciting
when Corsair releases a new obsidian I
mean this was a series that started all
for them and they are really populating
the line so I guess we can never
complain about having too much choice
right so this is the Corsair obsidian
450d a second mid tower in the line and
brings a few needed improvements with a
very attractive price of $120 now one
thing I'm very happy about is the new
protective plastic that no longer takes
ages to remove and it doesn't leave any
gunk on the front aluminum plates I'm
proving to us that they are listening to
users feedback and that is exactly what
is needed the obsidian line has always
carried that elegant and square design I
think that's going to carry forward as
the 450d looks the part of the obsidian
with a large square window cutout and
now a perforated front panel so this
case is designed with airflow in mind
the panel is easy removal has a built-in
dust filter and an aluminum plate
installed for that elegant aesthetic for
the main intake we have two 140
millimeter fans with a nice open frame
internally for resistance free air flow
and dual 120 million fans are supported
as well there are two optical drives at
the front and like with every other
obsidian there's no clean implementation
of optical installation as the frame is
wider and stealth covers are not
included so it won't look uniform
furthermore there are only two USB 3
ports I think for a case of this caliber
at least four should be included is
that's very common to see in mid towers
but perhaps on the next step City and
aeration then we have the standard audio
jacks and PR buttons up top you get a
large magnetic dust filter covering the
entire area so I'm very happy to see
triple 120 or dual 140 millimeter fan
support so radiator options up top
should complement coursers all-in-one
Hydra series very well plus the rubber
grommets to absorb fan vibrations so
that's considerate nothing unusual at
the back a 120 millimeter high airflow
exhaust fan is included there's a seven
PCI slot so ATX is the maximum
compatibility for your motherboard then
there's the bottom mounted power supply
with
large magnetic dust filter also covering
the entire bottom so I'm very happy to
see full dust proof with the 450d now
let's get inside the Smith Tower to see
how the latest obsidian stacks up as a
2014 release now one thing I want to
point out are how thin and flimsy the
side panels are it shouldn't cause any
concern over structural integrity but it
becomes difficult placing the panel's
back as one side is flush against the
case while the other isn't also the
front element of the case is plastic and
snot steel so it seems like the
compromising quality has been made to
hit that price point internals look very
open and that's something we've come to
expect with every coarser chassis an
additional 120 or 140 mm air intake fan
can be installed beside the drive cage
at the bottom there's a large gap to
allow direct airflow and also longer GPU
compatibility now drive cage supports
three drives with standard caddies so
regular tool is three and a half inch
mounting and this is these as well
you'll just have to remove one the metal
pegs on the side and that's why I prefer
centered SSD mounting holes now notice
how high the base is for the drive cage
this means the cage is on the level with
the bottom three PCI slots and given we
just have over 11 inches of GPU
clearance this internal spacing may not
favor dual graphics card configurations
or even some PCI lanes on the
motherboard I think the base should have
been shorter or at least accommodate an
additional drive caddy
luckily the drive cage is modular so you
can relocate it to the above position
that opens up an additional fan spot at
the bottom so a 240 mil irradiated is an
option without sacrificing on drive
storage but because the chassis isn't
very long there's practically no room
for your power supply with the radiator
installed limiting maximum power supply
compatibility to 150 millimeters and the
little extra wood just a fan I think
this is a huge oversight from courser I
definitely was not expecting such a
major compromise for the bottom mounting
options and a simple power supply
bracket extender at the back would have
allowed compatibility for longer units
without compromising on potential for
that additional bond rate however the
front does support 240 and 280 million
radiators with appropriate spacing but
this means getting rid of the entire
drive cage completely however the 450 D
is equipped with a couple of tooless SSD
brackets at the back so not totally left
without storage so you just like the SSD
in and in case you're using very slim
Drive removing the bracket is very
simple with just a single screw and the
appropriate carrots are available on the
SSD bracket to secure the actual SSD now
of course coursers major strengths has
always been cable management and the 450
d doesn't disappoint with large rubber
grommets many cable tie mounts and just
under an inch of clearance for all you
cable routing and starting with the
assembly course there is one of the few
companies that pre installs the
motherboard standoffs that simplify your
process so that's very appreciated and
the finished build looks outstanding
enforcer fashioned cable management was
so simple that I didn't even use any
cable ties yet all the cables are
completely flushed to the case the CPU
cut out is also oversized that would
allow seamless cooler swaps now I would
have appreciated a few cutouts right
underneath the motherboard for cleaning
routing but this also does the job and
the 450 D will accommodate really well
for top radiators with three inches of
space fill our memory modules now to the
most part the latest obsidian has been
successful with its underrated obsidian
good looks full dust proof with easily
removable filters a non-restrictive
front intake with great airflow
extremely simple to work in thanks to an
effective layout and the additional SSD
brackets are sort of expected and very
appreciated however the build quality is
just not on par to what we've come to
expect from the obsidian line comparing
to other cases in the same price range
like the h4 46 93 from Coolermaster the
middie r2 from fractal design and the
450 d just doesn't feel as robust bottom
radiator support is not optimal as it
limits your power supply length
there's no stealth cover included for
the optical drive and only 11 inches for
the bottom three PCI brackets due to
hyperdrive gauge that is limiting for
this form factor I do love all the
improvements however that Corsair has
added but it seems that some compromises
have been added as well that I'm hoping
would be fixed in the next generation
and the simple solution to make this a
top-level contender is basically an
extended power supply bracket that would
allow at least 160 memory units
supported with a 240 millimeter bottom
radiator but what do you guys think of
this new obsidian at the hundred twenty
dollars when you look past the
compromises or with the 450 not hit the
right spot for you let us know in the
