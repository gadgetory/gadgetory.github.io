possible by our partner nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to corsair
phanteks and NCIX without them we
wouldn't be here the camera on our
smartphone is one of the most important
tools to capture and share our memories
with friends and family 2016 has just
started and companies are focusing on
improving their camera optics to better
suit our satisfaction of taking pictures
asus announced their new zenfone zoom
smartphone that features three times
optical zoom 13 megapixel camera with
optical image stabilization and laser
autofocus there's a new technology
feature called pixel master that
incorporates 10 Hoya lenses paired with
higher precision motors arranged in such
a way to maximize the amount of light
coming through the glass which in turn
increases that clarity in pictures some
other features include dual LED real
tone flash along with shutter button on
the side frame for quick capture the
phone houses a 5.5 inch 1080p IPS
display and is powered by an Intel Atom
quad-core CPU with 4 gigabytes of RAM
and 64 gigabytes of storage all at that
four hundred dollar price point video
editors on the go well good news for you
asus has announced a new portable 15.6
inch IPS monitor that Brock's a 1920 x
1080 resolution matte display this is an
excellent choice if you want to add that
extra real estate if you're working from
a laptop plus the whole unit is powered
by USB see that has the proper bandwidth
to drive those pixels it's also very
thin and light to carry around and the
build quality feels solid so carrying
around shouldn't be a problem thank you
