great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Harbor
Canucks and we recently got to play
around with Dells next high-end ten the
half inch tablet the Dell Venue 10 7000
the are coming after Android and
realizing the full potential of having a
keyboard for ultra productivity is
awesome
the tablet is priced at $5.99 and add-on
about $100 for the keyboard bundle that
is a bit on the pricey side for that
keyboard now there are many elements
that help the tablet stand out starting
with the qHD o LED 2560 by 1600 P
display delivering incredibly vibrant
colors and super black blacks running
with pretty much the same specs as the
Venue 8 7000 the quad core until atom
z3580 and 2 gigs of ram and you can
check out our Venu 8 7000 tablet review
here the bulky circular hinge houses
stereo speakers and regardless of
orientation it will always face the user
nice this helps with the handling and
portrait mode as well and surprisingly
light enough for such a bulky one-sided
tablet the hinge felt robust with a good
angle adjustment and connected keyboard
added the perfect weight balance for
that laptop mode and avoid the tablets
from tipping over
speaking of the keyboard it's incredibly
thin to complement an already portable
form factor there's a responsive touch
pad with multi-finger gestures support
and keys have satisfying bounds with
dedicated Android shortcuts a real sense
depth camera is still present in the
back no longer in the really awkward
spot but just right in the center
still with terrible picture quality but
perhaps it will command useful for
architects for measuring things or at
least this is what we've been told the
Venu 10 7000 is aimed to compete with
Chromebooks and the like for that laptop
appeal working on the cloud it is
running Android lollipop and rated at a
disappointing 7 hour battery life that I
wish was extended even further as many
ultrabooks can give us 7 plus hours of
runtime but we will be testing
everything in an upcoming review so make
sure to subscribe to be notified when
that review come
so thanks for watching and we'll see you
in the next one
