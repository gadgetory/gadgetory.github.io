conduct and niebuhr say hello so guys
it's what times it's almost 2 a.m. and
that is how competence goes at least for
editors like us our Computex trip is
brought to you by frantic schoolmaster
and Amazon so we got videos rendering
where I get water we still have those
Apple somewhere alright guys so check
out our recording equipment we got a
microphone on top of the tripod you will
just need to do some extra recording 151
which if we got it we get it
ha smooth so it is the next day we had
an amazing sleep Eber staying in quick
shower we just had our first meeting
with NVIDIA now we have a bit of a break
before our next meeting so it's perfect
time to edit some videos so we're not
behind
the first train being played Louisville
a day
all right so that's it for nine games
so now leggings open for the local
public and again a lot of busier than
previous days some got to be out here we
have some room for these locals to check
everything out plus they have Computex
there zero yeah
that was very good 50 Anthony since the
party attendance on our parts for this
year has been minimal as we tried to
design of voyages make sure we edit
everything and maintain this voice not
to say we're antisocial but a little bit
less of party goers
yes we're almost here another rainy day
but type in 101 right now is inside the
cloud alright so context is coming to a
close and we're in the closing ceremony
they were joking around that Taipei is
crying to see everyone leaving and
actually in Taiwanese culture water
represents the flow of fortune and good
luck
so that's a good way to think about it
alright so Eber how do you love them so
ever how did you enjoy the show man
it was very good I loved a lot with lots
of work Tom but I found something very
unique you thought it was from source
tone remember the DIY a USB stick yeah
that's so close so good so small but it
makes a huge difference but guys you
know how we when we doing the tour of
the hotel we were like oh my god finally
a private bathroom first time in four
years we have a private bathroom the
doors closed
there's no weird windows you know
peeking into the bathroom area we were
wrong all along
so as we proceed to the bathroom either
everybody so once you close the bathroom
it looks pretty okay right you don't see
anything through until you come to this
bathroom here so Niebuhr you can can you
see anything there we go
if that's kinda creepy which things
coming through man well yeah we did not
realize that the bathroom was actually
not completely closed not that it
matters but you know I guess it's like
we cannot get the best privacy in this
hotel rooms righty but yeah this is a
place better than what we had last night
so that's true so the majority of you
are wondering that so one for those of
you wondering the majority of our
footage was shot on the c100 because it
was such a water style camera comes with
pills and Excel ours the footage was
shot and edited on the razor blade no
but what's the smell even what'd you get
kamusta I got the MX master it's a
really good mouse actually because it
comes with a vertical scrolling so guys
the coffee that X is officially over
it was very nice time to see all of our
press friends hang out with this guy you
don't care actually you not started not
too much and there was absolutely zero
percent chance a hundred percent no
chance that one of us got sick so that
was great so to give you details on
context show itself so they had over
40,000 visitors so that's one percent
increase from last year which they say
you know I guess it's an increase anyway
but they are expanding in the
infrastructure department so they can
accommodate for more businesses more
startups that could attend a trade show
and obviously more visitors he was with
it
one cool fact about coffee tax 28%
visitors for international and it's
important because a global show so
getting that coverage globally is pretty
significant it would not be a complex
show without some swag so here's
everything we received my favorite has
to be these pineapple pastries oh my god
absolutely amazing you have to stand in
line for these are very popular but we
got them at asu's and has been has been
a very sugar high type of evenings when
we're hungry we are a Corsair hat I'm
not a hat guy but thanks guys anyway no
sticker underneath oh so no genuine am I
right look at this we got a beer cap
that smells absolutely disgusting what
the hell's course they're doing these
probably came off right from the factory
Oh God seriously have to go through a
chemical wash or something but sure
thank you so much Corsair beer mug
appreciate it it's a Lego piece it's
only a piece ages 9 plus it's a 352
piece next friendly for them they took
them two hours to assemble it so they
clearly never played with Lego before so
but one cool thing from ZOTAC is this
guy is a three-in-one charging cable so
it supports lightning use DC and
microUSB yeah it's all one cable and
it's gold what are you thinking I'm not
going to carry such a large cable with
me around if I want to charge the
devices make me give me a single cable
with an adapter this is from cool master
and their RGB because why the hell not
right am i right silverstone gave us a
USB pen I mean sure I appreciate it but
why is the box aluminum I don't
understand why it has to be so fancy and
you know I'm all about conserving the
material
I'm not going to take the box with me
just give me the pen please and when
gave us a headphone stance that is
magnetic and it says mag ear make you
hear like whoo who thought of something
to put something like this off the
packaging that's kind of stupid well
thanks I guess then we have an MSI ruler
that is based on an IO shield
I like this thank you so much but again
why does this have to be in such a large
packaging give me a small piece of paper
or something like that why do you have
to waste so much material to give this
to me
we had these little things that you can
hang inside your car inside your
apartment and they're supposed to be
traditional Taiwanese little gifts here
it's like a little pillow with a
Computex logo so I will never you'll
never see this in my house this is from
ROG and simply pull it out like this is
it even waterproof I hope so with so
much rubber around it okay maybe this is
waterproof maybe this is kind of cool
all right this is the one thing that I
do appreciate a very good quality
notebook from the DNI Awards so this is
the companies that receive all the
goodies all the good stuff they went
based on their performance and the
uniqueness of the product I'm gonna give
this to my wife and the rest you can
keep
dude you do realize that that's my bed
right now I don't want to say that I
don't appreciate all these gifts because
I do thank you so much but I do also
have to say that material is a thing and
maybe perhaps we could move into a more
environmentally friendly swag that
doesn't include so much packaging and
yeah I understand why it's there but
still I would appreciate if companies mm
or into account because a lot of press
gave them and as it's really stormy and
thunderstorm a outside I really hope
that my flight needs no time so Demetri
I appreciate the fact that you cover all
swag and stuff but this is where I'm
sleeping so I got to clean all this and
that's gonna take a while well
this is going to take awhile Eber
all right so that it time to retire my
press badge it's been another great
context that can get so much for joining
along and watching the content has been
very good interaction this year-round as
well let us know what you are which of
your favorites video from the show and
let any feedback for future shows moving
forward how do you think we did and yeah
I'm sorry I doesn't have any footage of
me coming back home just kind of playing
town I completely stuffed on the plane
and that was great we'll catch up on
sleep but now back in the office regular
programming resume shortly so make sure
to subscribe and stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
