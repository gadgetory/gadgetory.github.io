factory tour which was actually quite
cool because we get to see firsthand of
how and where the cases are made form
Lee and Lee worldwide so all the cases
are made in this Factory it's quite cool
that they pump out 20,000 cases a month
so it's quite a large volume for a
fairly small factory and you know it's a
cool thing to see where these cases are
coming from because we have received
some in the past for review but going
through the factory speaking with JP and
other representatives they are showing
us how these cases are made and
obviously this is high-grade aluminum
there's three components for the
machinery and so there's laser cutting
and they're soldiering and there's also
pressure cutting all of which should go
into production of different series of
cases so laser cutting is a lot more
expensive so it is used for some of the
higher-end cases for me and Lee and so
therefore that sort of adds up to the
cost associated with those high-end
cases as well so if for a lot of people
who are wondering it's not really just
aluminum that's expensive that's also
the process that goes into making those
cases like the competition is
outsourcing into China into a lot of
cheaper production regions so while lien
Lee is keeping the factory in Taiwan
because they want to control the
production and they also tell us that
it's helpful for quick modifications to
the cases based on the feedbacks as
you'll hear a little bit later on
JP actually does us they receive
feedback from customers from buyers and
they're able to modify the cases and
that's why we see so many revisions of
the cases because they can take those
feedback and apply that to the cases so
they would release a certain case and
get the feedback and
these an updated version in the case and
because the company because the factory
is based locally in Taiwan they are able
to do that quickly and efficiently now
also because the factory is in Taiwan
the you know the capital costs are very
high so that's obviously related to the
actual pricing of the cases so while you
know it is good quality cases I think
that being Li is still lacking and some
of the most common features that we are
seeing seeing from some of streamline
competitors from Corsair like NZXT
fractal design is really really emerging
from the clouds getting really great
cases to us and so while really produces
good quality cases I feel they are still
lagging behind trying to really reach
out to what consumers want and that's
good quality cases at budget pricing and
so lien Lee while has really good
quality aluminum cases we might still
not see competitive pricing in terms of
case to case comparison so we spoken to
JP from Lee and Lee regarding this
competition and regarding Lee needs
future progress for tackling this
competition and this is what he had to
say
so hey guys we are here at the Lee and
Lee factory here I'm with JP from PR so
we have a couple of questions for you we
feel you know Lee and Lee is that an
advantage or a disadvantage because
having you own a factory here in Taiwan
versus other companies are moving
production elsewhere they feel that's
you advantage that or what's the yeah I
think it's still a advantage of their me
to having their own factory because we
can really quickly change products I
quickly develop new products we now have
a Computex for example we are launching
12 new cases well whereas all the
manufacturers usually struggle to have
one or two new cases per season but if
you look at the each show CSE bit
Computex every time we have new cases
and we quickly play with new ideas new
concepts you will see at the show ground
there's really some new ideas coming out
and because we have the machines and you
can easily bend and make changes it
really gives a lot of flexibility and I
think that's what our user want they
really want us to play with ideas and we
can't come up with new products alright
and you were saying that you you get
feedback from consumers from Computex
from trade shows and customers the
buyers and you cannot you can take that
feedback and apply it to factory which
you want to find that quickly exactly
that's right yeah I mean you know
yourself when you work on something
usually sometimes you get stuck in your
ideas and this is really the good thing
that ya the engineers they develop their
ideas but then show it to people right
and get some feedback and then can do
the final tweaks before going on the
market and then I may be regretting that
some little improvement could have been
do you think that eventually you'll move
on to 3d printing is that is that even
in the future what do you what do you
feel about that well I think it's still
new technology and it's definitely not
working for this kind of mass production
even with the younger prices we wouldn't
be able to and also given the many other
companies NZXT fractal design cool
master Corsair they're sort of emerging
right now with with really good quality
products coming out lien Lee has
established its own image you know
producing good quality aluminum cases
and that's what the image has been built
on so what is the strategy for Lee and
Lee based on this very competitive other
companies how is Liam Lee going to push
forward given 2013 is approaching and
obviously we'll we'll see some cases in
28 Computex but what's the strategy here
for me and Lee but I think the strategy
for Leonie is to keep the market and
keep the cup in the case markets so
that's still we welcome their
competition and it's great to get
competition so it's just moving keeps up
thinking and create more ideas and try
to be on the forefront with new concepts
right okay well great
we'll we'll be seeing more cases at the
actual complex 2013 conference so we'll
give you a first-hand look of the 12
cases that are being reached this year
so 12 cases actually very excited
all-aluminum good quality so thanks JP
we'll see you guys at the the complex
the MD program yep
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
