possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX without them we wouldn't be
here
we're in Vegas baby yeah let's do this
do this what's up guys I'm Dimitri with
our Canucks and this is my friend Eber
haven't seen you in so long three months
and three months but we have reunited
here in Vegas
to cover the show CES 2016 this would be
my third show this would be your first
show he's in for quite a bit of
surprises on this one
but everybody's been asking us what we
bring and there has been a few changes
to what we've brought this time versus
what we brought for Computex for example
so here's everything that's in my bag
and here's everything that's in IRA's
back to my bag so the idea for this CES
was for us to well for me was to be able
to fit all my equipment in here without
having to worry about carrying multiple
kilograms then I don't need to on my
shoulders for the entire day because as
we were out in the day there's no
possibility of coming back to the hotel
to drop off gear to pick up new things
so this all has to go inside the
backpack that we'll be taking with us
this is the low pro pro runner 33 50w
this is the backpack that I've been
using ever since our first Computex some
four years ago we have a nice large
pocket with the laptop multiple pockets
on the inside that's all padded let me
show you the all the little things that
were left over without the gear and
basically the idea here was to pack as
little gear as possible yet produce
better results than we were able to
achieve in our previous show coverage so
gear time now about the backpack let me
show you what I brought for my camera
gear all right guys this is my little
kit so the initial idea was to bring
just one single lens the Sigma 18 to 35
F 2.8 because it's a beast in low-light
it's got a great focal range I can focus
smoothly here and everything but we are
doing a little little surprise video
more informative video with mass drop
and therefore we've teamed up with them
to pick up some extra gear that we think
would be very beneficial for our show
coverage including the Iraq and on this
is the 12 millimeter F 2.0 so it's a
very wide wide lens and
it's a native micro four-thirds mount so
it can go directly on the gh4 or any
other Micro Four Thirds camera that we
can have on the show floor plus it's
super tiny it's much lighter than
anything else in our collection and so
therefore we needed that very light
compact wide-angle lens for things where
things are crowded and we really can't
afford to have this thing stinking in
somebody's face you know so the main
camera on my side is the gh4 you guys
know about this and we have a new lens
on there the rocking on 60 mm there's
any lens with the t stop of t 2.2 really
nice focusing smooth ring d click the
aperture ring and it's slightly wider
than the Sigma but it will it is also
slightly smaller and it is also slightly
lighter so this whole system is well
three lenses but it's gonna give us the
range that we need for white stuff more
versatile things where we want to have a
little extra reach with a 35 millimeter
there and this rocking on on the gh4 is
gonna be a very beautiful all-around
sort of package for you know our CES
coverage extra batteries here I have for
you despite that Jewish for super
efficient but it's always nice to have
so for all your stuff we are recording
everything into the zoom h5 it's an
absolutely amazing little recorder
really great microphones that are built
in here and these low railings that help
to prevent accidental changes in the the
amplification which could be totally
lethal in the recording environment
we're just you know shooting stuff very
quickly and the main recording
microphone is the aeg c3 one for it's
our new microphone it's absolutely
fantastic it's got multiple recording
patterns in the back and we'll make sure
to do a more in depth video about this
microphone but it's going directly into
the h5 for recording no inter for no
other interface requires and so it's
going to give us that beautiful vocal
quality that you guys expect from our
videos even from the show floor hey also
we actually have this son Heiser
handheld microphone is very good quality
it's like a hammer and just for
interviews and stuff
it's a very nice little package for
stabilization this is something that I'm
really excited to try out this is the
pilot fly and this is also something
that we've teamed up with mass job to
deliver tools unique tools that we can
use on on a on the show floor for this
type of unique coverage so make sure to
stay tuned for those very smooth glide
shots of the of the city on of the show
floor of the the Suites and stuff right
now it's off so I'm being careful
because I want mess up any of the
gyroscopes here but we'll have to play
around with it to see make sure that we
know how to work this thing but it's
absolutely amazing and it's super
compact and light going right into our
backpack when you go on the show floor
and the last piece of from my side
there's a standard tripod here no slider
this time around we want to keep things
like and stable so this is the just a
standard head form on Frodo and Bend row
legs
carbon fiber super light stuff alright
guys so this is exactly what I bought
with my all my peers inside this nice
little backpack this is the 10 buck
roadie - it's the only backpack I was
able to find on the internet that could
fit the c100 so let's just some cool
things I like about this backpack is the
secure system where you can open the zip
from the back rather than having it
directed in the front so it's more
secure and the padding is really good
very comfortable for a longer if you're
if you're on the go there's gonna be
very important for us because the whole
day out you know you BRR you gotta keep
that back secure yeah that's true so
opening this up well you can see I have
all my gear compact and ready to go open
this padding this is obviously the
glorious c100 it's a low light monster I
love this camera so it's magic with
these Sigma 18 to 35 millimeter F 2.8
lens it's the YouTuber lens everyone
needs it or everyone calls it the you to
Berlin so it's a great lens I love using
this lens it's a really nice c100 is a
great camera you know as you guys
probably do know I already have the
battery unit I only have one battery and
the battery life is really great it's
perfect for an all-day shoot so that
should get me going has an
LED indicator to show how much better
you I have left yes I have to charge my
battery so that's the camera moving on I
have the handheld unit for the c100 so
if we were to do a live interviews all
you have to do is plug in the mic that
Dimitri has into the XLR input and pass
through the c100 and you don't have to
worry about syncing them in post which
is great it's also built really well
that's good I also bought an external
hard drive for my editing system for
scratch disk in Adobe for Adobe Premiere
Pro which is cool of course I have a
external light that I need for my just
in case because you never know how the
lighting situation is when you're in the
booth so it's better to have some
external light to light up the products
and showcase what the that's one of the
things that I have over here
that's my light that's shining a little
bit on Eber and giving him a little bit
edge light without which actually the
image would look a lot different right
so now to the editing then we've set up
this dual editing station because me and
Eber are in separate rooms good stuff we
brought in one of the desks from his
room along with his chair so that we can
be editing together so we can share
files and we can no be more in sync
instead of just sort of calling each
other and being like what are you
working on right now so Eber station is
absolutely insane you know you don't
need to build the desktop machine that
you can you need to bring with you to
CES this machine has it all this is the
eurocom sky x9 so watch out for the
review coming very soon on this machine
but check this out hardware wise is
god's gtx 980m
in sli it's got a sky like 67 cpu 6700
cpu which is a desktop cpu 32 gigabytes
of RAM 250 gig about 256 gigabytes of
nvme storage he's got a 4k IPS display
and I think this is the 17 inch right
you were 17 inches so you have beautiful
you know real estate on the machine and
it's fairly lightweight like you can fit
this thing in the backpack
sure it's gonna kill you back if you are
carrying this thing all
but for needs like this where you bring
it in and you position it as a
stationary editing machine is absolutely
perfect beautiful backlight he's using
the Corsair
what is the mousee we're showing our
ship at our do you like it great I love
it I love the soft touch coating it's
really nice
RGB looks great review on that will be
coming shortly have you done any cool
buttons here so that you can watch while
you editing you can press stuff
unfortunately I haven't got time to
program any buttons actually never be
cool idea to do something in premiere
right like after effects like programs
shortcuts in here yeah yeah but I prefer
using keyboard shortcuts um
yeah those do a great job and he's
running well this is my pair of the HD 8
DJ beautiful headphones very nice for
reference audio even though they are not
totally reference you can still pretty
much work with you know these they are
fantastic so my station now this is
another Yuriko machine the m5 pro make
sure to check out the review of that
it's a very nice I actually bought this
myself and totally decked it out I have
one terabyte devices DS in here I have
32 gigabytes of RAM the 970m from Nvidia
and the high seven processor so it's
fairly fast and it's only in 1080p but
it's my IPS display so it's beautiful
and it's very color accurate as well the
only thing is like the delay this very
flimsy looking and feels kind of like
it's gonna break if there's something
heavy presses on it but whatever it's a
very like machine and I can actually
travel with this no problem in my
backpack without any pains to follow my
mouse of choice for right now is the Zoe
FK one this is one of the best mice of
the year that was awarded because it's
driverless and I just really wanted
something that worked without having to
attempt to you know think of drivers of
stuff for my audio I'm running the aeg k
182's oh my god forgot the name
absolutely fantastic pair super
comfortable and they are reference
headphones so that I can hear exactly
what the recording or on location or
when you're doing voiceovers and now I'm
moving on to the audio stuff
this is right in the middle between two
workstations so either uber or I can use
it for voice over recordings without
sort of interrupting each other and it's
just kind of h5 as I've said with our
AQG microphone so thank you guys for
checking out our what's in our bag video
for CES 2016 in Las Vegas I hope you
guys enjoyed our editing setup
organ station setup that we little
rigged up here but we're super excited
to cover the CES once again is the Ebers
first times gonna be a lot of walking
and he has his fit smart so we can count
our steps accurately this time and
basically we're looking forward to
seeing what CES has the stock and if you
have any suggestions on what you'd love
to see covered make sure to let us know
on Twitter and have our conducts and our
first on Twitter's as well because we'll
be covering so much stuff and if there's
one particular thing that we can perhaps
focus more on we'd love to get you guys
involved in that decision process so I'm
a tree tree this is uber CES is going to
be starting in two days
so stay tuned yeah more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
