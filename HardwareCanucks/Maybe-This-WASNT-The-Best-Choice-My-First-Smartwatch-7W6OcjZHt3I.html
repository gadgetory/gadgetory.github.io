to you no but step sorry
the steel HR sport is my very first
SmartWatch I looked into getting the
Apple watch series 4 but that was a bit
too pricey and the fact that has to be
recharged every two days or so was just
a complete write-off it's not something
that I want to worry about and this
thing is supposed to last for 25 days it
sounds like I'm an easy man to satisfy
but the journey with this hybrid is one
I'm excited to share did you bring the
stuff I sure did
it's so compact this brushed aluminum
plates floating 1/2 high keycaps MX
cherry low profile which is a Type C
connection and comes in different sizes
- the cooler master SK series careful
not to missing links below so this thing
has travelled a bit with me and I'm
pretty happy that I bought one its link
description below if you are interested
also my very first watch had a massive
white fiber on the black screen so right
there and visible I had again that
replaced via Amazon while the second
watch the replacement one was stuck at
the hundred percent of battery life for
like a whole week and after a firmware
update only then start to decline so it
wasn't like smooth sailing for Withings
for the two models this is the
replacement one but it's been pretty
solid since so it connects to your
smartphone via bluetooth and catches the
time from your smartphone hassle-free
timezone switching if you travel a lot
so that's pretty awesome and the only
physical interaction you have is the
side button to see your time your heart
break distance and battery life or
select a particular workout one of my
main goals of getting watched like this
was to highlight any loopholes that the
half of my physical activity given I
spent so much time in front of the
computer editing videos and that is well
the second small face at the bottom of
the watch shows that is my daily goal
step counter I set it to 10,000 and at
the glance I can see how inactive my day
has been sometimes I go to sleep with
like 2,000 steps on the watch and that
sucks but it's also a good reminder and
realization that I need to be more
active and the fact that that reminders
on the wrist and not somewhere in the
app is a good thing it's that further
encouragement that I think many people
would appreciate you do get a star
notification on the watch once the daily
goal is hit and the game of finding the
whole overall activity is how you
get sucked into it I also wanted
something a bit more practical for
everyday wear like a low profile body
that there's 40 millimeters in size with
an elegant face and this watch meets
that requirement pretty well and it's
especially a nice departure from the
really bulky almost ankle house-arrest
g-shock watch that I used to wear and
that broke as soon as it passed the
2-year warranty period so kind of sucks
on the g-shock as for the watch face
I love the font but the red plus within
the logo is slightly mismatched
to the red tips on the hour and minute
hands the watch face does not illuminate
and darkness but you can always check
time with the press of button so that
the round screen while small is a
brilliant design that makes this a
fantastic hybrid I like the overall
design but eibar finds it a little bit
too bland so let me know if you'd wear
something like it for $199 I feel the
value is there for a beautiful watch
with a really really long list of
features so first of all the watch is
waterproof up to 50 meters you can
shower with it
you can swim with it but the top rubber
layer on the silicone default straps has
worn out in just three weeks
the replacement straps are easy to swap
with good color options available I got
the leather one to match my iPhone case
and then blue silicone one to much my
another blue case but they are quite
expensive ranging from 25 to 50 bucks
the watch is a very accurate steps
counter and since I never take it off
all of my activity is being recorded
versus like having my phone left
somewhere else and those steps are not
counted so this way everything is in the
app we have heart rate monitoring
throughout the entire day and one second
interval when the workout is enabled
it's especially useful if you're trying
to train to hit a particular heart rate
intensity during your workout the watch
also tracks your sleep with a breakdown
of light and deep sleep and even
interruptions and heart rates throughout
the night it does not detect sleep lower
than three hours so my naps are not
recorded probably a good thing to
eliminate any evidence of sleep during
working hours and let's say your day to
night cycle is shifted or switched it
does not matter as long as you sleep
more than three hours that sleep will be
recorded it can measure distance
traveled when connected to your phone's
GPS it
can send vibrations and visual alerts
for all types of apps via that circular
screen I have mine enabled to vibrate
for phone calls so when my phone is on
silent I can still feel them coming
through so I don't miss them and all my
credit-card activity goes onto my watch
which is kind of cool we'll never make a
purchase online or in-store the amount
shows up on the watch it's not very
comfortable to read fast-moving text for
let's say SMS notifications but that's
obviously an option and many many others
my only complaint would be the vibration
intensity as it's quite weak so it's
easy to miss if something is vibrating
for a phone call for example if I'm in
motion but if I'm standing still I can
sense it a little vibration and the cool
thing is you can set the watch to
vibrate as an alarm clock but I'm a deep
sleeper and it's never been able to wake
me up the screen auto brightness is very
good but at harsh sunlight it's hard to
see what's on the screen and for
workouts you can set your five favorites
that you can access on the watch and
long press to activate that workout and
during this time the screen is always on
so you can see real time heart rate
calories and any other info based on
that activity and the other part of this
experience is the health mate app which
I would say is pretty fantastic for both
Android and iOS you can see all your
daily and weekly summaries and
occasional achievements - based on the
distance covered and I review my sleep
performance every morning and it helps
to kind of remind me if there's
something going off wrong if I'm not
getting enough deep sleep or my heart
rate is too high
and so I can monitor that and be aware
of something that's happening and
potentially make changes and also
because the watch is quite small I've
never had any issues sleeping with it
it's pretty comfortable as for battery
life their claim of 25 days is actually
pretty correct with my first watch I had
24 days until 2% while the second one
because of that whole hiccup with it
being stuck at the hundred-percent for
like 10 days I'm 22 days in and I'm
still at 29 percent of battery so I'm
not sure if - it will die before it hits
zero but so far it's going strong and it
recharges very quickly by the way with
this magnetic base my next steps with
the watch is to resume my running
activities and having it doesn't force
me into anything but it's like a
subtle reminder to be more cautious
about your physical activity and
potentially in the long term bring more
balance and some concluding issues I've
had with the watch only once I've had it
when they did not record my sleep cycles
so half the night was just not present
for some reason heartbreak during my
weightlifting session was not recorded
once while all others was properly
recorded and sometimes the watch is not
connected to the app or it can't find it
but a restart of the app helps to
resolve all those issues and this is my
first ever SmartWatch so I can't really
comment on what's it's missing based on
the competition but based on my
experience with it I would say it is a
recommendation from me and so that is my
experience with a steel HR sport it has
not come off since getting the first
model so that says something and I would
love to hear your thoughts on this whole
activity tracker and it being sort of
built into this elegant chassis that
lives on your wrist I'm happy with mine
but let me know what your thoughts and
what is missing here I would love to
hear your opinion if you're into
smartwatches physical trackers and all
that stuff
I'm 3-3 thanks much for watching check
out this other relevant content and
we'll see you in the next video
stay health my friends stay healthy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
