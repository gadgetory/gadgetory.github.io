great technology selection and service
the SteelSeries Siberia line of
headphones has got to be one of the most
popular gaming audio lines on this
planet they are actively engaged within
the eSports community they know exactly
who their target audience is and I would
say they price the siberius accordingly
at $79 which is that sweet spot for
value gaming audio the Siberia 200 is
the successor to the Siberia v2 with
seven color options available we have
the alchemy gold in our hands today and
it follows in the footsteps of a very
familiar structural body with flexible
adjustable headband the low profile
tubes that carry the cable from one side
to the other and the very light and
plastic construction that feels just
okay right now is brand-new but it
really is a matter of time until
long-term effects might show up as with
common issues with the Siberia v2
headphones were the microphone issues or
one of the sides not passing audio it's
one of those things that still series
says they are improving and from what I
remember it feels practically identical
to the v2 s the ear cups have a bit of
swivel and the flexible structure will
adjust accordingly to your head now for
me the size wasn't an issue but for
individuals with wider head the clamping
force will definitely be too tight
although the SteelSeries has done a
great job with the thickness of the ear
cushions that I initially thought will
be way too thin but my ears remain
comfortable without touching the
interior drive wall and temperature was
also not an issue you know I mean
occasional air breaks are needed but to
the most part there's a beery 200
breathe a little bit I love the low
profile hidden and extendable microphone
stashed away on the left that is always
on and can be muted via the inline
remote that can also control the volume
of the headset and I find that very
convenient and it's perfect length away
from the headset the one strange part I
found during the lowest volume toe is
still hearing the audio to come
so there is no way to mute the headphone
unless it's done through your source and
this is what the microphone sounds like
the quality is absolutely atrocious I
mean it will allow you teammates to hear
you but this is by far the weakest
factor on the Siberia 200 the cable here
is not braided but it is very light and
non intrusive with separate mic and
headphone jacks at the end with a
splitter included to be used on mobile
or the combo jacks on notebooks now the
testing of this headset comes at the
perfect time
where there fall out for these that has
a fantastic sound atmosphere and for
reference I first tried them on with the
HD 800 to hear the sound stage to hear
sort of exactly all the elements all the
detail within the environment and then
put on the Siberia 200 just to see what
was missing when was the sound stage
like how was the bass responding and
just to see exactly how the detail would
also resonate within this $79 headphone
for reference versus something a bit
more expensive and I was honestly
surprised and I was satisfied with what
I heard and that is because SteelSeries
has always delivered a bright sound
signature to pickup footsteps and create
a situational awareness through a semi
wide soundstage and this headset is no
exception
just walking in fallout 4 and just
closing my eyes I can feel the sense of
scale and the decay and the blowing wind
and the distant firefights with all
complimenting warm bass that overpowers
just sometimes but in majority of
playthrough is there to emphasize the
power of a laser musket or the thud when
you come down in your power
armour
but then it was time to jump into csgo
and test my sound reflexes and again the
bright treble extension is excellent to
detect incoming footsteps with good
stereo separation letting me feel the
direction of incoming fire and that's
really all I'd ask for EM a gaming
headset the sound stage is semi wide
it's not open but that's okay it
actually preserves more audible detail
but in sacrifice over more closed audio
space so the severe 8200 manages to
deliver a satisfactory audio experience
for games
I do wish though that SteelSeries would
open up the ear cups for a wider
soundstage and I really have nothing to
complain about in the audio spectrum at
this price point
the bass is deep with occasional muffle
but as the full package this headset
pretty much has it all although they
seriously need to improve the microphone
quality and so that wraps up our view of
these Phil series Siberia 200 let us
know which gaming headset you'd like us
to review next I'm doing tree with
hurricane axe thanks so much for
watching we'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
