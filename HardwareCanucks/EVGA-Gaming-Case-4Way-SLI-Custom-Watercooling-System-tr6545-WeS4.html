possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX without them we wouldn't be
here the EVGA case was showcased at CES
this year and this one definitely stood
out there are a few cool features that
they showcased but they're clearly going
after the enthusiast market for this one
given just how big and bulky this case
is the color choice is not final just
yet
but the exterior shell we are told is
pretty much what it will be for the
final release pricing will come at $79
for the basic model and under $150 for
the full advanced Edition which will
have all the perks you see here starting
with the front panel we have a bit of an
angular intake plates that continue the
same way for the top of the case which
looks quite nice with the removable dust
filter behind the panel that opens all
the way down to reveal your intake area
with triple 120 or dual 140 milf ants
and this case would utilize an open
front intake area for best possible
airflow as hard drives and other storage
as well has dedicated spots in the
basement one of the unique elements on
this case aside from the mirror strip
for the bottom chamber is a built in fan
hub with the i/o underneath and these
large unnecessary numbers to indicate
fan speed that can be selected for
exhaust or the intake and adjust it in
20 percent increments these definitely
have to be minimized and also have an
option to turn them off as these numbers
on the side of their case just don't
look good in my opinion the back of the
case has its own chamber that you can
open to get access to the motherboard
i/o but also access dual fans here at
the back but because this chamber is
very much close to the fans will remove
air from it but I think they will not be
as effective to cool the main interior
because of this pretty large gap and all
the cabling to your motherboard will
have to pass through this relatively
small cutout on the back panel to keep
things pretty clean on the inside you're
looking at a fairly standard layout with
EA TX support rubber grommets with
appropriate cable management and plenty
of height for a comfortable radiator fit
Plus this piece on the right side will
hide your drive cages if you have any
installed behind them and this EVGA logo
that is lit up and RGB implementation
maybe in the works I really like the
showcase built they've placed here to
show the enthusiasts potential of
hardware but also EVGA has revealed
their new quick release hydro water
cooling system that allows users to add
or remove hardware to their loop making
sort of a custom water cooling a bit
more mainstream but as far as the case
goes I think this large form factor may
not be exactly what the market is
looking for right now but the exterior
shell is quite unique and very different
from what we've seen so far on the show
floor if you are going for that showcase
design then the fan controller visuals
may need to change with the addition of
full RGB lighting and definitely more
premium materials as the full plastic
exterior shell just felt quite weak and
so this is the EVGA gaming case let us
know what you think of this direction do
you like it or do you question it let us
know in the comments down below
I'm Dimitri with haruka Knox thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
