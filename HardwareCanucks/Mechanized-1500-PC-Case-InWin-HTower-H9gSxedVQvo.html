thanks to the following sponsors
show them some love for helping us get
here to Taipei so the in win H tower is
probably one of those cases on the
entire shore floor at Computex that
turned the most heads I mean look at
that thing integrating this floating
panel design with this armor look to it
this is the in wind signature chassis
for wait for it $2,500 of course let's
be realistic about the functionality of
something like this for a normal
consumer but for system showcase an
awesome mech style chassis the H tower
suits the bill there's an app that
controls the reveal of the motherboard
and this mechanized approach is
certainly unique as the three levels of
panels move away to make clearance for
the rising motherboard the sample they
had on display moved without any hiccups
and while not completely smooth I think
that's something they can iron out for
the final production and one cool thing
are these lasers positioned on each side
of the case and they shine an outline on
the surface thus creating this sort of
safety perimeter allowing you to be sure
that nothing will obstruct the
mechanized execution what they will be
doing with the final release is sensors
on the inside of the frame for safety
purposes in case your cat or dog gets
inside or the button is pressed while
you work inside the case wouldn't want
to lose any fingers also when was the
last time you needed a separate power
supply for the case alone now as for
hardware itself you have an e ATX
motherboard mount hidden s SD and HD
brackets triple fan bracket at the top
of the case and full RGB lighting that
look awesome as light leaks through all
the floating panels and there's also an
rog version with red leds and sort of
this red scheme for asus theme builds
now you may be wondering how can in win
afford to do such risky signature cases
and that's because they have the factory
in taipei it's very local so any tooling
or redesign is done in-house and so the
H Tower is one unique piece of art case
so hit that like button if you want that
in went to send us one for proper
hardware conducts treatment
