please put on headphones for the best
audio experience welcome to the ultimate
headset microphone comparison good
people I'm Demetri welcome to another
video today we're going to rely on your
ears to determine which microphone
sounds best what would you like so I'm
looking for a gaming headset with a bit
of everything but not overkill something
that folds on your neck sure how about
the light frame without excessive
clamping force yes yes you have to will
ear cushions with proper internal
padding excellent I will take the cable
and the microphone are removable
fine fine this is the one multi-platform
compatibility with virtual surround
sound dongle avail can I just take one
and the sound quality you'll be
satisfied with so the new coolermaster
MH 751 and 75 to are here to make your
gaming experience now why do people
still buy gaming headsets easy the
inclusion of a microphone is just so
convenient to sum the microphone quality
is crucial to others not so much as long
as their voice is loud and can be
audible with their teammates and then
there's the other category of people who
want to use their favorite pair of
headphones for gaming and then attach a
microphone which is basically how the
mod mic system has become so popular and
for today's comparison we have 5 very
popular wireless gaming headsets so you
can observe the vocal difference if you
have my favorite wired headsets as well
and just to establish a reference point
I have the mod like 4 and 5 that are
wired to get the full perspective on
this comparison and to make this more
interesting I'd like to read a little
excerpt from homo Deus a brief yet
fascinating history of lawns and you'd
be the judge on what microphone sounds
best to you was true of grand social
revolutions is equally true at the micro
level of everyday life a young couple
building a new home for themselves may
ask the architect for a nice lawn in
front of the art why a lawn because
lawns are beautiful the couple might
explain but why do they think so it has
a history behind it
Stone Age hunter gatherers do not
cultivate grass at the entrance of their
caves no green meadow welcomed the
visitors to the Athenian Acropolis the
Roman capital the Jewish Temple in
Jerusalem or the Forbidden City and
Beijing the idea
nurturing a lawn at the entrance to
private residences and public buildings
was born in the castles of French and
English aristocrats in the late Middle
Ages in the early modern age this habit
struck deep roots and became the
trademark of nobility well-kept lawns
demanded land and a lot of work
particularly in the days before
lawnmowers and automatic water
sprinklers in exchange they produced
nothing of value
you can't even grace animals in them
because they would eat and trample the
grass humans thereby came to identify
lawns with political power social status
and economic wealth no wonder that in
the 19th century the rising bourgeoisie
enthusiastically adopted the lawn at
first only bankers lawyers and
industrialists could afford such
luxuries and their private residences
yet when the Industrial Revolution
broadened the middle class and gave rise
to the lawnmower and then the automatic
sprinkler millions of families could
suddenly afford a home turf in American
suburbia a spic and span lawn
switched from being a rich person's
luxury into a middle-class necessity
grass is nowadays the most widespread
crop in the USA after maize and wheat
and the lawn industry plants manure
mowers sprinklers gardeners account for
billions of dollars every year having
read the short history of the lawn when
you now come to plan your dream house
you might think twice about having a
lawn in your front yard you are of
course still free to do it but you're
also free to shake off the cultural
cargo beacuse to you by the European
Dukes capitalist moguls and the Simpsons
and imagine for yourself a Japanese rock
garden or some altogether new creation
this is the best reason to learn history
not in order to predict the future but
to free yourself of the past and imagine
alternative destinies of course this is
not total freedom we cannot avoid being
shaped by the past but some freedom is
better than none thus the no cable
situation which is why I chose to read
this portion in the first place
everything you just heard was unfiltered
and I'm pretty happy with my wide
selection of microphones the asana is
pretty great with some variability in
bass and trouble but they all have nice
pickup here but the modern mic Wireless
impressive when compared to the wired
selections and totally blows everything
else when it comes to wireless headsets
just it's no competition the catch over
is the price of a hundred and nineteen
dollars the microphone alone is more
expensive than these standalone wired
headsets which is okay crazy so for 120
bucks for a microphone alone this is one
luxury add-on and so the magnetic and
easily removable clamp system means you
can attach the mod mic to any headphone
and previous iterations took into
account the modularity of the whole
assembly plus some cable management
techniques on the mod like five but this
new wireless model really changes the
game for a more convenient contraption
because look no wires only for the
headphone of course the main body is a
little chunky but very light so there's
no way tension from the microphone and
there's steel boom arm stays in position
unless intentionally bent and you can
easily mute the mic with a power button
and observe battery and connection
status via the USB receiver that matches
the LEDs on the mic itself we have 12
plus hours of battery life and a micro
USB port for charging and two microphone
modes one broadcast quality or the
omnidirectional what would you've been
listening to now and then the second
mode is unidirectional or noise
cancelling so it sounds very much in
line - you know all gaming headsets but
you can definitely tell there is a lot
more processing going on to eliminate
all that background noise and so the
convenience factor for the new mod mic
Wireless is really up here and it takes
it to the next level based on previous
iterations of the mod mic you know the
whole idea of being able to attach a
microphone to your favorite pair of
headphones is awesome but now because
it's wireless and we have multiple you
know magnetic clamps means that the
microphone is not really fixed to a
headphone because you know you can move
it from one pair to another and it's
quite modular the microphone quality of
course is pretty excellent for being
Wireless it does compete very closely to
the previous iterations for the Malte
mic v that has a little bit more base
and character a little bit less
compression but for a wireless iteration
that has no cables attached you don't
have to route it through your headphone
cable is I would say you know a nice
value add for a little compromise on the
sound quality but you let me know which
microphone sounded best to you
in the comments all right thanks so much
for watching all the headsets and
microphones will be linked in the
description below I'll be tree I'll talk
to you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
