great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dimitri with
hardware canucks and on the review table
today is an affordable all-in-one PC
from gateway that seems to fulfill the
requirement of being the right office
companion for just under $500
now the Gateway ZX 4270 does not pretend
to be what it's not it's not a gaming PC
and running anything other than
Microsoft Office tasks will sure bug the
system down as the a4 5000 APU with just
the four cores at 1.5 gigahertz and 128
Radeon cores for graphics also there's 4
gigabytes of RAM just doesn't allow
anything beyond social media and your
microsoft office use the ZX 4270 is a
nineteen point five inch display this is
not a touchscreen with just a below
average resolution of 1600 by 900 with
also an OK LD TN panel that shows
significant contrast shift throughout
the angle adjustment but with pretty
decent side-to-side viewing angles
obviously at this price range we cannot
expect an IPS display but still I would
have liked to see a 1080p image now from
a physical perspective the screen bezel
is what you would expect from this form
factor with the glossy finish and that
perforate bottom portion that houses
both the stereo speakers and a power
button with a subtle white illumination
the built in webcam and a microphone are
included this is an all-in-one after all
and collectivity wise on the left side
we get an SD card reader I would have
preferred a multi card reader instead 2
USB 3 ports in the headphone jack
Ethernet port and an AC in now there's
no built-in battery so computer must be
plugged in to be operational the power
plug is low profile it cannot be seen
from the front so that's good news and
this model also includes four additional
USB 2.0 ports at the rear for those
permanent devices and there's also
locking mechanism there as well an
optical drive is found on the right that
seems hello finicky when ejected how are
snaps solid into position now one of the
most obvious cost-saving design features
here is the built-in stand for the
all-in-one that allows only some angle
adjustments and it doesn't really lock
into position nor do we have height
adjustment the two rubber pads at the
bottom do good enough job and holding
the
in place however the plastic coating on
the stand doesn't provide any anti
slipping support furthermore you cannot
remove the stand and as you can see
there are no wall mounting options
available nor any VESA mount support
limiting in the overall placement of the
zkx it does lay flat in a horizontal
position but the limiting viewing angles
render this orientation a little bit
useless the machine is also fairly thick
but the curved nature does slam the body
a little bit there's plenty of
ventilation at the top and some on each
side of the stand overheating was never
an issue and surprisingly the old one
remained quiet
even during benchmarks gaming
performance is expected as always non
evident as the 15 watt apu really
belongs in power efficient notebooks and
not really in desktops you could squeeze
a bit of gameplay on the very low preset
in BioShock Infinite and the 3d Phi
strike scored pretty low as you can see
now the system however basic is still
missing some key functionality when it
comes to all-in-one designs first there
are no video output ports so connecting
a second monitor you may have lying
around is not an option second for a
large form factor like this one I would
have loved to see a built-in handle at
the back for easier transport and
finally the CX is completely closed off
from any user upgrades meaning you
cannot replace or update the memory nor
the drives life expectancy in case
things go wrong is left only to the
Gateway warranty the 4270 comes paired
with a wireless keyboard and a mouse
that had come without batteries come on
gateway the keyboard is perfect for an
office environment as it's very quiet
yet pretty responsive with large keys
the mouse connects through a mini
receiver but really slippery plastic
signs and no sight browser buttons make
it almost unusable now I made a
commitment to use this as my primary
office driver
for the week and I really wish a proper
stand was included or at least allowed
to be mounted elsewhere as the viewing
angle was really sort of uncomfortable
and overall like a performance made me
stay away from the computer and one more
thing to mention before we conclude is
the location and the quality of the
speaker's is actually pretty great for
the price and for you know your casual
media however there's a very noticeable
high-frequency pitch that appears
randomly and only goes away once you
play some audio it's very annoying
having to deal with this on a daily
basis however this issue was not evident
when using headphones
now overall the Gateway ZX 4270 brings
an affordable solution for users with
minimal needs when the quiet in a
good-looking machine supporting six USB
ports front-facing stereo speakers and a
pretty decent display as wall mouse and
keyboard are included so that's always a
positive and this all-in-one is just a
good enough machine for us you know
social media and Microsoft Office
however it is easy to pinpoint the
shortfalls of this machine despite the
low price the stem here is extremely
limiting for placement that doesn't
allow any other mount there are no video
output ports and audio issue the
speakers are certainly annoying also I
wish batteries were included with the
peripherals so you can be up and running
in no time and I really don't think that
the a4 5000 APU is fitting here as
performance suffers even when writing
more than just two things at once now
for the $500 price the gateway CX may be
everything you need in terms of
performance and phone factor but if you
are looking for a well-rounded
multi-application all-in-one system the
gateway ZX unfortunately doesn't hit the
spot now if you're in the market for an
all-in-one
how do you feel about the Gateway ZX
4270 and would you consider getting one
