possible without the innovative fantex
world-leading nvidia graphics memory
partner corsair and the retail partner
NCIX
along with silverstone and in win we
stopped by the msi booth at Computex and
they had a demonstration of the msi gt72
concept gaming laptop i featured a
built-in eye tracker and it's quite
interesting to see the type of
applications that would utilize this
technology dmitri was trying it out and
the tracking was incredibly accurate and
the main target right now our game
casters and they would overlay gamers
eye movement so you know where they are
looking msi also introduced a new GS 32
m shadow gaming notebook with a dock
that's designed for mobility to meet
power the 13 inch form factor only
weighs 1.2 kilograms and it's nineteen
point eight millimeters at its thickest
point you can configure this laptop with
a 5th gen quad-core i7 CPU 16 gigs of
ram and set up a super-fast 512 gigabyte
SSD in braids laptop only features
integrated graphics but with the help of
the gaming dock users can take gaming to
a whole new level it comes with a single
PCIe gen3 slot where you can install any
desktop class GPU like the gtx 980ti and
with the help of a PCIe connector on top
of the dock all you have to do is slide
the built-in PCIe connector on the
laptop to the dock and the system will
automatically detect the GPU this will
unleash the best graphics performance a
gamer can achieve with a laptop and a
fully loaded GPU another great feature
of the gaming dock is the expansion
ports you'll find four USB 3.0 ports
gigabit ethernet and a dedicated
headphone / microphone jack and a 3.5
inch SATA slot internally on a dock so
you can expand on the storage the 13.3
inch display supports a resolution of
1920 by 1080 and msi claims it to be a
little better than a typical TN panel we
followed up with msi as to why release a
13 inch form factor for the dock and not
anything larger an msi will be rolling
out with a larger dock compatible with
bigger notebooks but for now what do you
think of the GS 32 m shadow and the
gaming table from MSI would this be an
option for gamers who would like to
transform their mobile desktop setup to
a powerful game
