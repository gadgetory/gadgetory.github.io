officially launching the core i9 79-80
extreme edition and decor i9 79 60 X
both of these are the new Halo products
for Intel in their high-end desktop
lineup which means they are supposed to
compete with aim DS rising threat Ripper
CPUs now both these CPUs cost around
$3,700 actually come to think of it
shouldn't be holding them like this so
let me place them safely and let's get
to the b roll these skylake processors
haven't really been a mystery at all
since we've known about their pricing
and core counts since this year's copy
tax back then Intel launched the I 970
900 X the I 978 20x and the I 970 800 K
along with the cable 8 X processors
which seemed ridiculous we're not gonna
get into that anyways and of course
their new x2 9 and platform but at the
same time they new AMD had thread repair
waiting in the wings and those twelve or
sixteen core processors would actually
beat the higher-end sky like X
processors on the market so what did
Intel - well they announced the core
counts and pricing for the i9 79 80 X E
and the i9 79 60 X in an attempt to take
some of the wind out of threaded burst
sales but did that strategy really work
I mean it's debatable since AMD just
quickly launched $1,000 1950 X and the
$800 1920 X both of which costs less
than what Intel's offering and should
offer competitive performance if you're
interested in review for those two new
CPUs you can check them out right here
now Intel's officially hit back with
this launch and you know looking at the
specs of these two new CPUs I'm
thoroughly impressed let's actually
start with this guy the 18 core 36
threaded in monster the i9 79-80 Extreme
Edition but first a quick message from
our sponsor the NZXT hue plus lighting
control hub is now available in the
white frame to complement the white
sixty monta case or other white theme
builds for best hardware color
coordination with enough extensions
included and is used to control the for
very bright RGB LED strips or the air
RGB fans all through the hue plus hub
check it out in the description below
okay so the first thing you'll see is
that pricing of two grand but since
we've already known that for months now
I'm guessing the sticker shock will be a
bit less not done just less because this
one processor costs as much as a
high-end gaming PC however its core
clock speeds are actually pretty decent
of course due to the massive amount of
heat being generated with that hundred
and sixty-five watt TDP and the input
power it requires intel had to keep the
79 80 X YZ base clock to a pretty low
2.6 gigahertz but in testing I never saw
the chip run under 3.5 gigahertz
however as less coarse are utilized
Intel's turbo boost technology really
takes over and runs up speeds even
higher it maxes out between 4.2
gigahertz and 4 point 4 gigahertz which
will be very important for games which
typically don't load a processor all
that much the $1,700 I 979 60 X has very
similar clock speeds and specs as its
bigger brother but it has 16 cores and
32 threads along with the price that's a
bit less expensive it will still put a
very big hole in your pocket though now
while the i9 semi 980 Extreme Edition
doesn't really have eight to recomm
pettite er from AMD just yet the 79 60 X
has the exact same number of cores and
threads as the 1950 X and yet it costs
$700 more really Intel actually let me
put some of this pricing into
perspective for you guys you can
effectively by a thread Ripper in 1950 x
and asus prime x 399 eight motherboard
ND GT x 1080 for the price of a single i
970 988 ammunition or gravity 1950 x and
a GT x 1080 without going over the 79 60
X's price point Intel's also launching
the I 979 40 X and the I 979 20x today
as well but since this video will focus
on higher-end CPUs I'll just let you
pause the screen on this chart to check
out the specs
something else you should take into
account is the amount of heat these
processors generate
the power they consume I'll get into the
specifics a bit later in this review but
if you're about to buy one of these new
processors a high-end air cooler or a
very good single bar all in one liquid
cooler is absolutely necessary
another thing that will always come up
in a threader / versus colic extubate
will be the number of PCI lanes offered
by the processors basically allowing the
processor to communicate directly with
an attached device should in theory
lower latencies and boost overall
performance so the more the CPU has the
better the record processors have a
total of 48 3.0 lanes available for
graphics and another doesn't set for
high-speed nvme storage solutions
meanwhile Intel has 44 lanes available
which are typically split with 40 being
dedicated towards graphic solutions
while another 4 can be towards nvme or
other types of high bandwidth storage
the balance of PCI ports are housed on
the X to 99 PCH I'll be testing to see
if there's any difference between the
two solutions but on paper
aim D setup is superior since it cuts
out the chipset and allows for a more
direct communication with the key
components before again to the
benchmarks there's something I have to
remind you as well it is important to
approach this review from the
perspective of a technology lover rather
than an outright critic like the red
ripper the high-end skylake X processors
are technological marvels which will
command respect while also attracting
endless flame wars but neither Intel nor
AMD are targeting their $1,000 plus
processors at gamers who can buy a
complete mid to high-end gaming system
for the cost of a single 16 or 18 core
CPU you need to have a very specific set
of needs to benefit from the gobs of
horse power these things bring to the
table even then without properly setting
native core Finity for programs a lot of
that potential will go to waste just
make sure you remember that before
criticizing or praising down in the
comments down below
so with that in mind let's get into the
benchmarks okay first up here is a quick
glance at the testing setup that we used
for each system we try to keep
everything as identical as possible from
one another starting off with Cinebench
is multi-threaded results it is obvious
that the extreme edition processor is
the processor to be right
now the 79 60 ex isn't that far behind
and both easily beat the threat river
processors the same can be said about W
Prime results next up is PC mark and
it's obvious that the home and creative
benchmarks likely reflect what to expect
from these processors in the real world
since this test combines multiple
different workloads the massive number
of course doesn't benefit in every
scenario I wanted to test out some
single core benchmarks too and here they
are with turbo boost 3.0 working in the
background the 79 80 X II and thus any
960 X remained very far ahead of AMD's
predator but there are still some KB
Lake and KB like X processors ahead of
them alright so I guess that's it for
synthetic benchmarks since I won most of
those review to focus on real-world
performance and for that let's start off
with Adobe Premiere so this is an
interesting result and one that I have
to explain since neither the sky like X
or thread of our processors do as well
as you might expect
while the 18 and 16 core intel parts are
still leading thread Ripper Adobe
Premiere requires a balance of higher
clock speeds and threads to perform
optimally anything over 12 threads
results in diminishing returns unless
you overclock
in some zip the extreme edition
processor and the 79 60 X really fly
head since this is a program that makes
use of Intel's recent optimizations and
it loves additional course blender is
the same thing as well with Intel taking
a massive lead over AMD it is important
to highlight that the $300 premium for
the extreme edition processor isn't
really beneficial here since the 79 60 X
is able to hit higher clock speeds more
frequently the results repeat themselves
in Corona it's interesting to see that
whilst Golic X was ahead in these
synthetic benchmarks the lead or a
thread Ripper is actually increasing in
real-world testing and that's
interesting since GIMP is a very lightly
threaded program you are better off
going with a much less expensive but
faster clock processor if you can use it
on a regular basis moving back to a more
multi-threaded program shows these new
Intel chips in the lead again but not by
all that much over thread Ripper it
seems like something else might be
causing a bottleneck in the systems
other than the processor pov-ray
actually raises a good question are the
79 80
see and e79 60x really worth all that
much money over 200 person 1950 X sure
they have a lead but it isn't a lead
that's worth $900 and $600 more rounding
up the real world benchmarks in WinRAR
and interestingly the i9 7900 cain has a
huge lead over everything this is
because winrar doesn't stress all course
and that one processor was able to
achieve a much higher average clock
speed during the test okay guys I know
that I said these processors aren't
meant for gaming since there are much
better values in this market if you just
want to have a good time but none of our
reviews would be complete without a
little gameplay obviously the 5-star
benchmarks are loves a number of threads
offered by the extreme edition processor
and these 79 60x their lead is
absolutely massive
but times pi is a little bit different
since the graphics card dictates more of
the score so all CPU score very close to
one another moving through all the other
games you can actually see that there's
really no need for such expensive
processors if gaming is your system's
primary use in some cases even our ultra
powerful Titan X became the bottleneck
while in others the game developers
themselves have capped frame rates to
try and improve the overall experience
sure there are titles that do benefit
from the extra course and in tusk I like
X is always ahead of thread upper in the
results but not by all that much
honestly guys you'd be much better off
spending money on a better graphics card
than jumping from a Rison or cable II
processor to thread repair or sky like X
so now with performance out of the way I
think it's time to talk about
temperatures and power consumption since
they are two areas that will play a key
factor in the sky like X story when
loading up the system's both the i9 semi
980 Extreme Edition and the i9 79 60 X
became the most power hungry processors
I've ever tested in the last two years
by a long shot - they both requires
significantly more input power than
Indies threader / and sucked down in
excess of 50 watts more than the I 970
900 X it looks like Intel tried to push
sky like excess frequencies as high as
possible in order to be threaded / and
the end results is excess power
consumption with that amount of power
consumption as you would imagine
of heat being generated is on the next
level you absolutely need a high-end air
cooler or a very good common looking
cooler at least as a minimum even with a
Noctua nagu 14s the I 979 extreme
edition processor topped out at 77
degrees Celsius which is the highest
I've ever seen a stock processor hit on
this cooler
it isn't anywhere close to throttling
but still this is something you will
want to take into account when buying
one of these new CPUs with those results
taken into account I think this is a
great time to talk about overclocking as
well and for that you will need to spend
some pretty special equipment a dual or
triple fan although an electric cooler
will be must or if you're going with an
air cooling solution something like the
Noctua in hu 14s with two fans installed
would be a minimum on the power supply
side you will need at least a unit that
has dual eight pin CPU connectors
according to our motherboard partners
these new processors can draw well over
400 watts from the 12 volt rail when
overclocked over 4 gigahertz on all
course this also means that motherboard
Wenders will have a challenge with VRMs
on some other boards as a matter of fact
gigabyte recommended buying their new
Oris x2 an 89 Pro Series if you plan on
overclocking any 16 or 18 cores comic X
processors those motherboards have a
different power layout and feature
active cooling over their MOSFETs I
didn't have much time to overclock these
processors so I focused on the I 970 960
X with good cooling I was able to hit a
constant 3.9 gigahertz on all 16 cores
and I'm sure I could have gone a bit
further with more time
but even then I saw scores that easily
matched or exceeded the extreme edition
processor unfortunately hitting the
speed also meant my system needed almost
100 watts more power from the wall
always stay charged with linky power up
power banks house than gorgeous aluminum
enclosure with dual USB and type-c port
with support for quick charge 3.0 to get
two devices recharged fast
available up to 20 thousand one hundred
million power capacities check them out
in the description below and that's a
wrap-up for skylake x guys and let me
tell you this one's going to be a hard
one to wrap up first up I have to give
mad props to Intel for you know pushing
the boundaries in the high-end test
market the i9 79 60 X in the i9 79 80
extremism CPUs are the fastest
processors you can buy right now period
their fasts are dynamic they're
adaptable and most importantly they can
blaze through any applications
imaginable as you can tell I'm pretty
excited to have these two new CPUs here
in the studio but I also have to
remember that Intel sent over $3,700
worth of CPUs to us well you guys have
to be spending the real money on them
and let's be honest here skylake x
demands a ton of money in most uses
cases spending that extra money wouldn't
be worth a wild / threader persons an
average of 15 percent better performance
over a 100 percent price premium just
doesn't make any sense but a 10 to 20
percent reduction in rendering times
over throw a dripper could mean real
money savings for professionals and for
them spending an extra $600 or thousand
dollars for the 79 60 X or he's 79 80
Extreme Edition could be money well
spent
but gamers don't think about spending
that extra money on these two new CPS
because you're much better off with a
CPU that costs one third of the price so
the 79 60 X or the 79 80 extra munition
are crazy expensive and in most
situations others less cost alternatives
will be the better choice but if you're
someone who absolutely needs the best
multi-threaded performance that money
can buy on the desktop platform then
maybe just maybe sky like X will be a
good fit so what do you guys think of
these two new CPUs from Intel
professionals do you see yourself you
know spending that extra cash to save
and rendering times and of course gamers
do you see yourself benefiting from the
CPU while you can do gaming and of
course
streaming in parallel or are you much
better off with flutter per like you
