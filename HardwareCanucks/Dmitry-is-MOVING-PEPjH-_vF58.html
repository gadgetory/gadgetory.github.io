welcome to another vlog I am moving soon
so this begins the chapter of me
cleaning out my office which has already
somehow somewhat started but let me show
you what I have to deal with cable Maud
now offers sleeved Ethernet and power
cables so you can color match outside of
the case with mod mesh and mod flex
sleeting available at different links
custom cables are now outside the box
right now the office is is still a
little bit in shambles like there's
everything on the floor and stuff I have
a bag of cables my other monitor the
curved one from LG is here and the 4k
monitor is right there which will be
utilized for the Nook the challenge now
becomes sort of organizing and managing
all the stuff boxes and everything I
mean this shelf has been has come in
super handy but I don't know if you guys
know this but all of that right there on
the balcony even like inside the office
here you know multiple cases multiple
boxes this is my area for filming anyway
but look what happens once we sort of
leave the office you can totally see
that this whole area needs its own
little storage space
one thing that I'm still worried about
are all these cases yeah in total I have
18 cases so I have been in this studio
for a year now exactly a year and I have
18 cases I have reviewed 18 cases
throughout the year that's crazy and so
what I'm thinking of doing is having a
shop that is organised just for my gear
right now it's kind of that but I also I
have some you know gear and microphone
whatever the problem for me is that you
know I have so many boxes that I really
don't need but I don't hate to keep I
like my boxes for some reason and so now
will be matter of
signing which boxes to keep which was to
throw up while keeping the product
somewhere else and so it begins
part in my hair so the first deal of
business is of course clearing out my
shelf I love this shelf so much extra
you know space for surface area to store
things and you know things have been
coming off it into their own boxes so I
can transfer them easily and the thing
is I'm still here for another two weeks
in this office space and I still have to
film a bunch of videos and still work in
the space and I can't because it's a
huge mess right now and my idea for a
new space would be to use as little as
possible on my main editing desk so I
will only have a single monitor and I
will have secondary workstations
somewhere in the room as well I'm not
sure yet but for the main workstation I
want to be as clean as possible as
simple as possible if you have any tips
on what to do it's gonna be a white desk
so hopefully it's gonna be I mean this
is a dark color so it tries to it helps
to calm a flash some of the scales but I
mean not really but I am looking forward
to the white desk because it gives me
extra light I'm gonna have a lot of
pedal stuff for the PC case but if you
have any suggestions on what I need to
do or like any advice on how to keep
this as clean as possible in a new space
please leave them in the comments below
the one thing I will definitely miss
about this studio space is how tall the
ceilings are like incredibly tall and so
therefore in the new studio space the
ceilings are going to be slightly
shorter so I'm wondering if they're
gonna be appear too large in that space
but it's gonna be there's gonna give me
even lighting in the new space because
the ceiling is a little bit shorter some
light will bounce my desk is completely
crazy right now and like as soon as I
get this cleaned up I can go on to
actually doing him more filming the good
thing is that I still have this white
desk that I can clean up and have very
clean shots without having to worry
about the rest of the space and that's
the beauty of having sort of a large
space like this I can actually you know
I mean you never see them eyes
the videos right because I mean look at
that cable mess I really am sorry about
that for you have to see that but it's
kind of cool authentic to see for
example you just saw all the cables and
like a huge mess and in my studio but
it's all about getting the shot right so
I just set up a quick little thing over
here so camera two lights one they are
firing over there one from the top to
give me highlights I smack your phone
there so I'm creating this really cool
intro for the mouse would mean from the
camera and check out the the composition
here so this is pretty clean you don't
see everything around it then so this is
the whole idea of doing these vlogs so
you can check out what's happening
behind the scenes like I have two cases
behind me I can't even move this chair
because there's so many cables around
but of course that will be fixed later
and yeah like this is this is how well
this is how I work at least in terms of
trying to set up the shot so for this
next shot I'm doing a little bit
roleplay like what my onyx is thinking
about it what the to mainstream gamers
camps are like one is saying that it's
completely ridiculous to have a heart
rate sensor on the mouse versus somebody
who's open-minded let's say and willing
to try there's something like that and
then the last person is me as a reviewer
so I have the classes for the my onyx
guy and I'm wearing just this and I'm
also doing a little bit of change up so
the gamer is gonna have actual gamer
glasses with a different gaming style
shirt and then when the reviewer comes
on on camera I'm gonna change out my
attire as well so that I visually also
change on the frame so this is what
looks like and so we get bionics want to
revolutionize gaming and give me real
time statistics to players about their
heart rate
so recently I've discovered this very
productive way for me to work on my
edits especially if I'm doing like multi
time shoot like it's not just a simple
let's spend an hour shooting this you
know it usually takes a whole day of
shooting product and so I'm finding
myself you find you start to edit early
on for example I just shot my 10 minute
or spend 10 minutes shooting the intro
which is gonna be like a minute long in
the Edit it's gonna take me about 20 to
30 minutes to edit that intro in that
way I know that I have something started
something already finished in the Edit
and that it helps me to be a little bit
more efficient and productive when it
comes to finalizing the video because if
you have that in the back of your mind
thinking you have to edit for another
four hours it's a little bit daunting so
if you break that up and you edit along
the way it helps me to be extra
productive and like actually enjoy the
editing of coming back to something that
I started already and just having to
finish it
all right the intro is finished but yeah
that's the whole idea it's so ambitious
we've never seen anything like this
before
having a heart rate sensor on the game
so right now I'm filming the s340 elite
the tempered glass edition and the
beautiful fall colors on the window are
so fantastic because depending on the
rotation of the case depending on the
reflection I can show off those colors
especially when they're out of focus it
is so beautiful now what's really
interesting within the case industry
trends recently is tempered glass we
made the whole video on that after that
after Computex
I have been using the evolve TG ever
since it came out that's fantastic I
love the looks the s340 looks clean AF I
mean look at that beautiful glass we
also have the course there's at 460 X
this is the RGB version review for that
is coming but look at that it's gorgeous
side glass on the side and the front
panel which is awesome but I wonder what
will be next you know we've gone through
the trends of what is needed in the case
industry one from rubber grommets all
black interior proper cable management
then we expanded the key size so you can
fit as much as possible then you shrunk
everything because space efficiency
became most important now we have
tempered glass but what will be next I
don't know let me know in the comments
now the one interesting aspect about
tempered glass and what that has done to
the cases that we have out now is that
they all now look similar because of
that similar reflection I mean the oil
using the tempered glass so the
reflection is the same so the only thing
that is different is the frame itself
and the interior too but they all sort
of merge together now very similar on
the interior everybody's has the power
supply shroud and you know SSD brackets
and etc but how do you make them
different that is a very interesting
problem that I would love to see how
these manufacturers approach that
because obviously everyone is trying to
get on board with a tempered glass
because it looks gorgeous Otto don't
break
it's a total pain to clean it I haven't
done so yet but you can see some videos
on YouTube on what happens when that
thing breaks but another thing is how do
you go about differentiating between
your case versus a competitor case it's
quite difficult and so the challenge
begins to move out of this studio space
move into something else which I'm super
excited and setting up everything once
again for a nice fresh take with some
new furniture hopefully to make it seem
less studio ish and a bit more home
stylish so that we get a nice new book
for I love my videos so I hope you guys
enjoy come along more vlogs to come as I
actually begin to move and we'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
