great technology selection and service
hey guys ever hear with hydroponics and
today we're checking out one of the
latest gaming notebooks from gigabyte
that features Intel's new Broadwell CPU
excellent mainstream gaming graphics and
a unique body designed to stand out this
is the p55 w priced at $1400 USD it's
hard to pass on such an offer given the
competitive price point and features
specs wise the CPU is a new Broadwell
quad core i7 5700 h-cubed clocked at 2.7
acres with turbo boost up to 3.5
gigahertz eight gigabytes of RAM a
powerful nvidia gtx 970m
with three gigabytes of vram and dual
storage capacity with a 128 gigabyte M
SATA Drive and a standard 1 terabyte
hard drive my first impressions with the
build quality were solid I was
particularly impressed with the screen
rigidity which does add onto the
thickness of the body but I don't mind
it the entire chassis including the
screen frame is made out of a hard
plastic material with a soft touch
surface so for those inclined towards
aluminum or non plastic enclosure may
need to look elsewhere gigabyte has
approached the p55 W with a unique
design with these aerodynamic
streamlines on the front of the laptop
and the embedded logo gives the machine
a nice Delta look they've also added
these orange accents on both sides for
extra character the black matte surface
does feel smooth but it is shy of hiding
smudges so do note that taking a look at
the i/o on the left side we have a
Kensington lock VGA output Gigabit
Ethernet and HDMI port along with two
USB 3.0 ports on the right we have our
power input a blu-ray drive a couple
more USB 3.0 ports and a dedicated
headphone and microphone jack something
we think is missing is a mini
DisplayPort that many current gaming
laptops are equipped with the laptop
weighs about two and a half kilograms
and the weight distribution throughout
the chassis is supreme this allows for
one-hand operation when opening the
laptop and the two hinges of the front
do a fantastic job preventing the screen
from wobbling while using the people
the 15-inch display comes with a
resolution of 1920 by 1080 that is IPS
viewing angles and the contrast ratio
are top-notch brightness levels are fine
for indoor gaming and the matte coating
on the screen helps to smooth out or
completely eliminate reflections the
speakers are placed to the front of the
laptop right below the palm rest which
means sound projection is not the best
as we've heard having angled the front
facing speakers below the screen is a
preference spot for the best projection
it also likes the base region that would
require headphones during game time
take a listen for yourselves
the typing experience on the p55 W was
excellent the full-size chiclet style
keyboard is properly spaced and the
tactile responsiveness on the keys is
phenomenal thanks to the two point two
millimeter key travel distance whether
you are typing four hours or gaming
you're enforced satisfactory treat plus
the two levels of white backlit is
gorgeous so it's super useful in dark
environments the touchpad is not the
best certainly it's a lot better than
the P 35 that we reviewed recently
features like double tap for right click
are missing and when you zoom into
webpage zooming out is just not as
responsive as I thought it would be the
two primary left and right clicks are
difficult to press and they should be
lighter for easier access and so the use
of an external mouse is highly
recommended I was also surprised to see
gigabyte not include an 802 dot 11 AC
Wi-Fi card in the p55 so if you want to
connect to a 5 gigahertz network you
have the option to swapping the m dot to
Wi-Fi card so how well does a gtx 970m
handle gaming well just as expected
pretty well starting with GTA 5 at very
high settings we where achieving a
little over 50 frames per second on
average which is totally playable moving
into Middle Earth shadow of Mordor are
ultra settings the GPU kept up pretty
well averaging around the 50 FPS mark
Metro last line at high settings looked
great scoring an average framerate in
the low 40s and the minimums hitting the
high 20s squeezing all these specs into
a relatively some form factor means heat
the laptop did run hotter than expected
with temperatures in the CPU hitting
above 90 degrees and a GPU reaching 76
degrees under load this is because the
cooling system is compromised of a
single heatman on the side of the laptop
that cools both the GPU and CPU
separately dissipation designs are
always better but in this case the
inclusion of a blu-ray drive limits the
internal layout for more cooling and
this is what the machine sounds like
under full load
so we can say the new p55 W is a hybrid
between a productive and gaming notebook
it's loaded for proper mobile gaming
with excellent quality bill structure
incorporating unique orange accents the
inclusion of a blu-ray drive can be seen
as a positive for some but coming from a
strictly gaming perspective we would
have preferred additional cooling or
more storage slots the 1080p IPS display
is great and typing has been a
phenomenal experience on the laptop like
this some drawbacks include a poor
touchpad that doesn't feel responsive
and the surface isn't smooth for
comfortable navigation the lack of AC
Wi-Fi is disappointing plus the heat
output makes it way onto the surface and
it can be felt by hands while gaming the
p55 W brings a unique aesthetical
refresh and a competitive price point
for the specs and it can be seen as a
solid productive machine for the
mainstream well that concludes our
review of the gigabyte P 55 w gaming
