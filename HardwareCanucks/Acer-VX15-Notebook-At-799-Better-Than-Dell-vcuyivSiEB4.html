architects and coverage from Acer at CES
20:17 was mostly focused on the
absolutely insane $9,000 extreme
notebook but we went to them in search
of something else something much more
affordable for real-world applications
this is the upcoming V x-15 notebook and
like the dell inspiron 7000 gaming we
already looked at it is a notebook with
gaming DNA yet it can also function as a
very portable school or home office
laptop but before we get into this a
quick shout-out from our sponsors the
show coverage is possible thanks to
Nvidia gigabyte fantex and NCIX the
similarities between the V X 15 and
Inspiron gaming are quite evident not
only within each of their chassis but
also what lies under the hood as a
matter of fact both have been made
possible due to Nvidia introduction of
their highly versatile gtx 1050 and gtx
750ti
into the mobile space Acer was extremely
straightforward with their thoughts
about these new GPUs not only do they
provide awesome performance relative to
their cost but that performance is
delivered with extremely high efficiency
hence notebook manufacturers are able to
maximize other components without going
over budget or over their TDP spec like
delts offering the 15-inch V X 15 from
Acer we'll start at $800 and it's
baseline configuration is very much
similar to its competitor but there are
some differences expected to come with a
KB like I 570 300 H cubed processor and
an IPS screen rather than a TN panel on
the Inspiron in addition Acer has added
a very welcomed USB 3.1 type-c gen 3
port which is something else that Dells
competitors lacks even though this one
wants at Gen 1 speeds so be mindful of
that the other specifications are quite
similar to their 16 gigabytes of ddr4 20
400 megahertz memory a 128 gigabyte SSD
as a primary OS drive and a one terabyte
hard drive for storage a gtx 1050 4
gigabyte will come standard and the gtx
1050 TI will of course be available for
about $100 premium if you want that
extra bit of performance ticking all of
the option boxes will run this notebooks
price to about $1,100 which is actually
still very affordable given its
capabilities what really surprised me
was how great Acer's chassis looks and
feels the
predominantly black color scheme and
soft touch interior not only gives a
higher-end look to the V x-15 but it
also rejects fingerprints quite well the
red backlit keyboard isn't something
that will ever replace a fully
mechanical variant but typing on it
seems to be more responsive than the
Inspiron I'm also giving kudos to a surf
or adding highlighted wass keys and
that's a nice touch
even though it's technically 1.1 inches
thick it's gently sloping lines and
well-designed
integrated hinge makes the V x-15 feel
quite a bit thinner than it really is in
addition I noticed that it was
subjectively quite a bit lighter than
the Dell so portability should be a lot
better unfortunately there's no 14-inch
version planned for the time being but
it is actively being looked into we're
all really excited to get our hands on
this one now onto the big notebook yeah
I know this is it but no Acer coverage
from CES 2017 would be complete without
a quick look at the predator 21 X it is
completely over the top it costs a small
fortune of $9,000 and it looks
ridiculous
but you have to respect a surfer going
on on a limb and creating something like
this the intent was only to make a few
hundred but given the positive response
they've received from their retail
partners at the show Acer may actually
decide to increase production you see a
lot of retailers see this as a perfect
marketing opportunity within their
stores and I have to agree with their
assessment just look at it within the
massive chassis lies and overclocked i7
7820 HQ processor 64 gigabytes of ddr4
26 66 megahertz memory to 512 gigabyte
nvme PCI SSDs two gtx 980 cards in sli
five fans six copper heat pipes backed
up by an extensive heatsink array and
two subwoofers the more visible
components are probably more noteworthy
than what's going inside the predator
21x there's the first 21 inch curved 120
hertz IPS panel ever installed on a
notebook support 4G sync and also Toby
eye tracking meanwhile the keyboard uses
true Cherry MX brown mechanical switches
and features a uniquely designed
trackpad / numpad combo that can be
flipped over depending on the
functionality you need in store may not
sell a lot of these but it was the talk
of the show believe me so there you have
it two notebooks at completely different
ends of the spectrum
coverage at CES 2017 isn't over yet
either so stay tuned for more
I'm ebrucaba axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
