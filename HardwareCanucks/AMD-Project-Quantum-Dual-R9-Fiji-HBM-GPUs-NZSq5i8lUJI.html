great technology selection and service
I'm really excited to be here today
because I'm about to unveil these
coolest the coolest most exciting that
we've ever made put it in something
small
Andy's project quantum is an exciting
direction for high-performance living
room gaming that takes a step further
not only for hardware but with an
important element design element
underlying the entire project reminding
users about the potential of changing
how we think about PC towers and gaming
builds in general thanks to high
bandwidth memory or hpm and project
quantum in my opinion is one of the most
unique and coolest builds of 2015 this
is a proof-of-concept designed to show
off the potential of their new figi hpm
GPUs where the memory is actually
literally stacked on top of each other
on the actual die of the GPU and the
quantum will feature to our 9pg GPUs
packing incredible performance with up
to 17 teraflops of compute performance
in this relatively compact form factor
thanks to the significant board size
reductions meet possible with HP M you
are looking at the multi-gpu powerhouse
something that would not have been
totally possible without HP m and for
size comparison here's a fury card on
top next to the r9 290x at the bottom
and AMD has been able to reduce the
board size up to 65% and that's what
project quantum is there to really
emphasize full specs of the PC are not
fully revealed but it will feature an
Intel i7 processor and we are told maybe
a fool AMD system in there as well what
we recommended for AMD is maybe a DIY
route for the quantum machine where
users
may have the option to configure their
Hardware all you just have to buy sort
of this base configuration and populate
your own processor your RAM and the
drives but that's a little further down
into the future so let's check out what
makes this pcs so special well aside
from housing dual are nine features in
there this unique shape allows proper
compartment separation while all the
hardware in the bottom chamber and the
cooling system in the top chamber with
proper ventilation and really
cool-looking design top panel so project
quantum is a fully liquid cooled PC with
a large square radiator in the top
section unfortunately we didn't get to
see inside the machine but from this
internal schematic it looks really clean
allowing the PC to remain completely
silent and cool as the massive exhaust
fan should do an adequate job with
cooling what we did not see on a show
floor was the external power supply as
the single feejee GPU is rated at 275
Watts TDP and having the power unit
outside the main machine obviously
compresses the size of the chassis and I
personally don't mind this solution so
this has been aimed this project quantum
a unique way to emphasize GPU board size
reduction thanks to HP m and how it will
fundamentally change the small form
factor PC moving forward but what do you
think of the design and make sure to
subscribe because we have reviews of all
the new cards that were just announced
coming shortly thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
