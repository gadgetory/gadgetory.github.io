oh hey there nc XCOM it's Canada's
leading etrailer for anything your mind
desires just keep within those
categories which are plenty and get
tempted by their weekly deals FYI Black
Friday is coming visit ncx calm for all
them sweet deals so tempered glass and
RGB are the latest trends for PC cases
and it's a clever move for companies to
upgrade their most popular offerings to
keep consumers happy and that is exactly
how the crystal series from Corsair was
born and we've got the 4 60 X RGB on the
review table today
priced at 139 it's a $40 premium over
the 400 see that share the same frame
but there are a few significant
differences that may justify the price
increase first of all tempered glass
it's on the main side that everyone
loves to see but it's also now at the
front that gives this unique look to all
visible angles and shows the RGB
goodness of those three intake fans and
I actually quite liked this approach
that gives some illumination to your
build but without overdoing it and
lighting control is done through the top
IO that cycles between color speed and
mode and to achieve this we have a
pre-installed hub beside the power
supply and an additional lighting
controller and the front it is adding a
bit too many stock cables but at least
they are cleaned up by default and I
want to clarify that you will still need
to connect the fans to your motherboard
as the hub plus the lighting controller
are for lighting only and by the way the
i/o still only has two USB ports PR
buttons and audio the lighting is very
basic with breathing mode flickering or
color cycle mode plus 3 speeds I'm just
happy the colors are vibrant and
accurate with LED concentration in the
center of the fan with a little bit of
spill into the blades it's a bit
misleading how you see the fans on the
product page but the most vibrant color
is the dark blue that fills the blades
to the most part but the rest are a much
more muted so moving on the frame on the
460 X is slightly different from the 400
see the support angle at the bottom has
been significantly reduced in size and I
think this is to allow raid
to fit sideways into the case easier
structurally it feels the same toe
without the side panels on there is a
bit of flex but with the case closed
it's totally fine and we see two more
changes first the frame around the PCI
slots is now closed off unlike on the
400 C where the frame would accommodate
like a screwdriver being used without
any issues which unfortunately is now
changed with the holes that are less
convenient to use and the second thing
the rear side panel no longer has the
self catching screws it's a weird
omission that should not have been
changed you have four thumb screws to
mount the glass panel and you gotta be
careful not to lose the tiny rubber
pieces that stay with the glass and
generally this is not a comfortable
panel to work with at all there's
nothing on the frame that holds the
glass and I prefer tiny rods that catch
the panel and we see this all the time
like on dark Bass Pro 900 the fantex of
OTG or the s340
elite all have some way to support the
panel before the thumb screws come in as
for the front panel it is spaced out and
open on both sides for airflow and there
are also four screws that you need to
remove to access the glass or the dust
filter behind it which spans the full
intake area and is really fine that's
great to see and here you can install a
360 radiator or dual 140 mm or fans the
intake with those three fans though is
fantastic but no exhaust fans are
included so that definitely needs to be
user populated a magnetic dust filter at
the top is present I love the non
intrusive design with offset mounting
locations for those dual 120 or 140
Milner fans but given the low height of
the case I couldn't mount anything other
than low profile ram to fit with my H
100 IV - at the top they could have
squeezed the fan mounting locations even
closer to the panel to allow higher ram
to be used with the top radiator but no
luck with this upgrade also
interestingly I could feel how much air
was being bounced back into the case
from my top exhaust and look at the
power difference of the air flow with
and without the top dust filter I didn't
measure the temperature differences but
I certainly could feel a lot of
turbulent air around the radiator and so
this is where the modular internals can
come in hang
like a removable hard drive cage if you
are not using it or place it further
away from the front to gain extra space
for the radiator without losing that
drive capacity and I love the second
power supply shroud to cover up these
components on the floor and you just
have to make sure to connect all your
cabling after the second shroud is
installed coming to the back the plastic
drive mountain middle is kind of bulky
and limits the use of the space for
cable management and thus everything has
to be guided around it it's definitely
not the prettiest solution and
especially since the SSD cables facing
up they're not easy to clean furthermore
the spring mechanism on the SSDs is too
strong causing all of my drives to just
pop out out of their plastic clips and
that's something to keep in mind but
overall I like the frame it's
appropriately spacious for a mid Tower
you have options on how to set up your
water cooling if you're going that route
I particularly like the dual shroud
panel for the power supply and the
two-piece tempered glass that stands out
from any other tempered glass cases
despite the uncomfortable nature of its
mount and while there are positive
changes to the frame like that corner
piece at the bottom I still don't
understand why they had to change the
rear side panel and its screws and the
frame around the PCI slots for the worse
the 460 X RGB is a pretty upgrade over
the 400 C and it sure follows what
customers are asking for and the price
premium is heavily influenced not by the
glass itself but those SP 120 RGB fans -
because they are $20 apiece ultimately I
would like to see more refinement to
what Corsair is doing right and these
new crystal cases should guide them in
the right direction as long as they
focus on fixing what's not working
instead of changing things that should
be left alone and that concludes the
Corsair 460 x RGB review thanks so much

more crystal case coverage and we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
