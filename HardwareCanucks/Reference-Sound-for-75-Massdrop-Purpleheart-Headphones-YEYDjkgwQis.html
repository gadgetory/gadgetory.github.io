the fantastic Sennheiser HD 598 close
Mac Edition headphones they were
welcoming change over my trusty dt9 and
premiums from biodynamic and as a
content creator I value three things in
headphones first close to reference
sound signature then comes comfort which
is important considering the long hours
I spend editing and scripting videos and
then comes design which might not be
your cup of tea but it's just something
that I care about premium sound quality
does come with a premium price tag and
not everyone has two hundred plus
dollars to spend on a pair of headphones
which is why Mac strap is collaborating
with EMU to bring you guys their new
purple beats headphones this is what
they look like what an interesting name
and an even more interesting set of
headphones but before we take a look at
how they sound quick message from our
sponsor the new NZXT air RGB fans can be
daisy chained together for awesome
lighting cohesion in your build with
vibrant and accurate color illumination
all easily controlled through the hue
plus via cam software full details in
the description below master op has made
a serious name for themselves by
collaborating with some of the
best-known companies and their
respective feels an effort to offer
premium price products at a more
affordable price point some of you might
recall their success with the fostex th
x00 and more recently the HT 6x x now
they've teamed up with EMU systems to
launch the purple heart headphones which
will be available for $75 starting today
and you can check it out through the
link posted in the description down
below do note that this drop is limited
to 3000 units and it'll be available to
both us and international members so
what exactly are you getting for $75
let's start with the design and it looks
simple you might notice some design
similarities between this and the Denon
D 1000 but they've added a few touches
here and there to visually standout the
ear cups are crafted in this beautiful
purple heart finish which is one of the
densest woods in the world and that
should theoretically reduce acoustic
venison's there are also no signs of
branding on these headphones especially
on the ear cuffs and aesthetically they
look and feel awesome the ear cups have
plenty of articulations so some swivel
and angle adjustments and this should
come in handy when resting the pair of
around your
neck although I would have preferred a
flat 90-degree rotation setting the rest
of the build is mostly plastic which
necessarily isn't a bad choice as it
complements a lightweight design plus
the smaller footprint makes it perfect
for on-the-go use which is exactly what
mass drop-in EMU are aiming for the slim
headband features light leather padding
and their adjustable steel sliders
that are well defined with step by step
adjustments the soft protein leather
earpads have plenty of cushioning to
prevent your ears from making contact
with the drivers and throughout my test
period it was a comforting experience
I'm so used to over here headphones like
the HD five nine aids and EDT 990s so
switching to an on your style felt a bit
different but I got used to it
eventually the clamping force isn't too
strong or weak whereas it's more
balanced which didn't cost me any head
fatigue over hours of use and that's
always a thumbs-up
so overall the lightweight structure
along with the comfortable ear pads
serves its purpose as a perfect travel
companion but I have a few concerns
first mass drop hasn't include a
traveling case or a pouch to store these
headphones and that makes me really
concerned about the longitude of the
Purpleheart finish it may be dense and
the lack of any caring option was likely
to reduce cost but this isn't a corner I
like to see being cut second the 1.2
meter cable is a bit too short for my
taste because I was barely able to
connect it to the front
io of my PC and hey I get it it's
designed for portable and casual use but
if this is your first purchase as a
multi-purpose pair I would highly
suggest looking elsewhere or you should
pick up a five point five millimeter
extension cable speaking of connectivity
these headphones use a 3.5 millimeter
gold-plated stereo plug and it doesn't
require a separate DAC or AM to properly
drive them these can easily be powered
by a smartphone or any other portable
audio source that receives a 3.5
millimeter audio jack now this cable
splits up power to each driver and
unfortunately these cans are not
removable so I'd be extra careful with
them during travel now on to the best
part about these headphones this sound
quality the 40 millimeter by cellulous
drivers feature a frequency range
between 10 to 30 kilohertz
and they blew away my expectations for a
pair of headphones that cost under $80
with a neutral sound signature I was
able to identify
vocals perfectly without experiencing
distortions of any kind the bass was
warm and well pronounced plus it never
overtook the highs or the Mint's I was
also able to notice subtle details and
certain tracks which provided a cohesive
experience and it blended really well
with the wonderful sound stage of
drivers and given the clothes bag design
they do block the surroundings fairly
well but expects some minor sound leaks
and now given I have a terrible DAC
inside my Nexus 6p
I used my PC to drive these but I tested
the purple hearts out of an LG g4 and
they didn't disappoint me either so to
conclude the purple hearts by mass drop
and EMU have surprised me in every
single way the simple design and the
lightweight structures stole my heart
from day one I was blown away by the
moment I started listening to tunes on
these and I wasn't expecting that for
$75 the soundstage is excellent for
different genres and I think this would
be a perfect pair for anyone who's
looking for an entry point into the
world of high-end headphones they're
also a great travel companion so that's
a good thing the concerns I mentioned
previously are minor and if you're
comfortable with that pick them up right
now before they're gone good luck with
the drop guys and let us know your
thoughts about the Purple Heart
