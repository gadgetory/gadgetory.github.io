I know if that might not hey guys
Ibraheim connects and I've been thinking
about making this video ever since 2017
but then things just started pushed over
I mean we saw a lot of developments with
RGB lighting and I know we saw RGB
lighting with peripherals then it's sort
of expanded into PC components we saw a
motherboard manufacturers implement them
on their motherboards AIO coolers air
coolers RGB fans RGB graphics cards RGB
SSDs I mean we just recently took a look
at an RGB SSD from Kingston at CES I
think we're slowly moving towards a
direction of pretty much having every
component with some sort of lighting
element and you know what's even
interesting is that gaming companies
have started using the term RGB as a
premium marketing gimmick to sell two
versions of the exact same product so
you'd have an expensive model that comes
with RGB lining and the non expensive
model that does not come with that yet
both of them are pretty much exact same
products it's just the lightening
differences and you're paying a premium
for that product and let's get this
straight
RGB lighting is a great feature and I
think part of the reason why a lot of
people lean towards that is just because
they have the ability to customize the
color of individual components to their
desire but there's one major problem
with RTP learning and that's finding a
unified solution to customize the colors
seamlessly without having to go through
three or four different software's
because let's face it there are a lot of
options out there it's really hard to
pick the best solution so in this video
I'll be breaking down on some of the
most popular options that are available
in the market right now and of course
we'll talk about the differences the
benefits the drawbacks
so let's get to it right after a message
from our sponsor creativity is fueled by
the best instruments it doesn't always
come easy and in the process you often
realize how important quality is the Rd
400 by OCC gives you quality and speed
with M de to interface the schieben and
flash and a PCI bracket making it
possible to focus on what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty
all right so right now RGB lining seems
to fall into two categories the first
ones completely dependent upon the
motherboard vendors and their respective
software solutions for instance Asus
uses their aura sync protocol gigabyte
has their RGB fusion software and MSI
does it with their mystic light sync now
there are some components that come with
native support for these software
solutions and what I meant by that are
components that simply plug in directly
into the motherboard without having to
go through the RGB headers for example
g.skill with their beautiful Triton Zr
gb memory kid gets automatically
detected by aura RGB fusion and mystic
lights software's graphics cards on the
other hand are a bit of a hit or miss in
some cases for instance if you decide to
use a Strix rog based GPU on an asus rog
motherboard you'd be able to control the
lighting using the or software designed
for the motherboard same story goes for
gigabyte if you use one of their GPUs
with a gigabyte motherboard you'll be
able to control the lighting of that
graphics card through the RGB fusion
software but you can't necessarily do
that vice versa because if you plug in a
gigabyte GPU on an asus motherboard you
won't be able to control the lighting up
that graphics card through or because
the GPUs lighting just doesn't support
Orem you'd have to download the
dedicated utility software for that
graphics card and then and then control
the lighting through that software
here's a quick example of Asus GPU tweak
software designed for the Strix rog GPUs
running on an MSI motherboard if you
want to monitor or overclock the GPU
this is what you would use but if you
want to customize the lighting you'll
have to download the or a plug-in app
and then customize the lighting effects
the colors etc so I know it's a two-step
process and it might not seem like a big
deal but if you're really picky about
using a unified solution this is
something to keep in mind another thing
I need to mention our RGB headers that
are located on motherboards it's another
option to extend the lighting of your PC
for instance if you want to add an RGB
LED strip inside your case maybe an AIO
cooler or RGB fans that support the
lighting software of the motherboard
this is a quick and easy way to set up
realistically if you're looking for RGB
components just make sure it comes with
compatibility for or sink RGB fusion
MSI's mystic light XL
also make sure it supports a direct
connection to the motherboard for full
operation it will save you the hassle
from going through dedicated controllers
which we'll talk about shortly
now most motherboards come with a four
pin RGB header meaning you can connect
any standard RGB strip to the connector
and control the lining through or a
mystic light or as rocks RGB LED utility
but be aware of voltages if you plug in
a five volt LED strip to a 12 volt
header or the other way around you're
just gonna blow things up no I'm just
kidding it just won't work I just make
sure to check the respective motherboard
manual for the voltage we doubt you may
have noticed that I skipped gigabytes
RGB fusion when discussing the four pin
compatibility and that's because they
include
a five pin RGB W header on their
mainstream boards especially on their
z170 series and upwards you see getting
a pure white output from a four pin RGB
connector is almost impossible because
you're only working with three channels
red and green and blue but when you add
a separate white channel you can take
advantage of the five pin LED strips
like this cable mod hybrid wide beam RGB
WP
that comes with an additional set of
white LEDs for the extra flexibility
when customizing now you could
technically connect a four pin RGB strip
to a five pin RGB W connector but you'll
have to calibrate the separate red green
and blue channels through the RGB fusion
software I know that myself confusing
but if you decide to use a four pin LED
strip on a five pin LED header on
gigabyte boards this is something that
you'll have to go through alright so the
next way to approach RGB lining is
through other vendor specific solutions
for example NZXT steel lining by itself
is a completely isolated ecosystem and
unfortunately can't communicate with
Aurra and the rest of the motherboard
software's so if you intend to use one
of their cracking coolers or their air
RGB fans you will have to go through and
zxt scam software to control the
lighting and effects now these
components use the standard USB 2.0
header that's found on pretty much every
motherboard out there to communicate
with the software but you could run into
a few issues when you decide to use two
or more of ncx needs lighting products
for example if you decide to use NCC's
crack in your cooler and NCC's air RGB
fans that require separate NCATS hue
plus great system you would need two USB
2.0 headers on the motherboard but
problem is that most multiples these
days only come with a single USB 2.0
header so you would have to sacrifice on
lighting with one of the components and
that's kind of it kind of defeats the
purpose of investing on RGB products in
the first place now quick fix to this
would be to get an extension unit and I
believe NZXT does offer an internal USB
hub extension unit for about twenty-five
dollars and you get three more USB 2.0
headers which is great so now you can
connect two of the products from NZXT
and you have an extra USB 2.0 header for
other components now if that sounds like
a hassle to you NZXT does have another
solution and that's this the n7z 370
based motherboard this is actually their
first motherboard to fully integrate
their cam q+ and grid + eco systems so
you don't have to go through buying a
separate etiquette controller what not
you can just connect the fans and all
the necessary connections to the
motherboard and the cam soft will
automatically detect those components
but unfortunately there's a steep price
to pay for that motherboard because it's
priced around $250 so I'm gonna let that
sink in for a moment
Corsair does something similar with
their RGB components as well if you take
their hydro Pro RGB coolers for instance
they connect to the motherboard via a
USB 2.0 header and then you'd use
Corsairs link software to control the
lighting and effects their RGB fans use
the same connector but it has to go
through their dedicated controller but
you'd run into the same issue that I
talked about earlier when you're trying
to link both the EIU cooler and the RGB
fans due to the lack of two or more USB
2.0 headers on motherboards this is a
most common issue if you decide to go
with dedicated controllers so definitely
keep that in mind then we'll take on the
other hand there's something really
interesting with their RGB products so
instead of relying on multiple USB 2.0
headers on motherboards they use a
unified digital LAN controller to
control the lighting of their flooring
RGB your cooler and their ring plus RGB
fans each controller comes with five LED
connectors and if you want to expand
that thermaltake includes a bridge cable
to connect an additional controller and
you can route all of this through a
single USB 2.0 header and I think that's
a pretty smart design on the downside
there software is an absolute mess the
UI looks like Candyland or something
that took inspiration from the 90
I would suggest their software team to
take a minimalist approach kind of like
what NZXT scam offers but that could
just be me so at the end of the day
having looked at all the various options
for RGB lighting it's really hard to
determine a one-size-fits-all solution
at the beginning of this video I talked
about how motherboards and their
respective software protocols can be
easily integrated with LED lighting and
the rest of the components for example
drop-in upgrades like memory and GPU
would work seamlessly with the
motherboard softwares but if you're
thinking about adding components that
are specifically dedicated towards a
separate ecosystem say for example NZXT
hue lighting and their cacnea coolers or
of course there's link software that's
just something that you can't
necessarily control with these
motherboard software's and that's the
sad truth there's no real standard being
developed for native RGB functionality
that means people could end up with a
software for their GPUs one for their
motherboards and it's headers one for
they're attached cooler like NC XD and
yet another one for the RGB s on their
PSU or lighting hub it's a mess
basically it seems like everyone is
trying to lock you into an ecosystem if
you want to expand the RGB line to your
peripherals I think you should seriously
consider investing in a separate
ecosystem and just take towards that for
example Corsair does a pretty good job
syncing the lighting effects from their
gaming peripherals all the way to their
PC components so if you want a
one-size-fits-all solution this is
something that you could look into and I
think using a dedicated controller would
be a feasible option if your motherboard
doesn't support any sort of RGB lighting
say for example if you're using a z68
platform or something a little bit older
that doesn't come with or support or
mystic light or gigabytes RGB fusion
software you could use these dedicated
controllers and rely on those to get the
RGB lighting of your choice because
they're all connected to the USB header
but once again the lack of USB headers
or USB 2.0 headers and motherboards
could be a bottleneck when it comes to
adding multiple controllers except for
Thermaltake I also want to quickly touch
base on pricing because if you decide to
invest in RGB components be prepared to
pay the premium because they're not
cheap they are expensive and also make
sure to do the proper research so before
picking these components but
is you know some other boards vary from
one another depending on you know
they're lighting software and just the
way how they work so make sure that they
come with proper compatibility and once
you do that then I think you should be
good to go in terms of customizing the
lighting of the components with just a
single piece of software or maybe just
two software's so what do you guys think
about RGB lighting and the different
solutions that are available in the
market today
do you prefer going with a motherboard
vendor and their respective software
protocols or are you more comfortable
going with a dedicated lighting
controller let us know in the comments
