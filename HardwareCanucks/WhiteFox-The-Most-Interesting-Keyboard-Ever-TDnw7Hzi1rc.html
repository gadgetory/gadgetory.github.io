hurricane axe every single keyboard I've
looked at has been targeted towards
gamers I mean that's what we cover right
gaming great peripherals are typically
at the leading edge of peripheral design
and you know you can use them to pull
double duties for both typing and
fragging within online battles but today
we're taking a look at something
different and I'm loving it so far
Toshiba now offering OCC products that
are awesome and affordable like the RD
400 TR 150 and Vitti 180 that are backed
by advanced warranty program now
stronger than ever under Toshiba what
you're looking at is the white fox
keyboard from input Club now why is it
different
well that's because unlike many other
keyboards the white fox is designed to
be customized to your specifications
rather than offering in
one-size-fits-all solution the approach
here is much more personalized but it
also drives the cost up I've seen the
price vary from as low as $180 to $300
and while that is expensive for a
keyboard the first batch has already
sold out which is astonishing
considering the company is only a year
old but there must be something behind
such a successful launch and I intend to
find out what it is
input clubs white fox represents the end
result of a collaboration project
between mateos Bellini who is one of the
industry's most knowledgeable keyboard
addicts master op and input Club it
almost took a year to finalize the
design of this beauty and it looks
freakin awesome in person so what
exactly is the white box it is a
keyboard designed from ground up to be
compact but infinitely customizable to
suit whoever's buying it you can buy
either a pre-configured option or buy
separate kits to make it truly your own
there's the option to have cherry MX
blue brown clear green red and white
switches along with Gator on red blue
brown green and clear options yes you
will need to know which switches are
best suited for your needs before buying
but that's the fun part if you're
planning to build this keyboard there
are six different plate layouts to pick
from
but they only require one PC
here's a comparison to my Nexus 6p so
hopefully you can get a rough idea as to
how compact this thing is the keyboard
screams premium build quality since it's
made from a cnc anodized aluminum body
and features die sublimated PBT keys I
have never felt any keyboard like this
in my life and it's surprisingly heavy
for such a compact form factor plastic
keyboards now feel a bit cheap to me now
I love the simple and elegant design
- once again considering the compact
layout this cannot be considered a fully
fledged gaming keyboard but rather
something that fits in an office space
or if you'd like to carry a mechanical
keyboard around this can easily fit in a
backpack or airplay carry on but that
doesn't mean it isn't highly adaptable
though since even input clubs
pre-configured layouts allow for plenty
of added functionality through secondary
function keys the cable is detachable
and braided both connectors are
gold-plated and I appreciate its design
which complements the white and blue
color scheme I just wish the cable was a
bit longer especially if it's being
connected to the rear i/o of your PC a
quick fix to this will be to route the
cable through a USB hub and that should
clear up the clutter fairly well there
are a few extra goodies that come along
with the keyboard - and that's above and
beyond customizability that input Club
offers before you buy for example if you
prefer to adjust the keyboard height you
can install the included front feet by
removing the 8 top mounted screws by
using the included allen key notice the
attention to detail on this custom feet
they are rock-solid given the metal
construction but if you prefer to lay
the keyboard down completely flat
without them you can use the included 3m
rubber feet to prevent it from moving
only have I was only able to find three
of them in the Box the white fox feels
like a keyboard placed on top of a pure
aluminium slab the integrated white PCB
features basic LED lighting but you
won't find any fancy lighting effects
the keys aren't transparent so light
can't shine through them but the effect
still looks really good but here comes
the best part I swapped out the key caps
from my old rush g1 gaming keyboard and
it looked great with the LEDs on this
alone opens the whitefox offer a variety
custom keycaps elections but for now
let's just take a moment to admire this
beautiful keyboard if you'd like to
build a ski board from scratch you can
purchase the DIY kit there are a variety
of key switch options like I mentioned
before and once you've chosen it's just
a matter of installing the switches onto
the frame and soldering the pins of the
switches to the PCB there's a whole
video guide on input clubs YouTube
channel so I highly suggest referring to
that before you begin like I said before
this isn't meant for novices and
customizing the whitefox outside the
pre-configured options could be a
daunting challenge for some folks this
is a plug-and-play keyboard so
technically it doesn't need any driver
software to operate but if you want to
take things to the next level
you've gotta manually program commands
to the keys the steps are quite simple
you plug in the keyboard and press the
flash button behind the keyboard using
the allen key this enables flashing mode
and you'll notice the LEDs on the
keyboard turned off download the first
program according to the online
instructions this is called Sadiq I
might be saying this wrong once the
software detects the whitefox install
the driver
once that's done open up the online
configurator tool this is the best part
for me personally as you can see there's
a physical layout of the keyboard
followed by a different set of commands
that you can program to the keys you'll
notice that there are seven different
command layers that can be added on top
of the whitefox I didn't use all of them
what I needed we're the basics like
media playback commands and function
keys if you decide to use multiple
layers just remember to assign the small
F keys to any key by default the Fox key
or f1 enables layer 1 so that's where I
have most of my commands programmed just
remember f2 to f7 are directly linked
with layers 2 to 7 respectively there
are also other special keys like lock
and latch when you enable lock 1 the
keyboard permanently locks to layer 1
the same story applies from lock 2 to
lock 7 it won't go back to the main
keyboard layout until the lock key is
pressed again meanwhile latch is similar
to lock the main difference is that as
soon as you press any key whether that's
assigned or not all latched function
layers will be removed it takes some
time to play around with these functions
and the possibilities of programming
commands are
endless once you download the farmer
flash the keyboard according to the
instructions on the website and that's
it now you may ask why didn't input club
include a genuine driver software that
could have done all of this within just
a few steps and I totally agree with you
but think of it this way people who have
invested into this ecosystem can start
sharing layouts within the community and
this opens a huge opportunity for game
developers so they can start including
or adding special commands that you can
program onto the white fox or any other
keyboard that supports this process my
experience using the white fox for the
first day was tough you have to consider
I'm coming from a fully sized gaming
keyboard armed with a wrist rest so it
took me a full day to actually get used
to the more condensed design but after a
few days I was up and running given the
compact form factor pretty much all the
keys were easily accessible by my
fingertips for quick typing the slightly
inclined shape also takes a whole lot of
stress from your arm I'll admit I did
miss the numpad and the f9 keys that I
pretty much use all the time for After
Effects but for general typing
experience the white fox is simply
awesome
it may not be great for folks with
larger hands though I received a model
with cherry MX blue switches which is
definitely a change for me coming from
MX Reds take good notes though these
switches are loud
the actuations are a lot smoother giving
you a little bit of resistance but I
prefer using these for typing let's take
a listen
the lack of USB ports is a disadvantage
here and there were two of them on the
g1 rush it was a nice addition for
charging my phone plugging in a thumb
drive etc perhaps we could expect to
come back in the next revision also
don't confuse yourself thinking the Fox
key acting as a Windows button at first
I thought it was but I realized that it
was set as the f1 key in order to access
layer 1 for windows keyless users this
is an option but for those needing the
windows key L GUI is the right code and
as you can see I have it set to the left
Alt key so if I need to access this
function I would have to press the f1
key and then the left Alt key whitefox
configurator could label better you see
these are some of the quirks that you
will have to work around with but think
about it if someone jumps into a new
ecosystem it takes time to get used to
and personally I don't consider any of
these as deal breaking features but what
about you I want to start an open
discussion would you consider a
mechanical keyboard of this calibre
given the price personally I'm glad I
jumped into this bandwagon because my
love for keyboards has just become
stronger and it makes me realize that
customizations for keyboard are endless
and there's an entire community of
keyboard enthusiasts out there looking
to build or create the ultimate simple
and the most comfortable keyboard the
whitefox is just the beginning well
those have been my thoughts on the
whitefox from input Club whitefox man I
love that name I still can't get over it
so cool anyway guys thank you so much
for watching and you know let me know
what you guys think about this keyboard
I'm looking forward to hearing your
thoughts I'm you bored with how it
connects we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
