got another case this is the ROG Strix
but before we talk about that huge
thanks to thermaltake cool master and
fantex for making compiex possible all
right guys so let's talk about the ROG
Strix enclosure so this is 60% complete
on the exterior and the interior is very
much finished because it's it's a
collaboration between asus and in win
the interior is based on the 915 case so
make sure to check out our video about
it here but the exterior is based on the
Asus sort of chassis design they're
their core functionality and they've
really stuck all the types of things
onto the exterior and we want your
feedback so they this is like I said
it's only a prototype 60% finished so
let's go one by one to see what type of
elements you want to see on the final
product so starting with the front we
have an aluminum plating here it looks
quite elegant very towering effect and
this like the front section is kind of
reserved to the back creating this
little spacing I don't mind this effect
but the material for the top is not
consistent so if this is aluminum this
is aluminum but this is brushed aluminum
this is sandblasted I mean where is the
consistency so the front panel here is
aluminum there are two versions there's
also the glass one I do like how they've
punched through it so that we have a
little bit this unique text going on ah
well well well look who it is I didn't
meet you hi I just want to ruin your
video really quick I know I was I was
wondering if that was like a fan or you
just like super excited by the case oh
definitely not a fan
Kyle everybody now I do like this laser
edge design over here you can see a
little bit of that Republic of gamers
text we haven't seen much of that stuff
going on here Haber
I wanted Buster got my light so yeah
Oh oh my goodness he just like rammed
into a person and lost his battery
Bieber look what you're going man she
says all right back to work
laser range stuff let us know what you
think about it unique design you can see
the lighting to seep through we can see
the dust filter in there as well so they
tell us they're experimenting with
airflow options in terms of how much
spacing they would need I would say we
definitely need more spacing there now
coming to the tempered glass side panel
so here it is removable with a button
from the back I like this too let's
approach we have this headphone clip
that you can attach to the top of the
case I do like it because it is
removable it is low profile but in terms
of this glass design what do you guys
think about this sort of like a line
design on the glass I think it's good in
moderation you know here I think they
just went all out to see what people
would like and what would stick here
maybe a little bit of that but not as
much as it is on here so let us know
what you think about that now as for the
top design if you guys recall the tough
enclosure which has the handles this is
kind of the continuation of that
direction but here it's a single strap
that cups around and it's a kind of a
unique design because it's not
necessarily it doesn't look like handles
it feels like it's part of the enclosure
but obviously it has that dual
functionality of being able to carry the
case and it actually looks pretty sweet
now for the now for that now for the yo
now for the yo-yo it's at the top here
so a bunch of USB type-c obviously
that's kind of expected they probably
will have a button to change the color
cycling effects because this whole thing
is just loaded with addressable RGB
things there's actually a hub on the
interior so that will be connected to
the motherboard and you have that full
control through physical buttons and
through software so coming inside as you
can see there's a lot of things going on
here but this is just a prototype so it
they will change things around I'm sure
not everything will stick so a few
things that I do like
I like this cutout for the power supply
shroud that has a glass piece so you can
see what's inside this is their Thor
power supply so you can actually see the
waters in it it is RGB so it definitely
works too
you know with this enclosure the RG
Strix over here I like the direction but
maybe it's might not fit when there's
additional text written on both the top
in the front at the bottom so I mean
there's also the Asus chassis design
this it's a little too much for my
personal taste but let us know in the
comments of what you would keep in terms
of all these visual elements alright so
coming inside for the specifications
over here obviously ATX motherboards are
supported the 915 inland chassis can
accommodate anything enthusiast related
but the good thing about the the ROG
Strix enclosure is going to be much
cheaper because it is not based on
aluminum like you have on the 915 this
is all steel with some aluminium and
glass accents so the price point will
definitely be cheaper now cooling
capacity obviously a 360 at the top and
the front I do like how spaced out this
whole section is but you will have to
remove additional panels in order to
access it so that could be a little bit
of a compromise in terms of the user
assembly but of course this isn't
totally finished and we'll just have to
wait and see of what type of design they
stick with for the final release but the
one thing is what would you guys like to
see on the interior that is different
that is potentially user friendly to you
if you were to go with something this
large potentially go for water cooling
systems multi-gpu configurations
vertical GPU brackets you know what type
of things that you want to see more of
for a company that has not released the
case in 10 years so the ROG Strix as an
enclosure is an exciting development for
assist you enter that market because I
think we need more that use the unique
stuff but that is obviously only going
to be possible with your feedback and
support and lastly the rear side panel
is also glass so obviously we have this
like dual tempered glass aluminum
elements glass on the interior I
definitely love this low power supply
exposure going on but yeah this is the
ROG Strix you know little prototype
enclosure that we've seen here let us
know what you think of it make sure to
subscribe and check out this other
relevant content and we'll see you
