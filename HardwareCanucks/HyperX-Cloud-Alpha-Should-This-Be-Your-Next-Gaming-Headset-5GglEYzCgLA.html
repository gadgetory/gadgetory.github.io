axe and you guys have been requesting
this review for a really long time so
I'm just gonna get into it there there's
no need for a particular introduction
here this is the new HyperX cloud alpha
gaming headset
it's priced at $100 and supposed to
compete against the Logitech G 433 the
Sennheiser GSP 300 the SteelSeries
Arctic's 5 and much more if you're
interested in reviews for those headsets
I'll leave links in the description for
you to check it out so let's cut to this
review but first a quick message from
our sponsor choose be quiet to join the
silent revolution designed and tested in
Germany they're meticulous passion for
quiet PC components ranges from premium
power supplies CPU coolers and fans and
innovative PC cases all of which aim to
achieve one thing is this thing even on
that's right totally quiet power
supplies even under load silent winks
fans deliver awesome airflow with noise
that doesn't reach your ears all
enclosed in the package designed to be
quiet as always let's start with the
design and interestingly enough it's not
that different when compared to the
HyperX cloud gaming headset you get the
exact same red and black accents I know
red and black accents I feel like this
is the standard gamers color scheme I
may be wrong either way you get the same
color accents throughout the body
including the stitches on the headband
however God our the brushed metal
surfaces found on previous cloud
headsets whereas with the Alpha you're
getting a matte finish on the sides of
the ear cups with the hyperox branding
and I like that but I would have
preferred an all-black design since it
tends to blend in with other accessories
HyperX did sell the original headset in
multiple color configurations and I'm
hoping that the Alpha would receive
those options sometime in the near
future the build quality has hands-down
been one of hyper axis major strengths
even with the original headset and the
Alpha does not disappoint here again the
aluminum frame is very flexible yet it
maintains that structural rigidity there
are no signs of creaking and that's
thanks to the minimal use of plastic but
that's also just how well the headsets
put together the headband isn't self
adjustable and I prefer that over other
headsets that are the opposite that
feature metal frames about the headband
which would then result in River
and that gets annoying thankfully the
cloud alpha was super comfortable to
wear the clamping force was a very
minimum and I didn't notice head fatigue
during my usage so that's great
the adjustable sliders are well defined
and tight enough to prevent slipping
unfortunately the ear cups cannot rotate
90 degrees unlike its younger brother
the HyperX stinger that was one of my
favorite features of that has said but
it is something to consider if you're
planning to rest these pair around your
neck the signature memory foam around
the ear cuffs feature plenty of cushion
to prevent your ears from making contact
with the drivers this is an over the
year type of headset and the ear cups
provide a good seal around your ears and
they were very comfortable to wear it
does a pretty good job isolating
background noise plus there was a very
minimal sound leakage so you can
comfortably take it with you when
traveling speaking of traveling the
cloud alpha takes the crown for
versatility
the included braided cables are
detachable so it can easily be replaced
the boom microphone is also detachable
and it plugs into the headset via a 3.5
millimeter connector this modularity is
much appreciated as it's perfect if you
want to just use these pair to listen to
music while traveling the headset cable
spends at 1.3 meters and it comes with
an inline audio control which can be
used to adjust a volume and mute the
microphone they're easier to reach and
fairly distinguishable HyperX includes
an extension cable that splits the
stereo and mic plugs and it gives you
that extra two meters of length if you
want to route it behind your PC now the
braided cables are quite thick so expect
minimal king formation but it does cause
some reverberations when it brushes
against anything so do take note of that
they have included a carrying back which
can be used to store the microphone and
the headset so that's convenient
just like the Stinger the cloud alpha is
also cross-platform compatible meaning
you should be able to hook this up to
your Xbox one or ps4 controller or any
other mobile device that accepts a 3.5
millimeter headphone / mic input the
shorter cable is definitely a smart
inclusion and it will certainly help
with cable management in those
situations the detachable microphone is
pretty flexible for quicker
maneuverability it does feature North
canceling characteristics and it does a
really good job isolating the background
noise as you can hear I'm typing on a
mechanical keyboard and it does a
fantastic job isolating the noise my
voice sounds natural and
it's not too nasally so it should play
out really well for twitch streamers and
definitely Skype calls now let's
actually do a quick comparison to the
HyperX singer this is a $50 headset and
see how it compares to the cloud alpha
and so right now you're listening to the
HyperX stinger gaming headset and for
$50 this is an excellent pair
specifically for gamers who are on a
budget of probably less than $60 or so
the microphone is pretty good I mean I'd
like to hear your thoughts on the
comparison between this and the HyperX
cloud alpha what do you guys think was
there a significant difference between a
$50 headset and $100 head sent let me
know in the comments down below okay so
how does the cloud alpha handle gaming
or just casual media consumption in
general very well actually one of the
main key song features of this headset
is the implementation of dual chamber
drivers that provides good separation
between the bass the mids and the highs
to me as long as it sounds great that's
a win-win I really don't care about all
the marketing gimmicks now my initial
tests involves listening to music
specifically tracks that emphasize on
vocals because I'd like to see how the
drivers respond to higher frequencies
the cloud alpha does a terrific job
providing excellent definition with
regards to that with great separation
between the mids and low ends I wish the
bass was just a tad more powerful to
complete that experience it isn't
terrible though bass is still very much
present and if you want to you can
definitely tweak that with an external
amp or through a custom equalizer
next up gaming and boy I had a lot of
fun with this guy I spent a couple of
days playing Forza Motorsport 7 and
battlefield 1 have to admit it took away
productivity time but it was so worth it
so with battlefield 1 gunshots felt
boomy I was very much aware of my
position throughout the gameplay since I
was able to distinguish my footsteps
from the Andean environment playing
Forza with this pair was just incredible
take this gameplay for instance the
simulation had rain the cheering crowd
the camera flashes the tires squealing
and a lot more and the best part was
that I was able to distinguish every
layer as I was gaming and that completed
the whole experience and on top of that
you've got d comfortable aircrafts
pretty lighter body what else can you
ask for RGB lighting yeah no absolutely
not HyperX don't even think about it
because I'm still trying to wrap my head
around why implementation of RGB on a
gaming headset really makes sense okay
guys so I think it's about time to wrap
my thoughts on the HyperX cloud alpha
gaming headset you see there are so many
gaming headsets in the market today it's
really hard for the end user to pick a
proper one that would sort of encompass
and complete their whole gaming
experience the reason why people buy
gaming headsets is first of all the
implementation of a microphone a good
sounding microphone and the HyperX cloud
alpha delivers fantastic audio quality
in that department
you also can't forget that the
microphone is detachable so you can
easily toss this inside the carrying
case and just use these headsets when
you're traveling to work and just
overall you know it's a really versatile
headset I really would recommend this to
anyone who is looking for an all-round
pair to complement a gaming experience
but also use this with their mobile
device because the short cable is also
fairly a smart inclusion because you
don't have to worry about longer gaming
cables with some other gaming headsets
or you'll have to deal with now in terms
of sound quality the cloud alpha
delivers fantastic sound signature I
would highly recommend this headset to
anyone who's also looking to use this
headset as a media consumption up here
so you can easily you know you'll
definitely enjoy your time listening to
music watching movies and of course
gaming because that's kind of important
being able to distinguish the ambient
surrounding noises with your gameplay is
important and I think this head cent did
a fantastic job completing that
experience I wish that the bass was just
a bit more powerful but other than that
it's just an all-rounder amazing gaming
headset highly recommend this to anyone
who's looking for a new pair and we're
giving it the hardware connects damn
good award it's a really awesome stereo
gaming headset $400 great job HyperX so
I'd like to hear your thoughts on the
new hyper x cloud alpha gaming headset
what do you guys think about the design
of this headset do you think HyperX
should have changed it up a little bit
or are you happy with the way how it is
what do you guys think about the
microphone quality the first utility and
just your thoughts in general I'll leave
them in the comments down below on e bar
