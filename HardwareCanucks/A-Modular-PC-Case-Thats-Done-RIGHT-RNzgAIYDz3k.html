plenty of awesome things the Odyssey X the
new land cool 2 some prototype fans
that are all attached together let's go
check it out by huge thanks to Phanteks
and SteelSeries for sponsoring our
complex visit
alright good people so this is the
odyssey x this is Lina Li's answer
towards the whole movement forward with
the open frame concept and I really
appreciate what they're trying to do
here it is expensive the price point is
between 300 to 400 dollars but that is
only because so much engineering goes
into something like this because this
case are all the same parts as this and
you can turn this into the vertical
orientation or take this vertical
orientation and put it into something a
bit more traditional the price point
also reflects the construction elements
so everything is aluminum here we have
tempered glass
we have anodized little accents for the
i/o and they are thinking about
expanding that color horizon beyond the
black and red into titanium silver
bronze and I mean look at this I oh it's
so tiny but so pretty the the feet as
well and we have a Type C at the front I
also it is future-proof and I really
appreciate this whole direction of
customizing certain elements in the case
that has character and yet has a little
pop of color too
so the concept of modularity it will
come disassembled which is actually the
whole fun part of assembling something
like it so you can get you can basically
immediately start building something
like that or go into the original
orientation they wanted something
user-friendly for modders to removing
certain panels there on all on clips
easy to loose installation you can paint
them you can mod them you can cut them
and that's the that's the whole idea
they're really trying to optimize the
user friendliness in terms of converting
the vertical orientation into something
more traditional so for example the top
plates and the vertical orientation are
actually front panels when it's in in
this orientation front panel in here is
going to be the cable cover in the
vertical orientation none of the parts
are wasted so you're using all the same
parts and just converting something that
would fit into a different space and
everything is currently done on screws
and they want to really streamline that
procedure by using a little clips so the
Pano's with clip-in and you use only a
few screws so the entire assembly will
not take you hours but maybe 30 minutes
or so the only four parts that are not
shared between the two frames are is
actually this little mount for the
tempered glass side panel that you can
see is bent and that is so cool so a
little bit of airflow options in there
and gives the case so much extra
character and that is because you need
this angular piece into which you attach
the tempered glass panel versus the
original orientation as you can see it
is all flat so those are the only pieces
that are not used and not shared between
the two frames and so the whole idea
behind this case is water cooling why
would you spend $400 on the case that
supports air cooling they told us course
that is possible but right now in this
traditional orientation you have a bit
more space in front of motherboard tray
so you can mount a radiator on the side
and the front and at the top as well and
you have a bit more space in front of
the power supply verses in the vertical
orientation you have a bit of that
height advantage so what they they did
here is this massive reservoir on the
top plus a really nice thick radiator up
there as well in terms of the advantages
it's would be based on your preference
and the physical characteristics of
something that is angular and taller
versus something a bit more traditional
I really admire Leonie for going out of
the way to design something like this
because if you guys recall the rio toro
enclosure that comes disassembled and
you can actually expand the height of
the enclosure that was the initial
stages of what i would love to see more
of in the case industry explaining the
case options either size orientation and
format and I feel like The Odyssey X
encompasses all those elements well and
then we have the land cool 2 if you guys
recall the land cool one that was an
interesting approach towards the front
panel and that whole open options but
the Lancool 2 is taking it's taking a
different approach in terms of adding
more features for a really affordable
price point this thing is supposed to
cost $89 and under 100 bucks I feel like
it it's got a lot of competitive options
so first of all this dual plate option
to open up the sides so this way you
open up the the power supply shroud you
can access your hard drives this way you
can actually access the power supply as
well in case
like need to unplug something that you
accidentally plugged in too much and
this also has multiple functionality
because we have this indentation and
ventilation so they have fans mounted on
top of the power supply shroud and it
actually helps to draw in some air I
really like this dual panel approach it
cuts down on the cost and they figured
out a way to add functionality for that
bottom plate which is awesome but now
let's talk about the front panel so
first of all the lighting here is very
nice and ambient and that is because the
actual LED strip is between the dust
filter and this mesh in the front over
here so it gives the whatever's
underneath there a super beautiful glow
and look at what happens because there
are pins over there so there it's a
completely tool-less panel you can
simply remove it you don't have to
constantly connecting cables and that's
where an $89 case is actually quite a
rare to see and I start the show for me
would be this fan bracket that supports
up to a 360 mm a radiator and the cool
thing is that we have these little pins
at the bottom and those pins allow you
to actually rotate the bracket and
because of how the frame is designed you
can insert this fan bracket more inwards
giving you a little bit more space over
here before the front panel and by
rotating it it allows you to actually
mount the fans further inside I find
that a really cool way to give you extra
space on the interior or if you want to
have everything outside of the frame
that is also possible and I really want
to see more companies do this because
not only does it mean that you can
install things outside of the frame but
you have this whole modularity approach
of having something outside of the frame
or like this further in to give you a
more more space for course pool or some
water just leaked and that's for the
hard drive cage this is cool it's on a
rail system instead of being set to
locked locations with screws or little
mounting points which means that you can
literally push it in and clear up all
this space for push and pull setup and
you can pull it out depending on on like
how much space you actually don't need
and clear up a little bit room and from
the power supply love this approach want
to see it more often that's what the
interior one cool element is this cable
cover so right now it's in the standard
ATX position but look at this boot you
take it out you again rotate it
you push it back in the pins and now
we've opened up this area for an e ATX
motherboard while still giving you that
full coverage in terms of where the
cables will exit and they will fully be
covered I love these little details that
make the assembly procedure like they
don't interfere if you have a standard
ATX motherboard but gives you options if
you go beyond and coming to the back
they're not done yet with a feature set
man how is this an $89 enclosure
I don't know but okay look at this cable
management two plates one for the CPU
backplate one for this whole side
section can you see any cables
I can't we have dual assist these that
they're visible beautifully you know
behind the glass
they are also including an optional
hot-swappable harddrive bracket because
they're accessible from the other side
which means that you don't necessarily
need to come on here federal around with
your SATA cables everything is like
thought about it is this is optional but
I would highly recommend you pick one up
if you are actually using hard drive
cages and we also have these do SSD
caddies on this no floppy cover and
finally we have a more finished
OLM on dynamic excel rog certified case
a few changes here include they've
removed a lot of the ROG branding from
the front now it's just complete brushed
aluminum block and the only ROG branding
is a little tiny thing on the temporal
gloss panel thank you so much I'm
guessing this is gonna be enough
feedback from the community they don't
want something like you know really
branded a few more things include a new
SSD bracket that this tool is that you
can relocate from the back all the way
to the front and it just snaps into
position they've also added this whole
fan pocket which means that you're
installing anything at the bottom you
don't have to rotate the case and screw
in the fans or radiator now this bracket
is two of us again you can remove it and
install everything that way we have a
new extension for the motherboard which
means that if you're using that massive
15 inch motherboard you can install this
in there and extend that whole selection
they've also expanded the rubber
grommets whereas on the original it was
just on the corner whereas here it spans
beyond little little details that really
make a big difference they've also added
hot swappable hard drives at the back
the UNAM come included this is not
unlike an optional thing like we saw
with the land cool - that's what the
price is going to be $1.99 and I feel
like the 11 dynamic XL is going to be
that thing that people have really
wanted from the O 11 dynamic
originally something bigger something
that supports really large GPU blocks
and you still have the same sort of
design of mounting all types of
radiators on the sides at the bottom or
the top and yeah looks like a really
awesome case for water coolers and
enthusiasts alright guys so that is it
from Lian Li I'm really looking forward
to seeing the final Odyssey X and I
really love the budget direction the $89
price point tool and cool to the feature
set and everything there just feels nice
and complete so let me know what you
think about these two enclosure you saw
thanks much for watching check out this
other relevant stuff over here and we'll
talk to you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
