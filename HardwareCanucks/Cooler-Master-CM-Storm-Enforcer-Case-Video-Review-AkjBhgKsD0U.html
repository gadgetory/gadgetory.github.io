all-new chassis of 2011 under the CM
storm brand it's geared for gamers and
enthusiasts here we have the CM storm
enforcer a modestly sized mid tower that
takes much of its successful layout and
design from the cooler master half
series and gives it a unique aggressive
look the case rings in at $89 where
there's a large amount of competition
and not just from other manufacturers
but from Coolermaster themselves so
let's see how the enforcer stacks up the
exterior design is inspired by the idea
of an armoured soldier or cyborg while
it may not be for everyone it sits right
in with a unique gaming look that CM
storm products aim for and it stands out
among the sea of simple box towers the
front has a 200 millimeter LED intake
fan and behind the front door there are
four external drive bays with a three
and a half inch option front ports
include USB 3.0 USB 2 audio power and
reset I should also point out that for
USB 3 they are using the new standard
internal USB header connection but
unfortunately there isn't any sort of
adapter to plug into the back of an
older motherboard now at the top there
is space for an optional 200 millimeter
fan or dual 120 millimeter fan the back
of the case shows water tubing holes 120
millimeter exhaust fan 7 plus 1 PCI
spaces and bottom mounted power supply
if the interior looks familiar that's
because it's nearly identical to that of
the half 9 1 - alejo we know to be tried
tested and true and now it has the added
bonus of a black paint job at the bottom
we have a dust filter under the power
supply separate two and a half inch
drive caddy with support for two drives
six three and a half inch toolless drive
bays for two lists five and a quarter
inch bays and plenty of space throughout
the motherboard for cable routing one
fun feature of this case is the ability
to quickly remove the hard drive cage or
rotate it so the drives are
perpendicular with the case overall it's
a layout that works great for a
mid-tower gaming case it allows for the
most flexibility when choosing what kind
of hardware you want to install
moving on to the installation you'll see
the case fits full sized ATX
motherboards while still providing room
to work with larger video cards are also
not an issue with this case as it fits
11 inch long cards with the drive cage
still in place and if you need more room
simply leave it out unfortunately
something that we felt was missing from
this system was thumb screws whether it
was on the expansion slots or the
retention system for the SSD in drive
cages everything still continues to
require a screw driver despite its small
stature cabling and the CM enforcer is
surprisingly good there is just enough
room behind the motherboard tray to run
thick wires though you won't be storing
them there and the drive cages are
pushed in for extra storage though you
may have to get creative if you want to
use all of the bays and that is the new
CM storm enforcer Coolermaster has
provided a very unique looking case that
keeps up with the always interesting
design of the CM storm brand and while
it may not be your cup of tea it's sure
to get people looking if you want to
take it out in public the case features
great airflow potential for its size and
has an interior layout that allows for
some pretty serious gaming hardware to
be installed Coolermaster has made some
pleasant additions from the half 91/2
framework including a new black interior
USB 3 and more toolless trays
unfortunately given the fact that it is
so similar to a vastly cheaper half nine
one two it does make us have to ask the
question is it worth the rather large
price premium add to that that cooler
masters own award-winning 692 is just a
little step up in price and offer some
of the best features in this market and
you see the cooler master is kind of
competing with themselves so while the
enforcer may be a very good case it
doesn't necessarily represent good value
and that is it for this episode of the
hardware connects products
case I hope you enjoyed this review if
