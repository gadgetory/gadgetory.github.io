back to another harbucks review
so Corsa has really been aggressive with
trying to cover every angle within the
niche of enthusiast user friendly and
feature loaded cases whether one comes
down to silent oriented designs Corsair
has been really lagging behind with only
one under chassis so today we're
checking out their latest release the
330 are now priced at $99 this is a
hybrid between the obsidian 550d and the
carbide 300 are so similar exterior
design with sound dampening door that
can be flipped and because the plastic
resembles a brushed aluminum surface
you're not expected to pay the premium
we have two USB 3 ports audio jacks and
PR buttons are at the front with three
meshed find the quarter inch drive base
right below and remove a dust filter
that reveals and included one forty
eight millimeter fan now removing the
entire front cover what we notice is
spacing between the front panel and the
fan which courser has assured to be
enough for adequate airflow but also
notice these plastic barriers that help
to channel the airflow which equates to
less turbulent intake and more direct
air penetration a second fan can be
installed on the front as well and
notice there are additional venting
cutouts in the frame for improved intake
at the back we have an exhaust fan seven
PCI expansion slots and the magnetic
dust filter right underneath your power
supply we also have rubber case feet
that fit in with the entire silent theme
so the top cover is basically delayed
for the case which eliminates any sound
coming from the top with more foam
attached and it also looks like it
eliminates any top exhaust to be
installed because it covers both fan
slots but upon further inspection we
have these tiny openings for exhaust air
to exit now it's not the most efficient
way of removing air but there are always
compromises when you go silent the side
panels have much been improved from the
original 300 R with thicker steel and
more sound dampening material applied so
overall the 330 R is a well constructed
chassis regardless of the plastic bits
so on the inside the top of the hard
drive cage has been removed to allow
longer gpus and just to clear up some
room for
airflow but why not just have a frame
that is more open as all that steel is
just restricting airflow this is the
exact same internal frame as a 300 R and
it's disappointing to see that we
haven't seen any change the hard drive
cage has four tools caddies with SSD
support nothing unusual just simple and
to us assembly process now coming around
to the back very disappointed to see
there almost no cable tine notches which
makes cable management really difficult
as you cannot secure cables to the back
of the case also there are no rubber
grommets on any of these cutouts which
for $99 is inexcusable we do get two
centimeters of room behind the
motherboard tray which would suffice for
even a loaded build now beginning with
our assembly a cursor is one of the few
case manufacturers who include a middle
motherboard standoff that makes your
entire process so much easier
our GTX 590 fits in without baking in
sweat and the build looks very clean now
two things we would like to mention the
audio cable is quite short and didn't
have enough reach and second the mount
for the rear exhaust is indented a
little too much inside which may cause
issues with large CPU heat sinks and
installing that 8 pin CPU cable now turn
in case around we find unsecured cables
and potential for frustration during
loaded builds it just doesn't make sense
to not include cable tie notches as they
really help during cable management so
the new carbide 330 R is a good
candidate if you are considering going
silent as every panel is covered with
sound dampening material it is well
built
despite the plastic parts and actually
manages to deliver decent airflow with
proper spacing between the fans and the
front panel and small exhaust holes at
the top and of course the internal
design is nothing new and assembly is a
breeze however we hope that Corsair
would put more emphasis on cable
management as missing cable tie notches
are big negative especially in this
price point also it would be nice of
them to modify the frame at the front to
make more clearance for that airflow so
thanks guys for watching let us know
what you think of the 330 R don't forget
to subscribe and we'll see you in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
