development it's raining right now in
Vegas it rains about two inches a year
so we're gonna get exactly this amount
same amount of precipitation in the next
couple of days while we're here
rain rain go away Nixon alright guys so
we're finally here it's still serious
let's go check out some other cool stuff
over here so big sign and really
exciting new Mouse that they're
launching the SteelSeries rival 600 so
I've actually had it for a couple weeks
and I can say that it is pretty fine
mouse so the cool thing about this one
is its integrating a new sensor that's
sole purpose is to detect the liftoff
distance and that means they can
fine-tune it to a point where if you're
not exactly happy with you know if you
move your mouse a little bit too much
high up and it you know it changes the
the cursor movement when you place it
back down this will solve all your
problems and it's actually yeah it works
really well a few things that are kind
of unique about the mouse is these
modular grips so they pop out to reveal
some really interesting weight
modification system so you can install
weights along the mouse and you can
install them on both sides so it kind of
cool to really customize the way how it
feels and stuff and this really awesome
little rubberized pouch that holds the
weights now you're gonna have to see my
full review on it they're just going up
on Wednesday so make sure to check it
out I'll leave the links on it below
when it goes live but yeah there's still
serious rival 600 can I reveal the price
sorry I can't reveal the price just yet
but what I can't reveal are our sponsors
thanks to faint exclu master and Corsair
for making this trip possible okay so
now let's talk about the steel series of
the our lab we're showing off some of
the concepts that you would normally not
expect for a peripheral company to come
out
but it's actually pretty interesting and
so let's talk about this thing so this
is a concept it's a prototype but it's
their work they're calling it this still
serious Sentinel and it's a motion
sensor
who knew that peripheral companies would
come up with something like this but
they are placing it in there we are sort
of sphere of products but it's a motion
sensor that will be able to communicate
via this other Bluetooth hub so once you
pass it I'll be able to send either a
message on to your desktop that somebody
has passed emotion infection and that's
actually pretty cool because with
integration of launching specific apps
for example that would be sweet where
you pass by your office and certain apps
pop up on the screen or the lights turn
on and you know we recommended some
support the Google home or the Nano leaf
stuff because Nana Lee is supported the
SteelSeries engine and that means that
let's say you pass on the motion
detection detects that there is
something there and it turns the Nana
Lee to a specific color it turns them on
or whatever so customization options are
pretty cool and I'm really excited for
this thing and the actual finished
product or the what they want the
finished product to look like looks like
a little little webcam thing that you
can probably attach to something that
will have battery life of like three to
four months and it's Bluetooth oriented
and customization hopefully is on point
all right so moving into their VR lab
being further so one of the things that
SteelSeries is trying to do right now is
bring in the keyboard into your virtual
environment something that hasn't been
done really with the mouse it's not
really a mystery because you just have
it with one hand and you know exactly
where it where it goes but with the
keyboard it would be cool to have like
one to one you know render and actually
seeing your hands or some modeling so
you can interact with the keyboard and
virtual reality and you don't want to be
no put out of that virtual reality by
seeing like a really crappy image out of
the webcam but what SteelSeries are
doing they're actually integrating the
webcam into detecting where your hands
are and basically
cancelling out any anything other than
your hands and therefore they can model
the keyboard in 3d space using this guy
you know by 3d tracker which was placed
beside the the keyboard and then they
can use the webcam to actually detect
your hands and you can see where your
hands are in virtual reality where the
keyboard is actually so you get that
really good sense of scale and you can
interact with the keyboard and virtual
reality just like you would in real life
and the second thing they're also
showing out here it's also relatable to
the keyboard because they obviously want
the keyboard to be replaced in virtual
reality is this little camera so this
camera detects where your hands are
below the keyboard and it models your
hands in virtual reality with these like
stick fingers and stick hands so you can
basically maneuver your hands around and
because of this camera placement it
knows where your fingers are it knows
where the keyboard is and it also gives
you a really good representation on
having that sort of interaction of
keyboard and mouse and physically seeing
your hands that are modeled after these
like stick stick figures and so I think
it's a cool approach towards bringing
the keyboard side things into the
virtual reality because we haven't
really seen anything like it
and between the two approaches between
using the webcam and actually showing
you where your hands are and they're
just cancelling out the noise in the
background versus modeling your hands I
think it's a it's gonna be maybe they're
onto something but I don't own the wife
and I don't use the vibe in virtual
reality so for those that do what do you
think about this sort of concept
showcase obviously these are really
further really far ahead and development
but I'm hoping that they're actually
onto something and not just trying to
you know give us some extra content here
okay guys so that's it for still series
make sure to stay tuned for that
rival 600
you and let me know what you think about
all that vr stuff cuz I'm really curious
to see what you guys think about it you
know I don't own the VR thing so yeah
thanks so much for watching I'll see you
