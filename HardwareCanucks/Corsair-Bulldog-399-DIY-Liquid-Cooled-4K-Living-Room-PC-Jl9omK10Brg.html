thanks for the following sponsors
show them some love for helping us get
here to Taipei
the Corsair Bulldog has been teased and
teased for some time now and we finally
get a chance to check it out for
ourselves
this is the Bulldog well it's the inside
frame at least the exterior shell is not
finalized yet but it looks this way for
now these angular elements mixed with a
bit of color accents plus solid and mesh
panels and the Bulldog name because
apparently of the case feet but perhaps
all of Corsairs livingroom design
products will be named after a dog of
some kind up top there's a power LED and
Corsair is pushing this as a livingroom
pc for 4k gaming and we'll get to that
in just a moment but the concept behind
the Bulldog is to create a DIY
foundation or do-it-yourself foundation
so for $3.99 you will receive the
chassis itself there are new SFX power
supply the SF 600 of 600 watts with
low-profile black and short cables
perfect for the shots in design the DIY
kit will also include a mini ITX
motherboard that's right a mini ITX
motherboard will be included and we'll
know more information on exactly what
brand and what type of motherboard after
skylake finally launches and the last
default component to come with the
Bulldog is this low profile small
form-factor liquid cooler that utilizes
a large blower style fan behind the
shroud sucking air from below and
channeling all that through the back and
notice this h5s F cooler is not attached
to the case but instead is mounted
directly into the motherboard and so for
$3.99 you are getting a check mark for
compatibility you don't have to worry
about getting the right CPU cooler and
all that's left to do is drop in your
CPU your GPU and mount a few drives so
the value of the Bulldog DIY system is
actually pretty attractive and I gotta
say the interior layout is functional
the assembly process will most likely
follow a step-by-step easy procedure
GPUs up to eleven point five inches will
be supported I love the drive bracket
that can house triple SSDs to a which
can be replaced by a mechanical one and
they will also add a PWM fan hub which
is very important as
most ITX motherboards have only two fan
headers and so the bulldog can house for
fans in total also an important part to
mention is support for a 120 millimeter
radiator above the power supply so for
water cooling your GPU using one of
their all-in-one coolers might be an
awesome decision for best possible
thermals and noise in the system and so
it's a really cool direction for courser
I personally love the interior layout of
the bulldog reminds me of a bigger iv0
one from silverstone but now with the
low profile CPU cooler included and
potential for water cooling your GPU as
well Corsair has emphasized this is not
a final product still and sort of
designing and prototype staging but they
are looking for input on the exterior
shell and we would love to hear your
input on that and would you be
interested in getting just the Bulldog
case by itself without all the DIY
components so leave me comments down
below thanks for watching and we'll see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
