possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex and NCIX
without them we wouldn't be here the
SteelSeries arrival 700 I feel like will
be an extremely popular Mouse when it
launches it is based off the arrival 300
but with many tweaks and differences
so first the shape is quite economic for
right-hand use with the lit-up RGB logo
and swap all rubber plates the back 14
customization we've seen this on the
rival 300 before and it's actually
pretty good idea the side grips feel
really nice even though the texture
seems a bit large the rubber coating
fought Pleasant and my fingers just
lowered into the right position for
great palm grip and there's also you
know a pretty good claw grip as a
support as well so steel series has
included a monochrome display on the
right side that is always visible and
the mouse can be easily lifted and
repositioned so you can view it clearly
now this thing is hilarious because you
can input gifts into it that will loop
and if you're wondering what the
spinning head of Nicolas Cage looks like
or Shia LaBeouf telling you to do it you
can probably think of interesting ways
to utilize the display for your team but
they're working to have things like
stattrak built into the display to show
you how many head shots you've gotten
within the game maybe the total game
time and all types of profile stuff that
will be displayed on there perhaps
bullets fired or something along those
lines for csgo and dota 2 customization
doesn't end there with a swappable
sensor which will come with an optical
pmw 3366 which is considered to be one
of the best gaming sensors ever same is
featured on the g5 or two but a lazier
option will be available as well plus
the top surface plate will be
interchangeable for a different look and
feel like a glossy version rubberized
version or a metallic surface the cable
is removable with the snyder degree
connection and the only thing that might
not be to your liking is the weight or
theis that was the case for me it is
extremely heavy at 150 grams so getting
into csgo with it at the show required
some readjustment on my part as I wasn't
really comfortable moving such a heavy
Mouse as I'm used to mice under one
grams for csgo but the good thing is
that the rival 700 was very well
balanced with a fantastic shape so if
they figure out how to make it lighter
while still offering all the same perks
this would be a very popular choice but
one of the coolest things about the
rival 700 is a built in vibration motor
for haptic feedback so it will produce a
very subtle vibration if you receive
damage or produce a different pattern
vibration if you die in game now this is
quite cool as it really doesn't distract
from the grip and you can still use the
mouse as normal and so you get flashed
and csgo then get a lucky kill while
screen is white this haptic feedback
will notify you of that kill before the
screen goes back to normal and actually
think there's plenty of use with this
feedback but what do you think is it too
gimmicky with the display and the
vibration motor let us know in the
comments below thanks for watching I
wish you CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
