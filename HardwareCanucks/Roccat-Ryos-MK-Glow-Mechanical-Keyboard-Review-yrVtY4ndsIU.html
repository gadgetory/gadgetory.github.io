and welcome back to another review the
rocket has become pretty popular in our
office for the past few months we have
reviewed a few of their gaming
peripherals with positive results so
today we're going to take a look at the
$140 ryos MK glow a mechanical keyboard
that strives to continue that same trend
like the past reviewed rocket set of
keys the MK glow is big it's very big
and has a wide shape with that built-in
wrist rest and the frame isn't seamless
and the slim bezel around the key area
isn't all that comfortable and I really
would have preferred a removable armrest
to give the MK Glo a more compact
footprint on your desk this time rocket
implemented a micro dotted anti-smudge
surface around the keys that is quite
nice to the touch and does exactly that
providing that mad slash glossy surface
that it's pretty much fingerprint
resistant underneath there are these
awesome channels for routing your cable
and the most efficiently possible so
avoiding cable clutter on your desk here
we also find some rubber paths to
prevent the keyboard from sliding and
slight angle adjustment with retractable
feet now to the business end of the
keyboard here we go the first thing we
want to point out is that ryos MK uses
MX cherry switches this means n key
rollover with zero ghosting and 1000
Hertz polling rate as well each
individual key has an LED underneath
Auto backlight is not 100% uniform
across each key as the LED module is
installed on top of the keys however the
brightness is one of the best I've seen
still very nicely visible in daylight
now this specific unit uses MX cherry
black switches that are linear which I
personally love the black switches
require a bit more force than the Reds
and definitely need some time getting
used to but I do prefer this type of
switches for gaming now if you are
interested in other switches
rious MK pro offers browns blues and the
red switches now Roccat also has kept on
the best features from the SQ effects
that we reviewed previously that makes
Roccat keyboards very unique for gaming
the MK glow features easy shift plus now
this key replaces the caps
but the caps lock feature can also be
just renamed in the driver software and
this allows you to map any key on the
keyboard to something custom while the
caps lock key is pressed so basically
say hello to secondary commands the LED
indicator above the arrow keys will let
you know whether you are using caps lock
or easier Shift + and you can quickly
swap between these two using caps lock
and T one button the ryos MK glow also
features thumb master buttons right
underneath the spacebar giving your
thumb 3 extra button presses I think we
need to see more keyboards with these
additional thumb buttons as this allows
uninterrupted movement from your WASD
and the best example I can give you guys
is marking your enemies in battlefield 4
which is by default is Q which would be
interrupted if you're running left and
need to lift off your ring finger now
these buttons are of course customisable
in the software we further have 5
programmable M keys on the left with
on-the-fly macro recordings using a
function key and the f12 you hit your
desired and key type in your command hit
the same M key once again and you finish
your macro it's that simple the function
keys also incorporates all the media
controls plus brightness adjustments in
four levels now the software is actually
quite easy to use and full features one
feature we found very intriguing was the
LED illumination timeout this will shut
off or dim the LED after a set period of
unused you can also adjust the
illumination of the total keys assigned
sound feedback when switching between
profiles or just recording macros you
can configure the caps lock key either
for easier shifts plus so secondary
commands but also included the rocket or
compatibility which basically functions
as an extension to easy shift plus but
transferring the remapping capabilities
to a rocket Mouse as well then this
makes having both rocket mouse and
keyboard very appealing as this
complementary functionality could work
very well for gaming you can remap the
function key to a Windows key for your
productivity profile for example now
when it comes to key assignments the
ryos MK glow features the best
customizable software and layout in
for zone so your FG is your M keys thumb
keys and the rest of the keyboard
secondary functions of course include
macros but also built in gaming profiles
with the most common functions included
for that particular game the software
has rocket rad option that tracks the
total keystrokes as well as WASD strokes
in case you find those stats interesting
you can also win or unlock trophies
based on your usage these are just minor
carrots when you consider all the other
features this keyboard offers in
comparison but still added value
nonetheless the built-in flash keeps all
your profiles and settings on your
keyboard instead of the software now
overall the rocket MK glow is a pretty
decent package and that's pack a
powerful punch for those quality MX
cherry black switches individual elite
keys for a more uniform glow the easy
shift plus is extremely functional that
allows for additional customization
along with thumb master buttons that are
well located and will certainly come in
useful during intense gaming sessions
and the rocket software is well laid out
and user-friendly now with all that said
it does come at a cost $140 for this
keyboard is a bit more expensive
considering it lacks audio and USB
pass-through Auto MK pro incorporates
these features but for a $40.00 premium
plus the non removable armrest up to the
size and I don't particularly find it
comfortable now oh no the rocket rise
MK glow is a solid contender in the
marketplace even at an expensive price
point it has a lot of the features that
gamers would want and has the power to
deliver performance on a consistent
basis now we in the office liked it
quite a bit and the black switches were
a fan favorite so this concludes our
view of the rocket riots MK glow let us
know what type of keyboard you're using
and potentially have the chance to win
this riot and gate glow as always thanks
