axe and I had a few parts lying around
in the studio that I wanted to utilize
for my next work station to see so I
wanted to build a system with these
components to see if the switch was
worth it for my aging sex porn machine
the price of the build is on the
expensive side at over 2,000 but that's
because we're using some exclusive
components like this $14 memory kit from
Corsair and $160 a i/o solution for the
GPU
anyways this build can tear through
triple-a titles in 1440p and perhaps
even 4k but as a bonus you can also use
this PC for content creation purposes
without breaking a sweat so allow me to
walk you through the parts going inside
this PC right after this everyday check
yourself for the best quality sounds to
complement any lifestyle your ears
deserve at some Heiser momentum products
move freely with the gorgeous momentum
in years or styler dock with the
momentum in your wireless with the
Leatherneck band and up to 10 hours
battery life or fully zone out with
active noise-cancelling momentum
Wireless available over here or onto
your pairs enjoy your music with an
Heiser move with the momentum flow
details in the description below so the
idea behind this build is pretty
straightforward
I wanted it to feature an orange and
black color scheme without going too
fancy but showcase a few components here
and there and secondly I wanted it to be
powerful meaning it had to pretty much
handle every task that I do on a regular
basis that's including content creation
gaming and other productive tasks some
of the components that are chosen here
might not suit your taste but I'd love
to hear your thoughts on alternative
parts that would have been a better fit
for this build let's start with the case
I chose the be quite solid base 800 full
tile chassis that comes with these
orange and black accents and a side
window that's made out of acrylic but
not glass this case has plenty of room
to accommodate radiators at the front
and the top plus it comes with noise
dampening material inside that should
help with acoustics as well if you're
looking for more information on the
Cylon base 800 we leave a link to our
review video in the description down
below to embrace all these high-end
hardware we chose the msi z 270 gaming
cams
mother board this board is packed with
features like support for obtain next
generation you to connector audio boost
for pro that features two independent
audio processors with dedicated amps
you also get USB 3.1 gen2 type a and
type c port on the rear i/o and video
four slots waited for up to four
thousand megahertz operation there's
also three empty slots built in RGB
lighting alongside a dedicated LED
header and much more for the cpu we
chose the core i7 7700 k that overclocks
like a monster hitting as far as 5
gigahertz and remember modern titles
love processors with higher frequencies
so this chip would be perfect for that
task plus with 4 physical cores and
eight threads it can also provide a
seamless experience for content creation
our choice from memory might be overkill
for some of you but I seriously think it
blends in really well with the build
meet the corsair dominator platinum
special edition torque with 32 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory clocked at 3200 megahertz
talk about premium quality DRAM modules
and I think Corsair nailed it the hot
rod finish at the top traits of design
elements from the quad mode of Industry
and albeit I've never seen a ram module
disk kid ever before everything from the
brushed aluminum finish to the engraved
Corsair logo screens perfection it also
comes with xf e 2.0 profile out of the
box and automatically adjusts to the
fastest save speed for your kit to cool
the 7700 k we chose the NZXT x 60 to a
i/o cooler featuring 8 to 80 millimeter
radiator and what's unique about this
cooler is obviously that infinity edge
mirror display right at the heart of the
CPE block
it just looks gorgeous and I cannot take
my eyes away from it plus with the added
features like RGB lighting and various
lighting effects it works out really
well with the color scheme that I was
going for in the first place
storage was not really a concern for me
because I was easily able to hide the
reading close to 40 gigabytes Corsair
Neutron Tex beyond SSD at the back of
the chassis but it's plenty fast for
what we need and to expand our game
library I chose the Western Digital
caviar blue 4 terabyte drive so I don't
think I'll ever need to think about
running out of space at least for now
moving on to our most important part of
a gaming PC
bu we decided to throw a liquid-cooled
gtx 980ti inside the case because it had
the room for a 140 millimeter radiator
if you want to learn more about how I
replace the founders edition cooler with
this setup leave a link to that video in
the description down below but to sum it
up I mounted an X 42 cooler with the
help of the G 12 bracket provided by
NZXT and the end result were lower
temperatures and consistent clock speeds
well above 1835 megahertz we'll give it
to the benchmarks shortly powering the
entire build is the be quite straight
power 10 700 watt ATX power supply with
its 80 plus gold rating it can easily
handle extensive upgrades in the future
plus it boasts awesome efficiency and
guys it's be quiet so expect choir
operations under load thanks to the
built-in cell and wingspan and now
taking a look at the final build I'm
pretty happy with the way how it turned
out there's definitely more room for
improvement for example I would have
opted for the pure bass 600 TG mid tower
case with the orange accents and given
the popularity for tempered glass the
build would have looked even better but
hey I'm not complaining the Kraken
coolers are doing a fantastic job of
both cooling and showcasing the orange
LED lighting it's simple and it blends
in really well with the build so what
kind of performance can we expect from a
bill that costs $2,400
well I rendered a one-minute 4k video
using Premiere Pro CC 2017 and compared
the results to my primary six core
editing machine and the results do speak
for themselves I did over caught the
chip to 4.6 gigahertz and as you can see
the machine outperformed my editing rig
by 13 seconds it's not a huge difference
to be honest but when rendering larger
project files the gap would expand
yielding faster results on the 7700 K
compared to my aging 6 core PC onto
gaming and like I mentioned earlier this
machine tears through triple-a titles at
1440p starting with battlefield 1 at
14:40 pset2 ultra it averaged well over
a hundred frames per second
overwatch at 1440 pset2 epic gave us
just a tad below 130 frames per second
doom at 1440p set to ultra using the
Vulkan API averaged a little over a
hundred and 75 frames per second and
finally Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
wildlands
which is a highly demanding title
averaged about 87 frames per second so
there's no denying for the fact that
this is a very capable gaming and video
at MPC I might even consider switching
to this rig right after I published this
video because it's really that good it's
time to take illumination seriously with
vengeance RGB ddr4 memory by corsair
with incredibly bright LEDs and uniform
color spread add a touch of classic
color that is fully software
controllable and compatible with a wide
variety of intel and AMD platforms more
info in the description below so guys
there you have it I'd love to hear
thoughts about the orange and black PC
that's sitting right there beside me
obviously I could have brought down the
cost of this build by going with a less
expensive memory kit CPU cooler that's
air cooled and an aftermarket GPU
solution but do you agree with my
component selection or do you have any
suggestions that might have been a
better fit for this build let us know in
