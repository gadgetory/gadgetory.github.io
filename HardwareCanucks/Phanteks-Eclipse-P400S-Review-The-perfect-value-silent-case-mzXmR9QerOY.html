great technology selection and service
during CES we published the fantex
eclipse p400 preview which generated
quite a lot of hype for this new $69
enclosure and motor Pantex is really
trying to achieve here with the eclipse
line is deliver solid and competitively
priced options within the budget
category and now we have the full retail
version in the house and let's see if
our experience differs from that a few
weeks ago
this version is the silent edition or
the p400s with a window and as usual
fantex is diversifying your options with
three colors available black gray and
white silent window or silent closed
panel so you have a ten dollar and a
twenty dollar premium editions that all
share an identical building experience
and an identical frame the glacier white
model where the window is the most
expensive one at $89 which you could say
is almost competing with fantex own
lineup of cases like the enthu pro m but
they've actually managed to add value to
the eclipse line so it doesn't compete
with their own cases in this price range
so taking a quick look around the white
paint job is awesome the metal panels
have a glassy element that unfortunately
does not Gabri over to the plastic
covers at the top which are more matte
and you can definitely notice the color
difference these panels do help to block
out the noise and are magnetic so
they're very easy to remove and go back
and we've seen this type of modular
approach from fractal design with the
mauve ends but fantex includes optional
dust filters if you decide to populate
the top fans which will support a dual
140 or 120 million fans and given the
limited height of this meant our
radiator installation at the top is not
recommended or most likely will be
impossible with most ATX boards the i/o
is at the top with dual USB 3 on your
jacks and illuminate power button with a
reset switch and a three speed two fan
controller so only two fans can be
connected here and an ambient lighting
switch that illuminates the fan --tx
logo at the bottom with
ten colors available and if you're not
feeling it a long press will turn off
those LEDs there's a second connection
for the fantex LED strip if you decide
to add some extra ambient color on the
interior with those LED strips and that
is exactly what I've done here but
you'll have to purchase them separately
behind the front panel we find very
similar rail system for fans we've seen
this multiple times before triple 120 or
dual 140 member fans support and
radiators up to 360 millimeters will fit
given you remove the floor panel and
also the hard drive cage underneath it
but it does comfortably suit I thick
240mm a radiator with enough space for a
second row of fans if you desire to do
push-pull or maybe other water cooling
hardware there are dust proofing
approach for the front panel is
interesting one having these very small
mesh pieces one at the top and one at
the bottom leaving everything super dust
proof unlike the panel on the end 2 pro
m and there's also a dust filter
underneath the power supply the silent
Edition comes with sound dampening
materials applied on all exterior pieces
including both side panels the front
panel and even the top covers moving
inside you have 2 and 20 member of fans
included one in the front one in the
back and I get a say my color
coordination with this system seems a
little bit less conventional as we have
this blue and orange color scheme with a
white exterior and well RGB interior
lighting if you are building around an
ATX format with not too crazy of a
system you'll be very happy with the end
result given the power supply chamber is
fully covered which is a huge time-saver
when it comes to interior cleanup
we have rubber grommets that have been
added and despite having the optional
openings on the side of the motherboard
for installation of hard drives you have
to purchase the brackets separately and
a build like ours with a front radiator
renders those spots useless fantex
really wanted to cut down on any
additional costs so the accessory pack
is very basic and the user manual has
been reduced to one sheet which I
actually preferred this way instead of a
full booklet which you can still
download online and
apparently helped to reach this budget
price point at the back fantex includes
two SSD brackets and a dual hard drive
cage in front of the power supply and at
this price point I think the storage
options are totally fine the verdict for
cable management is okay we have these
awesome velcro straps around the
grommets but nothing in the front
portion of the enclosure so you need to
get creative with how you secure some
cables if they enter that area and to
some people the absence of a cable cut
out on the power supply shroud
underneath the GPU may seem strange
considering they've always been there on
their previous enclosures but routing
the PCIe cables from the back instead
actually gave us cleaning results and so
at its core the $69 frame and the
assembly experience is fantastic with
good airflow options and adequate
radiator accommodation at the front of
the case the more upgraded $79 model
adds so many extra features that the
$10.00 premium is totally justifiable
with the side window the silent features
the top covers and the optional the dust
filters fan controller although it is
only for two fans so they're all quite
well executed without removing itself
from the budget category making this one
damn good enclosure so that concludes
this review I'm Dimitri with hurich
knucks thanks much for watching and let
us know what you think about the P 400
and the p400s does it tickle your fancy
for this type of budget enclosure let us
know with a comment down below and if
you'd like us to do a showdown between
the s 340 from NZXT versus the P 400
from fantex leave a like on this video
and we'll make sure to deliver</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
