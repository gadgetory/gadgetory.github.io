right right around the end of October
Lenovo invited us to China to take a
look at their headquarters and see their
testing facilities and see how they test
our products and it was actually a lot
of fun but at the same time they also
invited us to give them product feedback
on their upcoming products for 2019 I'm
here at the airport heading off to North
Carolina to
lenovo's official headquarters here in
the States to see what they actually
have in the pipeline for 2019 so let's
go check it out
so we're here guys we're here in Raleigh
Durham North Carolina this is gonna be a
lot of fun you see back in China Legion
were there for a workshop just to give
them product feedback on their existing
peripherals their gaming laptops there
are pre-built desktop systems as well
and you know we also wanted to ask the
community for their feedback which is
why we posted that video see if you're
interested you can actually go check
that back but we're here now we're gonna
head we're gonna be heading to their
headquarters to see what they have
stacked up for 2019 and actually see if
those valuable feedback actually made it
into their new products so that's gonna
be interesting let's let's get on board
and and see what they have in the
pipeline for 2019
all right so day one at the council is
complete and have to be honest I am very
impressed work for the product lineup
for 2020 from Legion it's definitely
exciting I really can't wait for you
guys to take a look at it unfortunately
most of the stuff that we talked about
are still around and it looks like the
product roadmap for Legion for 2020
looks pretty solid and I can't wait to
get my hands on these new products all
right so this is the y740 from Lenovo
it's our mainstream notebook a lot of
you guys really wanted some content
around this baby so I'm here to provide
you a little bit of context on what
they're planning on changing with the
next-generation design which is the 50
series car so currently were you know
rocking the 40 series which is a Wi-Fi
42 Y740 that features the new RTX
reviews and the latest Intel CPU as well
so we've got a chance again like I said
earlier to take a look at their next
generation 50 series designs and it
looks absolutely gorgeous so I just want
to give you a little bit of visual
context as what has changed so first
things first the nose cam is actually
getting replaced or it's actually being
shifted to the top so they've actually
increased the bezel on the top to
accommodate that which is cool so that
way you don't get this thick chin and I
really like that I appreciate that
you're getting front facing speakers
which is awesome I mean that is just a
must-have on a notebook for me
personally the keyboards being refined
quite a bit so they're taking some
explosions from the ThinkPad series
because you know if you're thinking
about a laptop keyboard that's the one
thing they'll come to my mind at least
so they're definitely taking some
inspiration from that to implement on
the you know the next generation 50
series designs so that's awesome the
trackpad is also being refined adjust a
bit there also can be hiding a lot of
ports to the notebook to make it more
versatile for gamers streamers and
content creators as well and yeah just
overall they're you know adding faster
screens higher-quality screens for the
most part and just looking at this
notebook I mean Legion if you think
about it back in the day I mean I know
five years ago lonoa gaming laptops
wouldn't really not known for you know
having the best quality and of course
not the best performance out there but
now they're definitely stepping it up
with
the l√©gion branding and i'm really happy
to see a company like Lenovo taking you
know a feedback from just the overall
audience I mean does not just influences
but also you guys so the feedback that
you had from our previous council
session from that video it's certainly
been taken into consideration so they're
definitely you know they're definitely
open to that and that's something that I
really appreciate about a company like
Legion so we're just gonna head into the
Lenovo customer experience Center here
in the headquarters and apparently they
have everything from the old-school
ThinkPad notebooks to you know different
consumer products and a lot of a lot of
Lenovo guys a lot of Lenovo so this is
the consumer stuff right over here they
have a hold wipe of their phones and
their you know consumer related items
and then when you scroll back right over
here you've got all the ThinkPad series
which is pretty awesome and then you
know big few notebooks hanging up there
so I'm gonna I'm gonna shoot some b-roll
and you guys can enjoy some of the
montage let's do it
all right so we wrap day 2 at the Lenovo
Experience Center and it was an awesome
experience guys I hope you enjoyed the
b-roll sequence because I personally
loved shooting all of the old-school IBM
ThinkPads and just getting to feel them
and kind of you know just it just brings
back a lot of memories I remember my
parents carrying one of those notebooks
and it just I don't know it just has its
own place in history for sure but what
really stole the show was this IBM
palmtop PC 110 it was just so tiny and
very cute but the same time it's
actually the first devices to rock an
LCD 256 color display 4.7 inches
actually to be exact and it also had
four megabytes of RAM and a 4 4
megabytes of flash-based SSD
4 megabytes guys think about that 4
megabytes compared to you know terabytes
of storage that we're seeing right now
so we've come a long way in terms of
history you guys and it's just really
fascinating to see how technology has
grown in the last decade or so and I'm
happy to be a part of it for sure
so Legion has actually planned some fun
activities for the next few days before
I get back home I think it's a good way
to start off the next week so I'm
actually really excited about that so
now that the first two days of the
council workshops are over we are going
to have two days of fun first of all
we're going to start today with an
experiment if 'ti to kind of represent
the savage side of Lenovo products and
then after we're going to go go through
like a geek themed escape route so
you're gonna challenge you guys and see
what you guys can do and see if you guys
can break the record the current record
at the geek themed escape room
then tonight we are bringing you guys to
a VR lab so you guys can try all
different kinds of VR games so yeah
we're gonna have lots of fun there
that's a long list of activities that
she has planned for us I don't know what
you were thinking but I hope my body can
handle it if if not then I don't know I
feel bit if you guys be able to see me
next week probably I don't know but yeah
let's let's do this guy's well axe
throwing was fun guys but sadly I lost
which kind of sucks because you guys
almost had the opportunity to win a
Lenovo y530
but it was fun
it was really fun now we're on to the
escape room which should be even better
so we are in the escape room actually
yeah I don't know how this is gonna go
this actually my first time trying this
out wish me luck guys so we all didn't
get out of the escape room unfortunately
we were so close we were like 99.9%
really close to the clue but it was just
one thing that we didn't see and
honestly was fun escape room I would do
it again it's a great teamwork exercise
to be honest and I think Mike and
Demetri we should do it we should do it
again as as a team our next stop is at
the VR labs we'll see how it goes
all right so I finished my little quick
VR session and it was definitely a lot
of fun guys
yep beer is definitely something that
you really have to try out for yourself
to kind of experience the immersiveness
but this is kind of a really cool place
because it's a pretty large space with
eight different stations and the
interesting thing is you can have eight
team players
hop onto a multiplayer session and that
way you can sort of get into you know
interact and have a good time you know
just kind of finding different enemies
and whatnot so it's pretty cool if I
just walk you through this little
session here this is part two so it's
four by four and look I mean as you can
see it's good it's it's pretty awesome I
mean it's something that you really have
to look for yourself in when you look at
the systems that are powering these
they're fairly pretty decent I mean I'll
just show you a quick demo on what that
what they're rocking all right so this
is one of the system's powering the HTC
vibe and as you can see it looks pretty
pretty dated but I mean it has to be a
part where to to power something like
that ooh interesting enough I don't if
you can see notice but that that's
that's Trident II RGB memory of it right
there which is pretty awesome I don't I
can take a little peek inside they'll be
able to take a look at the specs but
that looks like an arrow arrow GPU MSI
hello hi hi there so it is the last day
here in Raleigh Durham North Carolina
and lenovo has a few things planned out
for today before we head off back home I
think we're gonna kick things off with
go-karting which is gonna be awesome
again this is my first time trying all
these things and it almost makes me feel
like I really haven't had a life but
it's also to try these out guys so so
yeah here's to more fun
so that was an awesome experience guys I
lost again but it was a lot of foot it
was a lot of fun I can't wait to do it
again with Mike and Demetri we should
totally do it again man
it's so awesome Thank You Liddell this
was great take your gaming experience to
the next level with Corsairs new harpoon
RGB wireless gaming mouse with its
advanced slipstream wireless technology
experienced hyper fast sub 1 1 second
connection speeds along with dynamic RGB
lighting for some extra Flair check out
the harpoon Wireless in links below our
last activity for the day is actually
watching a hockey game so I don't really
follow that much hockey to be honest but
it's fun to watch
I prefer hockey over baseball and
football you keyboard warriors can go as
much as they want but that's that's my
personal preference but today we're
watching who's playing yeah well the
Carolina Hurricanes vs. Tampa Bay
Lightning so it should be a fun game
let's see how it goes
so that game when decently well the
Canes lost unfortunately but it was a
good game just want to say thank you 100
for making this whole thing possible I
mean you know the first few days were
great with all the product feedback and
all that kind of stuff these after those
we're we're definitely awesome and I
can't wait to do this again so yeah
that's pretty much it guys hope you
