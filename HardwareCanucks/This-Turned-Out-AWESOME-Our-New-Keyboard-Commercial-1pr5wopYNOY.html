like d1 setup gold I did have to clean
up a little bit but okay so the last
couple of days have been a little bit
crazy with my what case size should you
buy video because I literally had like
all the cases that I have currently on
hand out in the office and I was trying
to you know compare them side-by-side
and want to establish really good shots
where each case was in exactly the same
positions the compositions have to
remain the same and yeah it wasn't
pretty
so right now I have just a few cases out
these are the ones that I'll be working
on in the near future so that is my
organized but today my friend we are
shooting something really interesting
for coolermaster a sponsor a 30-second a
spot for their new master keys pro line
of keyboards the new ones are the M RGB
and the s non rget white ones everything
else is already established and already
released but these two models are the
new one now the idea for the app spot is
a little abstract which is why I have my
suit out and yes I hope to capture
something really abstract in the first
part of that laptop and then bring in
the keyboard in its natural environment
them half shop it is in like this sort
of computer gaming setup but the first
part of that ad is going to be me
wearing the suit pretending the keyboard
is a piano and playing it in my living
room now of course the office is a bit
of a space constraint so I cannot set up
my white desk here with like a plain
background because everything is gonna
be very busy here so I had to move
everything into the living room alright
so let me show you what I have done to
set this up so usually this living room
is much cleaner this but what I'm trying
to do is set up like a very nice clean
shot let me show you what that looks
like here so with this without any
lights I haven't done my full lighting
setup yet but I'm going to be wearing my
suit I'm going to be sitting here and
start to play with the keyboard as the
piano music kicks in and I'll show you
the spot in the end the video too by the
way and
is very nice because it is overcast so
it's sending me very soft lighting if
this was sunny then it would you know
mess up my wife Valentin it was just
wouldn't look as pretty with like the
whiteness and just the cleanliness of
the frame let's see what I can do with
my lighting setup here because once I
turn off my turn on my softbox it adds a
little bit too much light and I wanted
to have this kind of type of silhouette
effect you know when the frame is like
this and I'm sitting here using the
keyboard but I want there to be no
overexposed background but I still want
to be like a silhouette with a little
bit of detail on my on my face and
obviously that you can tell that I'm
I'll be using the keyboard so see what
the that looks like and the virtual
business is - Sudha what we're paying
back there you go that's better I'm
thinking the green Thai suits the
keyboards better this is a little bit -
yes maybe the green let's go with a
green this is a dual camera shoot so I'm
using with g7 to establish my wide shot
angles and do all the Bureau for when
I'm getting ready and I'm using the gh4
wasn't for when I have to film the
actual keyboard lighting because when
the keyboard lighting is on I cannot
change the system frequency on a g7 but
I can with the h4 so that I can
eliminate all the flickering and still
shoot at higher shutter speed so yeah -
camera shoot GH for g7 save the day
so I just shot my first photo attempt
I'm going to bring the footage into the
computer and see how it looks but
totally forgot that my hair is a
complete mess and I also didn't have my
tie on so I have to reshoot everything
but also give me an idea on how my
lighting looks and we still have plenty
of ambient light outdoors I'm not
worried about the time it's done like
about an hour until things get start to
get dark outside so this is pretty much
how I work in terms of trying to
establish the shop see how it looks and
then maybe like perfect little things
here and there once I take a look at the
footage inside the computer turns out I
don't remember how to tie a tie except
it's a little chunky but I think it will
do oh yeah I'm so hot this is too chunky
for piano player is a great success so
this is a bit of a work in progress
after reviewing the footage while it is
authentic to have the cabled keyboard in
the shop it really doesn't make sense
for it to be in a shot so I've since
remove this so just a plain keyboard and
that's all you see in the shot and then
I will have a shot of me plugging the
USB in but that is really just to
highlight the the braiding on the cable
and like the little Coolermaster logo
that's also on there I did bring an
extra light in to fire also the size of
the keyboard because as I'm typing
because the full black body have gets
washed away by my suit so having given
it a little bit orange key side light
from this side kinda helps to separate
it and especially it highlights my hands
as I'm playing on keyboards so that is a
very good way to separate the product
versus the background and suck it out
and also I am very out of focus in the
background which is very good so the
keyboard the front row of the keys is
completely in focus
and that's the whole idea
so that was on the shop the problem is I
don't know exactly which piano music
I'll be using so I try to play different
variations of the speed on the keyboard
so that least I can match it somehow to
what we'll be hearing into the piano
music versus what I'll be sort of
playing on the keystrokes on the actual
keyboard so hopefully it was to match up
but I'll definitely have to find some
appropriate piano music for this and so
when you first see the keyboard in the
shop it might not come to you as a cool
master keyboard but this is where this
type of a little inclusion shots come
and play where I position my light which
highlights the keyboard beautifully
otherwise this is a little too cold
adding this type of light gives the keys
and the edge very beautiful highlight
and what I try to do is record this in
slow motion with my pinky or my thumb
sort of pressing on the cooler master
key in order to record the brand in the
shop they're somewhere like the logo
brand quite important for something to
establish you know the product of folio
product name and the brand
so the challenging part of the shoot now
is a transition period where we
transition from the piano playing user
you know being a little abstract to the
keyboard now into the its natural
habitat so I need to create a shot that
can be recreated in two positions
exactly the same so that's where the key
words will be plugged in and I'll have
this smooth transition that will be
inserted in there so that you don't
realize the transition that's happening
but you're immediately transformed from
this piano playing environment into a
gaming environment so let's see what
let's see how I can achieve that and for
the final shot that's pretty
straightforward I set up the tripod
camera exactly as I did in the living
room so that at least I get the same
angle of everything the keyboards been
plugged in RGB lighting all is on just
have to get the shot and do a smooth
transition between the two and not leave
the end of this shoot and so all that
pluses do now is actually show you that
30-second spot that I filmed you can
only rely on the pros do the job with
every keystroke satisfying like the
billions before
quite ill every key regardless of your
fate to remark the mastercase pro make
it with you make you feel so thank you
so much for watching let me know if you
want to see more episodes like this and
I hope after the authenticity of my
thinking behind the scenes process or
trying to do something creative so that
you get a little look as to how those
things are done and how much work goes
into them I hope you enjoyed it make
