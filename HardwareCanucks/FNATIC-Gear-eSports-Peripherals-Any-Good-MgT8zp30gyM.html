with a link below what's up guys I'm
Dimitri with hurricane axe and welcome
to another review today I'm a little bit
intimidated by what we are reviewing
today because we have a few peripherals
from one of the best eSports teams out
there so how do you approach something
that is backed up by professional gaming
company first I was a little bit
skeptical on what they're trying to pull
using their name as the vessel for brand
recognition and not really the quality
of the stuff but we'll find out more
today so more that is left to do now is
really just jump into a game and utilize
those gaming tools for precision and
speed
let's play some csgo you really have
this
Oh quite haddem so on the review table
today is a very familiar set of
peripherals this is from fnatic gear and
they say familiar because remember funk
gaming while they've been acquired by
fnatic and some peripherals have
transferred over we have the entire set
here which includes the flick g1 gaming
mouse the rush g1 keyboard and adduced
g1 mouse mat so let's start with a
keyboard first now I say this one was
familiar to me because it is based off
the funk KB 460 and nothing has changed
aside from a few software tweaks which
is a bit disappointing because I would
expect a tkl keyboard from an actual
eSports brand it is a very basic board
with some simple design it comes with MX
cherry red blue and brown switches with
a red backlight on the keys and an under
plate also for that cohesive undertone
and I think that looks awesome you can
adjust the brightness of the leds in six
intervals and there's also a built-in
breathing mode too there are two USB
pastors at the back which can be used to
connect other peripherals and that's
awesome the keyboard comes with a wrist
rest which is comfy and easily
detachable and shares the same
rubberized matte coating that feels
comfortable on the skin but easily picks
up fingerprints and such I do love that
the wrist rest isn't bulky in any way
plus I love that it is removable
although the attachment mechanism is a
bit finicky with these two individual
clips but you know it's totally fine
media controls are built into the F keys
and we also have a fanatic mode that
disables the Windows key when we talk
about the switches these come with reds
and I really have nothing negative to
say about these it's a very light 45
gram key I prefer linear switches for
gaming so there is no tactile bump when
the key is rebounding and you just have
to adjust to releasing pressure from the
finger so the key can bounce back which
is super fast and it's also a fairly
quiet keyboard even if you don't bottom
out let's take a listen
now when we offer the mousepad the
packaging is cool although I would say
it's pretty wasteful so much material
for so little of product it is a very
thin mat toe with the shape which is
also compact enough and the surface is
fine for tracking no problems there but
the bottom surface is ridiculously
slippery there is no grip whatsoever I
prefer something more stable like these
aluminum pads from in wind or simple
fabric ones and I'm really surprised
that the boost mousepad actually made it
into the fanatic approvals list since
land players they don't know which
surface we'll be playing on so the grip
is essential but now let's flick gears a
little bit and talk about the mouse
having the fanatic backing this product
made me really excited because you know
fnatic as a gaming company or an eSports
team day they should have some
credibility right despite my
disappointment with the mouse mat and a
simple logo exchange on the keyboard as
soon as I jumped into csgo match with
this mouse I instantly felt happy and my
expectations were met the flick g1 has
many fantastic properties its light at
90 grams you can flick away no problem
the shape is comfortable with all the
curves and angles and the right spots
for my type of a hybrid grip the
ambidextrous body allows left hand
operation but the side browser buttons
are only on the left side so there's a
bit of a compromise there the rubberized
coating feels good all the buttons are
in their natural spots the primary left
and right clicks you zom run switches
but they are more resistant than the g5
a2 or demonics caster but not by much
and it was easy to adjust to the
slightly heavier actuations the scroll
wheel is a little bit money but scroll
steps are defined
it's that rotation that could use less
restriction the middle click is light
enough to press in game and the round
button behind the wheel is very well in
reach for the DPI or profile change
which are indicated by these three
discreet LEDs
on the side of the mouse that's a
perfect - quickly notice your dpi level
when the LEDs are in orange and the
profile changes when the LED corresponds
to the lighting on the mouse wheel the
site browser buttons are awesome they're
in good place and actuations do not
distract from the grip nor the aim the
feet the bottom are on each corner
provide very smooth glide and at the
heart of the Fleck g1 is an a DNS 3310
which is a very trusted sensor within
gaming mice and used all over the place
by my onyx Zowie SteelSeries and Roccat
mice there is no acceleration no
prediction the default lift off distance
could be shorter if you move and lift
your mouse a lot but overall this is a
sensor that I can trust when my aim
needs to be 100% all the time
now maybe it's because I'm so used to
the performance of the 3310 sensor on my
other mice that when I start gaming with
the Fleck g1 it feels very natural and
the performance and the sensor is so
consistent that I can just plug in my
desired dpi my standard dpi across all
my other mice that use the same sensor
of 800 dpi and I can just flick away
play no problem
I love the consistent performance that's
awesome on the software side of things
unfortunately fnatic do not have a
drivers hub so you need to download
flick and rush drivers separately the
mouse customization is very basic
offering three dpi steps
double-click speed polling rate but no
lift off distance adjustment which is
very weird because it is not a sensor
limitation and this is such a
disappointment because the mouse becomes
unpredictable when you place it back
down on the surface and this is a very
odd omission again because the sensor
can be controlled to adjust for that on
other mice but apparently not on the
mouse that is behind an eSports brand
it's completely ridiculous
moving on to' you have three profiles
and color customization with a few
effects that only applies to the scroll
wheel and all this is saved onto the
mouse itself effectively allowing you to
do a one-time setup and forget about the
drivers the keyboard drivers following a
similar simple suite giving you a chance
to create profiles with macros on any
key of the keyboard which I guess is
that hidden gem if you're all about
those macros and so this entire set of
fnatic peripherals enters a highly
competitive arena with the rush keyboard
dating back to three years ago which
makes me think it needs a price drop you
can acquire many similar MX cherry
boards for under 100 bucks that function
in the same way but other than that the
rush is a satisfying keyboard for those
who want simplicity but if only it
wasn't this expensive the flick gaming
mouse though I think is what will hold
the fnatic gear brand it is priced very
well at 49 bucks which is probably the
most Buy in this price range as long as
you can get used to the set
liftoff distance but overall I think
it's a very good direction for a fanatic
to acquire funk because at least now
they have a solid foundation to grow
from with all these peripherals but now
I want to see a Tiki on keyboard and
maybe a different shaped Mouse please
but that is it for this review then
guess much for watching if you enjoyed
