about four weeks now and I'm still
compiling my thoughts about this
smartphone so expect my long term of you
some time later now I didn't want you
guys to hang in until then for some
content around this device so I decided
to focus on one of the key aspects of
the s10 the cameras now I'm also aware
of Huawei's recently announced P30 Pro
and it's incredible camera system I'm
hoping to get my hands on the device
soon so if you're interested in a
comparison between the S10 and the P30
pro let us know in the comments down
below
switching gears to S10 recently I got a
chance to test the cameras to its
absolute best on my recent trip to the
States and it was a lot of fun exploring
the setup but at the same time also
taking a closer look at the detail and
evaluating things like color low-light
performance video quality as well so
let's take a look at that right after
message from our sponsor the new razer
blade 15 is a machine for people who
know exactly what they want when you
need a reliable keyboard and one custom
lighting when you need an accurate
display and what insanely fast 144 Hertz
refresh rate when you need a portable
machine and want a gorgeous thin
aluminum unibody in the world's smallest
15.6 inch gaming laptop when you need
powerful gaming hardware to truly
dominate with GeForce rtx the Razer
Blade 15 when you need the power for
anything you do and will nothing to hold
you back check out the configuration you
want down below okay so just to refresh
your memory the s10 has a standard wide
angle 12 megapixel sensor with a
variable aperture mode that shifts
between F 1.5 and 2.4 remember it's the
exact same setup found on the s9 then it
has a 12 megapixel telephoto lens with
an F 2.4 aperture and it's 2 times the
optical zoom range of a standard
wide-angle lens the interesting addition
to the s10 this year is the 16
megapixel ultra wide-angle lens with a
field of view of a hundred and 23
degrees we first saw this feature with
LG's G series of phones and I guess it
was just a matter of time for Samsung
and a few other brands to adapt this
feature before I get to the results I do
want to quickly talk about the user
interface it's pretty simple and easy to
get accustomed to so you can quickly
switch between different lenses by
simply tap
on the respective ones you can also
switch between different modes like life
focus video pro mode that gives you full
control of the shutter speed ISO white
balance etc there are also some
slow-motion capabilities built in into
the s10 and it's very fast in switching
thanks to the powerful specs baked in
there also some filters headed to the
app which i think is completely
pointless in my opinion but you may like
them especially if you're into selfies
and things like beauty mode shaun
suggestions is also a really cool
feature added to the s10 it's
essentially on-screen guides to help you
line up for straight compositions
there's also scene optimizer that
identify certain subjects in the
background and it optimizes the color
for that particular subject
I personally ended up turning it off
because I wanted to get the true
representation coming out of these
sensors now I shot all of these photos
in auto mode with HDR turned on and as
you can see it's pretty darn impressive
in well-lit situations for example in
this shot the colors a nice and vibrant
not super saturated there is a good
balance between the highlights and the
shadows
thanks to HDR of course if you're into
food photography the s10 shouldn't
disappoint to you again it does a really
good job capturing colors and honestly
portraying what it looks like in real
life
however low-light performance isn't
really the S10's Forte as you can see
the detail completely falls apart around
the branches it also does tend to soften
the image as well but on a good note it
still manages to capture true to life
colors the additional wide-angle lens is
by far my favorite feature on the
instant it comes in really useful in
certain situations especially if you
need to get a lot of subjects in the
frame I mean take a look at this shot I
recently got the chance to watch a
hockey game and I wanted to share the
ambience or the excitement level in the
arena and I was able to do that with the
s10 and the result look absolutely
spectacular
here's another first-person perspective
of me go-karting and again by taking
advantage of the ultra wide-angle lens
it just really gives you a cool
perspective and I loved it now the
telephoto lens can be used to take
interesting abstract images if you're
looking for good symmetry and best part
is that you still get great dynamic
range and color rendition so nothing to
complain here it still manages to keep
consistent colors as well as
detail but albeit samsung's
post-processing on all of these photos
are a tad aggressive in my opinion but
really if you need that extra reach
especially with sports photography the
extra telephoto lens could be an awesome
feature to take advantage of here's the
same shot with the standard wide-angle
lens and boom ultra wide and I took
these in a matter of seconds which is
just impossible with a traditional DSLR
or mirrorless camera then there's macro
shooting and it's absolutely incredible
I use the telephoto lens to get as close
as possible to the subject and the
results as you can see are quite amazing
the subject isn't focused the colors are
really nice and this is something that
you really can't achieve with a single
lens setup on a smartphone and listen
until if you decide to go for
third-party lens mounting accessories
alright so I also want to compare the
s10 to my pixel 3 to see how it actually
does and the one thing that I found in
common throughout this comparison is the
fact that the pixel just takes the edge
in the detail Department compared to the
s10 but again that's only if your pixel
peeping in low-light scenarios it's a
hard pick to be honest because on one
hand the pixel is a bit sharper but the
s10 is more true to life in terms of
colors speaking of colors that's another
aspect that I really wanted to talk
about because the s10 leans towards more
on a neutral side which is you know
either cooler or warmer again it's a hit
or miss depending on the situation
whereas the pixel again it takes the
lead with detail and in some cases it
just processes the image especially in
the colors when it comes to the greens
and the purples because it starts to
increase the it starts to add a lot more
magenta to the image in some cases as
well so again I'm glad that they're a
third party photo app so that you that
can be used to edit these photos and
kind of you know enhance it the way you
want it to look but if you're looking
for the best colors out of the box the
s10 takes the edge here but let us know
what you prefer in the comments down
below I also got a chance to test
portrait mode on both devices Samsung
calls it live focus which allows you to
adjust the blur in the background in
real time which is pretty neat and as
you can see both cameras look pretty
good personally I like the field of view
of the s10 as its not super close as a
subject come
to the pixel that actually crops into
the sensor to achieve the effect here's
another shot in with good lighting I
want to say that edge detection still
has a long way to go on both cameras but
I still do like the image coming out of
the pixel the front-facing cameras are
great on both devices
um the s10 likes overexposing just a
bit and it also likes to smooth my face
by like 10 percent which may or may not
be a good thing whereas the pixel just
takes the edge here since you know it
has two front-facing cameras one which
gets you the traditional wide-angle and
an ultra wide-angle lens as well and it
captures great detail dynamic range and
colors as well I also got a chance to
test out nightscape on the pixel 3 to
see how it actually plays out compared
to the s10 and as you can see there's
clearly a huge difference between the
two the incident does have a night mode
built inside the scene optimizer feature
but it only turns on when it detects
that the subject is in pitch black so
there isn't a dedicated night mode like
what you'd find on the pixel and as you
can see the colors and the detail just
more better on the pixel compared to the
s 10 so this is the rear facing video
test on both these devices and as you
can tell probably see the pixel 3 is
more leaning
a cooler tone whereas the galaxy is 10
is more true to life and naturally this
kind of
really beautiful out here in New York
City so that's another thing also it's
also a good representation on what the
microphone sounds like I want a nerd
thoughts about that in the comments
lastly I do want to cover on the
compactor pixel three props it a little
bit on the sensor which could be a
limitation for somebody out there
whereas the galaxy s10 has the ability
to switch between the ultra wide-angle
lens as well as the telephoto and the
wide-angle lens but do keep in mind that
I can only be done when you're shooting
in 1080p and 4k at 30 frames per second
we can't do it in 4k at 6 TV movie
you'll wear to the front-facing camera
test this is exactly what you're gonna
be getting out of the box without any
filters anything applied I feel like the
microphone on the pixel is just a bit
muted in terms of dynamic range the s10
steals a show here I think the pixel is
just a bit more overexposed I mean the
galaxy s10 has a good balance between
the highlights and the shadows and you
also get again more true-to-life image
compared to the pixel so I when it comes
to video quality overall I go with the
s10 any time of the day you gotta
appreciate the smooth and engaging sound
with massdrop hifiman he-4xx planar
magnetic headphones that sound amazing
without a fancy amp and they're built to
satisfy your ears and not destroy your
wallet check out the drop down below so
this brings us to the conclusion and
honestly I really enjoyed my time
playing around the estin and the cameras
of course now do I see myself taking
advantage of all three lenses absolutely
because having that ultra wide-angle
lens is so awesome especially if you
want to capture something interesting
especially when it comes to different
events if you are someone who likes
adventure photography then I think the
ultra wedding lens is absolutely a great
implementation because you don't have to
worry about carrying a mirrorless camera
or DSLR camera with multiple lenses
because you have all of those three
implemented in a single package sure it
doesn't have the best quality in the
detail Department but honestly for
social media and sharing pictures online
for that kind of stuff it will get the
job done that's
that's what it is so let me know what
you guys think about the camera
comparison or I guess the quality coming
out of the s10 in the comments down
below I looked in your thoughts about it
and what are your expectations for a
smartphone especially in 2019 in the
camera department do you prefer having
these three lenses or are you just okay
with an ultra wide-angle lens and a
standard wide-angle lens I want to know
your thoughts about down two comments I
mean where the Hydra connects thank you
