is brought to you by and see IX
technology connected ok so hey guys we
are here at CES 2014 in the funk booth
so they have a couple things laid out
here so let's go ahead and first check
out the funk ms3 mouse we've taking a
look at this we've reviewed this in the
past and it's actually quite popular
mouse for gamers because of this
ergonomic design it supports for your
ring and pinky finger a very nice
support for your hand and also the thumb
support so fully economic design for the
gamer the buttons feel really nice there
they have provided very nice feedback
they're not not too hard and the
probable but squishy feel so it doesn't
completely stop the button which is
always nice to see it is sitting on the
the funk mouse pad which is reversible
so we have a slightly harsha surface and
the more smooth surface depending on the
surface that you prefer and this would
be ideal with the type of sensitivity
again that you play with both of which
provide different type of sensitivity
feel for your laser mouse next is the kb
460 we're mkb 460 so this is their
mechanical keyboard we've taken a look
at this as well in the past and you know
it's a fully mechanical keyboard a nice
red backlight and the rubberized surface
so excellent but what is exciting about
funk in this suite today at CES 2014 is
their new headset so they are expanding
into audio which is awesome to see
especially for a gaming company that has
produced these excellent peripherals in
the past so this is the HS 260 as you
can tell it is nothing flashy it's a
very simple and elegant design I do like
this we have a fool of you coming out
later in the month a very awesome
feature about this headset is it's only
79 99 99 so eighty dollars for a gaming
headset this sort of the sweet spot to
things so it has a removable cable like
this and has a removable microphone as
well so let me take this out so
depending on how you are depending on
where the cable is running and depending
on your desk you can swap the cable so
it's not a source it's not on in the the
table and it will go in the direction of
your computer either left or right so
this is an excellent feature to see the
microphone is immutable with a button
and below it has a volume control on the
actual ear cup so you don't have to
reach out for any anything else but your
headset and it's very easy to sort of
feel exactly where it is and it also
features two types of ear cups so we
have the original leather leather cups
and sort of this more open design and
the earcups just simply pop off and it's
very simple to put them back on so 799
the review is coming out shortly later
in a month so this is all from funk that
we've seen here at CES 2014 so hopefully
this headset this headset is able to
deliver to sort of the gamer
expectations but so far from what we've
seen here at CES we like it so hope you
guys enjoy our CES 2014 coverage don't
forget to subscribe to see what else we
have in store for you here at CES 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
