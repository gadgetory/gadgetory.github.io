weird making in Computex video without
actually being in taipei yet but I love
complex because we can reunite as a team
meet amazing people amazing food and
Taipei is just awesome but back to the
topic at hand what el gato is announcing
is a virtual mobile Stream Deck so the
original stream like the physical Keys
lets you customize different shortcuts
for streaming for gaming for editing for
whatever you want
software is intuitive and they come in
different sizes but now that sort of
application is going to be available on
your iOS device which is pretty cool
let's check it out but first the huge
thanks to our sponsors Phantex and
SteelSeries for making our Computex trip
possible alright so for all of our
streaming gurus elgato is announcing a
new stream deck excel with 32 keys which
has more than double what was previously
available on the lower end models for
the 6 and the 15 keys and that is
because people have been buying 215 key
sets and setting them up the way they
want and now we have the 32 option which
is pretty awesome for customization of
anything you want especially because you
can create folders within each key and
then customize that per application it
is a $250 part which is expensive but
considering the 15 key set sells for
$149 it seems like a pretty decent deal
but the thing that I'm actually more
excited about is the stream deck mobile
it is available only on iOS right now no
Android support sorry guys
you know iOS for life for life Android
for life yeah but you can get stream
deck mobile on on the Android
well it'll soon be announced so the set
up on the iPhone is actually pretty
straightforward you scan a code on your
computer it matches as long as you're on
the same Wi-Fi network and I've created
myself a little touch bar situation that
I can use in conjunction with my Razer
Blade 15 and it's actually pretty
awesome you can go in portrait mode or
landscape and they rotate there's a
little haptic feedback when you press
the keys love vibrations so you know
when the key has been registered plus a
visual indication of the key actually
going in just like you would experience
on the actual physical stream deck and
so what is the main use case scenario
for
something that is on your phone you
don't need another physical device if
you are trying to go after some
customization and shortcuts for any of
your programs and the cool thing is here
I've created an editing profile
shortcuts within the app so I go into
editing and all my shortcuts are here
it's can sit beside my laptop as I work
and can activate multi key commands like
opening the screen or linking and
unlinking footage something that doesn't
require me to reach different keys that
are far away from each other everything
can be set up on the stream deck mobile
app and that has been actually pretty
convenient especially because there is
no lag or input from here from the time
when the actual shortcut is activated on
the computer so we do get 15 buttons but
you can create folders within folders
granting you unlimited access and
customization for all types of
applications and I'm just I'm just
scratching the surface of what I'm able
to do in the short period of time on
something that I will actually be using
from now on and that is pretty
incredible now the thing is we were
joking with the guys that next thing you
have to consider would be an iPhone
stand and something that that you can
interact with and I feel like the whole
point of this stream that mobile service
is to really tease you on what is
possible with customization within the
stream deck software and the whole
ecosystem and potentially push you over
the edge to go and buy the physical
product and that brings us to price this
is subscription service based through
your Apple ID so $3.99 per month or $32.99 per year it's almost like they're
competing with themselves because they
don't really have competition but 30
$2.99 per year versus buying a 15 key
for $150 you can deftly try this before
committing to a physical product and
potentially you might not even want one
since the economics of this being in
front of your monitor especially if you
have a good stand and the visibility of
it and the size too might be a better
way to go then go in the physical route
now I have the stream deck mini the six
key version I've actually customized it
to turn on my lights to take screenshots
and other miscellaneous things that I do
here and there but that has to be
plugged in via USB it occupies space on
my desk versus the app I can literally
open that anytime I want when I'm in my
household because there
things connected to the same network I
can literally do things without being in
that physical space and that is a big
benefit for me but guys I'm not a
veteran stream deck user therefore can
tell you this is the best value or it's
an amazing product but if you do use the
physical keys would you consider going
for the subscription service or not and
you can use them in conjunction with the
physical modules as well and the fact
that you have that monthly trial gives
you an opportunity to try it before
committing to either the physical one or
going on with the annual subscription
service all right that's it from Elgato
thanks much for watching make sure to
subscribe and check out this other
relevant stuff from Computex I'll talk
to you in the next video we got we're
getting claps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
