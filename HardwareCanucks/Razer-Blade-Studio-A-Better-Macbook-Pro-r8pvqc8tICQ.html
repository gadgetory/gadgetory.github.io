blade studio a lineup of notebooks now
it's really interesting about this
particular lineup is it Razer is
actually implementing in videos new
Quadro RTX graphics cards what does
that mean well if you're really into
series content creation like if you're
working in a studio environment
particularly movie industry or if you're
someone who's you know particular
workflow requires heavy cuda processing
or if it requires a lot of CUDA cores
and of course if you're getting into
ray-tracing and development all that
kind of stuff this is something that you
might be interested in so let's take a
look at the blade studio right after
message from our sponsor huge thanks to
fan text and SteelSeries for making
Computex 2019 possible ok so I do need
to give you guys a little bit of context
as to where the blade is to do a lineup
of notebooks stack up within the rest of
the notebook competition you see this is
not really a gaming notebook because of
the hardware that's featured it's really
like I said gear for a lot of people who
are serious about their you know
particular workflow so if you're working
with a lot of rendering programs or if
you're you know in a movie industry not
to mention considering the power that
these notebooks feature I don't think
it's gonna do that great in terms of
battery life plus it's also not a
significant update in terms of design
from the existing mainstream laptops and
what do I mean by that well as you can
see by these press images the blade
studio 15 and the blades 317 come in
this anodized white mercury finish
unfortunately you're not gonna be
getting the matte black variant I like
what you can find on the blade 15 and
the plate pro 17 notebooks which are
getting the mainstream options that
razer offers what really matters is the
specs inside so the starters the 15 inch
notebook will feature a core i7 and 9750
h 6 quart welter at CPU so the same
found on the blade 15 but the 17 inch
notebook will feature the core I 9 98888
core 16 threaded monster so that's 2
extra cores compared to the blade pro 17
notebook and do keep in mind that this
is a 45 watt CPU so cooling is certainly
something that I'm interested in I mean
considering the size of the chassis it
shouldn't have a problem but I'm
interested to see how far it can or how
well it can cool this core i9 chip but
at the same time I'm also interested to
see how the clock speeds bear
and you know in this setup considering
that it's eight cores and sixteen
threads the reason I say this is because
Apple just recently rolled out this new
eight core 16 threads chip into their
MacBook Pros and from the recent
performance analysis that I've been
looking online it just looks like the
chassis just can't handle the powerful
CPU something else that really caught my
attention is the new blade student
lineup of notebooks don't have support
for Intel Xeon processors or ECC memory
support and I feel like ECC is pretty
important especially for serious content
creators because if you're rendering you
know intensive 3d assets or something
like that
ECC memory can come in super beneficial
and I'm certain I'm pretty sure that
certain applications will take advantage
of ECC so it is interesting and if
you're someone who's working in the
creative industry let me know your
thoughts about you know whether or not
if ECC memory is valuable particularly
in your workflow the rest of the specs
includes 32 gigabytes of RAM that comes
standard but it can be upgraded up to 64
gigabytes it also starts at a 1 terabyte
and via mean storage although do keep in
mind that the 17 inch variant might have
an extra hand to slot 4 expandability
just like the blade pro 17 the display
on the blade 15 studio is a 4k OLED
panel at 60 Hertz or asked one on the
blade 17 studio will feature a 4k OLED
panel at 120 Hertz now this is an
interesting implementation because when
we checked out the plate 417 those
laptops are only being offered in 1080p
variants at a high refresh rate and now
something with a higher resolution so I
feel like Razer was sort of planning
this whole thing out with rolling out
high resolution displays with their pro
or their 17-inch notebooks later this
year and it looks like we're only
getting OLED the other thing that really
is really really really weird is that as
a content creator myself I don't see
Olin and particularly interesting
because as again a content creator OLED
is definitely too saturated and I don't
think when I'm grading or color grading
videos I'm gonna get the accurate
implementation or the accurate
representation when I'm you know doing
that stuff so especially for people who
are serious into doing color work or
whatnot I feel like the OLED option
might be a bit too aggressive so I want
to hear your thoughts about that in the
comments down below do you think OLED
is really necessary for a notebook port
selection looks pretty decent at least
from the press images that you're seeing
there is power in three USB 3.1 gen2
ports done about three ports but do keep
in mind that the blade studio 17 will
feature a UHS 3.0 card reader whereas
the blade 15 studio will not which is
disappointing basically the new studio
lineup of notebooks look exactly the
same as what Razer is offering with
their mainstream laptop or mainstream
options which I don't know if it's a
good thing or a bad thing
I mean I personally like the way how
they look but again you know what you
have liked to see Razer's sort of tweak
the design here and there a little bit
would love to know your thoughts about
that in the comments the main star the
show here is the implementation of
Nvidia's new RTX quadro GPUs and
this is particularly interesting
especially from a company like Razer
who's trying to target a different type
of audience not necessarily gamers
because if you're really looking for a
gaming laptop you probably are well
better off with a geforce r-tx GPU
rather than something like a quadrille
graphics card because quad rows are
really good for like I said serious
people who are working in professional
environments like studios or rendering
3d assets that requires all of that
hardware but this will certainly push
the price of the studio line up of
laptops because if you look at the
desktop market the Quatro 5000 has more
than 3000 CUDA cores and it puts it
right between the $700 RTX 2080 and
thousand-dollar r-tx 20 DTI however it
costs about $2,100 and it actually makes
me wonder how much of the price premium
we could expect by implementing a Quadro
GPU inside a laptop the other thing
that's important to me or something that
I should mention is that as a content
creator myself you know making videos
and of course using programs like Adobe
Premiere and DaVinci Resolve I don't
particularly see Quadro as a real
investment because you know the RT X
GPUs are well taken advantage of
especially intervention result so you
know quadrille doesn't look like it's
gonna add a super substantial increase
in rendering performance or playback
performance because the current Arctic's
hardware is plenty enough for content
creation like making videos but like I
said there is a specific type of user
that might take advantage of all the
hardware that quadrille offers and I
think that's what Razer is trying to
approach here now we did inquire about
pricing for the new blade studio lineup
tops but unfortunately Razer wouldn't
tell us anything I mean all they did
mentioned was that they were going to be
very expensive so I guess we'll just
have to wait and see how much they're
gonna cost when it's officially
available and I get it I mean they're
trying to compete against Apple and
their MacBook Pros with what you know
they're offering the provector graphics
and of course at this point you're
getting an 8 core 1630 CPU so you know
if it configure a MacBook Pro to its
best you will be easily spending at
least 6 grand or more and you know I
think Razer is trying to kind of catch
up and compare or compete against those
markets so like I said there are a
couple things that concerns me one is of
course temperatures I'm really
interested to see how that a course 16
credit CPU can perform in that 17 is
chassis it should be okay but hopefully
I'll bills get my hands on one of those
and secondly I'd like to see extended
warranty support for these new
professional laptops because pros
definitely need that additional support
they'll certainly like it because you
know Apple offers one of the best
customer service out there and they are
paying a premium for that so let me know
what you guys think about the blade 15
studio and the blade 17 studio do you
are you guys interested in this whole
implementation of the quadrille r-tx
GPUs if so let me know the comments down
below
I'm Ebor with Hardware Canucks thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
