and I love me an affordable quality
gaming peripherals because gaming gear
right now is getting super expensive
especially in the audio realm and so you
know for example I use the GSP 500 which
is a over $200 headset so that's
definitely coming off the table because
in this video I want to compare headsets
that are 100 dollars versus $49 so
literally half the price on what you can
get with these line up the GSP 300 by
the way is my go to $99 recommendation
for gaming headset make sure to check
out a review all the links for a
purchase things will be in the
description below and the HS 50 has been
my recommendation for the $49 price
point but there is now a new contender
I've never heard of these guys before
the pluggable Performance this is the HS
53 also a $49 pair and I wonder if
there's any coincidence in the naming
scheme but coming onto this side the msi
GH 60 I never knew MSI make gaming gear
aside from like laptops and computer
stuff but I'm guessing they're obviously
in this space the GH 60 is the first
high res audio certified gaming product
that is under $300 because the other one
that I've reviewed would be the
SteelSeries arctas pro but that's way
too expensive so I'm actually curious to
see how these perform against these
let's begin right after this are you
ready okay watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P managed by
Coolermaster check it out in the
description below alright so let me
quickly go over the basics of why the
GSP 300 and the HS 50 are my picks for
those price points so the GSP 300 it's a
super lightweight headset it is plastic
but durable there is no creaking when
you stretch it around you can throw this
around no problem it does expand quite
large so if you have a larger head with
potentially a lot of hair if you like to
wear hat or a baseball cap this will go
over it no problem and it also collapses
into a pretty small headset if you're in
a smaller head sizes we have a volume
dial on the right side to control that
the microphone is actually pretty decent
it mutes when it's in the upright
position and overall the blue color
scheme is not really my thing
but this is a for stay at home only type
of headset you don't want to be wearing
this outdoors sound quality is fantastic
a lot of bass representation here good
detail nice soundstage despite this
being a closed bag design overall this
thing can breathe you know there is some
heat concentration in the ear cups
because they are this pleather material
but it is super comfortable design that
is lightweight they sound awesome the
microphone is good overall a really good
balanced package now the HS 50 for the
$50 price point represents a good
balance - so the build quality is fine
we have some metal parts in here they do
stretch out quite nice they expand for
larger heads the headband padding could
be slightly thicker but sound quality
despite this being like like a closed
design it does have like a semi open
soundstage which is awesome
not something you'd expect from $50 pair
which is really good for like
environmental things you're not feeling
like you're closed in you feel like your
audio is slightly expanded the
microphone is removable we also have
volume dial and a mic mute on the left
ear cup so nice overall package for 50
bucks and they're also super low profile
and there are no color accents just the
logo on the side which means if you
could wear them outdoors be my guest
so now how do the other pair stack up
let's start with the g-h 60 at $99 price
point so from a physical standpoint this
is a gaming headset no doubt we have
this fort
earcup design aluminum black plastic
glossy plastic textured glass on the
interior and then matte plastic so they
went all out with this particularly not
knowing where to go in which direction
so just they settled for everything I do
like that the ear cups can rotate
inwards so when they're on your neck the
drivers can be facing up the headband is
self adjusting kind of like on
SteelSeries it's a good design from this
implementation it should fit most head
sizes and overall it feels like a
durable piece the ear cups on here
pretty thick they cover my entire ear we
also have a replacement set with these
like breathable material which is
actually quite comfortable on the skin
unlike many other breathable materials
that we tried particularly from Logitech
but here overall comfort with the g-h 60
is pretty decent headset is also pretty
light because it is mainly plastic with
a steel band up top there is no clamping
force I could wear these for hours no
problem now moving on to the other $50
pair the HS 53 they look deceivingly out
of their own price class this whole
matte black design a lot of padding on
the headband and the ear cups and this
exposed brushed aluminum look on the
side adjustment you know little pieces
here but as soon as you feel them you
kind of understand this is this is a $50
pair they look awesome but they don't
feel that great the size adjustment
mechanism sounds good
but it's quite loose it doesn't really
stay in position and also the main pet
peeve of mine are the ear cups so it is
deceivingly thick but in fact the
leather just kind of wraps around the
plastic housing so in reality the
thickness of this padding is only about
half and so it's kind unfortunately
because they look like they're super
comfortable with so much padding but
that's not the case and also my ears
touch the internal driver inside the ear
cup which should not be the case for
headset that looks to have such thick
padding the one thing I will say about
this design is that the clamping force
is not too strong which is good because
my ears are currently making contact
with that interior wall so I can play
for a few hours but then it starts to
introduce a lot of fatigue on top of the
ears because the
your point is not exactly curved because
the ear cups are totally flat so the
bottom here doesn't have any support all
the pressure and the weight is supported
by the top my ears and somewhat by the
headband to both headsets have inline
remotes for volume control and mic mute
the plughole performance one is actually
detachable so it can be just as a
standalone headset you can plug into
your console and then have this thing as
a standalone thingy that can break out
into a splitter cable that is also
included in the same idea for the gh 60
but the inline remote is built-in all
right so it's microphone quality time
this is the GSP 300 by far the best one
out of the bunch it just sounds most
pleasing nice amount of bass in the
vocals nice amount of detail - it's not
too tinny and just sounds the most
natural I would definitely use this to
stream so this next one is the GH 60 the
other $100 pair weirdly this one sounds
the worst out of the bunch because it
almost sounds like the microphone is
located inside the ear cup and not so
close to my mouth because the audio is
like kind of distant and not intimate
also doesn't have much detail yeah just
a really bad microphone on this guy
alright so moving on to the cheaper
pairs this is the HS 50 from Corsair I
like this microphone it doesn't have as
full the body as the GSP 300 but there's
a lot of detail it's not too nasally
there is some like noise compression
going on stuff but really like this
microphone for 50 bucks
alright so the final one is the HS 53
from pluggable it definitely sounds
better than the gh 60 at half the price
there's a lot more bass pickup it's
clear the bass is kind of muddy which is
totally fine for for vocals but it's
kind of weird because it almost matches
the sound signature of this headset
itself but for 50 bucks it's quite good
and it's also very sensitive so you have
to be either lower your a vocal volume
or move the microphone a bit further
away but for 50 bucks sounds good and
out of the four headsets which sounded
the best to you let me know in the
comments all right let's go a first
competitive match with the msi GH 60
let's see how they stack up
so it has been a few matches nobody's
complaining about the microphone quality
everyone can hear me well I mean that is
the expectation for $99 headset they are
semi comfortable the audio quality is
just on par the highs are there it's not
too bass heavy the mid-range is clear so
I can hear exactly where my enemies are
and my teammates are around me in the
environment in csgo so the GH 60 I'll
continue using this for the next hour or
so alright so after the first hour of my
verdict for comfort is it's good my ears
feel a little bit warm but there's no
like fatiguing you know nature of like
the clamping force being too strong or
something like that the ear pads are
fine they do concentrate the heat and
that's the only thing that you have to
worry about but for a $99 headset that
is close back with a leather padding I
mean that is expected all right so it's
time for the HS 53
so after just a few matches you can
definitely tell this is a cheaper
headset the comfort wise it's fine here
the clamping force is not too much you
can extend them I mean the build quality
you can definitely tell it's not as good
but the sound quality you can definitely
tell that this is on the cheaper side
because it just lacks any detail it's
very muddy and bass heavy too not
exactly what you need for competitive
gameplay this is where the other
headsets kind of excel you could go into
the EQ settings if your sound card has
that and adjust the treble really boost
that for more detail because otherwise
this thing lacks it now aside from
having subpar sound quality this headset
also lacks in positional awareness
multiple times where I'd be confused as
to where the sound was coming from where
on any of my other headsets that is not
the case so if critical positional
awareness is your thing this headset the
HS 53 is not for you alright guys so it
is awesome to see more $50 price points
enter the headset arena for gaming but
the HS 50 still holds that spot because
it's just built wall the sound quality
is great the microphone is nice overall
a nice balanced package whereas with the
HS 53 it's like a nice try the visuals
are good the packaging is good the
microphone quality is decent but the
sound quality and the build quality they
just fall short I mean listen to this
one fall and something might break
inside you know you don't have that good
perception of build quality which is
disappointing you have good perception
of visuals and packaging but that's not
what you're looking for in the long term
but the main disappointment comes to
audio quality because multiple times in
like competitive matches in csgo my
teammates were like dude did you not
hear him walk behind you and I didn't so
there was a lot of confusion in the
audio situational awareness you know
something that I'm normally used to
hearing I wouldn't with this headset and
that means that's a no-go for gaming and
this is where the HS 50 really shines
because it has nice detail definition
and a semi-open wide soundstage so that
you can have this positional awareness
that's not too loose and you can
pinpoint where things are coming from
whereas with the GF 60 it's like a
typical
looking gaming headset the microphone
quality is really bad for $99 I'm
surprised the HS 50 sounds better than
that but this one in sound quality is
awesome
like the amount of detail you can pick
out the bass is nice the mid-range is
there it's not too sharp the soundstage
is not like it's not too loose but this
is a closed design so you can hear
things quite close to sound quality is
great builds nice comforts nice
microphone is subpar and this is where
the GSP 300 really comes out on top at
the $99 price point because it kind of
balances out all the features great mic
awesome sound quality fantastic comfort
and build wise sure it's plastic but no
creaking anywhere and I'm confident that
this will last you for a very long time
and just to answer the original question
of whether it's worth spending double
the money in order to get the better
audio experience for games in the
instance of the GSP 300 versus the HS 50
yes it is superior in every way but the
HS 50 is just fantastic value however
when we take a look at the GH 60 this
one sounds fantastic it's comfortable
but the microphone quality on here is
just subpar the HS 50 wins while the HS
53 and 49 dollars also seem to be good
value based on looks and the microphone
quality but the sound quality and
comfort is lacking so you spend any more
on the gaming product really is
dependent on the product itself so I'm
guessing the search continues for the
next best budget headset under $100 you
know the $50 price point is awesome but
we don't see that many options there and
I'm guessing the $99 price point will be
quite saturated but what if you're
