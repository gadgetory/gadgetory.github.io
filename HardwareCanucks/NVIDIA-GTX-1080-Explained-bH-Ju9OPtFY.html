ox and next generation NVIDIA Pascal
GPUs are here the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070
there are plenty of exciting things to
talk about so here's everything you need
to know about the launch so first come
all the known specifications which are
fully revealed for the GTX 1080
but most of the information for the 1070
is still unknown but the GTX 980 has
2560 kut'r course it's clocked at 1600
790 Hertz for the base and 1733 for the
boost comes with 8 gigabytes of gddr5 XV
ram versus the standard gddr5 on the gtx
1070 memory speed is impressive at 10
gigahertz with pretty large bandwidth
and a very impressive TDP of 180 watts
which is only 15 what difference between
the GTX 980 now one thing to notice is
the lack of HP m2 everybody was excited
to see high bandwidth memory on an
NVIDIA Pascal GPU
however yields are not there yet for the
consumer version stuff HP m2 will most
likely be first focused for the Tesla
stuff and the enterprise solutions
before rolling out into the consumer
stuff but we have the fast memory with
the gddr5 X on this Newton 80 there are
some physical changes on the reference
card which is the founders Edition so
the design language still looks familiar
but it's a lot more angular now with the
same illuminated GeForce logo this would
certainly make for some excellent
hardware photography but let us know
what you think about this design in the
comments down below and this is the
founder Edition which will have a price
premium over the board partner version
which be cheaper and will have all the
custom coolers designed and slapped on
by the port partners the card is still
10 1/2 inches in length like previous
reference designs and for the i/o we
have three DisplayPort 1.4 outputs a
single connection for HDMI 2.0 B and a
dual link DVI
and I'm pretty sure everybody was super
impressed to see only a single 8 pin for
power at the back for the GTX 1080 which
gives us that confidence in Pascal and
its power
efficiency and to put everything into
context here with the new 16 an F infant
process and the Pascal architecture that
brings so much of permits basically
across the board and everybody was super
impressed to see this slide with the
expected performance saying that the new
GT X 1080 is faster than dual 980 s in
SLI that's pretty crazy and of course we
have the card in our lab so make sure to
subscribe to see our results now on
video is heavily focused on optimizing
their hardware for VR applications and
the new 1000 series could not be better
timed as HTC vive and oculus rift hit
consumers hands as we speak and seeing
these graphs is really exciting
especially for virtual reality
expectations another major thing to
notice is the leap in performance that
the new graphics cards are bringing to
the table just to give you a better
reference when the 980 was launched it
was about 25% faster than GTX 780 so
with the new GT X 1080 is about 75%
faster given on these graphs than 980 so
it almost seems that Nvidia is skipping
a generation the performance compared to
what we've seen in their previous
releases and that's really cool next
thing is price and this one has
everybody excited
so the GTX 980 will press that 539 and
379 for the gtx 1070 meaning it's not
far off pricing range from the 980 and
the 970 when those were launched the one
thing to clarify here though is the MSRP
is $5.99 for the board partner gtx 1080
so when they will have custom coolers
that will be a cheaper card than the
founders Edition which is the reference
gtx 1080 so the aluminum shroud and the
blower style heatsink that will be a
$100 premium to $6.99 just strange
because in the past usually the
reference cards set a base price and
they go up from there depending on the
cooler but here that's really not the
case now there's no official information
on what will happen with the gtx 980 and
the 970 perhaps we'll see some price
drops here and there given
how many cards are in circulation at the
moment but maybe even the 980 will be
given an AOL status or the end-of-life
status perhaps discontinued so that
Nvidia can you know hardly push with
Pascal and so all know everybody is
super excited about the new launch the
GTX 1018 1070 how do you feel we have
the card in the lab make sure to
subscribe to see the full benchmarking
results and everything like that
June 10th is the launch for the gtx 1070
and may 27th is the launch for the GTX
1080
I'm to be true with our Canucks before I
go I will leave you with a quote the
imagination decides everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
