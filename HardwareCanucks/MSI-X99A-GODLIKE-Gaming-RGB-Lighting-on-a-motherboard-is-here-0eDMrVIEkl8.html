you by fantex nvidia corsair and CI x
silverstone and in win make sure to
support them for helping us bring this
great content to you RGB lighting on a
motherboard you guys knew it we knew it
it was just a matter of time at Computex
we stumbled upon the msi x99s gaming
motherboard that seems to really have it
all aside from the traditional black and
red msi color scheme we are seeing
motherboard manufacturers including
these steel reinforcements on all the
five PCI lanes for supposed long-term
structural integrity of the PCI and lane
so it does not Bend there's a single end
or two slot for a 32 gigabyte per second
transfer speed a really good built-in
headphone amplifier to drive high
resistance headphones with a full size
6.5 Miller headphone jack there are four
USB type 8 ports killer LAN double-shot
x3 pro with dual Gigabit Ethernet and
built-in wireless AC for awesome my
Wi-Fi connectivity and network and a
single USBC type port because you cannot
just not have one but to highlight one
of the features that were really excited
to show off is mystic light in other
terms pimp your motherboard out with a
selection of colors using an app
controlled by a tablet connected via
bluetooth for up to six motherboards so
not only do you get multi color options
and I'm actually glad that MSI decided
to provide these options to be more
compatible with user specific color
scheme but you also have different modes
to choose from
maybe too many modes that is a bit funny
to see on the motherboard we don't even
get to see some of these lighting
effects on keyboards and keyboards have
had backlight for ages there is a
breathing mode or fire mode flashing
mode with white lights or the background
colors still changing there's a stack
mode where it looks like the colors are
being stacked on top of each other
there's a random mode a wave mode and
the lights can be turned
now do you think this is a bit too much
or do you like this approach from MSI
taking on the RGB trend and giving us
all the lighting flexibility would ever
need in the motherboard
another thing is they've teamed up with
bits power for this water block that
spans the LGA 2011 socket and the
Southbridge so in case you'd want
something MSI branded all in all the x99
a god like a gaming is a seriously
loaded motherboard with style and I
think it's a matter of time until we see
RGB implementation on the rest of the
competing motherboards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
