me that he has not updated his system in
like ten years at first I was terrified
and then I was like I got hi I'm Timmy
and I haven't updated my system in ten
years let's go check it out
well folks it's time to kick it old
school year well my system is basically
ten years old because the motherboard is
ten years old and so is the power one of
the car drives is still the original
hard drive you can get some work done on
the side offline while it's booting I've
been playing at lowest at lowest
settings like no shadows no texture just
almost can we just have the squares
moving that's almost it so you see I had
to step in but this is an exciting build
hope you enjoy right after this it's
time to try something new with the k900
em mechanical keyboard by Zalman with
Cale brown switches on board macro
recordings and absolutely gorgeous RGB
illumination with the white frame even
your dog will go nuts check it out in
the description below it's such a
sleeper pcs look for example if we were
to populate the new hardware and here
people will never know you had the new
system like haven't opened my machine in
about three months might be a little
dusty it's an interesting case I don't
know what the make is look look at this
mirror finish show here yeah these lines
here a little bit textures got the door
so we got four or five in the quarter
inch base and do all those little three
and half inch drives that used to be for
floppy disks so that's how you know how
old this one is of course these never
work is this fan mounted for intake not
exhausting air so it's actually taking
all the dust inside Wow and not blowing
it out that's crazy
might be a little dusty all right D me
so you're actually rocking a pretty
capable platform for ten years ago with
a GT 240 Nvidia graphics card from
palette while I haven't seen these in so
long but look at that color scheme on
that orange fan that's crazy
a really tiny CPU heatsink on the m3
socket 500 watt power supply which has
no efficiency rating here and look at
these lovely cables man
they're called ketchup and mustard and I
have not seen an ID cable and so long a
little blast from the past man from the
new machine I'm expecting to be kind to
accept the name of sunshine that's what
I call my machine always because no girl
has ever let me coker that so that's the
girl that I call sunshine so we're gonna
use a new case for cable management
power supply it is going to be modular
and the best efficiency so you don't
have to worry about electricity bills
will finally mount you a fan that is
exhausting air but we are sticking with
air cooling and I'm gonna have some
really nice fans in your new case
although with custom profiles so when
you start into Starcraft it feels like
something's happening I like that I
don't mind a tinier or doing there it's
fine tiny sunshine yeah you can get
married seriously sweet that's crazy
I've never I've never seen that honestly
so that's gonna be the first four before
in ultra graphics I've never seen that
yeah it's not supposed to be like ok I
also have icons in stuff it's great oh
you're good times is 40 seconds I don't
think so mister startup manager but I
designed that desktop myself nice
alright so to my surprise you are still
running a 32-bit Windows which is
Windows 7 you have an Athlon 2 X 4 630
processor 2.8 gigahertz which is not bad
but it's only a 4 4 core machine so
you're gonna be in really good hands
with a 6 core 12 thread upgrade you're
already using half your memory just by
having Windows running it's just very
very slow it's like a it's not even a
computer it feels more like a machine
used for cooking then you're just
leave it like a microwave it is still
spinning yes dissipate oh my god no I
don't think I will miss anything about
this machine I don't think he'll miss
anything about it I redeem me I think
it's time for you to say goodbye to
sunshine and me to go and build you a
new machine oh it's just a one night for
the sunshine and then it's gonna rise
again because rising it's gonna be
rising alright enjoy this bill
d me your system is ready excited yeah
alright but first of all I want to tell
you that I haven't booted on so I have
no idea if it works ok but little did he
know that I already spent the time to
make sure that everything is working on
the machine I even put this awesome
wallpaper with Starcraft theme so hope
he likes it
yeah go ahead sweet is any tempered
glass owner your task is to peel the
sticker really ah it's so awesome
alright so the assembly begins in the
space of finding out where sunshine 2.0
goes it feels as if it's been
custom-made together with the whole
space it doesn't feel patched at all
yeah why don't you well the case of the
fant experi hundred it's nice and
compact got a tempered glass panel and
most importantly it's affordable this
thing costs 59 bucks if you guys want to
check out there are you make sure to to
watch that for the motherboard we got a
gigabyte be 350 gaming 3 it's actually a
really nice board it's also affordable
so we're going for this hole not too
expensive but really keep machine and
the gigabyte board also has an MDOT two
slots and you'll be surprised that the
motherboard has RGB illumination on the
one the sides so that if you want to
control it and match it up to the case
lighting which you'll see just in a bit
you can do that now I'm very excited to
see what you think about the performance
of this machine because for graphics we
got our gtx 1070 from gigabyte the
windforce x2 edition so he's got two
fans the thing doesn't even spin at idle
and even look like light load situations
the GPU you cannot hear it which is so
awesome and also the graphics card does
not have a backplate which is fine
because the PCB is black so it comma
flashes well with the rest of the build
so the flare X is a 16 gigabyte kit so
remember we went from 4 to 16
we went from 1333 in terms of the speed
to 3200 megahertz
it looks like a computer
Vader we have and that is very
satisfying for power here we have a 650
watt Silverstone power supply that has
platinum efficiency so in terms of
electricity bills man you're fine and
for the heart of the build we got a new
risin v cpu the 1600 X so you went from
an Athlon a 4 core yeah now we have a 6
core 12 threads so that all those
threads can be populated with tasks and
the performance is incredible so that's
like six times different you will see
you will see my friends and to cool that
CPU we got a dark rock three cooler from
be quiet not only does that Tower look
freaking amazing it cools very well and
it fits so well with this whole like
yeah often and Osho of design you have
to appreciate that the font fits the
family of phones of gigabytes form
that's how I choose hard work by phones
well now you got a 480 gigabyte SSD this
is the new OC Toshiba TL 200 so there
again in the whole affordable category
so while we are going for nice budget
system everything is performance wise is
excellent now it's left a film maybe
it's got shirts oh this is like just
please horror its magnetic dust filter
okay so I can clean you let's see does
it work yeah and you can keep Wow oh
sweet oh my god what is this
it's just a gory didn't but you weren't
expecting anything to like show no I was
expecting a blue screen and like found
motherboard welcome through world and
stuff like that yeah I wasn't expecting
this no no no all right II mean I have
run some benchmarks to see how this
system performance versus what you just
had because we actually have the same
CPU in our test bench and we were able
to measure how that CPU performs and
benchmarks because obviously we couldn't
really do anything with that system
because it's so slow so this is
Cinebench r15 look at how it compares
versus what you had before it's crazy
okay so this is
a gimp benchmarks which takes a bunch of
photos and recreates like a Photoshop
environment the new system completing a
task in 28 seconds versus your previous
system will have completed in 272
seconds Wow
Dimitri tell me about their game
performance of this machine let me show
you now I'm seriously impressed with the
performance of the 1600 X that thing is
a monster
6 core 12 threads comes pre overclocked
to 3.7 gigahertz out of the box given
you have sufficient cooling which we do
and just comparing it to my 1700 X
workstation in Adobe Premiere render
times they're practically identical
alright so my frame rates an overwatch
actually is really good so this is a
1080p one epic settings and I'm just
around 100 frames per second and I'm not
dipping below 95 even when things are
happening and there's like a bit of
explosions and whatever very respectable
framerate for a GTX 1070 and the rise at
five all right now let's try csgo I am
in 1080p the highest possible settings
right now you can see the frame rate in
the top left corner I'm getting pretty
it's pretty nice close to 300 pop G's
next and look at this I'm getting 60
frames in the spawn screen with all the
players there's smoke there's fire
look at that that's impressive this is
again the 1080p in the ultra settings
obviously this game is not played in
ultra settings regardless of how pretty
it is
because lowering the settings gives you
that extra visual access he's still my
car boom so finally we have Starcraft so
this is something that D me really
wanted to play at maximum settings so
this is exactly what we have here 1080p
the highest possible settings on all the
things and we are over 200 frames I love
how it smells oh it always says it's not
right
and I've also installed a couple more
fans in here so that you have one be
quiet intake and one be quiet exhaust
really fantastic and quiet fans they
move a lot of air without making any
sound you want to drop up in listen
listen uninterrupted pin dropping
computer still running no issues then
get started well by the appendage a
here what are your thoughts well it's
pretty amazing I can still feel my hair
growing if I have another sister you can
marry her
I'll just find it I was just taking all
Dejan all all right man
the system is finished it's finally here
it's working fine and it's an absolute
beast and performance yeah
so enjoy man so yeah now I'm just gonna
tell all my friends to come over that we
got it and it's happening and let's roll
it's the Eclipse the flare X the wind
force the rising the dark rock see - OH
- space
