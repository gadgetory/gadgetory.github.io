hardware connects bones review as you
know no sleeved cable extensions are
quite popular in the gaming and modding
community as they hide all the colored
cables inside your case and make the
interior looking sleek on our review
table today we have three brands one
from BitFenix another from NZXT and the
third from mod right now you might be
familiar with the former - as big
phoenix cables have been released a
little bit later in the market but
feature a different design of sleeting
so let's take a look at these three
brands and compare now if you've ever
sleeved cables you know how tedious and
time-consuming it can be especially for
the 24 pin motherboard connector so a
time-saving alternative is obvious with
these sleeved extensions right off the
bat the pricing for all three brands are
quiet on par so it only comes down to
stock availability at the stores you
shop at and obviously your preference of
the brand but all three brands have the
standard connection types everything
from the three pin fan extension to 24
pin motherboard connector however big
phoenix has the upper hand and variety
of types of the cables and also the
colors they available in in total of 23
types for beat Phoenix and seven colors
19 types for NZXT in three colors and
around ten times for mod right in five
colors now if you are going for a
colored build then variety of colors
helps you be consistent and
personalizing your interior becomes much
easier ok so let's take a look at these
cables and close up starting with one
from beats Phoenix they use what they
call nano sleeve which eliminates the
need for heat shrink as the molded
connector around the cable and the
actual cable is braided in a thread-like
pattern so the sleeving itself is not
plastic and therefore is much more
flexible than the other two brands
making it easier to fold around corners
and just generally easier to work with
it's sort of a new approach towards
sleeved extensions but isn't entirely
new to the computer market as the same
type of braided cables can be found on
many mainstream gaming peripherals like
mice headsets and keyboards
so now moving on to the cables from NZXT
the steaming here is more standard being
secured by heat shrink in both sides of
the cable and the still quality is quite
amazing and you do expect the cables to
withstand some intense flexing as you
can see the heat shrink is quite short
and is all black for three colors to
blend in with the case interior now you
can't say they're cheating a little bit
as the cable inside is leaving is the
same color as this leaving itself has to
come a flashes further now the same
approach is done by mod wright who have
been on the market slightly longer than
the other two brands and the differences
are very minor for the actual sleeping
is practically identical to the one from
NZXT
but the major aesthetic difference is
the length of the heat shrink as you can
tell it's quite long and has text
written on it so for those who prefer
the clean look to the slightest detail
those may steer away from moderate
cables now in terms of flexibility it
does take quite a bit of force to bend
them in preferred shape but is
definitely not an issue
here you can see the heat ring
difference between the three brands and
the less featuring the more flexible it
is right in the edge of the plastic
connector now beat fittings cables are
the most flexible as heat ring is not
used and the actual braided cable is
easy to work with without sacrificing
the quality of the cable which is
actually superb so tears from bending is
unlikely now the main question is which
one is more user-friendly while beech
Phoenix has the most variety of cables
with many color options and provides the
most flexible feel while NZXT is a good
alternative and the heat shrink is
fairly short with quality of the
sleeving
being really good but quite limited to
only three colors mod rod is also
another alternative however you do have
to deal with stiff cables and a little
bit longer heat shrink so for some of
those who want the most tidy look mod
right may not be the final choice
however all three do the job they are
supposed to and when it's time to slice
the cake it really comes down to your
personal preference thank you guys for
watching and we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
