value oriented brand giving us better
value without compromising on the
products and that's exactly what we saw
today they were these two new
motherboards so let's talk about them
now
Hager canucks is at another fantastic
Computex show all thanks to Nvidia
fantex and cix and MSI so the first one
is the x99 pro gaming fatality part of
the gaming series a lovely color
combination
not too much bling just a nice dark red
in their sport for Broadwell ECP use
dual intel Gigabit LAN ports we have ke
Wi-Fi module dual m dot u gen 3 v 4
slots for potentially great
configuration if you're going that route
3-way SLI and crossfire with the first
two slots being spaced out which are
also metal plated for protection that
seems to be the trend these days however
no metal shielding or metal casing
around the DIMM slots nor the EM that
you like we've seen on past motherboards
perhaps that could be a cost-cutting
solution and I don't find it the cool
thing about overclocking abilities this
one features 12 faced power v core
design versus 8 on competing
motherboards let's say competing
motherboards have eat we have new audio
software which is the Sound Blaster
cinema 3 and a water pump header support
so in case you're deciding to water cool
this one a one of the four pin headers
there is powerful enough to support a
pump this board will be priced at $259
which I would say is competitive and we
have this slightly cheaper x99 Taichi
which is priced at $219 so it features
all the same things like dual MDOT twos
3-way crossfire sli 12 phase power v
core design new audio software and it's
based off this martial art design and
because they want to try to balance
between price and specifications we
still have dual lands and steel on those
PCI brackets so the direction that as
Arrakis taking here is clearly towards
cutting down some of the features that a
lot of other manufacturers are offering
some you're cutting out the bling not
everybody likes that and it's a nice
option let's say if you have LED
lighting but
if you will end up turning it off anyway
it's a nice cost-cutting solution but
we're here coming from the azrog booth
I'm Dimitri with our Canucks and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
