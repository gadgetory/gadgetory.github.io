Nvidia gigabyte fantex and NCI X what's
up guys I'm Dimitri with our Canucks and
the thermaltake V Tower 900 it's d tower
not just tower it's a weirdly
interesting PC case for a particular
water cooling model it's a pretty unique
looking full-size e-atx enclosure that
continues a recent trend among designers
to put tempered glass everywhere
the tower 900 is part of their premium
line comes fully disassembled and with
my own experience on the W 200 the case
assembly is actually decent the tower
900 has glass on three of its four sides
and the glass is actually 5 millimeters
thick which is slightly thicker than
normal
giving it sort of a fishtank look the
orientation of the mountain board means
that it faces the front meanwhile the
graphics cards are pivoted so they're
exhausting the i/o points upwards and
this is certainly an odd concept but it
also puts all the components on full
display inside a great-looking glass box
in our quest for unique cases we have
come across some oddities but the tower
900 seems to be both odd and actually
pretty functional at the same time there
seems to be plenty of expansion room
with hidden support for up to 8 two and
a half inch drives or six three and a
half inch hard drives in the rear
chamber there's also a five-minute
quarter inch drive brain right to the
front in the middle which is perfect for
you know a fan controller and adaptive
pump brackets in the main chamber so
placement of water cooling components is
somewhat flexible so the main chamber
only has two fan slots one in the top
and one more above the middle drive cage
which is limiting for this size but
there's really only one way to use the
Tower 900 and that's to do a water
cooling system with hard tubing mounting
a 480 or up to a 560 mm of radiators in
the rear chamber on the sides and
passing the tubes through the grommets
in between you can install 360 mm rad in
the main chamber right below the
motherboard but I think the idea is to
really hide as much cooling Hardware in
the rear chamber as possible thus
dividing the heat accumulation
everything is covered with magnetic dust
filters plus the power supply is located
in the rear chamber at the bottom and so
interestingly the case actually emerged
as part of a mod which is why the system
layout is so particular
and why we see so many moderate
showcases using the tower 900 it's a
great way to highlight components from
all three sides but it's not really a
functional layout for a general
mainstream system but at $150 you better
know what you'd want to do with it
however I do feel that for the size
alone and for a little bit of the
modularity and all the things you can
pack into it
users might easily justify the price
here's another case that's unique but
familiar reminding me of some in wind
open style cases this is the core p1 T G
it's a compact ITX case that has blacked
into the templates window a bit of steel
and not much else I think the entire
point in this case is to make your
system look a little bit more like an
art piece then provide a ton of
functionality the main structure is made
out of a simple pedestal that serves as
your i/o area also a motherboard tray
and mounting area for two 120 or 140
millimeter fans and like the Tower 900
these pieces are modular and make
assembly quite simple other than the 280
moment radiator support Thermaltake has
once again added their moveable water
pump bracket and a native compatibility
with their own liquid cooling systems
and of course the most obvious part in
this case is its tempered glass side
panel which extends past motherboard
unfortunately this means the entire
system is very open to dust to enter but
like I said before this is more of a
form over function and I see the core p1
T G being great to display your
components but man that's AG all the
cases we saw in this type of format had
inevitably suffered from weight of the
components bending the base of the frame
which may be a downfall in the tooling
design but I still love the format of
this open style PC but just be mindful
on what you're getting yourself into so
that's it from thermal tank what do you
guys think of these new additions let us
know in the comments below and stay
tuned for more CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
