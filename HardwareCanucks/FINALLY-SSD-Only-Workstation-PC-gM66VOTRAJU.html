anytime soon okay alright but first a
message from our sponsor the z9
neo-byzantine features on a budget with
a large window side panel five included
fans and the excellent interior layout
with super simple cable management get
it now link in the description below Wow
so today marks the day when I completely
move away from spinning hard disks
inside my main workstation PC and
replace all the drives with solid-state
drives
oh those early days when you're trying
to edit something and the disk just
keeps spinning and spinning and things
just keep loading and
so when I first built the sky lick
editing PC I had this point in time
imagined I was really looking forward to
it
with the V X 500 new drives from OCZ to
Sheba they're really changing the game
on what you would consider to be sort of
these mainstream SSDs to be super
compatible and actually quite preferred
to be used inside a workstation PC and
that's because of their crazy high end
endurance so let's take the one terabyte
variant of the V X 500 this Drive has an
and endurance of 592 terabytes that
means that you could be writing to this
drive 10 terabytes per month for five
years which is its warranty period and
that places it way above many consumer
drives which is why I'm placing this in
this workstation status price-wise we're
looking at $150 to $330 for the 512 and
one terabyte respectively
that's a pretty good deal for something
that will last you for a very very very
very very very very long time the new
drives also look quite unique with this
silver dotted texture on the surface
squared edges very low profile can fit
notebooks no problem with just a simple
sticker blue sticker on the front and
the specification one at the back the
land is not 3d it's too DNA and it's 15
nanometers and the controller here we
actually don't know much about the
controller but it seems to prioritize a
lot on the stability on the long term
versus short term performance gains in
synthetic benchmarks so let's populate
these guys in and do some things
all right so now that's done I've set my
1 terabyte SSD to be on primary video
projects drive and since we've got a 16
terabytes enology nas I can offload all
my archive to there and my dream machine
is complete May we're over here now
here's an interesting tidbit about my
previous primary main workstation SSD
this is where all the files are dumped -
this is where all the basic work is
happening and from there the footage and
all the files are being moved into the
archive so in 12 months that I've been
using this non-stop it only has 2.7
terabytes of NAND write operations and
that's pretty crazy you think it's quite
low it's only 3% of its lifespan for
NAND write operations from the vector
180 in the 12 months that's that's
pretty good the VX 500 drives are
actually quite fast they're a little bit
slower than my vector 180s in write
operations and synthetic benchmarks but
maintain look at that consistent speed
for copy operations which is very
important I use this on a daily basis
while copying from the disk to my Intel
750 perform exactly the same on both
SSDs so the vector 180 was just as fast
as the VX 500 so what I'm trying to get
out of the VX 500 as my primary
workstation video drive is consistency
and that is exactly what we see and so
my system right now has six drives in
total one nvme and five SATA SSDs and
because of this population I've
discovered a bottleneck that's right who
knew so two of the six SATA connections
on this motherboard are limited by
bandwidth so there is not enough PCIe
lanes on the z170 chipset to support all
SATA SSDs to be running and their full
potential a little bit disappointing but
quiet i opening or what could be done to
mitigate this a bottleneck this is where
an X 99 system would swoop in kick out
that bottleneck out of the house
but that made me realize there is a
compromise I have tested the 6,800 K
versus the 6700 K to realize the four
core machine was faster in after-effects
primarily due to higher clock frequency
but still it's quite eye-opening to
realize that there is almost this
compromise on both sides but the beauty
of PC hardware is of course migration of
hardware and I'm happy that I've settled
on a fully SS the only run workstation
and that makes me wait for loading no
more and that's a pretty good day you
know what else was pretty good a message
from our sponsor
assembling your verdaguer gaming chair
just got a whole lot easier with a
simple insert mechanism of the back seat
onto the side rails so you mount the
side screws much faster a true one-man
job
assembly made easy by over a year
alright everyone thank you so much for
watching all the relevant videos and
links will be in description below
including my raid failure which is why
I'm not rating in this system thanks so
much for watching I'm Dimitri with our
Canucks we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
