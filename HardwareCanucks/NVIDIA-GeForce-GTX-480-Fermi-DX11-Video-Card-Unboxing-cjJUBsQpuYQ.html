this card to finally be ready in just a
few weeks ago we finally got to see the
actual performance numbers from a bunch
of different movie websites Harbour
connects included check it out now
virtually the card itself wasn't
actually ready at the time of release so
we've had to wait a couple weeks to get
our hands on it but here it is the first
one hit store shelves from PN watt and
with companies like XFX stepping out of
the race it's nice to see a few other
companies sort of stepping up and
offering their cards so we're gonna
unbox it take a quick look action before
we get there
highlight some things on the boxes
cardboard sleeve nothing too important
on the front we have all the
technologies down the bottom three
divisions surround physics CUDA SLI all
that fun stuff on the back a bunch of PR
stuff the specifications more of the of
the technologies you can check the specs
out at the end of the video now one
thing that I do want to highlight is the
minimum system requirements for this
card one thing that stands out is the
minimum 600 watt or greater power supply
with 42 amps on the 12 volt rail that is
a serious power supply and we're not
talking you're cheap $20 eBay power
supply either you need to have something
that is quality to be able to power this
thing the other thing they suggest is
about 2 gigs of system memory with four
gigs recommended so you need a fairly
we're not a fairly high end but you need
a fairly good mid range system with a
lot of power in order to complement this
thing now the other thing about PNY is
they do now offer a lifetime warranty
which is great to see more companies
jumping on that bandwagon and supporting
their cards for longer you know standing
behind their work otherwise there really
isn't too much important on it so let's
actually take a look at the real goods
what we have here just a quick start
guide which basically shows you how to
install the video card into your system
and how to install drivers what to do
next on the list we have the video card
drivers themselves now these are using
the 1/9 7.03 drivers and media has
released as of april 9th the one nine
seven four one i believe the number is
drivers so head over to an medias
website if you add this card and
download those as far as accessories vga
to DVI adapter pretty standard PCI 2 or
PCI power and molex adapters again
pretty standard now this is a difference
we have
the mini-hdmi into like s regular HDMI
because that is actually an output
featured on the card itself let's get to
the meat of this thing we have the GTX
480 from PNY it's definitely fairly
beefy a little weighty to which you'll
see on the top is we have a solid metal
cover that is over the heatsink which is
actually fairly shiny the little
fingerprint e we have our fan situated
at the back of the card and we also have
air intake ports at the back and then on
the PCB itself you'll actually notice
that there is holes in the PCB in order
to allow for more ventilation on the
side we have the 6 pin PCI power and an
8 pin PCI power so this thing is serious
and we also have four we have four
copper heat pipes here nickel plated and
that is to transfer heat from the chip
on to or into the rather heat fins that
word we're gonna open it up and see
those in a second as far as outputs go
we have the dual DVI and there is also
an HDMI connection and then a bottom
spot specifically or only for venting
now surprisingly there isn't actually
aside from this on the side here and up
front there isn't a lot of other venting
on it it's all pretty enclosed so we're
gonna take off the shroud and actually
take a look at the card underneath
alright so taking off our shroud was
actually surprisingly easy it's just a
little plastic thing there with a bunch
of clips now this thing I don't know
whether to be scared by it or rather
impressed we have this sort of turbine
looking fan at the back here which is
fairly thick and there's also this solid
metal plate that extends over the VRMs
and the RAM chips that extends from the
all across the PCB so everything is
going to be kept cool and we have this
meaty metal heatsink up at the front as
you can see it's a fairly dense I
believe it's aluminum thin there a that
extends pretty much three-quarters or
two-thirds the length of the card here
and one thing I should correct myself on
is there is four four copper heat pipes
that extrude from the card but there's
actually if you can see it there a fifth
that is sort of tucked away inside now
these go straight through the metal
heatsink they come out the side and that
is how the chip is going to dissipate
its heat other than that that is pretty
much much the cooling system Nvidia so
of breaking new ground with this you
haven't really seen I can't say I've
really seen a video card that uses heat
pipes in order to transfer heat so it's
a little bit of an experiment for them
but if you've seen any of the reviews
you know that something this beefy is
well it's really going to be needed one
other point I should make is that the
GTX 480 is actually a standard 10.5
inches long which is more of an ATX
standard and he's going to fit in a
majority of cases and what we saw with
the HD 5870 from ETI is the fact that
it's a little over 11 inches long and
many cases won't support it and then you
have this brute back here which is about
12 and a half inches long and finding a
case to fit that is actually incredibly
difficult you find a lot of users wind
up having to buy a whole new case just
to fit the card when are we doing some
gameplay videos testing out some
benchmarks and doing some overclocking
with this card in the next few videos so
be sure to check back thanks for
watching
