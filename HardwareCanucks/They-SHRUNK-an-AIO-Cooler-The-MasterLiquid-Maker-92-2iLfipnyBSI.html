becoming more and more popular as gamers
look to reduce the footprints of their
systems as a result we have quickly seen
a revolution with everything from
high-performance motherboards to
class-leading GPUs being awkward in
sizes that are compatible with Mini ITX
cases in addition those ITX enclosures
have become more and more feature-rich
and capable of housing high-end
components unfortunately in many
situations actual cooling setups haven't
really kept pace with the small
form-factor craze cooling overclocked
processor stakes thermal mass and
smaller more compact systems don't
typically allow for large coolers to be
installed with that in mind
kula master thinks they have a solution
this is their new compact a IO the
master liquid maker 92 it may have a
long and confusing name but it promises
to offer excellent cooling for high-end
overclocked processors while remaining
small enough to fit into some ITX cases
it isn't exactly inexpensive either at
$100 which is a lot more than air
cooling options from not Toula and some
other companies so we're they able to
cram all that AIO power into this tiny
and versatile cooler you're about to
find out but first we need to talk about
a contest now to celebrate this
availability in Canadian Best Buy's
check out the link below cooler master
is giving away a brand new master key
slide mouse and keyboard combo to one of
our viewers you may remember this combo
since we reviewed it a few weeks ago do
not that this giveaway is limited to
North America all you have to do is
apply through the gleam link which is
posted in the description below alright
let's get back to the cooler but first a
message from our sponsor the dark bass
900 maybe the most innovative case of
the year with a built-in Qi charger
interior lighting tempered glass that
can be installed on either side and a
fully modular interior that can be
inverted if you so desire be quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below
at first glance this is an incredible
work of engineering by the folks over
Coolermaster its unique approach towards
compact AIO solutions and they're
targeting this cooler specifically for
mini and micro ATX bills
not to mention this can be mounted
inside a full-size ATX tower but
remember this is a hundred dollar
compact liquid cooler so you're entering
the premium price category for CPU
coolers and there are plenty of cheaper
and more efficient alternatives in the
market which fit that demographic
honestly if you have a larger case
you'll likely want to look elsewhere
taking a closer look at the maker 92
it's relatively easy to spot the
components that make up the whole
structure there are dual 92 millimeter
high static pressure fans in a push-pull
configuration with an aluminum radiator
in between them if you're wondering
where the pump location is it's actually
sitting on top of the radiator and
they've combined them to achieve this
compact form factor do note that the
pump requires a dedicated power source
through SATA the tubes routed towards
the CPU block are braided and sleeved
and speaking of the CPU block cooler
master has implemented a clean copper
base to maximize the contact surface
that should lead to quicker heat
dissipation provided the smaller
radiator can keep up an interesting
feature about the maker 92 is the switch
and swivel mechanism that basically lets
you choose between vertical and
horizontal cooler configurations
depending on your air flow needs there
is a custom hinge bracket that swivels
the radiator and pump in one direction
with the intake fan facing the top and
the exhaust at the bottom the horizontal
support is 118 point 8 millimeters in
height whereas the vertical support sits
at 167 point five millimeters it's a lot
taller than the Intel stock cooler so I
would highly recommend to check case
compatibility for this particular AIO
installation was pretty straightforward
coolermaster includes all the necessary
mounting hardware inside the box I
tested this unit on an azrog z170 and
mini ITX motherboard featuring an i7
6700 K and 16 gigabytes of RAM all you
have to do is install the long screws on
the rear supporting bracket with these
holders and tighten the cooler on the
other side this is one of the benefits
of the maker 92 it doesn't require you
to find an open fan mount on your case
but rather integrates all the liquid
cooling components into one compact unit
I did not experience memory constraints
with this cool
placed in both horizontal and vertical
configurations but I'd be careful with
RAM modules that feature a taller
heatsink like the Dominator series from
Corsair for example now this is where
the actual compatibility issues start
you see even though the maker 92 is
small and it's advertised to fit into
ITX systems if a case was compatible
with the liquid cooler it would also be
compatible with heat sinks from Noctua
fill Montague van tanks and many others
because actually finding a small
form-factor enclosure which fits the
Mako 92 will be a challenge Kula master
doesn't have a compatibility list for
competing products and to make matters
worse none of their own ITX cases
actually fit this small cooler here's a
great example with the silverstone Sugo
ESG 13 a case that highlights the
strengthens of ITX design but it simply
can't fit the maker 92 regardless of
which position it is in with all that in
mind I've decided to throw in not to as
low profile CPU cooler the NHL 9i and
compare the results with the liquid
maker 92 what's astonishing about this
cooler is its high clearance of just 37
millimeters now only does that make it
compatible with nearly every ITX case on
the market but the l9 is more compact
than Intel's own stock cooler and by
volume it's three times smaller than the
maker 92 the top mountain 95 millimeter
fan supports the PWM standard for full
automatic speed control you know what's
even more interesting the price it's a
massive 50 dollars cheaper than cooler
masters offering and I was really
looking forward to the results so are
you guys ready for it on your idle
situations both coolers ran at about 27
degrees Celsius but under load the NHL
9i outperforms the maker 92 by about 4
degrees which absolutely blew away my
expectations considering the tiny form
factor remember the maker 92 was set at
a horizontal configuration and it was
curious to test out how it performed
when set to vertical setting and here we
are with the 92 running with just a few
degrees warmer during both idle and
under load situations let's listen to
how they sound
a few months back we did a video
comparing the pro 240 liquid cooler to
not to as D 15 D 15 s &amp;amp; u 14s and the
air cooler is performed really well in
our temperature and acoustic tests the
only disadvantage with those coolers
where the enormous hinting mass hanging
off the motherboard this video puts
things into another perspective because
Noctua has done a fantastic job with the
NHL 9i with its performance given the
compact form factor on the other hand
Coolermaster has engineered something
marvelous with the liquid maker 92 I
still can't wrap my head around the fact
that they were able to cram a radiator
pump and two fans into this tiny package
and while it does have restrictions with
certain mini ITX and micro ATX cases I
think they're heading off in the right
direction with this type of design
maybe we can expect a much smaller size
and better performance in the next
revision but until then the NHL 9 is a
superior choice especially considering
it's $50 cheaper than the maker 92 and
fits into more compact environments
until Coolermaster publishes a full
compatibility list or offers their own
mini ITX case to fit the maker 92 I'd
recommend looking elsewhere as we saw
with that little knock door cooler there
are certainly great alternatives out
there however I can't take anything away
from coolermaster either since without
innovations like this the market really
wouldn't go anywhere so what are your
thoughts about the cooler master liquid
maker 92 how are you impressed by its
performance plus how surprised are you
after I reveal the results of it
compared against the NHL 9 I leave a
comment down below and I'll make sure to
check them out I'm Eva with hurricane
axe thank you so much for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
