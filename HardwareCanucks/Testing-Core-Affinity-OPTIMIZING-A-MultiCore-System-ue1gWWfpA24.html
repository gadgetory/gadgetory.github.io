hardware connects and welcome to our
grand finale or part three of our X 299
bill series brought to you by Intel we
wanted to say thanks to all of our
partners who helped out in this build it
was a complicated one and we really
appreciate all their help now if you
recall about a month ago we put together
an epic skylake X PC featuring the core
i9 79-80 Extreme Edition 18 core 36
threaded processor along with some
high-end components including two gtx
TTI's in sli inside a micro ATX case and
while i did experience some challenges
billing the system the end result was
absolutely stunning I mean I can leave
the Bill vide or I'll link the bill
video right over here so you guys can
check it out
but something to note here is that this
is our very first Scott ik X PC and we
wanted to find out how adaptable the
platform was for our workflow which
primarily revolves around video
production but the one thing that we
really wanted to focus was being able to
get the best out of a high-end system
like this while overclocking could
improve performance by a specific margin
provided you've considered cooling and
power drawn to the equation that wasn't
the case with our build as you saw we
really didn't gain that much in terms of
performance so in this video I'll be
walking in through my experience using
core affinity within Windows 10 and how
you could set parallel workloads at the
same time so basically by assigning
start number of course and we'll get to
that later
but at the same time I also want to
tackle overclocking just one more time
just to see if I could squeeze just a
little bit of performance out of this 18
core processor so without any further
ado let's get started but first a quick
message from our sponsor finally an
ultra slim body keyboard with mechanical
red or blue switches designed and
perfected for work and play that the
Sorel Graham access evolved to fit right
in check it out below
all right so one of the reasons why
someone would want to invest in any
processor featuring 14 or 16 or 18 cores
in this case is primarily due to the
sheer amount of horsepower it has when
it comes to rendering tasks or
multitasking remember this is a $2,000
CPU with way too many cores for any
program I want to take advantage of so
we're gonna try and optimize all the
threads for our own workflow
for example if I take this 12-minute 35
second 4k timeline export it to youtube
4k pre send this 18 core processor
completes that task in 12 minutes and 10
seconds which is almost a one-to-one
ratio and that's amazing now when you
compare this result to other processors
featuring lower core counts the rendered
time is expected to increase which makes
sense but there's also the multitasking
aspect that's important when it comes to
taking full advantage of a cpu like this
sometimes professionals don't have the
luxury of time to dedicate their system
to just one use which in this case is
rendering you want to be able to do
multiple tasks at the same time while
rendering the background without losing
a lot on the performance side this not
only enhances productivity but it
eliminates downtime a system renders and
I think here's where skylake X can come
in really beneficial from a personal
standpoint as a content creator I render
videos on a weekly basis while working
on thumbnails as well as doing other
tasks in fact we do have a possibility
of streaming to twitch while gaming so
we're really looking for the ultimate
mega tasking processor here and I think
this is exactly where something like bi9
79-80 XE extreme edition is a perfect
fit enter core affinity having spent
some time playing around with this
feature I absolutely love it and it
plays a large role in optimizing for
scaling X now typically if you were to
render a video but at the same time also
work on 3d animation or if you just want
to kick back and relax by playing a game
or something your Windows 10 task
manager distributes those workloads
evenly across all 36 threads which could
affect performance this is the same case
for any lower counts abuse by default
the current version of Windows 10 does a
pretty good job at thread scheduling in
some situations but core affinity takes
things to the next level
essentially this allows the user to
assign a certain number of threads to a
particular application so for example I
can scan
20 threads for Adobe Media encoder a
threats for blender and 8 threads for
doom or battlefield 1 this completely
eliminates the need for these
applications to start fighting for
system resources because if you said
everything in Auto and if you start
running all these programs at the same
time they're going to be fighting for
those threads and this completely
eliminates that you're basically taking
control of which one's doing what what
what are you assigning or which one of
these threads are you assigning to a
certain application and it's pretty cool
executing this is pretty simple all you
have to do is open up the task manager
head over to details find your design
application right click on that task
then head over to set if any and start
assigning the threads now one of the
things to keep note of is that you need
to have your application open up prior
to sending core Finity so for example if
I sign a certain number of threads to
media encoder I need to have that
particular application open up before
even assigning more affinity because it
doesn't show up in the process list
within task manager
same story goes for blender or just any
application in general that you desire
or that you want to assign a certain
number of threats mind you that this is
a temporary solution because as soon as
you exit the application everything goes
back to default so you need to sort of
redo the whole process which could be a
little frustrating but there are
third-party programs like process lasso
that allows the user to permanently
assign threads but that's something that
we want to look into later so to test
out core affinity I'll be running three
applications at the same time let's
start with Adobe Media encoder blender
and doom I've created three use case
scenarios just to compare and see how
core affinity is efficient so with case
one I'm gonna set everything in Auto I'm
gonna let windows task manager do its
thing and basically just assign the
number of threads to those applications
running at the same time and with case
two I'm gonna be sending twenty threads
to Adobe Media encoder a threats to
blender and then eight threats for doom
our last case is splitting the number of
threats evenly across all three
applications so I'll have 12 threats for
Adobe Media encoder twelve threats for
blender and finally twelve threats for
doom so how do we do well let's start
with case one Adobe Media encoder took
around 15 minutes to render the 4k video
a blender completed its render in three
minutes and 29 seconds while doom was
completely unplayable at one
per second at 4k set to ultra settings
remember we're working with two gtx 10a
TTI's in sli as well but it seems like
there was not enough cpu resources for
the game to run but as soon as blender
completed its render I got an average of
around 50 7.5 frames per second on doom
which is pretty interesting
moving up to case 2 where we assigned 20
threats for Adobe 8 for blender and 8
for Doom the 4k render took 17 minutes
and 27 seconds to complete while blender
did its thing in 11 minutes and 7
seconds and doom surprisingly did not
stutter we got around 65 frames per
second on average and it was a welcoming
a change our last case splitting those
threats evenly across all three
applications we see media encoder
completing that task in 25 minutes
blender completing its render in 7
minutes and 18 seconds and we get a
slight boost in fps in Doom so that
makes sense because we did assign an
additional 4 threats so I think Court
affinity is an excellent feature to take
advantage of especially if you have a
multi-core processor like the 79-80
Extreme Edition CPU it's great I mean
you can just being able to assign number
of threads to a certain applications
fantastic it's actually a lot better
than having Windows 10 do its thing
because as you saw we were barely able
to play paddle free one or just doom in
general I mean one FPS is that's
unplayable you can't do anything so
imagine replacing that task with
something like streaming or doing
something else I don't think you'll be
able to do or get away with something
like that because we had blender as well
running in the background that just
taxed out on the CPU so there are
different things to take into account
so this is where core affinity is an
excellent option now that we've taken a
look at optimizing your CPUs performance
I should also discuss other options that
Intel X junetta and chips and brings to
the table let's start with storage
because it's a crucial element
especially when it comes to a
workstation VC X 299 offers 44 PCI lanes
with 40 being split towards dedicated
graphics solutions and the remaining 4
nbme or other types of high bandwidth
storage having multiple drives is key if
you're working with large format files
because it eliminates bottlenecks and
with your drivers working in parallel
that increases your efficiency in my
case I configure the octane 900p SSD as
my primary boot drive for the operating
system applications like premiere
traffic's Photoshop are the important
ones you know and I should emphasize
that investing in an SSD makes a world
of difference when it comes to boot
times and application launch times the
MDOT to nvme SSD that I've installed on
the motherboard is configured as a
footage or ingest drive where I would
offload my footage from the SD card to
the drive and then use that to edit
videos in premiere for my scratch disk
I've assigned one of those to intel's
545 series SATA base SSD and lastly for
game library I've assigned the other
SATA SSD so this should help ease my
workflow plus it's another way of
staying organized another thing that I
need to mention is that while you're
rendering a video within media encoder
the last few seconds just right after it
completes that video I think that's
where a media encoder just sort of
writes that file towards your drive so
having a fast drive just for that test
so say for example if you have another a
dedicated Drive just for exports so if
you're just basically just rendering it
directly to that drive it would come in
beneficial it would obviously reduce
many times just a little bit only if
you're concerned about many times if
you're not you could just use the
footage drive or the ingest drive that I
talked about earlier and then just keep
it that way
there are different ways to configuring
a workstation PC in my case this works
really well another thing to keep in
mind is that there are some applications
that can fully take advantage of two or
more GPUs alongside the CPU resources
and a good example of that is 3d
rendering the X to 99 chipset allows for
high speed GPU interface across multiple
programs without sacrificing on
bandwidth when compared to their
mainstream XIII semi chipset take octane
render for example I took a sample
spaceship demo render scene and compared
the results with a single GPU and
combined as you can see the render times
are cut by half after enabling the
second graphics card now realistically I
wouldn't recommend gaming GPUs for these
tasks
since there are workstation base GP is
specifically geared towards 3d GPU
acceleration but I just wanted to test
out the true potential of these to 1080
T eyes ok so let me explain what I'm
doing right now
so I've disabled SLI on both TT x 1080
eyes and you can do that through Nvidia
control panel regardless of regardless
if you have the sli bridge or not so you
can go through the control panel and
disable SLI the other thing that I've
done here is after I've actually a
Media encoder to the first GTX 10 a
tester so one of them is dedicated
directly towards the media encoder and
I've said the second GPU for Doom so you
know titles like doom they fully take
advantage of both SLI and single GP
solutions so I've separated those tasks
within those two GPUs and here are some
interesting results with the same core
affinity applied so 20 threads for Adobe
Media encoder 8 threats for blender and
8 threats for Doom the framerate
difference between both cases so
disabled sli versus sli is quite frankly
interesting as you can see I got around
84 frames per second compared to 65
frames per second by just disabling sli
and assigning that second GPU towards
doom and I think I might have an
explanation here but I'm not sure if
it's the right conclusion so correct me
if I'm wrong in the comments down below
so here's what I think I think when you
enable SLI programs like Adobe Media
encoder Doom and other applications they
try to spread their workload across two
graphics cards and this case premiere
really doesn't part Media encoder
doesn't really make any sense because
we've seen through numerous tests that
having a dual GPU solution just for
rendering videos is absolutely pointless
when Doom is running in the background
just as Adobe Media encoder and blender
I think there's a little bit of
confusion with those two graphics cards
because when premiere splits its
workload across two GPUs then you know
doom might have a little bit of a
confusion as to which GPS it should
potentially take advantage of so that's
kind of what's going on here that's what
I think that's causing you know the FPS
drop when you disable or when you enable
SLI but disabling SLI completely fixed
it solved the problem and the results
are as you saw are really interesting we
got you know 84 frames per second on
average at 4k said to Ultra settings
while we were rendering a premiere and
again rendering results haven't affected
whatsoever which is again very
interesting but it totally makes sense
because you know SLI or non-us allow
you're really not going to notice a
significant difference with a high end
GPU like a gtx 980ti
and the last thing that i want to
discuss here is overclocking because I
did want to squeeze a little bit of
performance out of the 18 core processor
but unfortunately I
wasn't able to I spent countless hours
playing around the Ring ratio core
voltage ring voltage si voltage and IO
voltage and I was unsuccessful getting
the CPU above 3.5 gigahertz on all
course it seems like MSI decided to use
middle-of-the-road MOSFETs on this x2
99m gaming pro motherboard and the lack
of proper VR and cooling all added to
the equation in fact when I ran the
stress test I did notice vrm
temperatures going as far as a hundred
and ten degrees Celsius which then
resulted in CPU throttling so all cores
were running at 2.6 gigahertz which is
again really unfortunate remember I'm
trying to overclock an 18 core processor
and a micro ATX motherboard so the
limitations are pretty expected and it
seems like MSI has purposely limited
overclocking on this particular chip but
it might not be the case for the lower
thread count CPUs that until offers so
for example 7900 X or the 79 60 X and
that's a wrap for this X 299 series it
was definitely worth the while it all
started with me exploring the platform
and then going through my process just
building together our first Scottish X
PC although we did face some challenges
I think the end result was absolutely
beautiful and of course in this video we
talked through core affinity and of
course taking you through different
configurations where you can assign the
number of threads which is actually a
great feature if you're if you want to
take advantage or if you want to
optimize a multi-core CPU like the core
I 979 ata extreme edition processor the
other thing is that you know configuring
your storage in a certain way especially
if you're a video editor is crucial so
you know having one as an interest
having a certain drive for ingest and
the other one for exports another one
for scratches is important it'll
definitely help your workflow it help
ease your workflow that's the term that
I want to emphasize on finally we want
to take this time to thank our viewers
for watching this series and of course
let us know in the comments down below
if there are any other ways to evolve
this bill and of course your suggestions
for robust motherboards and I could use
my personal workstation PC will be
fantastic I'll gladly take a look at
those as well and if you're interested
