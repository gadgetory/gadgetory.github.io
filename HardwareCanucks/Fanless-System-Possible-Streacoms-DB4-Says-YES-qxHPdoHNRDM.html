think it to open this thing the M it is
expensive Wow
well let's resume the review after this
creativity is fueled by the best
instruments it doesn't always come easy
and in the process you often realize how
important quality is the Rd 400 bio CC
gives you quality and speed with M de tu
interface the schieben and flash and the
pci bracket making it possible to focus
on what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty alright welcome to our very
first alright welcome to our very first
fanless and completely passively cooled
system experience inside the beautiful
gorgeous streak on DB for now seeing
something like this from the company
totally makes sense they have their
niche market figured out who not only
want the best aluminum experience on the
case but also go through a completely
different assembly process this aluminum
cube is not your ordinary ITX case there
are many features here that I wish would
carry over to the mainstream and
vice-versa I feel this case is trying to
do so many things differently and that
may scare off potential customers but
that's like a catch-22 because it's
totally different approach is the
brilliance behind its success like the
foam factor this cube structure wood
thick 13 millimeter aluminum walls that
make up the majority of the 7 1/2 kilo
weight of this enclosure that are sent
blasted and machine beautifully with
incredibly precise extrusions that are
part of the cooling solution and finally
smoothed out so you're not cut by the
millions of edges around the case size
wise it's pretty compact it would suit
in the living room or a desk environment
very well
I love the stand design that complements
the abstract nature of the frame and
since the motherboard IO is facing down
it keeps the entire prim
the case in character however I wish the
stand was a little bit more elevated so
the thicker cables like the DisplayPort
is not bent at 90 degrees which makes me
really uncomfortable it does the job
with cleanliness but obviously this area
is far from accessible and you'll notice
throughout this review there will be
more convenience compromises for the
sake of the design for example the 2 USB
3 ports are located in one of the
corners which is only good to route USB
hubs via cable because the high
clearance is a restriction for longer
USB sticks plots it's not at all
user-friendly or accessible the power
button is also here it's easy to
memorize its location but I never
thought I would actually comment on the
power LED which to me is way too bright
and creates an unpleasant light spill of
course it can be disconnected from the
bottom i√∂ because there are no fans the
top panel is solid just the light piece
of acrylic that can be used to
accessorize your db4 add some character
to an already beautiful art piece and I
want to get the hardware compatibility
out of the way because it's not really
built for a gaming machine instead that
welcomes the least demanding hardware
possible that produces minimal heat
after all the cooling is completely
passive so there are no fans by default
CPUs up to 65 watts are recommended with
the included heat pipe kit but can be
also extended to 105 watt CPUs with a
larger cooler design so that is one of
the most unique elements here the CPU
cooler is mounted directly onto the side
panel and the large aluminum surface
area off that side panel is what's
cooling your CPU and it's pretty
incredible the case is literally the
heatsink and also looks a little bit
like a heatsink and while the default
configuration only uses one side panel
to cool the CPU they are all identical
and that could be set up for more
advanced cooling as for GPUs maximum
support length is 200 millimetres but
size is not the only spec to think about
for example blower style cards might
work better for exhausting air but the
main compatibility element to think
about is the power supply since db4 only
supports nano PS use or their own
fanless ZF 240 power supply it's a 240
watt unit that has no PCIe power
so graphics cards that are powered by
the motherboard only are compatible like
the GTX 1050 now I understand the
interior is completely closed but having
ketchup mustard cables is not ideal
especially on such an expensive unit and
while this power supply is very thin and
compact and fanless it is limiting what
you can do with the system especially
when an SFX power supply can fit in here
in this space no problem and so this
entire frameless approach is definitely
unique and db4 stands out from the crowd
but in the age of you know extremely
efficient power supplies and graphics
cards whose fans don't turn on until
heavy load I feel like the db4 kind of
missed an opportunity to you know merge
that beautiful styling with the
enthusiast crowd who craved to pack as
much power for Hardware in as little
space as possible and that could be due
to inevitable history of this case
because streak um actually put the
production on hold some four years ago
so four years ago those have been
totally unique in the market but I hope
that streak on would catch up to the
modern specs of having really efficient
hardware that is both cool and quiet and
can you know accompany this beautiful
styling on the inside the motherboard
tray separates the two compartments and
Street comes approach for mounting
everything is very unique for example
each panel is secured with a thumb screw
plus this clever toolless mechanism on
how they are inserted each panel fitting
together like a perfect puzzle piece
it's kind of difficult to describe just
how premium this whole frame feels like
you definitely get what you pay for and
one thing because the aluminum is send
blasted any little marks that you get
through just handling stuff can be
easily wiped off and it looks like
brand-new even if you're going with
metal on metal you know it just wipes
away cleanly and you'll have a pristine
looking case always the first step is to
mount the power supply extension which
has a good length cable for flexibility
or where you want to install the power
supply and you use these Universal
brackets six of them included that
utilize a small clamp system that is
very low profile and can be installed
anywhere around the perimeter of the
case to house your drives the power
supply the CPU heatsink and so we have
total
all control on what and where things
will be mounted the only issue with my
system was right about the extension
cord that doesn't allow a three and a
half inch drive there
there's just no clearance but having no
active cooling inside the case should
encourage you to do an SSD only PC the
motherboard can also accommodate two
SSDs or a single hard drive but you
gotta be mindful of clearance behind the
tray if you already have some brackets
populated putting the system together of
this caliber is very simple collecting
all the cables and the power supply area
is mainly the only cleanup necessary and
the way I wanted to approach this build
is to establish a base temperature
utilizing a low profile Intel stock
cooler which at full load is very loud
but keeping the CPU at sixty C but what
happens when we close the case and let
the interior heat up a little bit
temperatures shoot up to eighty degrees
Celsius and concentrating the heat on
the inside which felt a little bit like
an oven when I remove the top cover and
so then it was time to assemble your own
CPU cooler with the roaming copper plate
heat pipes and the heatsink mount making
sure there's thermal paste on the CPU
and on the heat pipes - before
tightening the mount arm it's all in
pieces because by design even this
assembly can be switched around for
something more capable the heat pipes
have some motion this is normal to allow
a tighter seal when the side panel is
installed and as you can see the
heatsink mount is also held in with the
universal bracket that's really cool the
heat pipes protrude a little bit and
Street comms original approach was to
apply a thermal pad in this area
allowing heat transfer without all that
mess of the thermal paste for example if
you were to take off the side panel but
they later advised to only use the
thermal paste because of a much better
cooling potential now what I'm doing
here is a little bit unconventional
first I'm using a much higher water CPU
than what is recommended with the
default configuration cooler I'm using
an 88 watt CPU which is the 4690k
I'm not overclocking it just to bur
boost to 3.9 gigahertz versus their
recommended up to 65 watts and second I
wanted to go both through the thermal
pads and the thermal paste to see what
type of temperatures we would get and so
for the first option I use the thermal
pad and my CPU reached 100
three Celsius really quickly and that
took about ten minutes to drop the
temperature to about 50 s with one side
panel really hot to the touch to the
point of kind of warming my fingers in
just a few seconds taking off the panel
and the thermal pad is not messy but how
do you store this for future reuse
something straight gum should definitely
think about then I proceeded to apply
what's left of the included tiny thermal
paste tube on this large surface area of
the heat pipes and they really need to
include more thermal paste if this is
the case and finally applying some more
pressure on the heat pipes to make sure
the contact is as tight as possible
rerunning the benchmark gave us a
significantly cooler maximum in the high
80s which is quite good for a completely
silent system with an underpowered
cooler for this particular CPU compared
to the really loud intel cooler and so
the interesting thing about the D before
is it becomes the primary focus of the
entire system you have strict
compatibility rules for the type of
hardware and it's about staying inside
the lines to appreciate everything the
db4 achieves as a fanless enclosure it
feels like many primary elements of this
case sort of chip away at the size of
the customer base and that's okay to
have a very specific and focused target
demographic and so my main negative
point here would be the lack of sfx
power supply support because there's
definitely space for it and would
greatly expand your hardware
compatibility but you know I can see
what circum is trying to achieve they're
definitely going outside of the
conventional boundaries and that should
be celebrated
it's a beautiful merge between design
and engineering particularly those
Universal brackets and the CPU cooler
expansion and because of that we're
giving it the Harvick Knox dam
innovative award assembling your
verdaguer gaming chair just got a whole
lot easier with a simple insert
mechanism of the back seat onto the side
rails so you mount the side screws much
faster a true one-man job
assembly made easy by over a year now
what I would love to know is how many of
you valued the completely fanless
completely silent system you can house
inside the db4 it's a beautiful piece
obviously it's like an art showcase
piece that would blend in very well with
an elegant home within your
furniture within your speaker setup but
how many of you are actually interested
in something like that let us know in
the comments down below I'm Dimitri
we'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
