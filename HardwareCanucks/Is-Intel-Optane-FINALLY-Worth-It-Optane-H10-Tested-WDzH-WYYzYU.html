more specifically obtain h10 now Dimitri
did a video and explained video a few
weeks ago of explaining the technology
behind Intel's latest m10 and HTN memory
and to give you a little bit of context
it's basically you know the combination
of the responsiveness of obtain as well
as that paired with a qlc NAND flash all
put into this single m2 module which is
actually pretty sweet now if you
interested in learning more about it
I'll actually recommend checking
Demetrius video or explained video right
over here
but basically Intel centers you know a
notebook to test out the performance
that you can actually get out of
something like this compared to a
traditional nvme base drive so why don't
we get into that but first a quick
message from our sponsor the new Razer
Blade 15 is a machine for people who
know exactly what they want when you
need a reliable keyboard and one custom
lighting when you need an accurate
display and one insanely fast 144 Hertz
refresh rate when you need a portable
machine and want a gorgeous thin
aluminum unibody in the world's smallest
15.6 inch gaming laptop when you need
powerful gaming hardware to truly
dominate with GeForce r-tx
the Razer Blade 15 when you need the
power for anything you do and want
nothing to hold you back check out the
configuration you want down below ok so
let's quickly go over the notebook that
Intel sent us for testing purposes so
this is an HP Spectre x-360 featuring a
whiskey'll a core i7 85 65 u processor
it also has 16 gigabytes of RAM
and start the show is of course intel's
octane memory age 10 now for comparison
Intel also sampled as an Intel 760 peat
SSD and the capacity on that thing is
around 512 gigabytes this is a 32
gigabyte opti memory module with 512
gigabytes of NAND flash so storage or
capacity wise we are going to be doing
pretty much you know an apples to apples
comparison except this time we have you
know obtain plus some SSD storage in a
single and dr. form factor now I want to
show you guys a more realistic use case
scenario with octane age 10 and in order
to do that I transferred some on a
personal project files and some
applications to both of these drives and
after running you know all these tests
for like multi
times I noticed I mean the difference is
actually really really interesting so
kicking it off with a boot test as you
can see the age ten actually takes about
ten seconds to get into Windows whereas
the seven sixty P takes around eighteen
seconds to get to the desktop
moving on to crystal dis marker and this
is where the octane h10 takes a step
back as you can see the read speeds are
obviously a lot better on the 760 P
compared to the H ten and that's because
for my conversations with Intel they did
mention that the that the Nance the NAND
flash on the H ten modules actually
based off the 660 P so that is probably
one of the reasons why we're getting you
know relatively lower rate performance
compared to these 760 P which is
actually fairly new to the market and if
you did catch Dimitri's explain video he
did mention that the octane memory
module and the NAND flash are actually
split in two by two so two lanes are
dedicated towards octane and then two
lanes are towards the NAND flash itself
and I think that is something to keep
note of because I ended up disabling
obtain on the H 10 because you can do
that through the rst driver and I ran
the crystal the smart benchmark and as
you can see the read and write
performance are almost split by half
which almost makes sense because you
aren't only getting two lanes on the SSD
flash or the SSD are compared to obtain
so they both sort of talk to each other
when it comes to caching certain
applications and that's what kind of
gives you a more responsive system so as
I'm going through the rest of the
benchmarks you'll see why
octane and something like this will be
beneficial for some users out there I
also write a few game launches on both
these SSDs starting with dota 2 the
obtained aged ten took roughly seven and
a half seconds to get to the start
compared to roughly ten seconds on the
760 P the same story goes with doom the
OP th10 took roughly 25 seconds to get
to the mission compared to twenty nine
seconds or so on the 760 P when we had
to photoshop I took this thumbnail
project that I worked on recently and I
launched that with the application and
the H ten took roughly four seconds to
get to that compared to roughly seven
seconds on D seven sixty P now from what
I can tell there isn't a significant
difference between the two drives I mean
just launching a project file from the
start
sure the h10 is a little bit faster but
it's not that much faster to a point
that it just it just gives you that wow
factor so I decided to run a few other
tests to sort of you know flex the
muscles on the h10 and this is what I
did so I took this 18 gigabyte video
file and I duplicated it within a folder
and it decided to launch a GIMP project
file which is around 100 megabytes and
this definitely shows the true potential
of where h10 can come in beneficial now
as you can see the h10 took roughly 10
seconds to open the project compared to
a whopping 40 seconds on these seven 60p
and remember this is with a file
duplicated video duplicated within the
same folder while opening your project
when it's loading up the whole thing and
you know I made sure to run another test
to see if I'm actually if I'm getting
consistent results and I sure was
because I took the exact same background
scenario and I opened up Photoshop and
the h10 took around 9 seconds to open
the project compared to a little over 30
seconds on these seven 60p now this
shirt does need an explanation what
essentially is happening is when I was
performing the task on the 760 P that
drive is actually fighting for resources
it's fighting for bandwidth to complete
its tasks so it's not only duplicating a
file but at the same time it's trying to
open up a project at the same time so
it's basically maxing out the drives
capacity compared to something like the
H 10 you have two separate modules so
you have the opt-in memory that's
actually caching the application to open
the project as fast as it can and then
you also have the QL scene and flash to
you know do its write performance which
is basically duplicating the video files
so it's actually doing its own thing you
know it's sharing the bandwidth in a
very smart way so that it actually opens
a project really faster compared to the
760 P because while the write
performance on H 10 was a lot slower
compared to the 760 P it actually
manages to open the projects in both
scenarios so having looked at the
numbers back-to-back I think the one
conclusion that I can come up with is
that obtain H 10 is really geared
towards the prosumer market because if
you're someone who really
it's access to a lot of assets like data
assets in a short amount of time
h10 would be a lot beneficial because
you know if you're rendering something
in the background or if you're you know
performing multiple background
activities while opening up certain
projects opted-in will certainly be a
lot beneficial because you have intel
octane paired with kill scene and that
sort of talk to each other so I want to
say that it's more of a smarter SSD
compared to what you can buy in the
market right now because if you look at
the 760 P it is a fastest as d don't get
me wrong the sequential read and write
performance definitely tops of charts
compared to the age 10 but you know when
it comes to performing a lot of tasks at
the same time it struggles to share the
bandwidth and I think that's where the
760 p has its limitation and something
like the H 10 kind of takes over in that
case now as a content creator I do see
myself taking advantage of Intel's opt
in age 10 because it sure does
accelerate project load ups or
application load ups in the first place
but for gamers I really don't think you
would actually benefit a lot from
something like this because you know as
you saw with dota 2 and of course doom
just loading a permission you're not
gonna notice a huge difference to
something like a traditional nvme base
drive
oh and another thing you really can't
buy this separately online because
Intel's really targeting this to know
manufacturers and they really want the
them to sort of implement h10 into their
products because you know it's more of a
space-saving storage unit that helps
accelerate programs rather than you know
giving you the best performance it's
really again like I said it's really
geared towards a certain type of
demographic but the other thing that
really concerns me the most is pricing
because I have no information regarding
that at least from the briefing that I
had with Intel regarding octane h10 so
you know definitely expect it to be a
little bit more expensive compared to a
traditional traditional nvme SSD but of
course it does come with its drawbacks
and of course its pros as well so let me
know what you guys think about opt NH 10
and of course having looked at the
performance numbers or having looked at
the numbers in general are you impressed
would you actually consider a notebook
with obtaining H 10 and would you like
to see something like this hit the
desktop platform I'd love to know your
thoughts in the comments
