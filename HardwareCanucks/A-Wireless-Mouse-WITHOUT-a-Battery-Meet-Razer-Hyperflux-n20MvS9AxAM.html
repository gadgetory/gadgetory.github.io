this year's CES but this time they are
going directly after logitech slight
speed wireless mouse technology with a
version of their own called hyper flex
and from our perspective they might
actually have the better solution why
because unlike the powerplay ecosystem
the Mamba hyper flex wireless mouse and
Firefly hyper flex mousepad don't even
require heavy battery the power from the
mat is transferred directly to the mouse
we went for a hands-on demo and razor
suite so let's go to that right after a
message from our sponsors our 2018 CES
coverage is brought to you by fan tax
Corsair and Coolermaster when we were
reviewed power play last year it was
obvious that Logitech had developed
something quite unique but in some ways
it still felt like a first generation
device the mouse itself was a bit heavy
for our liking and there were a few
other quarks with the wireless charging
technology that prevented the system
from offering a seamless experience
Razer thinks that they have solved
almost all the problems associated with
those first-generation attempts by
creating a technology that projects a
magnetic field from the mousepad and
into the mouse supposedly this
technology is the world's first to
provide power directly to the mouse and
eliminates the need for a battery the
first Mouse being outfitted with hyper
flux is raisers Mamba and nothing has
changed from this peripherals overall
design and as a 5g optical sensor
capable of delivering a true dpi up to
sixteen thousand nine programmable
buttons and will only come in a
right-hand format with side rubber grips
as with every other higher-end Mouse
these days it comes with RGB lighting
that can be controlled through Razer
streamlined snap software also if you
wanted to use the Mamba hyperflex off
it's charging mat there's also a handy
2.1 meter cable to game in Wired mode
the Firefly hyperflex mouse mat feels
like razors other high-quality mats
except this one has new yeste RGB lining
because why not it has dual reversible
heart and coughed mouse mats but
remember that this will be required for
wireless charging of compatible mice
after using this combo for a little
while it was so hard to distinguish the
Mamba hyperflex from the standard Mamba
this is exactly what razors trying to
achieve - they wanted a true Wireless
experience without a bad
and without any interruptions there
really weren't any hiccups but I do have
some concerns about the long-term
effects of exposure to a low-level
magnetic field both myself and other
electronic devices near the mousepad
as a matter of fact razer recommends
that you not place a smartphone on the
pad surface the hyper vlog setup isn't
cheap either remember this thing is
cutting-edge technology that may be
blazing a new path for less expensive
peripherals you'll end up paying a cool
$250 for the Mamba a slashed Firefly
combo when it's launched in q1 of 2018
like every year I think that Razer has
one of the most interesting showcases at
CES with project Lynda the new Nomo
speaker line-up and now high per flux
2018 will be a really interesting year
for them in many ways this is Ebert with
hurricane axe and our coverage from CES
2010 will continue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
