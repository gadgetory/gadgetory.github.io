seems like in every show silverstone has
something interesting to show including
CES there were some consum cases new
production enclosures and revisions to
some of our old favorites perhaps the
most interesting though item was this
small unassuming little prototype case
dubbed ESG 14 let's take a look at it
after message from our sponsors the show
coverage is possible thanks to Nvidia
gigabyte fan techs and NCIX
so at the heart the SD 14 uses the same
baseline layout as the SG 13 but it has
been slightly expanded dimensions wise
to accommodate its vertical orientation
that orientation means it takes up less
space on your desk but also ensures easy
access to all your components once all
those side panels are removed speaking
of this panels and the cases orientation
I'm not sure Silverstone realised but
this SG 14 prototypes does look a little
bit like the thermal text our 900 case
but isn't like this mini-me format there
are her or some very distinctive
features it's black tinted plexi front
panels feature very gentle curve while
the power and reset and the i/o
connectors are at the top so they exit
through this little cutout through the
back and you can hide them easily
for the interior perspective there are
more than enough space to work with and
there's even space for 11 inch GPUs
silverstone did their best to maximize
every usable millimeter of the SGS 14
and it also seems like vertical GPU
mounting was definitely the trend at
this year's show and the SG 14 prototype
did exactly that in order to minimize
its footprint while maximizing GPU
visibility and since this is a very
early handmade prototype silverstone
would love your feedback about what if
anything they should change before this
case goes into full production so for
example they want LEDs on the inside or
do you want it completely plain so that
it has the smarter and elegant the sort
of darker appeal what do you think of
this layout is there anything they
should change on the SG 14 let us know
in the comments down below
moving on let's have a look at the PMO 1
RGB yes the magical CES RGB fairy
sprinkled a little bit her pixie dust
onto the original PMO 1 but there are
also a bunch of other changes for this
version many of those changes were
actually brought up by us and our video
review so thank God to Silverstone
actually listening and take
notes so what about those changes well
for the most part the case remains
adhere to the same layout and the
successful design but the RGB version
receives the new RGB fan grills we'll
talk about those later and now a
tempered glass window silverstone has
taken our advice and removed the screws
from the front panel of the pl/1 making
it a true tooless design so you can
access those fans and the dust filter
easily added a module a fan plus RGB
controller which is at the back of the
case and will eventually be rolling out
with the front area module with USB 3.1
gen2 support oh and that side panel with
the horse that will actually be offered
as an option yeah this is a very
targeted for the Chinese market not
necessarily gonna be popular in the
North American market another major
change is the radiator support at the
top you're now able to mount dual 140 or
120 member fans right above the frame
which was not possible on an original
pmo one plus we have now cutouts in that
frame so you can mount cable tubing from
an AI o or radiator or fans into the
inside of the case as for the interior
itself it remains largely unchanged
other than added RGB strips and defense
roller hub expect the PM o 1 RGB to
become available in next few weeks for
$150 which represents about a $40
premium over its predecessor and now
let's talk about the RGB fan grills
which are really cool here they are so
instead of integrating LEDs directly
into the fan housing silverstone decided
to create something different
these mount on top of your existing fans
and give off this unique diffused light
rather than something harsh that you get
sometimes from illuminated fans so yes
they are another component to install
and they may be size restricted so for
example these are for 140 motor fans
only but we all love them they look very
unique and say you have to replace the
fans you don't actually lose out on any
of the illumination portion and they
also want to give the short mention to a
pretty unique power supply this is the
world's first 800 watt PSU that's fully
compatible with the chassis that
requires an SFX sized power supply not
only does it carry certification of 800
watts of continuous operation and a
fully modular interface but there is
also a t + titanium certified making
this enhanced built unit one of the most
efficient power supplies on the market
right now and according to Silverstone
for an 800 watt SFX power supply to be
successful or even necessary for that
matter they will likely need to be
complete rethink in the overhaul in the
ITX space and right now even with the
most powerful CPU and the GPU on the
market jammed into this ITX case power
input will never exceed 600 watts so
basically this unit has not been built
to fulfill the need but rather it could
push system designers towards some very
unique and high-performance concept and
so there you have it
a little bit of something for everyone
from Silverstone would hope you guys are
enjoying our post Show coverage of CES
2017 expect more soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
