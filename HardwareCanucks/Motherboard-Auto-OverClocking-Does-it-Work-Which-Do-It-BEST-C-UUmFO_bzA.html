and let's establish a fact here
overclocking a cpu or processor is not
rocket science at least for the majority
of our audience here but sometimes you
can't ignore key elements that could
potentially cut your CPUs lifespan that
is the core voltage temperatures called
ratios etc but first time users who are
introduced into this new concept might
find these elements a little
intimidating or they might want the best
performance without tons of trial and
error to overcome the issues and
guesswork normally associated with
manually overclocking a CPU motherboard
manufacturers have implemented certain
steps to auto overclock they capable
unlocked processor there is now some
great software that can be downloaded
from the respective website or you could
do it through the BIOS the intent for
this video will be to show how new
motherboards and their features can
allow first-time users or even
experienced users to safely and easily
overclock their systems with just a
press of a few buttons but most
importantly we're going to be finding
out how well various motherboard
manufacturers do that so let's dive in
right after this what is that the you 31
you should put a ring on it yes time to
make it our to be official
you
there will take rain high static
pressure fans because your key is there
if the rain poor details in description
below alright allow me to set the stage
for you guys just so you won't get lost
by the time I reveal the results our
roundup features 5z 270 flagship
motherboards from reputable
manufacturers like msi asu's EVGA as
rock and gigabyte my cpu of choice for
testing all these boards will be the
core i5 7600 k this is a popular choice
among gamers who crave for highest clock
speeds because it is one of the best
price to performance overclockable chips
in the KB Lakeline app for memory I
decided to go with G skills Trident Z
series 32 gigabyte kit that's capable of
speeds up to 30 400 megahertz along with
overclocking me processor I will also be
evaluating the DRAM frequencies as some
of the board's auto seat settings enable
the XMP profile as well I used the CLC
280 a IO liquid cooler from EVGA to cool
the 7600 K because Auto C certainly
plays around with voltages and I wanted
to ensure I have proper cooling
throughout my torture tests I did test
these motherboards inside a closed
chassis featuring the s340 case from NXT
as we'll also be monitoring CPU
temperatures using either 64
the rest of components are pretty
irrelevant in this case and that
includes the GPU the power supply the
SSD and other elements because none of
those play a key role when it comes to
overclocking so let's take a look at our
contenders shall we first up let's take
a look at our cheapest Z 270 based
motherboard and then move our way up
this is the asrock Z 270 Taichi that
retails for around $220 it's a pretty
basic looking board that does not
feature a lot of RGB goodness if you're
looking for aesthetics but it does pack
a punch when it comes to user
upgradeable add-ons it's got three empty
two slots that support the PCIe gen3
standard PCI use steel armor
reinforcements dual Intel and a robust B
clock engine that should complement the
auto OC procedure as rock is focusing
this board to be the most reliable in
the market because it does feature of
high-end electrical components that
should help with stability for the long
run but I guess the results will tell
next up we have the gigabyte or SGA v
270x gaming 7 motherboard it's got all
the bells and whistles that you would
ever
for a board including RGB lighting
through the RAM slots steel-reinforced
shielding for the PCI slots 2 m dot 2
connectors for PCIe SSD s and a single
YouTube connector you also get a high
quality creative sound core 3d deck
along with killer networking and list
just goes on from a physical standpoint
the orders board is quite unique and
it's got a white and black color scheme
that's not too fancy but it would fit in
well if you're thinking about a
stormtrooper build but price-wise you're
looking at a $10 premium over the asrock
board our next player is MSI's z2 70
gaming m7 it's the top-of-the-line
motherboard from MSI's gaming c2 70
series and for your convenience we've
also featured this particular board in
our recent ultimate gaming splash
editing PC build video link is down in
the description if you're interested the
gaming m7 is an interesting addition to
the roundup because it does feature a
simple and intuitive auto OC function
through MSI's game boost knob and check
this out there's a physical knob located
at the bottom right hand corner of the
board that you can use to select the
preset ever size program to the board
already it's really weird but at the
same time it's also pretty cool just
like any other flagship board expect
features like RGB lighting next
generation u2 connector 3 and our 2
slots and military-grade components if
you really care about quality our second
last board is from the mighty folks over
at EVGA meet the g27 a classified k
that's purely targeted towards
enthusiasts who just want to achieve
stable overclocks without worrying about
fancy aesthetic features like RGB
lighting and such it's an extended ATX
motherboard with support for dual end
are two connectors a quad core audio
processor from creative and
interestingly enough you'll find 8 pin
CPU connectors to ensure the power
reaching the processor is clean and
stable the i/o is fairly limited on the
board compared to the competition and
that makes sense because like I
mentioned earlier this is an enthusiast
class board designed for overclocking
and it doesn't come cheap
priced at $300 it is the most expensive
HSN today's motherboard among the 5 that
I'm testing out in the video actually
there's one more from the folks over at
Asus can't forget about them because
they do offer a variety of motherboards
priced appropriately for the
rumors and they're generally well known
for overclocking and Intel based CPU my
money is on this guy the Maximus 9 code
because it looks stealthy AF and the RGB
lighting is very subtle compared to the
other four plus it features a thermal
armor throughout the entire PCB to
emphasize the code branding feature wise
there's just a lot to talk about this
board but I'm just going to go over a
few key unique features that water
cooling enthusiasts might find
attracting ACS has implemented dual
water temperature headers and flow rate
header to feed information to the fan
export utility this way you can
constantly monitor the flow rate along
with the temperatures of an entire loop
the IO is jacked with USB ports there's
a USB 3.1 front panel header that some
cases can take advantage of the digital
power controller is precisely tuned to
deliver these smoothest core voltages
and the rest of the components are made
of high-quality materials
I can't wait to reveal the test results
to you guys but before we move on let's
take a quick look at our testing
methodology I used item 64 to stress
tested sepia for 2 hours per motherboard
this was to ensure that the overclock
was stable during heavy load situations
in real time and that it wouldn't either
throttle under load or down clock due to
various reasons CPU core voltage is also
a key element to consider here as many
of these boards dynamically adjust the
voltage to achieve the best possible
clock speed the higher the voltage the
higher the temperature and sometimes
that could end up potentially shortening
the lifespan of your CPU
luckily my 76 in a case stood strong and
I was surprised that I was actually able
to complete this round up since some of
the automatic overclocking programs push
extreme voltages to the processor in
order to achieve stability so what is
considered a winning combination here
well that's pretty simple I'm looking
for the software or automatic setting
that achieves the highest o´clock at
the lowest voltage that remains
rock-solid
of course automatic memory overclocking
is also beneficial in our books but some
manufacturers avoid that since high ram
speeds add another variable into the
equation now almost every one of these
boards perform their automatic
overclocking quite differently there's
some that apply a simple generic one
size fits all voltage and core speed
boost while others actually do their own
stress testing to customize a overclock
for your particular CPU so now let's
walk through each individual boards
our overclocking features along with the
results one board at a time starting
with gigabytes or Z 270 gaming seven I
used the easy to an option from
gigabytes app center which then opened a
separate window that revealed system
information along with various presets
that can be applied towards the CPU I
chose the auto tuning option and then
proceeded to the tuning process the
system rebooted after 30 seconds then it
started to stress test the CPU by
increasing the core ratios the maximum I
was able to get was 4.8 gigahertz at one
point two seven two volts I ran my
standard Ida 64 stress test for two
hours and it passed with flying colors
averaging around 60 C under load and 30c
during idle unfortunately the board did
not overclock the memory but I did test
out the OC preset for 4.4 gigahertz the
system passed the stress test but
interestingly enough the core voltages
were sitting around 1.3 - that's a mere
point 0-5 volts higher than the 4.8
gigahertz overclock I was able to
achieve with the auto tuning option
fascinating right taking a look at the
built-in presets in the BIOS they were
fairly limited because as you can see
the maximum they had available was a 4.6
gigahertz overclock for the 76 and K I
did stress test that option and it
passed no problem yielding those
voltages and temperatures but it did not
overcome the memory next up I tested the
asrock Tai Chi Z 270 motherboard the
auto C feature was built into the a
tuning software that had to be
downloaded from the website I chose the
performance option I proceeded to the
Advanced tab from there actual C 4.8
gigahertz OC preset which was the
maximum available and clicked apply the
system rebooted successfully applying
the preset but surprisingly the core
voltage was sitting around 1.4 0-8
that's a point to increase from what I
was able to achieve with the gigabyte
board and the temps were hovering around
60 Hz once again that's a 10 degree
difference from the gigabyte board that
being said this did not pass by stress
test as you can see the CPU down clocks
to 4.6 gigahertz and it remained at that
frequency over the course of night
two-hour test now for my second attempt
I applied the 4.7 gb x OC preset from
the a tuning app and rebooted the system
sadly it was the same story as last time
the CPU down clocked all the way to four
point five gigahertz during my stress
test
and the core voltage was sitting around
1.36 also yielding temperatures around
60 to see which was a lot lower than 68
with the 4.8 gigahertz preset the
built-in optimist OC preset was similar
to a tuning software I did test out
before point 8 gigahertz preset but
unfortunately it wasn't stable under
load
fYI even the core voltages and
temperatures remain identical to what
was achieved via a tuning next up we
checked out the MSI C 270 G m7 auto
overclocking can be done through the
command center which is MSI's utility
for monitoring system specs including
the option to overclock the DRAM what
we're looking for is game dos that gives
you full access to a preset it also
lists what overclock you can expect at
each level which is incredibly handy I
chose set 11 that targeted the 7600 K
for 4.9 gigahertz the system rebooted
successfully would definitely set but
check out that voltage 1.5 0-7 volts
that's dark territory for the CP of my
friends and I was reluctant to stress
test the system but I decided to do it
anyways and we see that the CPU down
clocks itself 24.8 under load and
temperatures exceeded ATC the CLT 280
cooler did a fantastic job keeping
things under control and interestingly
enough this was one of the first boards
to overclock the RAM to 3300 megahertz
but man the voltage is way too high for
the CPU my second attempt was to test
out set 10 that overclocks the chip to
4.8 gigahertz but sadly it did not
remain static during the stress test as
a dumb clock itself 24.7 core voltages
were sitting at one point four which was
still a lot higher than expected and
temps were hovering around 70 C so
that's a 10 degree difference from the
4.9 GRE that I tested earlier now the
bias for the MSI motherboard is exactly
the same as the game boost software that
we just took a look at so doing it
either way wouldn't really make a huge
difference because they feature the
exact same presets
let's now discuss the EVGA AC 270
classified motherboard I had a lot of
expectations for this guy because it's
purely targeted towards enthusiasts who
just want to achieve a stable overclocks
but when it comes to auto overclocking
there's not a lot to expect here let me
show you exactly what I mean
you see EDG
the elite tuning utility x4 monitoring
system information but it's essentially
images flavor of cpu-z
with a few options for overclocking that
- had to be done manually by playing
around with eco ratios and voltages as
there are no audible C functionalities
but I was told by EVGA that the BIOS has
an auto OC function that automatically
sets CPU voltage once you set a CPU
multiplier I gave that a shot since it's
not that difficult to enter Kol ratios
my first attempt was to set it at 50 for
a solid 5 gigahertz overclock the system
boot is successfully applying a core
voltage of one point three four four but
during my stress test the CPU dunk on
its way down to four point seven
I did try four point eight and four
point seven but unfortunately the CPU
down clocked its way to four point five
and four point four respectively with
the following voltages shown here also
this board did not overcook the memory
which makes sense because ebj does not
offer that feature one auto overclocking
the CPU the last automotive test here is
the ROG Maximus nine code from ACS I
took advantage of the AI suite - a
utility app that featured the five way
optimization option from there I choose
the extreme tuning option with tp1
enabled this feature plays around with
the Cole ratios and achieves the best
possible overclock after cooking me
start by the system rebooted and the AI
utility started stress testing the CPU
while simultaneously increasing the cold
ratios it's really a smart tool in my
opinion because you get real-time stats
for your voltage but it won't proceed
until it knows that it's safe to
increase the ratio it took its time and
I got to 5 degrees no problem with a
cold voltage of one point four two volts
unfortunately the CPU dumb clocked
itself to 4.9 during the stress test the
temperatures were well within reach
averaging around 68 degrees coming back
to the AI suite app I wanted to try out
these TPU 2 options since that adjust
the bus speed of the processor you won't
believe this but it's successfully
booted with a 5.1 gigahertz or o'clock
without crashing core voltages and
temperatures were the same compared to
what I achieved earlier with TPU one but
under load the CPU once again down clock
2 to 5 gigahertz also this board did
overclock the memory to 29.92 megahertz
compared to MSI's overclock it's
slightly lower but the
did that is just awesome the BIOS is
just filled with different profiles to
overclock the CPU I chose the golden 5g
preset and it was a success the system
stayed rock-solid at five megahertz both
under idle and load situations but it
did not overcome the memory this time
core voltages were slightly higher than
the Ottawa clock but it was not that
significant so guys I think it's about
time to wrap up my thoughts on Auto
overclocking five of the best z2 70
based motherboards it certainly required
a lot of patience and personally it was
a learning experience for me because I
learned how to manually overclock a CPU
by reading the forum's online and
watching tutorial videos I'm sure most
of you did the same thing as well but
this Auto C feature that motherboard
manufacturers have implemented into
their motherboards is an excellent
option especially for first-time users
we don't want to tinker around with core
voltages and coal ratios and other
elements it's a great feature to embrace
especially if you're craving for higher
gaming performance with just a few
clicks because modern titles these days
love higher frequencies I'm not going to
be picking a clear winner here because
all these motherboards are great when it
comes to manual overclocking an example
or I guess the worst example that we
encounter here was ebj easy to send
classified board which costed around
$300 and it didn't do that great with
the auto overclocking feature in fact it
did not have an auto overclocking
feature because it was just EVGA a
built-in feature in the BIOS and it
didn't really work out that great aces
on the other hand had the best best best
auto overclocking feature with just a
button and just a few steps with TPU 1
and TP 2 I think that's an excellent
option if you really want to take
advantage of that board but again it's
expensive it's a $300 what really
surprised me was the cheapest among them
all the azrog board which was super
stable I was easily able to get 4.8
gigahertz without a problem
but what also surprised me was that out
of the five motherboards that I tested
only two of them overclocked the memory
issues and the MSI amasai torille called
the memory to its maximum potential but
at least it's great that these vendors
have implemented or added that extra
element to the equation guys let us know
your thoughts on Auto overclocking and
what do you guys think about the results
that I was able to extrapolate with our
overclocking pretty much the same CPU on
all the five motherboards
but also stay tuned for Rison because
there's a lot of X 370 boards that I'd
like to check out but I'm also not so
looking forward to that because
overclocking rising processor is way
more complicated than Intel or maybe I'm
just I don't know it's something out
there anyways stay tuned for that
