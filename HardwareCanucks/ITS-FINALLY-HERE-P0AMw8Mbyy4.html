inside a case hello everyone I'm Dimitri
with her economics welcome to another
behind the scenes today I'm in a bit of
a creative challenge because I am
currently filming the review for the
Thermaltake core w200 it is the largest
case that we've ever worked with the
whole thing is steel it's incredibly
heavy to pick up in this state so
imagine when I populate two systems in
two it is going to be very difficult to
maneuver around my space so I have a
plan I need to utilize my time in each
space that I position the case in so
right now it's against the white wall so
I can get my shots and then I'm going to
position the whole thing sort of in the
middle of my room here with the
background being the trees and the
balcony there so that I can I can have
full 360-degree space around the case so
I'm hoping it should be fun and I'm
psyching myself up for it because I
really want to make you guys proud with
what we can do when it comes to things
like that however I'm going to be honest
with you guys I am a little bit worried
publishing this video because of the
hashtag thermal fake bandwagon that's
going on right now and you know I
definitely want to encourage this
discussion and the main review video so
I have to be worrying my my conversation
and my review notes carefully so that I
can explain our situation from a
reviewers standpoint carefully well that
is inclusive of everybody's position but
that's gonna nothing take some work in
making sure that we are not bashing each
camp but also explaining our situation
walls
so as I'm filming the case behind me a
very good advice came from Brandon Lee
from lioness effectives he said it's
about accepting the compromise of the
frame that you want based on your time
frame and based on your studio space aka
balance out all the elements that goes
into your production so that you can
still deliver a visually pleasing image
to your audience but perhaps when you
are stumble upon some challenges go
outside the box
try not to fully recreate what you've
done in the past as I have because this
is the largest thing that I've ever
filmed so I'm trying to follow my
mentality of how I normally shoot cases
but I have to get out of that mindset
and accept the fact that it's going to
be a very different shoot thanks Brandon
love you man
I am very particular about my lines so I
try to level everything out so that
lines at the bottom match the lines at
the top but in this case maybe it's
because it's so large and it's still it
there is some like my nude curves in the
steel therefore it cannot fully match my
horizontal lines at the bottom in terms
of video footage to the top once when
I'm panning
even if my tripod is fully leveled and
stuff I'm thinking it's combination the
case being slightly skewed and then also
my table is most likely not leveled
perfectly so one walk around to that is
shooting from the side and therefore I
get sort of this type of angle and you
don't notice the the skewed lines so
much and it's not me trying to hide the
sticky lines on the case that's not
that's not at all I'm just trying to
create a good composition so I can
sharpen the inside and very particular
about my lines so like I'm handing up
and the top line doesn't match the
horizontal line at the bottom
I can't conclude that shot has been
perfect
sometimes during the filming process
little packages arrive to know what's
inside of it I'm super excited to share
this on camera let's do this I need to
be very careful not to move the tripod
legs because I still want to keep the
same shot Green oh my god
and so this was stuck in customs but
this seal isn't yet broken I know Kyle
from awesomesauce Network was passing
through and they had to break the seal
this seal isn't broken I'm gonna pause
that music because there's a time in
place when I listen to music is when I'm
working out what I'm cooking when I need
to relax when they need to just jump
around in the office to some crazy
trance song that I found but whenever
I'm shooting video I want to have my
brain engaged in other than trying to
come up with cool shots so podcasts come
into play a fantastic podcast will they
listen to the day is this is hitman
brain very talented
hidden brain by NPR fantastic show this
is not like a plug-in for them that's
just something that I tried to listen to
whenever I'm working so that I can
engage my mind because they have
fantastic conversations about politics
science issues everything that you can
possibly imagine very interesting show
so I can be engaged in here and also
here when I'm trying to come up and
compose my shots to be as creative as
possible while I'm shooting while
working I'm also learning
another package has just arrived
let's open it up a gaming headset ok so
a little change of plans as to what I'm
filming no longer filming the case which
is right over there
I blocked off the windows because I want
to be very dark I'm creating a very
moody video for what's under there which
is the GTX 1080 and this is probably
going to be the creepiest introduction
that I've ever done because I am the the
actor inside of it the creepy one and I
have a mask and a flashlight
I will incorporate like really quick
motions in premiere and also playing
with lighting to create a very moody
atmosphere and then some ambient like
dark sounds in the background + reverb
in everything that I record with a
microphone with the gh4 right there
so it sounds like I'm in like big Hall
like kind of blocky sound so this should
be fun the day he is turning out to be
completely crazy I had no idea that this
would be doing but spoken with Michael
we have this nail down that's going to
be really hopefully well-received video
and a well-received video eight was so
this was the unboxing very creepy vibe I
hope you guys enjoyed it make sure it's
check it out the link in description but
this would be the conclusion of this
vlog
apologies for spanning it over a couple
of days and doing sporadic things or
like whipping this up and literally just
a couple of hours while in the midst of
shooting a case for you the largest one
we've ever done so all the links will be
in the description below he haven't
checked out our previous vlogs and if
you have any suggestions on what type of
content you'd like to see from a vlog in
the future please let us know all
feedback counts and I make sure to
deliver but I'm three Trevor's I reckon
axe thanks much for watching and we'll
see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
