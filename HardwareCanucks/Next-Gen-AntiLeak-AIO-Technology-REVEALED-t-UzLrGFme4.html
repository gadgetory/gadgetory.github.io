something interesting that they've been
cooking for a while particularly in the
cooling segment they're calling it the
anti leak tech and yes as the term
suggests this technology is supposed to
significantly improve their AIO's
operation by allowing it to achieve an
automated pressure balance and improve
longevity on liquid cooling let's get
into how it works but first huge thanks
to our sponsors pantex and Steel series
because without them Computex 2019 would
not have been possible now when you look
at a typical a a cooler the coolant
plays an important role when it comes to
cooling the processor now the pump
design is also very crucial and as the
coolant temperature increases the
pressure within the AIO also increases
and over time this expansion and
contraction can cause or could cause
certain components to leak Deepcool who has
somehow figured out a way to implement
an elastic pressure relief bag with one
sized exposed to the air and the other
inside the coolant so when the internal
pressure increases the air inside the
bag gets pushed out creating more area
within the AIO and this decreases
pressure think of it like a lung
exhaling air the capsule itself is made
out of a specialized rubber material
that's also heat and corrosion resistant
and Deepcool also claims that the
material itself wouldn't deform over the
temperature variances and I do have this
you know really interesting mock-up
sample of the actual Anti Lake tech as
you can see that's the rubberized
capsule hopefully this hopefully this
camera focuses right or autofocus is
right and then you've also got the
release point right over there so you
know even though this isn't he working
sample I think it's pretty cool tech now
with the implementation of this new anti
leak tech does it automatically result
in better CPU temperatures not
necessarily because Deepcool is really
gearing for or targeting towards the AIO's longevity over you know cooling
performance and while they are
considering achieving both those you
know it's really interesting to see
they're taking a longevity as one of
their highlights for their new a aya
coolers and I'm hoping that you know
I'll be able to test this out to keep
you guys sort of my long-term experience
with their products now unfortunately
adding this rubber caps you'll insert
causes the radiator size to increased by
a bit the vehicle did mention that
they've tested compatibility with most
ATX cases but I highly
this would fit a micro ATX case moving
on to the new coolers they announced the
Castle EX series and as you can see it
looks very familiar to their previous
Castle two models but now they've
included the anti lick technology the
logo chip is now swappable and
customizable and you can do that by
twisting the cap and taking off the
circular insert Deepcool does including
normal one with their logo as well as a
plain option so users can attach
stickers or anything you'll also notice
the subtle ring lining around the pump
that looks really cool and it features
addressable RGB lighting the pump design
now features a dual chamber system that
allows for a better flow and they've
increased the size of these skype fins
behind the copper core plate by 25% the
included fans have also been revised so
first and foremost they're not RGB thank
you Deepcool cuz personally I didn't
like the ones on the original Castle
cooler the blades on the new fan are
more efficient and exhausting hot air
plus they've built these subtle vents
around the corners that improve acoustic
performance there'll be two models of
the Castle ax series so you get the 240
millimeter and 360 moment option and
pricing is $120 and $160
respectively and you can pick up these
models right now the captain series of
coolers are receiving a slight upgrade
as well so instead of the glass pipe
design going into the pump they replaced
it with a metal one which they claims
should dissipate heat a bit better it
also comes with the anti Lake technology
and you get both 240 and 360 moment
options
pricing starts at $105 and 134 or 135
dollars respectively they're also
offering white models for a few extra
dollars on both sizes so that about
wraps up our coverage here at Deepcool
let me know what you guys think about
the new anti Lake tech that Deepcool
has integrated within their new AIO
coolers is this something that you would
consider you know looking into
I certainly am pretty interested in
testing this new whole tech but yeah let
me know what you guys think I'm Eva with
Hardware Canucks thank you so much for
watching
