hello everyone this is Dimitri with
Harbor Canucks and welcome to another
review if I was to describe in a few
words what NZXT has been doing for the
past little while on their case designs
I would say innovative for the budget
there are only a few handful of
companies that actually striving to be
competitive and NZXT is definitely in
the leading pack as to the most part
they implement features that we as
builders warn and leave out all the
unnecessary stuff out of the equation
and for those looking for a mid Tower
sized ATX chassis with a very capable
internal layout and a really Suites
price point this would be it meet the
s340 the ladies chassis from NZXT that
aims to set that benchmark on how the
competition should follow with its $69
price tag with pretty much full metal
construction and I would like to start
with the entire bland and boxy approach
that's so not NZXT as they're known for
their slightly curvy and mainly angular
designs
so the s340 would look boring if it
wasn't for that glossy and slightly
textured metal coating surrounding both
sides in the front it is highly
reflective that would look stellar in
any environment and the best part it
doesn't really feel like a $69 case with
the rigid side panels and absolutely no
flex in the internal frame the drawbacks
however are the clearly visible dust
particles and their certain lighting
conditions and of course fingerprints
that are annoying but likely disappear
with a quick wipe the top of the case
has a matte finish instead with two USB
3 ports audio jacks and PR buttons plus
a single fan slot for 120 or a single
140 Millner fan and given how closed off
the front panel is NZXT has left a large
opening for air fault to enter between
the case and the front panel that is
adequate for plenty of static pressure
to occur behind it is a removable
magnetic dust filter and no intake fans
included as the s340 is designed for an
all-in-one what
to be installed in the front anyway so a
240 or 280 million radiators are
supported plus notice the lack of any
typical hard drive storage so this
allows direct airflow delivery into the
main chamber the side window follows
that fully boxy layout as well that
would showcase the internals beautifully
although the panel scratched way too
easily you can see it here under direct
sunlight but here's a close-up of me
lightly running my dull nail through it
and if you aren't worried yet the worst
part that it doesn't come off so NZXT
really should rethink the plastic used
for the side panel for something more
sturdy and better quality on the better
note though the thumb screws stay with
the panel so you never lose them and
then would love for this to become the
standard on all cases where possible
bust the included power supply bracket
has the same implementation just lovely
at the rear we get the 120 millimeter
exhaust fan 7 PCI slots and the power
supply bracket for easier installation
of your unit from the back instead of
trying to squeeze it from the side
the s340 stands on tall quality case
feet and up to this point everything
aside from the scratches on the side
panel have been really impressive until
we get to the power supply dust filter
we get this awesome magnetic filter at
the front but they sure have to cut
corners somewhere with this flabby
mesh thingy so I'm not impressed and
moving inside this does look familiar
right so remember the aged 440 well it's
a similar approach although now in an
even smaller footprint we still get two
SSD brackets along with appropriate
cutouts coming from the chamber below
for appropriate cable management plus I
love the utilization of the space for
the drives and SSDs are then showcased
through the window and replacement is
also super simple power supply goes to
the bottom and since there's nothing on
the way really long units are still
compatible with a few K with that points
on the floor who really clean things up
in front of the power supply we find the
hard drive cage for two three and a half
inch drives only as there are no caddies
and instead you mount these mechanical
drives directly onto the metal cage
without any rubber padding included so
this means potential audible vibrations
might arise from your basement below the
cage there is an additional space for
cables but mounting
host for two and a half inch and three
and a half inch drives as well in case
you need extra storage now one of the
most obvious additions of the interior
is actually the cable management /
reservoir bracket that is supposed to
cover the large opening to the right of
the motherboard and hide the exiting
cables from the back it does extend
inside so you can easily pass any type
of cable through plus it also has a few
cable type points at the back and this
cutout in the upper portion for mounting
reservoirs and for this price point
that's excellent to see I also was happy
to find pre install motherboard
standoffs with a longer one in the
middle to help with that initial descent
of the motherboard so thank you for that
and we have a total of 39 centimeters of
clearance for a GPU until we hit the
front of the case and this clearance
will be reduced based on the thickness
of the radiator and the fan that you
will install at the front now for the
first bill that use their x41 cooler
this is a 140 millimeter all in one and
the cable management bracket was
actually on the way of installation
since the spacing between the bracket
and the frame is only 60 millimeters so
keep that in mind as otherwise you'll
have to remove the bracket to have
clearance for any thicker radiator Plus
fan combos and this leads me to my next
point the bracket is secured with seven
screws that's five too many making the
process so much more difficult than it
needs to be especially since I found
doing all the wiring much easier without
it in 60 really should have made it
removable with just two thumb screws to
simplify your entire assembly process
and also if mounting was flexible on a
strip instead of fixed holes we might
actually have made it work as you can
see there's just a few millimeters off
the original mounting points with that
x41 cooler installed in the front
however mounting in there x61 cooler
which is a 280 million radiator and it's
a slimmer system you can see the appeal
of this bracket to hide the cables with
the system looking very capable and
clean auto because it is also glossy a
quick wipe of the bracket after the
assembly wouldn't hurt but then I do
wonder if simple rubber grommets would
have eliminated the compromise of having
thicker radiators or even push-pull
setups in the front without being
constrained the
60 millimeters of spacing and honestly I
was very disappointed to find this
compatibility issue or their own x41
cooler even for this price range
now going back to cable management I
love the cut out to router GPU power
cables it's very nice along with
appropriate cut outs to even accommodate
for micro ATX scenarios below the
motherboard and also many cutouts up top
to channel your fan cables behind a
motherboard for example and the rest of
the cables I also want to mention that
the top fan is limited to fan only as
there's no additional high clearance for
video everything is well cleaned up
behind them on the board with many camo
type points and all this room in from
the power supply to really sort of
concentrate and tuck away all your
cables so a clean system is inevitable
for sure and then conclusion the s340
brings a strangely handsome mid-tower
with all its right angles with solid
frame and side panels great chamber
separation and cable management options
I love the dual SSD bracket and proper
airflow design
despite the fully solid front panel and
an outstanding price tag for what the
s340 offers to the market also the poor
power supply dust filter the lack of
caddies in the drive cage and easily
scratch about side window are all
negatives that we might just might
overlook given the price point however I
feel the uniquely integrated cable
management / reservoir bracket is it's
actually major downfall
despite also being one of the selling
points as well while you do have that 60
millimetres of spacing it is limiting so
you cannot do push-pull setups and as
was shown in our build thicker radiators
from the start will not fit with it and
I really wish NZXT would take our
consideration into account for their
next revision of the chassis regarding
the mounting of that bracket as it's
unnecessary difficult to remove but of
course having said that and putting a
proper built inside the s340
makes for one impressive design the
deserves damn good value award that with
some really minor changes to the bracket
and some other things that we mentioned
and perhaps some more color variations
as well
this could really dominate the budget
market and so that is it for our NZXT

see to take our feedback into account
and actually let us know how you feel of
the overall design with the comment
