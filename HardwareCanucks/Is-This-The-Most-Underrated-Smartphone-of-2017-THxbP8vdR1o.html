unique device among the competition that
has been receiving a lot of praise for
its modularity and that's an important
term for Motorola because most of their
flagship phones are geared towards
adapting a different style that some
users might like I've been using this
phone for about a month or so and I have
to admit I've been enjoying my
experience using this device but as you
would expect every phone has its own
quirks that you'll have to work around
with so let's discuss some of the
positives and negatives of this device
right after this invest in storage that
makes a difference choose toshiba Rd 400
and vme SSDs that are incredibly fast
and reliable
backed by advanced warranty programs so
you can focus on what matters
Rd 400 check it out in the description
below
let's get pricing out of the way because
it's the most important factor when it
comes to a smartphone since the
competition is pretty tough in 2017 the
32 gigabyte variant that I have here
costs just a tad below four hundred ten
dollars when he bumped that storage to
64 gigabytes you're looking at a $90
premium which puts it right against the
1 plus 5 and that breaks up a lot of
questions especially for the specs you
get for the price the 1 plus 5 comes
with a high end Snapdragon 835 CPU 6 or
8 gigabytes of RAM 5.5 inch 1080p
display a 3300 milliamp hour battery
that supports the dash charge and it
works wonders and it comes with a dual
camera system the Moto Z to play on the
other hand features a Snapdragon 626
processor 3 or 4 gigabytes of RAM a 5.5
inch 1080p AMOLED display 3000 milliamp
hour battery with support for Turbo
Power and a single 12 megapixel rear
facing camera so from a value
perspective the oneplus 5 seems to offer
the best bang for your buck at least on
paper now in my opinion specs are
secondary because I'm not interested in
having the latest and greatest
smartphone with the fastest processor
available in the market all I need is a
phone that can perform well for my
day-to-day tasks like email listening to
music messaging and handling my social
media accounts and over the course of
these four weeks I've never experienced
slowdowns on the z2 place so that check
marks one of my main necessities
motorola has also done a terrific job
with the build quality of the device
it's rock-solid given the aluminium
unibody construction I would say it's
right on par with the LG G 6 although
they did manage to make the z2 play a
little too thin for my taste
here's a comparison shot with the g6 and
you can clearly see the engineering
marvel I'm just used to thick phones
because the weight and the bulk gives me
a better grip and unfortunately the z2
play didn't suit my taste did I also
forget to mention that huge camera bump
yeah it seriously gets annoying when you
have the phone placed on a flat surface
although the motor mods that we'll be
talking about shortly addresses that
problem easily watching content on the
5.5 inch 1080p display was a pleasing
experience the MOA technology really
shines with vibrant colors and deeper
blacks is similar to what you would get
with Samsung's
ship phones viewing angles are also
great but personally I prefer IPS panels
over AMOLED because the colors are more
natural to my eye and it's more visible
in daylight conditions now the lack of
thinner bezels to accommodate a larger
screen might be a deal-breaker to some
of you out there as it nowhere stands
near the offerings from Samsung or LG
where they offer more vertical screen
real estate to enhance multitasking but
I'd like to hear your thoughts on this
would you prefer a smartphone with some
bezels or lesser of them let us know in
the comments down below
speaking of bezels the front facing
fingerprint reader is a great
implementation on the Moto Z to play
it's fast and responsive to the touch
when unlocking and locking the device so
that's convenient but be mindful it's
just a fingerprint reader and not a home
button Motorola uses on-screen
navigation buttons for that task and the
little things like the inclusion of USB
type-c
a headphone jack front-facing mono
speaker which is surprisingly really
good compared to the bottom facing setup
on the g6 and the s8 plus are all great
features for the Z to play it completes
a smartphone in my opinion this phone is
also water repellent and not water
resistant both of them are very
different from one another a Motorola
has added an advanced nano coating
technology to prevent moderate exposure
of water like accidental spills splashes
or light rain it's not designed to be
submerged in water or even it's not
designed to resist dust so it definitely
lacks the ip68 rating be mindful of that
the camera is unfortunately one of its
weakest points when compared to the
competition it's a 12 megapixel sensor
that shoots at an F 1.7 aperture and the
samples you're seeing now was shot in
auto mode without any adjustments to the
ISO white balance etc everything is
straight out of the camera without any
enhancements the dynamic range is pretty
terrible to be honest colors look washed
out there's not a good amount of detail
to recover and I think part of that has
to do with the processing done by the
CPU the sensor also had a hard time
exposing to a certain subject and that
was disappointing here are some more
samples
the same story goes for a video it's
capable of shooting 4k at 30 frames per
second and it does feature slow motion
recording but the footage is totally
unusable guys
all right I wanted to spend some time
and talk about motor mods because it's
quite a unique strategy to enhance your
smartphone experience motorola uses
these proprietary pins to link and
transfer data through their modules that
are designed for a specific purpose for
example I have this JBL sound booster
speaker mod that essentially adds a
premium speaker setup to the Z to play a
simple snap instantly improves the audio
listening experience and I've taken
advantage of this when going outdoors
with family and it's amazing
it comes with a built-in kickstand and
battery to extend the phone usage by
another 10 hours so that's cool tech to
take with you when camping the other mod
that I have here is the turbo pack that
comes with a three thousand four hundred
ninety milliamp hour battery it just
snaps on to the phone and starts
charging the device instantly or in some
cases you could just leave it in there
to get two days worth of usage out of
the phone which is what I did because
the thin profile on the z2 play wasn't
comforting to hold in hand so I snapped
this on and it added some weight and got
rid of the camera bump that I talked
about earlier so that solved the problem
however investing in motor mounts will
definitely hurt your wallet the battery
mount here costs $80 and so does the
sound boost a mod that we just looked at
there are other mods too for instance
this mod comes with a 360-degree camera
and cost $300 the Moto aims to share
projector mod costs another $300
Motorola teamed up with Hasselblad to
create this mod that comes with ten
times optical zoom and it costs $300 but
it hasn't received positive reviews as
far as I know and the list just goes on
guys they even have an upcoming gamepad
mod that comes with control sticks a
d-pad and action buttons it's an
interesting ecosystem in the smartphone
market and I'm curious to hear your
thoughts about motor mods the software
experience on the z2 play is one of the
best I've come across on an Android
device the unit runs on the latest 7.1.1
nukid OS and I love the cleanliness of
the UI I've got huge respect for
Motorola for taking the stock Android
approach as it helps a lot with
performance and battery life it also
doesn't eat up storage with unnecessary
apps
unlike other devices although I can't
guarantee you on whether or not this
device would receive software updates in
the future because I highly doubt that
this would get the Oreo update that
Google just recently announced so be
mindful of that one last thing before I
wrap up my review I wanted to touch base
on battery life so the Moto Z to play
comes with a 3000 milliamp hour battery
and I was easily able to get over 6
hours of screen on time so that was
amazing considering the thin profile of
this device now when you add the Moto
mod so the turbo pack power
that I talked about a little earlier you
can easily get 12 hours of screen on
time on that one
sometimes even 10 depending on usage so
if you're looking for a smartphone with
the longest possible battery life and
you know of course and then afford of a
budget you should definitely consider
this phone because the optimization with
hardware and software
I think Motorola has done a terrific job
in that department so to conclude the C
to play from Motorola is a very solid
choice especially if you are really on a
tight budget you know for $400 or 408
dollars to be more precise this is an
excellent package all our package if
you're considering a solid smartphone
with a really good battery life and of
course the a clean stock Android
experience you could consider you could
spend another $80 and up for the 1 plus
5 which offers better specs and of
course a slightly better camera I think
that's one of the disadvantages with the
Moto Z to play the camera is just not
the best so you know taking that into
account I'd like to hear your thoughts
on the Moto Z to play what do you guys
think of this device would you consider
this as a perfect fit for a $400
smartphone or would you consider
alternatives like the 1 + 5 or even the
LG G 6 after that ridiculous price drop
