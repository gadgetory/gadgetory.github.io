inter launched their new cable ache
processors I wanted to do a quick build
around the v2 selling platform if you
watched our full review of these new
processors you may remember that even
though that these new CPUs didn't offer
massive benefits over as well or skylake
users of older systems could benefit
from increased performance and new
multiple features if you haven't watched
a video we will leave a link down below
for you to check it out the intent for
the system isn't anything particularly
special I just wanted to look good offer
great gaming performance and not cost an
absolute fortune while still having the
ability to overclock but before I get
into the components a quick word from
our sponsor introducing the new OTC BX
500 all state drives from Toshiba it
offers great well-balanced speeds build
with mlc nand flash for superior
endurance and is also backed by five
years advanced warranty program learn
more about the vx5 hundreds at OTG com
this would be our first KB like build
for the years so I decided to make it a
special one by going with a red and
black color scheme and the end result
turned out to be beautiful at least for
me but let us know your thoughts about
it later on housing the entire system is
the NZXT s340 elite metal chassis ever
since my switch to the fence X and for
evolved ATX PG tempered glass is slowly
starting to become a trend and
personally it's one of my favorite
features of the case I picked up the
matte black variant with red accents but
there's also a blue black model and a
complete matte white edition which looks
pretty awesome too Dmitry has posted a
fantastic review of the sv40 elite on
the channel and we leave a link down
below for you to check it out for the
heart of the system I chose the azrog z2
78
holiday gaming k-6 motherboard for just
$180 this motherboard packs a ton of
features like support for octane plenty
of space for aftermarket cooling
installation a 12 phase digital power
delivery system USB 3.1 type a and type
C port on the rear i/o and for ddr4
slots waited for 38 66 megahertz
operation there are also two MDOT two
slots built in RGB lighting alongside a
dedicated LED header and much more oh
also the red and black accents
throughout the motherboard fit in
perfectly with our build the processor
of choice in this situation is the core
i5 7600 K which delivers an excellent
price to performance ratio not only does
it feature overclocking capabilities but
it holds up pretty well against more
expensive options particularly in gaming
later on in the video I'll be comparing
the CPUs stock speed versus when it's
lightly overclocked
this should give you a rough idea on
performance increases with just a few
tweaks within the BIOS or through as
rocks Auto overclocking feature
speaking of cooling and Dixie hooked us
up with their spanking new Kraken X 52
Ottoman liquid cooler and while I know
it's an overkill for the 7600 K CPU what
I love about this cooler is it's
infinity edge mirror display right at
the heart of the CPU block it just looks
gorgeous plus with added features like
RGB lighting and various lighting
effects it works out really well with
the color scheme that I'm going for once
again we've posted reviews of both the X
52 and the X 62 on the channel links are
all in the description my choice for ram
went to Corsair Vengeance LED 32
gigabyte ddr4 kit clocked at 3000
megahertz what interests me the most
about this specific memory is obviously
the vibrant red LED lighting it also
maintains a local file design which
doesn't make a difference here since I'm
using a water cooler
but anyone that wants air cooling should
pay attention here for the GPU we
decided to add the gtx 1060 gaming X
from MSI this should yield as plenty of
horsepower to test modern titles at
1080p and to back that up
it sports a base clock of 50 94
megahertz and a boost of 1809 megahertz
in OC mode it also features a stealth
black backplate which I appreciate plus
it shares the exact same Twin Frozr 6
heat tank design with the GT X 1080
gaming X GPU and since this is a red and
black base bill the cards lighting fits
in
play with the system powering the entire
build is the corsair a x86 TI digital
ATX power supply with its eight 60 watt
80 + platinum rating it can easily
handle extensive upgrades in the future
and the Platinum rating means it boasts
awesome efficiency one of the best parts
is that with Corsairs link software I
can monitor real-time power input and
output efficiency fan speed and internal
temperatures Corsair also hooked us up
with their Neutron series xti 240
gigabyte SSD this will be our primary
boot drive for Windows and applications
but it is categorized for extreme
performance with read and write speeds
well over 500 megabytes per second the
read enclosure is exactly what we need
and as you can see the case showcases a
drive really well building the whole
system didn't take me too long but I'm
happy about the end result the tempered
glass on the SJ 40 L a beautifully
showcases the components inside and it's
pretty hard to look away from the
machine like this the lighting isn't too
fancy but it's subtle and simple which
I'm always a fan of so what kind of
performance can we expect from a build
like this well let's start with
Cinebench r15 a very popular CPU
benchmarking tool and as you can see
aura clocking the 7600 K CPU 24.9
gigahertz gives us more than 15 percent
performance increase compared to stock
speeds which is great I also rendered a
five minute 4k video using Premiere Pro
CC 2017 and the results do speak for
themselves while a two-minute difference
isn't that significant rendering longer
videos would increase the gas quite a
bit this 76 R K is no joke guys but then
again if you're doing high-level
rendering something like these 77 under
K could be money well spent for its
productivity increase alone CPU temps
surprise me after all o'clock in the
chip to 4.9 gigahertz at idle there's
almost a 9 degree difference between the
two and during my stress test the X 52
does a killer job cooling the chip well
under 65 C gaming on the other hand
didn't do much of a favor after all the
clock in the processor this should be
obvious given that model tiles rely
heavily on the GPU and partially the CPU
as you can see battlefield 1 at 1080p
set to high settings uses the exact same
frame rates but over watch set to ultra
settings give us an extra 15 frames per
second due to the fact that it's
operating at such a high frame rate I
did push the GTX 960 to 1440p
and I'll admit this car deserves my
respect for dishing out well over 60
frames per second
the card was benchmarked in OC mode and
it did a fantastic job both in
battlefield 1 and overwatch to conclude
I'm very happy with the way how this
bill turned out given it cost $1500 in
components the parts that we chose
worked hand-in-hand to achieve the red
and black color scheme that I was aiming
for in the first place and it looks
gorgeous overclocking the 7600 cake gave
me fantastic results especially after
rendering a 4k video it's a pretty
capable chip if you're building a budget
workstation PC so what do you guys think
of our first KB leg bill for this here
let us know in the comments down below
I'm eager with our connects thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
