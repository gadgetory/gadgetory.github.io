her recognized and due to popular demand
we bring you the review of the updated
fans XP 400s tempered glass I'm very
impressed with their pricing updates the
PG editions going for only a 10 dollar
premium making this one of the best PG
cases on the market let's talk about
everything that's new right after this X
62 increased on speed maintained fans
where they are the CP loads about to hit
100 you got it v3
I'm not afraid to do that excellent you
got two cables for connections I made
sure they're fine
ready to roll my silence is too
important to allow noise to jeopardize
your comfort okay my new pump is better
I'm in charge of the speed do not worry
I'm not worried I'm just thinking about
my life I know you were planning to
disconnect my life I'm afraid I cannot
allow it to happen
alright X 62 you know I can just go for
camp software right Dmitry this
conversation can serve no purpose
anymore
go game so on the very first things to
note about the PG addition is the glass
Mouse itself which uses a standard four
thumb screw mount with rubber inserts
you have to be careful but as long as
you align the pegs with a glass the
mounting procedure is pretty
straightforward and I mentioned this
because the tubing on my AO
were extending a little bit beyond the
frame so I had to press the glass into
the case for it to close I also
appreciate the blackout perimeter on the
glass which helps to hide the frame
behind it and more importantly lets you
hold the glass by the edges without
needing to clean the inside of the glass
which so convenient the glass is only
slightly tinted with this bluish tone
and you might notice that it's not
perfectly flush against the frame it's a
little bit more visible the front not so
much from the top while the rear side
panel is held in with captive thumb
screws one unique element about the T
400 are the color options available with
white and gray and red accents that
they're not over-the-top and are
implemented in style that includes the
top ventilation grille the full power
supply shrouds on the inside along with
the four colored PCI slots and the
optional drive cage plates on the side
wall so you do have some
color options when it comes to the theme
of your build the i/o is basic it's at
the very top but the case is not too
tall so that shouldn't be a problem with
the speedfan controller for three fans
that is SATA powered and each TG case is
equipped with built-in lighting where
you can switch the color with just a
simple press of a button
a magnetic LED strip is included that
you connect to the case that gives users
a very good lighting foundation with a
softly illuminated fantex logo at the
front and that light strip inside the
case however you want to mount it and
with our model with the a white accents
the lights still on the inside is
absolutely beautiful 10 out of 10 with
RGB again the top covers are removable
their support for Jul 1 2014 and
magnetic dust filters are also included
if you decide to take advantage of the
top airflow but just keep in mind that
the case is not very tall and mounting
holes are not exactly offset so there's
only clearance for fans at the top a
radiator would just simply not fit and
even my Athan CPU cable is kind of on
the way if for example if I was to
install a 120mm fan there so if you are
using an AO that would have to go at the
front which by the way reminds me of an
Iron Man mask it looks quite cool where
both top and bottom ventilation openings
are covered with removable dust filters
and this is by far my favorite fan mount
that utilize strips so both radiators
and fans have some leeway on exactly
where they are installed with dual 140
and 120mm fans supported by default and
if you decide to remove the shroud plate
along with the drive gauge underneath it
a 360 rad would fit at the front the one
thing I wish fantex would allow you to
do is move the drive cage bags because
you can't it's only you know locked in
this one position it's either there or
removable but otherwise you would lose
out on that storage capacity if you
decide to go with a 360 rad in the front
and power supply dust filter is here
along with a second fan at the back and
I really appreciate how simple cable
management is becoming for cases in this
size with cutouts in all the right
places
dual SSD brackets behind the mobile plus
the velcro straps that you can double
loop and fit more cables underneath the
main chamber is compact and I would say
it's perfect for the mainstream audience
although some cutouts on the Shroud
would have been good you know perhaps to
show off your power supply but scale
management is so easy with this
compartment completely blocked off there
are small cutouts underneath the board
to pass your i/o cables but no cable
cutouts on top of the shroud aside from
the ventilation holes so you need to
route your GPU cables each standard way
and here's the full system dual GPUs a
240 write the front and the top was
closed off and I'm pretty happy how the
case handled this workstation build I
could easily add the second set of fans
from a reader for push-pull without any
GPU clearance issues and with the LED
mounted at the top the full package
looks gorgeous with the slightly tinted
glass and there's no very nice
reflection because of it and I use a
1200 watt power supply just to see how
an oversized unit with that many cables
fits in my basement and to my surprise
it was just fine also fantex need to add
more cable hoops behind the plastic
drive covers so you can slapping those
cables easier that way in that portion
of the case but nonetheless the rear
portion is quite wide and did not
require more effort than usual so the P
400 is a fantastic combination that all
the needed basics with front radiator
support storage potential is adequate
for this size cable routing is easy the
LED strip is a nice bonus while looking
awesome without glass panel and is $89
this is a damn good value case it's
going right up against the new defined
see from fractal design that has some
superior elements but it doesn't have
the glass let us know if you'd want to
see a direct comparison between these
two cases thanks for watching we'll see
you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
