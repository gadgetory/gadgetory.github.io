kick things off with something that we
haven't quite completed reviewing last
year and that's this the asrock desk
mini GTX is a compact base micro STX
bare-bones PC and you may recall me
talking about it and how I went through
also the troubleshooting steps to get
that thing booted up in the first place
but that didn't happen so I had to send
it back to asrock all the way to Taipei
they reported back saying that it had a
broken motherboard which made sense but
I have the final working sample right
now in my hands I've ran benchmarks on
it it's all working just fine so let's
talk about this guy but most importantly
we'll come to conclusion as to why does
this thing even exist
considering the price and specs and
whatnot so yeah let's get into it but
first a quick message from our sponsor
the newbie quiet dark bass 700 packs a
fully modular spacious interior with
option to invert your motherboard tray
with excellent radiator support and an
outstanding fan controller it also comes
with a type C port RGB lighting and a
tempered glass side panel check it out
in the description below
alright so taking a look at the physical
aspect of this unit it's pretty simple
and quite fitting within any environment
being your office or your home setup it
doesn't feature gamer elements or flashy
RGB lining around which I personally
like the chassis is primarily made out
of metal with a brushed aluminum finish
of the front there is plenty of
ventilation for the components inside
this PC and it can be used in either a
vertical or horizontal configuration the
i/o is pretty limited but that should be
expected in a system this size you get
Gigabit Ethernet HDMI power in two USB
3.0 ports a full-size DisplayPort
another HDMI port and another a mini
DisplayPort do not that these three
ports are linked directly to the
dedicated MXM gtx 1060 GPU the front io
consists of a headphone jack a single
USB 3.0 type a and type c port and mic
in oddly enough the audio jacks were not
labeled so the only way I was able to
distinguish the two was to refer to the
manual which is unfortunate there are
also a couple of USB 2.0 ports on the
side of the chassis
let's get into the specs the desk mini
GTX comes in three flavors a kit with a
gtx 1060 gtx 1070 and
80 and the pricing for all three of
variants are ridiculous so the base
model that I have here that comes with
the GTX 1060 costs $800 and that's
without the CPU memory and storage
factored into the equation the top of
the line 1080 Varian costs $1600 and
that's a lot for just a bare-bones PC
that doesn't come with the rest of the
components because if you add them
you're looking at spending roughly
around 400 to 700 dollars on top of that
investment and you might be think to
yourself well I might as well just build
a better gaming PC for that price you
know I mean there are so many things
that you could consider here and there
but all in all I just can't seem to
justify paying so much for just a bare
bone specie that comes with an A Okay
cooling solution for the GPU I also
don't want to mention how memory prices
have skyrocketed since last year did it
a minute it is unfortunate because
beginners who are starting to build a
basic gaming PC would have to invest a
chunk of their budget into memory
instead of a decent GPU so let's just
hope that in 2018 prices will come down
a bit
but I'd love to hear your thoughts on
this do you find components a lot more
pricier than they used to be a couple
years ago let me know anyways coming
back to the desk mini GTX there are a
few things that you need to be aware of
before choosing the rest of the
components the micro SD X motherboard is
based off a b250 chipset meaning you
won't be able to overclock a CPU that's
unlocked there are only two sodam ddr4
slots that can support up to a maximum
of 32 gigabytes of memory accessing
storage involves the removal of the
motherboard tray and when you flip that
you'll find three m dot two slots two of
which that support PCI gen3 drives and
the other one supporting SATA if you
decide to use a two and a half inch SATA
base drive you can populate up to two of
them and they are linked to the
motherboard via this proprietary
connector in my case I decided to go
with an i-5 7600 K CPU and yes I'm aware
that it's an unlocked CPU but it was the
only one I had lying around in the
studio as for memory
I chose Corsairs Valley select 16
gigabyte kid clocked at 21 33 megahertz
and for storage I chose Corsairs force
elite 240 gigabyte SSD the decimal GTX
relies on an external power supply so if
cable management is a concern for you do
not
the external power brick is half the
size of the PC and it's quite heavy
there's also one more thing I need to
point out before getting into
performance and that's cooler
compatibility specifically for the CPU
this micro SD X motherboard does not
accept anything except for Intel's own
stock cooler which is unfortunate but
keep that in mind before pulling the
trigger on this bare-bones PC alright
let's talk about performance I ran a few
synthetic and real-world benchmarks on
the destiny GTX to make sure that the
system was stable under full load
now do note that these numbers could
vary significantly depending on your
choice for the CPU and GPU so for
instance if you decide to go for with a
core i3 processor expect slower
multitasking performance and also a
potential bottleneck
well gaming speaking of gaming I ran all
the tests at 1080p which made sense
because the GTX 1060 can comfortably
push playable frame rates at that
resolution anything above that say 1440p
or even 4k would requiring a beefier GPU
would that be said i was comfortably
able to head well over 60 frames per
second in most titles starting with
battlefield 1 at 1080p set to very high
the Destiny averaged 87 point 5 frames
per second over watch set to epic
yielded over a hundred frames per second
doom set at Ultra using the Vulcan API
was easily able to hit a hundred frames
per second Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
wildlands taxed out on the GTX 1016 even
a 1080p set to very high settings I was
only able to squeeze frame rates in the
mid 50s I was very surprised with the
CPU and GPU temperatures the stock
cooler did a fantastic job cooling the
7600 K even at under my 30-minute I 264
stress test the GPU ran around 70 C
while gaming and the maximum core clock
that I was able to achieve was around 18
60 megahertz which is very impressive
considering the compact form factor and
the system was relatively quiet during
my testing here's how it sounds
then you coarser avoid pro gaming
headset is comfortable stylish in
different colors delivers fantastic
wireless performance even for
competitive gaming with an all-new
microphone for clear communications
check out the void Pro Wireless or wired
in the description below
alright so having looked at those
performance numbers it's fairly evident
that the azrog dustman a gtx 1060 can
comfortably game at 1080p without
breaking a sweat
but my problem comes with the price of
performance ratio I just can't justify
spending $800 for a bare-bones kit and
then spending an extra $400 to get a
basic CPU like an i3 dual core 8
gigabytes of RAM and a pretty small
compact two and a half inch SSD and mind
you SSDs are also pretty expensive and I
don't think I'll be able to offload my
entire steam library to it just you know
start gaming on it right away
I would have to rely on an external
solution or I might have to invest a lot
more to populate all these storage
options that we have in this micro SD x1
factor now let's also not forget to talk
about MX and GPUs because they're
primarily found in notebooks rather than
desktops so Nvidia could stop making
them this year and you know that would
leave you in a dead-end space because
the only option you would have is
upgraded to a GTX 1060 or 1070 but I'm
pretty positive gonna end up paying a
lot more than what you really should for
that module and of course when you keep
up getting the GPU you could end up
restricting airflow and it could cause
overheating issues and I think there's
things just might go wrong with the way
how it is so oh no I really can't
recommend the system guys and I think
part of that primarily has to come with
the price that you pay for this I think
you're much better off like I said
earlier build a much better gaming PC
for that price but I'd love to hear your
thoughts about the as drug test many GTX
what do you guys think about it
especially the design and of course the
performance and as Rux approach towards
the micro STX form factor and also I
would love to hear your thoughts on MX
and GPUs do you think they could
potentially be the future or could this
be the end could this be the last unit
that we see that would come with a fully
fledged desktop grade GTX graphics card
