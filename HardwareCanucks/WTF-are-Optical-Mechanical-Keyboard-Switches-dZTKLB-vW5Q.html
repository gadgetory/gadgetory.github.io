microphone this disorder keyboard has
optical switches what the optical
switches let's find out right after this
excuse to to increase pawn speed
maintain fans where they are the CPU
loads about this is 100 you got in to be
tree I'm not afraid to do that
excellent you got two cables four
connections I made sure they're fine
ready to roll
my silence is too important to allow
noise to jeopardize your comfort okay my
new pump is better I'm in charge of the
speed do not worry
I'm not worried I'm just thinking about
my life I know you were planning to
disconnect my lights I'm afraid I cannot
allow it to happen
alright X 62 you know I can just go for
camp software right Dmitry this
conversation can serve no purpose
anymore go game so thank you either for
that introduction but this my friends is
it the sword Excalibur se Spectrum quite
a long name but at $99 the store is
trying to really stir the market a
little bit for under $100 for a
mechanical keyboard that has plenty of
features that even enthusiasts and also
budget-conscious consumers will
appreciate so let's dive right in so
first thing I want to talk about is the
price at $99 despite on what it looks
like on the outside and what feels like
you're actually getting a pretty good
deal here now despite this being a
plastic fake body that kind of standard
it is competing directly against the
large tech g4 13 which is at $89 price
points and the HyperX alloy both of
which feature this metal plating on top
that reinforces the frame whereas the
dis or excalibur SE spectrum doesn't and
so therefore it exhibits a little bit of
creaking sound when you bend the plastic
so it's a little bit you know doesn't
have the same level of quality feeling
as other keyboards but I would say it's
pretty good but one thing that sure has
stood out as one quality concern for me
are the slip out feet at the bottom not
only do they not stick around when
you're trying to push on the keyboard
but they're they don't raise the
keyboard as much
and they're just super weak forcing them
to really close off when you're applying
any pressure on the keyboard and that's
unfortunate the cable is non-removable
it's coming from the right side which is
you know it might not play nice with
your symmetrical design the font here I
find extremely weird you know I prefer
something cleaner but you know the arrow
keys the caps lock the shift all have
something strange the the letters the
q-and-a and just everything is a little
bit weird
it's got spaceship II type of fonts I
prefer something more clean going this
font think it's ugly but now let's talk
about the positives and they're plenty
to say about this new keyboard first of
all the key caps are double shot so
there's a double injection which means
extra durability and will not faint as
much in the long term I do like that
media controls and other functions are
built into the function keys with the
function key only on the right side
nothing on the left and the keyboard is
completely drivers also which I
appreciate because the Sora's previous
driver software UI looks like just want
to avoid it completely but here you can
do macro commands on the fly between F 1
2 F 4 and you can lock the windows key
you can enable n key roll over so
pressing everything in here or 6 key
roll over which is nice and the only
thing that I wish that they removed from
here would be the break the rules above
the arrow keys which looks out of place
the font is ridiculous default doesn't
even match the font on the lettering
between the f5 and f/8 we do have four
levels of adjustable repeat acceleration
so that is how often is the key that
your Prime tries to press will be
registered again not exactly sure how
you would use this in the regular
scenario but it is there so let me know
if this is something that would be
useful to you in a particular game or
particular keyboard scenario but the
main highlight here are the new Tesoro
optical mechanical switches available in
the clicky blues also linear version so
will be coming down the line these have
been code designed with Gator on and I'm
very happy with what they've produced
the cool thing about the optical switch
is its lifespan of a hundred million
clicks and that is twice of the MX blue
switches which are ready 250 milli
of course it's usually higher because
you know it's good quality and
everything but a hundred million
keystrokes is your keyboard will die
long before or maybe you will want to
replace the keyboard long before the
switches die so that's awesome
they are hot swappable which is good
because you can simply pull them out on
the frame and later on when linear
switches will be available and
potentially different variation of the
switch you can sort of set up your
keyboard the way you want that's what
the switches behavior to me they feel
more closer to razor greens as far as I
remember and not like the MX blues MX
blues have a bit of a crispier
tactile actuation point whereas these
ones are feel a little bit lighter I
really like these and because their
infrared nature they are dust proof and
spill proof which is awesome to have
this type of element I do like the three
built-in profiles that are constantly
saved onto your keyboard because of this
driverless nature that's awesome the
only thing that does not change in color
are your nebula caps lock and the G key
so that always stays blue but I really
like the perky color customization
directly onto the keyboard simply by
pressing the key you can cycle the color
and then just save that as your profile
it's pretty awesome to customize the
keyboard just the way you want and
here's a quick sample on how these
switches sound and so the disorder
Excalibur SD spectrum is an excellent
keyboard I was not expecting that
because with the source previous very
clunky and ugly UI software and sort of
basic and almost overpriced nature of
other keyboards that we looked in the
past this at 99 bucks seems like a
really good value compared to other
things on the market and have really
recently launched you know perky RGB
elimination very nice switch that is
tactile linear is coming later just as
long as you don't mind the very
bare-bones
look of this board I would definitely
give this
good award oh wow that rhymed Wow the
only thing to really complain about are
the little flip out feet that are
completely weak and don't really hold
the keyboard when you apply any pressure
on it and just fold under the weight of
the keyboard and really just if they
change the font here luckily the key
caps are removable so you know if you're
completely dislike the font here you can
change them because they're MX stem
compatible that is a thing but yeah the
soar if you're listening make sure to
take that notes for future keywords but
guys what do you think of this keyboard
let us know in comments below at $99
stop too much to pay for sort of you
know this over encompassing gaming
keyboard with overspill features and
dustproof is that is that something that
you guys care about let us know in the
comments down below I'm Dimitri with how
are Canucks that's Eva right there
behind camera well you will plug
yourself in there huh yeah a
little-little Ebru action in the video
you're already in the beginning man you
want to be in the end too
all right you just going to make sure to
come in and show your hands like like
you did before this it's time to take
illumination seriously with vengeance
RGB ddr4 memory by Corsair with
incredibly bright LEDs and uniform color
spread add a touch of classic color that
is fully software controllable and
compatible with a wide variety of intel
and AMD platforms more info in the
description below so thank you so much
for watching make sure to subscribe to
more similar content and we'll see you
in the next video you passed out you
just listening to me in your pasta I
can't see it yes okay okay let me try
that again but the main but the main
highlight here are the new optical mm
but the main highlight oh how do I get
