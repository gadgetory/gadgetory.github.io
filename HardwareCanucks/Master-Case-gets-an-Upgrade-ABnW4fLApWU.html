possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX the master case concept is
seeing some very cool updates as of late
now you can customize the frame with
tempered glass panels there are new top
and front panels as well with every
modular piece being truly modular in the
sense they can be simply installed
inside the master case without modding
required I found the return of the GPU
support brackets plus the large fan
shroud for the GPU kind of surprising as
these to me seem like the components
from the early days but I actually think
it works very well now installation is
very simple thanks to all the mounting
holes inside the case that already
pre-made as you can see in this example
it delivers direct airflow to your
graphics cards and I'm also interested
to see if the setting fan to exhaust
will do anything to the temperatures of
those GPUs aside from that we now have
this new box that is attached to the
case this is a magnetic toolbox this is
also part of the master case concept
accessories so you don't lose your
screws and all other small items and
apparently it's really awesome for
modders speaking of the motors the
master case modular idea is expanding
even further to online where different
pieces mothers create for the case can
be sold online so for example if you
like certain front panel design fan
grills custom painted parts or whatever
else the community will think of
Coolermaster will host it online for
users to purchase for example if you
like custom cut pieces for the bottom
chamber that is installed onto the side
panel you can get them in multiple
varieties and this idea is really
awesome and I cannot wait to see it
evolve for real and we also got a chance
to see the master air maker 8 which is
their latest CPU cooler with LED
lighting dual 140 memory silencio FB
fans 3d vapor chamber and also custom
top plates either aluminum or this
see-through plastic one with 3d printing
available for your own customization so
we will have a full view of the school
coming very soon so make sure to
subscribe and we'll see you in
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
