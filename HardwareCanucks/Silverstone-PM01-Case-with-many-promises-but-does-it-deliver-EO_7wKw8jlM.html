can only speak your sentences backwards
okay pick I should which to these
between all you cannot respond in
English if we're playing this game okay
new minion drives Oba I did not go
active Lulu still ventilator but svetka
cocorinha Charlotte Mon review leave for
time it's gas i cheaper is silverstone
oh by the way you don't have to respond
backwards anymore maybe this is so sad
we need friends case review case review
creativity is fueled by the best
instruments it doesn't always come easy
and in the process you often realize how
important quality is the rd 400 by OCC
gives you quality and speed with m de to
interface the schieben and flash and a
pci bracket making it possible to focus
on what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a five-year advanced
warranty ok guys so my initial idea for
this video was to compare the new
primary case from silverstone to the
NZXT and 450 because they are in an
almost similar price range cooling wise
they are identical on paper and share
some physical properties like this
angled window on the side and a quite
similar shape of the exterior top and
front panels but on the interior we're
looking at completely different layouts
with a more modern configuration on the
PM one such as the opening terior and
thus I decided to review this as a
standalone enclosure because regardless
of the specs on paper these two cases
offer completely different experiences
both for assembly and hardware and when
I first got the case I thought this is a
fantastic entry from silverstone the
glossy white color may not be my
favorite but color variants between
metal and plastic is almost non-existent
while a glossy black exterior is also
available and a matte black will also be
coming the side panel is quite bendy
which is pretty normal when you have
such a large window and this crash test
returns to see how resilient
the window is from handling and no lock
peel off the protective sticker after
you finished building to avoid battle
marks the built-in blue lighting for the
white version is fine it's red LEDs on
the black case definitely not the safest
choice and RGB would have been better it
is 2016 after all but it will attract
those committed to that one color scheme
the LED modes are full brightness half
brightness breathing mode and off and
notice the three front 140 movie fans
are part of that LED sync which is nice
and having so much front airflow for the
interior is fantastic especially since
the front panel is fully covered in mesh
now taking off the panel toe is a bit
ridiculous as we need to remove four
screws first which are a bit difficult
to access and whatever happened to
Tula's approach for removing panels
there is a large dust filter covering
the full intake area which is a fine
mesh that catches all the small
particles but still grants nice air
movement speaking of dust filters there
is one included for the power supply
easily removal from the back the i/o is
at the top with four years P ports and
audio with LED and power buttons located
opposite from each other and while we
are at the top this is where the case
disappointed me the most we first need
to remove a few more screws to lift off
the stop panel again what happened to
tool approach but I assumed that this
space above the frame could be utilized
for a set of fans especially if you are
installing a radiator on the inside and
this extra space would be awesome and
also based on the specifications it
supports a 240 a 280 and a 360 mm er
radiator at the top but not only the
Silverstone restrict fan placement due
to such bulky plastic frame but none of
the mounting holes actually line up with
the fans since the plastic frame is so
thick and even if you could mount fans
here there is no Kingo pass through to
the inside of the case again this pasta
frame is so restricting and it doesn't
have to be the height here perfectly
accommodates for set of fans for
additional internal clearance but this
terrible table design makes it totally
unattractive for all-in-one users and
this makes me so mad because on
paper it's awesome and even with just a
glimpse of the interior it makes it seem
like it will be awesome for a standard
240 millimeter all-in-one at the top but
it isn't the power supply chamber tow is
fully enclosed with discreet branding
that I appreciate and if your air
cooling this fantastic front intake
would deliver so much air and a front
radio support exists via this slide door
at the bottom and opens 45 millimeters
of clearance so you could potentially
mount your all-in-one in the front and
move those front fans around the storage
approach here is pretty basic with dual
is as the cat is behind the mobile and
standard drive cage in front the power
supply with three caddies they are
catching up with the velcro straps which
is awesome for cable management along
with a fan hub for 10 fans which is
quite nice but it is SATA powered I hate
fan hubs that you cannot control kinda
feeds the purpose of even including one
and so we begin the assembly with taking
apart my recently built workstation
because the color combo is actually
pretty perfect with white and blue and
the first hiccup comes with the
motherboard standoffs
or the lack of them on the right side
and if you pre install six standoffs you
might as well pre install all of them
and this is where during the build I
realized that no fans can be mounted
above the frame and my 240 millimeter
all-in-one could not fit above the
motherboard due to limited spacing as
the mounting location is right in the
center and in no way offset closer to
the side panel and this meant I could
only mount a single fan on my radiator
as there is 45 millimeters of internal
clearance before we hit the memory now I
can imagine this to work flawlessly with
a CPU tower or a 120mm at all one for
the rear but I just don't understand how
a new 2016 case release could be so bad
at accommodating a 240mm radiator and
also where are my thumb screws for the
PCI brackets just doesn't feel right at
110 dollars on the inside if you need
more storage though the sidewall can
house three more SSDs and kael
management is perfectly fine I would
like to see more cable tie oops on the
right side but the velcro straps in this
main area is a
big plus and so what we have here is a
case with fantastic front airflow good
storage support and the reasonable cable
management but the top frame design is a
real killer and immediately turns off
customers with a Oh plants the PMO one
is a large enclosure that doesn't really
utilize its size for the target builder
but from an airphone perspective it
would be an excellent choice for those
with CPU tower coolers ultimately for
case over $100 we need something new and
silverstone right now is playing
catch-up which is a good trend but left
me wanting more which I hope the
eventual PM o 2 will completely satisfy
thank you guys so much for watching
I'm Dimitri with our contacts we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
