thinking about the other day no how do
you make keyboards cooler hello good
people on three tree and I was thinking
the other day what could be the next
cool thing when it comes to keyboards
and you know what SteelSeries is out do
the bang at Computex releasing eight
keyboard my friends you know giving a
little flavours here and there for your
preference so let's take a look at the
new apex pro and apex seven lines right
after this huge thanks to fan thick sand
steel series for sponsoring our Computex
visit so the first one here is the apex
pro keyboard we actually just came from
their booth I actually get to experience
it and also we kind of stole one with
the condition that we return it tomorrow
but don't worry I'll definitely get some
in the studio right after the show so
stay tuned for our full review then so
the apex Pro it is top of the line and
I'm very happy with its feature set the
board design looks great with that thin
profile without any oversized frames or
weirdness going on and actually really
awesome illumination we have an aluminum
base plate a really nice soft touch
magnetic rest rest on both the tkl and
full-size variants there's a USB
pass-through port on the left side that
is illuminated 3-way channel for the
cable underneath that is non removable
and multifunctional roller and button in
the top right that is for your media
control volume and navigating that
screen now that magnetic wrist rest it
feels so smooth and satisfying we do
have some concerns about that collecting
lint and other particles over time when
we try to clean it with a microfiber
cloth it left a bunch of particles but
in terms of its surface texture and its
feeling in your fingers and on your
wrist it is really smooth the only thing
that I would comment on about the
physical characteristics would be the
cable it is quite thick it requires dual
connections because of that USB
pass-through and one power in the
keyboard so just keep that in mind now
let's talk about that monochrome OLED
display and it seems like that's coming
back and while I thought it was pretty
gimmicky on the rival 700 Mouse with the
vibration motor and the slide display on
the right side to give you some
information I think that it's a mutation
on the apex Pro and the apex 7 key
is actually well done what you can do
with it is lighting navigation profile
selection on-the-fly macro recordings
you can see your system statistics like
hardware usage or temperature of the
hardware there are plenty of in-game
integrations too with csgo and dota 2 to
see your kill to death ratio plus all
types of unique graphics based on these
titles it's got a notification system
built-in for Spotify and this chord so
you can see visually things coming in it
won't be like a thing that you can read
an email on that's kind of pointless
because the screen is pretty compact and
it's further away from you if the screen
was somewhere beside the escape button
then it would have been a bit more
visible but it being in the corner it's
only there when you really need it and
you can also use the screen to adjust
the actuation point for the new
SteelSeries omni point switches which is
awesome you don't require the software
now i've made the whole video about the
omni point switches you can check it out
over here but to recap they wanted to
create something linear something that
is light at 45 grams something that
mimics the gaiter on red switches and
actually co-developed it would Gator on
and this which is now patented and the
main selling point is the ability to
adjust the actuation distance on when
that key is registered from point four
millimeters all the way up to three
point six millimeters so if you like to
bottom out on the keys and have that
typewriter feel you can set the
actuation point to register at three
point six versus if you like to really
just fly on those keys without bottoming
out or just pressing them it's slightly
a slight amount then you can have a much
shorter actuation point all the way up
to point four if you prefer that but as
everybody jokes around in the suite like
you can just blow on the keys and
they'll register of course that's not
the truth but having that really low
actuation point is unique but it's also
probably not necessary for majority of
people and this actuation customization
is done on the perky bases which is
fantastic
so you can customize your writing area
for something else and maybe the numbers
to be slightly deeper or was the area to
be faster but everything else to have
deep actuation points we don't
accidentally press them while
maneuvering your hand within a certain
area of your game
so that is awesome they are rated at 100
million clicks versus 50 million on them
exchange so they should last you for a
very long time and they've been testing
it for months trying to click it and 100
million is at least as what you can get
you can do probably can do more than
that now if you don't really care about
the whole actuation customization
element about the apex Pro that is why
apex 7 exists
it offers identical features to the apex
Pro in terms of the tkl versus full-size
magnetic wrist rest the oled display
everything is identical but the switches
and the switches on the apex 7 are Gator
on bread brown and blue fantastic
switches and that gives you the option
to save a bit of money if you don't want
the whole customization element and
that's what the OLED screen I'm curious
to see how the experience will be like
in the long term is this something I
will actually use or just occasionally
come back to it to set my lighting
presets and maybe change up the
actuation point and I'm guessing that is
going to be the the usage case scenario
but the whole idea of it displaying some
hardware statistics or something in-game
I feel like that's going to be a nice
attractive point of why you should maybe
consider the apex pro or the apex 7 so
stay tuned for my full review and
finally here are the prices for all the
new keyboards a bit on the premium side
due to all the loaded features one thing
I'm really happy about is that
SteelSeries is launching both the cheeki
L and the full-sized versions at the
same time and we don't have to be asking
for tkl variant of something like it and
it's cool because the apex pro and the
apex 70 Cal versions also have the
display that has the same functionality
as the full-size alright so that's all
from SteelSeries check out our omni
point explained video if you are still
confused on how that whole thing works
and yeah thanks for watching I'll talk
to you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
