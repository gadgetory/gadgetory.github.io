up a meeting with ZOTAC who are
displaying some pretty interesting
products this year but before Iman quick
message from our sponsor
big thanks to Nvidia gigabyte fantex and
NCIX for our CES coverage the one item
that really caught our eye was their new
GT X 1080 mini which is supposed to be
the smallest most compact GT X 1080 on
the planet I mean just look at it it is
meant to be perfect for smaller ITX
cases that won't fit in a traditionally
sized GPU but are still capable of
accepting a higher-end graphics
processor this certainly isn't the first
of ZOTAC mini series we have looked at
but is certainly the most powerful by a
long shot
specifications are very close to
reference with a base clock of 1620
megahertz and boost going to 1759
megahertz meanwhile the GDR 5x is
clocked at 10 gigahertz
that's all understandable given the fact
that the GTX 1080 mini uses a smaller
cooler to keep with its compact size so
high out of the box over clocks were
impossible ZOTAC did mention that it
still does have some good manual
overclocking potential provided your
system is well cooled enough you can
also see that ZOTAC installed two
different sized fans on this card 190
millimeter for static pressure while the
other one is a hundred millimeters and
that is used for additional air movement
there are also dual copper heat pipes
that ensure an adequate amount of heat
movement away from the core so tax
pricing for this card wasn't announced
but expected to be the same amount as
entry-level gtx 280 cards there are
three things that are being highlighted
by many companies we're visiting this
year at CES VR mini pcs like so tax
ohncbox and external graphics dogs
naturally ZOTAC was showing off one -
and it looks pretty interesting even
though this is a hand-built sample
graphics Doc's are all the rage since
USB 3.1 gen2 and Thunderbolt 3 have
allowed for high bandwidth high power
connections between today's compact
notebooks and external devices so tax
intent for this doc is for it to be
connected to a low-power all-in-one or
notebook and provide massive graphics
horsepower but will a low voltage
notebook CPU be enough to avoid
bottlenecking something like a GTX 1080
we'll find out soon after CES but first
onto the dock this external dock is
meant to communicate with a device via a
Thunderbolt 3 connection which it could
if a device supports it it's also used
to power an external
low voltage device speaking of the
graphics card though tech isn't going to
be including one but it is supposed to
support up to 400 watt discreet cards
zodiac has also thought ahead by giving
their Doc's some additional
functionality and incorporating three
USB 2.0 ports and one quick charge 3.0
USB port unfortunately pricing and a
timeframe for widespread availability
wasn't discussed but we'll make sure to
keep on top of this while development
progress is that graphics card doc may
be a perfect fit for some of those tax
updated ZBOX
which now has its full lineup refreshed
with cabling processors that's which
also made possibility of an inclusion of
Thunderbolt 3 which also adds a lot more
functionality and will also allow the
connection of additional high-power
external devices so that wraps and
things that ZOTAC I'm Eva with hurricane
axe thank you so much watching and we'll
see you in the next CES video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
