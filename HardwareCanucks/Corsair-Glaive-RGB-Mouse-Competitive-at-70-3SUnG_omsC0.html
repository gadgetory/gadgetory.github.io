know if our audience are getting tired
of these videos but this is pretty good
it's pretty good
guys meet the Corsair clave RGB King
emails coursers targeting dismounts for
gamers who value comfort and performance
along with other features like RGB
lighting and a few more that we'll
discuss shortly
priced at $70 the Glade competes
head-to-head with Logitech G pro and the
g4 3 along with a few other competitors
like the rival 300 from steel series and
the my onyx caster all of these mics
have received countless positive reviews
and fortunately we reviewed all of them
so I'll leave a link to those videos in
the description down below now I've been
using a Glade RGB for the past few weeks
so I'm just going to share my thoughts
about it in with regards to gaming
editing and other productive tasks that
I do on a regular basis but before we go
on a quick message from our sponsor what
inside you 31 you should put a ring on
yes how to make it hard to be efficient
there will take ring high static
pressure fans because your key is there
if the ring for details and description
below
as always let's start with the design
because it's actually just as important
as the sensors performance I really like
what Corsair is done with the clave
there are a few aggressive elements
throughout the body like the subtle
insertion on the sides to showcase the
LED lighting which by the way has
received the RGB treatment and there are
three zones that can be customized
through the cue software the build
quality is also excellent the chassis is
mostly made out of hard plastic
materials but it's put together really
well and I'm always a fan of this soft
touch silicon material that's similar to
the g4 three and my havea or 7000
although it will wear out over time
picking up oil stains coarser also sells
an aluminum version of the glaive and
the only difference is that it's a
little bit heavier than the black model
let's stock organics because that's
Corsairs main selling point for the
glade I have large hands and my palms
were wrapped around the body comfortably
for science comparison I have the g4 3
here and as you can see the glaive is a
little bit taller but it doesn't affect
which ability for the two primary
buttons unfortunately the body isn't
ambidextrous so left hand users are
completely left out of the equation
if you recall my review of the G scale
MX 780 it featured interchangeable side
grips that allowed users to adapt
towards various grip styles the glaive
sports a similar feature except it's
only done on the left side out of the
box they include two extra thumb grips
that are shaped differently to better
suit your style personally I ended up
using this slim and textured grip since
I constantly switch between claw and
palm tight grip when I'm editing and
gaming but your preference might vary
anyways
kudos to Coursera for including this
feature in the first place the bottom
comes well equipped with four Teflon
pads and they did a great job gliding on
my cloth gaming mouse pad the cable is
rated but it's not as flexible as my AV
or 7000 on a positive side they have
reinforced it really well to the unit
and it's also long enough to write
behind your PC there are six
programmable buttons that can be
customized to the Kim software this
includes primary left and right clicks
the forward and backward buttons on the
left side of the mouse the scroll wheel
button and the DPI share button sitting
right next to it
speaking of the DPI shaped button
Corsairs implemented and indicate
at the top of the mouse for easier
distinction and it cycles through five
different steps
the primary buttons exhibit great
tactile feedback and the travel distance
felt similar to my g43
plus they don't require a lot of force
to actuate so that's awesome I was a
little concerned with the forward and
backward button placements because as
you can see the slight gap between the
buttons and the thumb grip made it
awkward to access them so it took me a
while to get used to that this is partly
due to the interchangeable grip design
but when you compare to the g43 which
does not have that feature it was
automatically a seamless experience
sliding my thumb to click the respective
buttons on the other hand the scroll
button doesn't require a lot of pressure
to press and the scroll steps are nicely
defined and it's also well gripped if
you care about that moving on to
tracking performance Coursera's
implemented a custom-designed optical
sensor that boasts a sensitivity of up
to 16,000 dpi honestly I really don't
care about how high the sensor can go up
- in fact if any of you guys use a mouse
at that setting leave a comment down
below because we need to have a serious
chat coming back to the topic of
performance I had an excellent time both
gaming and editing on it I normally
leave my DNS setting at 1600 plus course
there's a cool feature of fine tuning
settings down to one dpi I did play
around with this option through the cue
software and to be honest I didn't
notice a huge difference with slight
increments but it is a nice feature to
have if you're really picky of your
desired dpi setting after a few seconds
of calibrating the sensor on the glade
with my mouse pad I jumped into a quick
battlefield 1 deathmatch session to
bring out its true potential and the
good news is that I was able to aim and
target subjects really well acceleration
was nowhere to be found and given how
fast these switches are I was able to
fire gunshots just as fast as my g4 3 so
overall it's a really good sensor and I
don't think you'll regret about it when
you pick it up and the last thing to
cover here is the drivers software you
can easily modify settings and then save
them directly to the mouse thanks to the
on-board storage inclusion on the blade
this is perfect for gamers on the go who
may not have the advantage of bringing
their own personal computer with them
everywhere taking a look at the
left-hand side of the window the tabs
are nicely organized starting with the
actions tab you can create customize and
assign macros to any of these 6 buttons
moving on to lighting effects tab you
can cycle through the different lighting
effects including rainbow color shift
color pulse static and lighting link
that essentially syncs lighting effects
with other Corsaire peripherals if you
happen to own one the detail shift tab
is pretty straight forward and like I
mentioned earlier the user has full
control with regards to how far he or
she can set the sensor sensitivity the
performance tab lets you play around
with the left off distance and pointer
speed and finally the surface
calibration tool allows you to calibrate
the optical sensor inside the glade so
if you're looking for a gaming mouse
under the sub $70 price point you should
definitely consider the glaive to be on
the top of your list everything from the
build quality to the design to the way
how it feels in the hand to a sensor
performance is excellent
you know features like RGB lighting and
the interchangeable side grips are great
additions but you also can't cross out
other competitors like the g4 3 from
Logitech the cast refine my onyx and be
much less expensive alternative the
bible's 300 from steel series it's
really hard to pick a winner from all of
them because all of them are really good
mice but I'd like to hear your thoughts
about the course circulate what do you
guys think about this males would you
consider spending $70 on it or are they
any cheap alternatives apart from the
other competitors as I mentioned that
you'd be interested in taking a look at
