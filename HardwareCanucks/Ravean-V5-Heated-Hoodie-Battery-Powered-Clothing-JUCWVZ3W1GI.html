great technology selection and service
let's be honest here how many of you
hate wearing a thick padded winter
jacket outside on a cold morning how
many times have you dressed like this
and when the temperature rises you carry
the bulky coat around or decide to sweat
inside guys we have something really
cool to review this time and it's a
hoodie
not just any hoodie a heated hoodie and
I have to admit I have a special love
affair with hoodies they're comfortable
easy to put a lot lighter than a jacket
and most importantly easier to move
around with today I'm taking a look at
the Arabian heated hoodie priced at 130
dollars we'll get to the specs in a
moment but a little bit of history on
the company Raven was a recent startup
that took the idea of creating heated
outerwear and made it the right way by
introducing great design uncompromising
quality and implementing the best tech
inside without compromising the visual
appeal and I think that they nailed
those marks with the heated hoodie the
outer and inner shell are made out of
60% cotton and 40% polyester and I'm
very happy with the soft texture and
it's very comfortable to wear the design
is simple nothing too attractive
other than the imprinted Brabant logo on
the left side of the hoodie and the
stitched heated tech then you can see on
your left arm the heated hoodie comes in
two colors black and gray with sizes
ranging from small all the way up to
double XL you have two side pockets on
the front of the hoodie both of them are
zipped so you don't lose any of your
valuables if you decide to leave them in
there inside the hoodie is where you'll
find two pockets on the right one is
zipped and the other is secured with a
velcro strap they are perfectly deep to
host a variety of items but shallow
enough for quick access on the left side
is where there is one pocket that is
secured with a velcro strap and this is
where the magic happens
ralien includes a 5 volt portable
battery pack that has a capacity of 5000
milliamps which powers the whole heating
system via the built-in USB cable inside
the garment the micro USB cable is used
to charge of the battery pack and there
is an LED indicator that shows how much
charge you have left with just a simple
touch
and if you're recharging the battery
pack the LED indicator does a really
good job of showing that truth to be
told I really like it to turn the
heating on all you have to do is press
and hold the R button until the LED
lights up in red which does indicate
high mode for the maximum heat output
press again the LED turns white which is
medium heat press it again and the LED
turns blue which indicates low mode the
battery is set to last for two and a
half hours on high mode four and a half
to five hours on medium and seven hours
on low I was able to feel the heat on
the chest area as well as my back since
the heat panning are installed inside
those regions at first it was a little
weird to feel the heat coming from the
padding inside since your body is
directly in contact with the system but
once you find the optimal heat setting
this is an amazing piece of tech for
cold winter months
I left the heating mode to medium
because the high mode was just way too
hot a little strange having the heat
concentrated in these small sections at
your chest and back and not throughout a
larger surface area this means for
extended use these areas will get
significantly warmer than the rest of
your body and you might experience
discomfort especially if quickly popping
into your heated room which may cause
you to sweat in regions around the
heating pads another thing to keep in
mind is the sudden decrease in
temperature when you remove the heated
hooding obviously this will happen but
you might want to turn off the heating
on the sweater a few minutes before
getting back inside from the outdoors
Narae being designed there outdoor wear
for the best durability the zippers are
of high quality and the heated hoodie is
also waterproof so you can throw them in
the washer and not worry about
malfunction later although make sure you
remove the battery pack before the wash
but if something goes wrong there's a
five-year warranty a treyvion includes
with their products which is nice and
that's it
simple easy to use heated hoodie from
ribbing this was actually my first time
trying out a hoodie of this kind and the
heating works like a charm if you're
interested in picking one up you can
pre-order the hoodie from the link
