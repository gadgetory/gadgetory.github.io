axe and AMD has been on a roll lately
and it's about to continue with the
recent launch of risin and threat repair
forcing Intel's hand to launch coffee
lake sky like X and KB like X there's a
whole lot of completion in the CP market
one of the few areas where Intel has
some safety was in the know book market
and I'm not gonna sugarcoat you guys on
this but Amy's AP us have struggled to
gain notebook designs and there's some
good reason for that there are two
power-hungry they run a lot harder than
Intel CPUs and the performance outside
of games was just terrible things
started to change around a little bit
last year from last generation but not
in a meaningful way now that there's sin
and you know there's some hope that this
new architecture would bring some big
things to the mobile space so what has
indeed done to change the game while
they've leveraged the powerful rise in
processor design and combined it with
varied graphics compute units the end
result is a new line of AP use codenamed
Raven Ridge and notebooks with these new
processors will be available very soon
let's take a closer look
right after message from our sponsor the
master of fast curved gaming monitor is
now available measuring at 35 inches
with 34 40 by 1440p resolution at 100
Hertz and free sync support with nice
stand that can do portrait mode because
why not so join the drop with a link in
the description below to get your game
on
alright guys so Amy's intent is actually
pretty ambitious even though they've
been absent from the ultraportable
segment for a really long time they're
hoping to put rising processors into
notebooks about this size while offering
better overall performance more cores
and about the same power consumption as
Intel's latest CPUs that means Raven
Ridge ApS are supposed to go up against
kb lake r and that my friends could be
really challenging you can find our
video about kb lake are right over here
but let me put that into context for you
since there needs to be a huge leap
forward from the mobile FX 9000 series I
mean just looking at this chart gives
you a good idea of how far behind and II
was not that long ago to design a
somewhat competitive notebook processors
for thin and light ultra books they
needed to increase performance by
between 40 and 50 percent on the GPU and
CPU while also lowering power needs by
50 percent even if those targets were
head
until would have been able to walk over
a Raven Ridge but Indy decided to take
things a bit further and this is what
they ended up achieving their first Zen
based ap use have CPU cores that are up
to 200% faster than seventh generation
processors and graphics processing has
been boosted up by 128 percent those are
some seriously impressive numbers but
what really catches my attention is the
power consumption which was lowered by
58 percent that means longer battery
life and you can spend less time looking
for a charging location which was also
always an issue with Bristol Ridge and
earlier mobile ap use at least initially
the mobile Rison processors will be
available in two different forms the
Rison 7 2700 you and Rison 5 2500 Q both
will be based off quad-core 8 threaded
layouts but the 2700 you will operate at
higher frequencies both packages will be
available in either a 15 watt
configuration for the thin and light
market or 35 watts for systems that have
better cooling that can handle Lyanna
thermals the integrated Vega graphics
may have been based off a new
architecture but don't expect them to
offer much in the way of performance in
higher end games the 10 compute units
paired with relative clock speeds of the
rising 7 graphics subsystem makes it
roughly one-sixth as powerful as Indies
of Vega 56 ok the GPU specifications
don't really look impressive but what do
they mean for performance well let's
take a look at what Andy says and
remember this is likely a best-case
scenario since Intel CPUs don't do all
that well in dx12 applications right now
the win is huge but even without taking
a look at Intel the new Rison 7 2700 you
absolutely destroys the older FX 9800 P
that kind of jumped from one generation
to the next
it's just amazing even though the 2700
you won't offer anything even closer to
discrete graphics cards frame rates if
you lower the details enough it can play
some of today's most popular titles but
the problem I foresee is what happens
when people want a bit more than this
level of gaming performance remember
Intel and NVIDIA have achieved some
pretty amazing things by integrating
efficient Pascal GPUs alongside kb lake
processors in thin and light notebooks
that paired was achieved with Intel's
Optimus GP
switching technology something that
brave and rich ApS won't be compatible
with that leaves discrete very good base
GPUs as the only other option but we
won't see those in thin and light
notebooks anytime soon the architecture
is just too power-hungry on the CPU side
AMD sees their 2700 you lining up well
against the cable a car I 78550 you that
processor also has 4 cores in a
processing threads while offering TDP
values from 10 to 25 watts
depending on the configuration chosen by
the system builder in the chart you're
seeing right now there's no mention of
which system the 2700 you is installed
into but the Intel CPU is seated in an
Acer spin 5 that means we may very well
be seeing an Apple store engineers --n
but nonetheless AMD winds clearly in
multi-threaded applications like
cinnamon a single thread performance
falls behind though when the charts get
B 2500 you the results remain pretty
much the same with the AMD processors
pulling ahead in multi-threaded
benchmarks but falling behind when less
threads are needed remember these are
synthetic benchmarks and if history is
any indication from our testing of kb
lake vs. Rison real-world applications
will be very tight even battery life
seems to be pretty encouraging against
their previous generation but one thing
that is conspicious by its absence from
this chart is an Intel processor there
isn't even any mention of these systems
being used for both AMD GPUs but we'll
assume they're identical but one of the
main problems with Amy's mobile
processors has always been their
availability announcements were made and
products shown off but actually finding
them to buy was challenging many ended
up being paper launched and nothing else
I'm hoping this time will be different
since they're already some thin and
light notebooks in the works HP will be
introducing in the 15-inch Envy x-360
which has the risin 5 2500 you up to 8
gigabytes of dual channel memory a huge
55 one battery that packs just nineteen
point five millimeters thick lenovo will
have a more compact 13.3 inch notebook
called the IdeaPad 7 20s which will have
the option for either the 2700 u or 2500
you but only a single channel memory
luckily that notebook is also super thin
and will come with a
nvme SSD finally the Acer Swift three
seems to be the best of both worlds
since it's light thin and comes with an
IPS screen and dual channel memory we're
hoping to get our hands on these really
soon and I'm pretty excited about that
well there you guys have it our quick
overview on these new upcoming rise in
mobile processors while we only know a
little bit about it right now and of
course the benchmarks was given to us by
AMD there's a lot to be excited about
you see competition is great and
especially in a thin and light notebook
space and if these new AP users can
deliver at least 75% of what E&amp;amp;D claims
things are gonna get really interesting
for the rest of the year and of course
into 2018 so what do you guys think
are these new Rison processors gonna
make some inroads into a segment where
Intel is still supreme would you
consider buying an AMD notebook let me
know in the comments down below any bar
