often that I find absurd products to
land here in the studio but lucky for
you it's one of those days what's with
the hair
all right so this is the MF 120 an
intelligent Wi-Fi operating fan system
what but they definitely win some points
for the unboxing experience this is by
far the coolest way to unbox a set of
fans
yeah so these fans are little bit
strange for one it actually has no fan
frame not in a traditional sense anyway
like you would on a traditional fan
instead here we have an aluminum
structure in the center that holds the
RGB illumination as well because this is
a super fancy and expensive fan so why
not I'll definitely be testing the
cooling potential of this fanless design
but it also has no traditional four or
three pin fan header instead it has a
microUSB that then goes into the main
hub of course the coolest thing about
the fan would be its Wi-Fi capability
allowing you to control both the RGB
illumination and the fan rpm through the
hub via smartphone that's awesome so
this is a uniquely beautiful fan let me
know if you agree in the comments below
it's still absurd though so let's check
out exactly if this fan is all design
aspect or it actually has some cooling
functionality behind it right after this
lighting up your build for customization
is one thing cables are another so check
out cable mod in the description below
for all types of colors and extensions I
mean look at this and red SATA cable how
cool cable ma awesome customization that
will stick around check it out
description below alright so they're
multiple absurd factors about this
product one of them is how you cannot
actually hold it when the blades are
spinning because you know good luck
fingers especially if this thing is
going at full speed you have to either
hold it by the center frame but still
have to be very careful or by the edges
also you can only mount them for pushing
air because that's how the frame is
designed and mounting them in pool will
cover up this RGB strip and render them
pointless plus the lack of a shroud
means non-directive airflow and
obviously loss of pressure but these
fans actually push a lot of air as
you'll see you later
but what really triggers me is the whole
Wi-Fi control situation because that's
not really a value added because that is
the only way to control the RGB
illumination luckily for speed there is
a four pin PWM connector from the hub to
the motherboard so you can at least
control your rpm through your
motherboard
however for RGB control you require an
app now this app is available in iOS and
Android on my iPhone I could not get it
to connect
despite the slow progress bar always
reaching to 100% while on Android the
app crashed on me a few times until I
finally got it to make a connection with
the hub now the UI is intuitive if you
can get inside the app so you can choose
your color any of these lighting effects
along with speed and brightness and
inside the fan tab you can have three
speed presets or you choose your own rpm
from 500 to 2200 and what's really cool
about the fan and this like dual LED
strip in the middle is that when it's
illuminated it really does not look like
a fan at all inside your case and so the
blades are not illuminated and so we
have this discrete lineup that would
look incredible in front of a case
through like a temporal glass or
something
although the gamer storm logo looks
ridiculous and there is no way to turn
it off individually and to diversify the
visuals you can even rotate the fans for
this weird look I can see the appeal of
a horizontal mount to highlight more of
the blades
now unfortunately the hub is pretty dumb
in a sense that it does not know the
order of these three fans so if the
meteor effect is enabled the direction
of motion of the lighting does not
account for the potential of the fans
stacked on top of each other so they
kind of all blink in sync and that does
not look good at all and also the hub
has no expansion potential with only
three fans supported with the
proprietary 5 pin connector and so
there's got me thinking who are these
fans for the RGB fan market is pretty
diverse with plenty of visual variety to
choose from like the illuminated blades
that spill a lot of that light these are
the Corsair ml RGB fans I also really
like the ring illumination on these TB
RGB fans from inner Mac's that
illuminate the frame but not the blades
a totally different look for your system
and actually has a hub for 8 fans and
RGB strips too so it's a bit more
versatile while the MF 120 kit holds its
own unique ground because of that middle
illumination and I'm sure there are many
built in areas where each of these fan
sets would suit right in and by the way
they're all listed in the description
below if you want to pick one of the
sets now in terms of cooling I tested
them inside the Liam EP Co 11 dynamic
with the three fans mounted on the
radiator for the side exhaust with all
of them running around 1600 rpm with
pretty much identical temperatures so
the MF 120 said definitely can push a
lot of air through the radiator no
problem but they are significantly
louder at anything beyond 1000 rpm and
so I started this video thinking that
this would be a fun way to show how
point does this product is especially
because you only get three fans and that
109 dollars for the entire set that is
definitely crazy expensive especially
because the Wi-Fi control is the only
way to control the RGB illumination and
there is no provided software for your
computer so yada yada yada but it did
open my eyes to the entire RGB market
especially in the fans category at how
diverse it is and how many options we
have that all deliver pretty good
cooling especially here you know what a
thousand rpm delivers the exact same
temperatures as I would with 1600 rpm on
the default Corsair fans of course this
thing is significantly louder and there
are some limitations with it but when it
comes to fans it seems it doesn't hurt
to go the visual route even if you lose
some functionality along the way alright
so let me know which one you liked the
most visually out of the three sets and
while I would not recommend these I'm
kind of glad they exist because it will
push the RGB market in two different
directions into something that's super
weird yet kind of cool at the same time
that potentially would fit it built that
would look totally unique because of
that dual strip LED illumination in the
center alright so thanks so much for
