hurricane accent one plus five is an
attractive device the price is less
appealing versus the 3t but it's still
awesome to have such high capacity
storage for a lot less and then we're
normally used to plus their approach to
clean software is fantastic it doesn't
get better than this outside the pixel
lineup the hardware is nothing to
complain about although the full
utilization of that a gigabytes of RAM
is questionable but the phone feels
incredibly fast the new curved body is
gorgeous the 1080p AMOLED screen is the
perfect compromise between pixel density
and battery life and the dual camera is
of course the main highlight here that
is good but there are a lot of asterisks
that are sort of associated with all
these positive features so is the 1 plus
5 for you let's break it down right
after this the Graham spectrum keyword
bike Tesoro comes with a new mechanical
agile switch with low profile key caps
with super fast response and shorter
actuation distance plus all the
customization included with RGB lighting
and macros for a premium user now a few
days ago I ran a Twitter poll to see how
you guys use your smart phones the most
and surprisingly there were very few
clicks in the camera department so let's
see how the 1+5 handles all other
aspects that people rely on so let's
begin the experience with the body that
absolutely requires a skin or a case I
love the original sandstone texture that
is grippy and that is needed not only
for holding the opie 5 but also picking
it up as the smooth curved edges have
zero grip which is why I prefer the body
design of the 1 plus 3 but everything
else is pretty much identical with
clicky power and volume buttons although
they are now much thinner but still have
very nice clicking the student the
fingerprint scanner is incredibly fast
without minor vibrations for feedback
the notification light is excellent on
the top left corner with colour
customization available and the type C
port is at the bottom that is still a
USB 2.0 interface I wish more Android
phones had the alert slider so you can
quickly enable silent mode or
on the store mode and customized them a
little bit so for example when I'm
taking a nap and I want to still receive
phone calls for my favorites FedEx and
UPS I can still hear that phone call
come through and not miss a package the
headphone jack at the bottom
surprisingly is powerful enough to drive
my HT 6 X X so I'm very happy with the
amp output and it absolutely kills the
iPhone 7 in volume the single speaker
hover is way too easy to block it is
very loud in the cache call Youm it's
too harsh so find yourself a bowl and
opie 5 turns into a
so now the screen it's received good
praise because of calibration tools so I
prefer the srgb mode because it's just
the most natural colors but if you like
a more saturated look we have the color
customization and also a temperature
adjustment the resolution at 1080p is
fine the brightness outdoors though it's
kind of weak so you know I always have
to keep it at 100% even indoors to get
that nice vibrant and bright effect
which so I wish that this screen was a
bit brighter
however the minimum brightness is very
low which is good so you won't be
blinding yourself or anyone around you
if you check your phone during the night
but the blacks do tend towards the
purples so you know the color accuracy
is not there anymore
at this lowest setting but really what
got people riled up is the jelly effect
on the screen when you swipe up and this
jelly effect is visible because the
screen on the 1+5 is mounted upside down
and we're told that is to make room for
some other hardware components on the
inside most likely for that dual camera
at the back so the jelly effect is only
visible when you scroll up and I can
recreate the same jelly effect by
flipping my 1+3
and you can see the jelly motion here as
well that top portion or the bottom
portion of the screen has that little
bit of stretch now I can recreate the
same effect with my galaxy s7 if I flip
the screen around I think that's the
nature of the AMOLED screen and how the
refresh cycle works and you know I can
sort of live with the jelly effect on
the 1+5 what I cannot lift though is the
touch screen latency which on the 1 plus
5 is just terrible now when I say
terrible I mean in relation to my
experience with the iPhone 7 and the
galaxy s7 that have very little if any
touch latency so everything on the
screen when you interact but it feels
like it's one to one on one plus five on
the other hand that's not the case so it
is very noticeable when I'm swiping and
I tap the screen for it to stop there's
a delay between my tap and when the
screen actually stops at least it feels
to me that way also when I'm typing with
both thumbs it feels like the text is
trying to catch up to me so there's that
visual delay which is very annoying or
when I'm holding long pressing the
delete button
it always deletes more verses when I
lift off the some off the delete button
they're just so annoying because it
creates that's weird contrast as this
phone being praised one of the fastest
smartphones on the market right now but
it has that weird
a sluggish feeling on the touchscreen
latency situation so it's not ideal and
so that is my biggest complaint with the
1+5 alright so now let's talk about the
camera
the selfie mode is wider than my iPhone
and the handles backlight better but the
s7 despite its softer look is still my
favorite with direct light the iPhone
has the most detail but I still prefer
the galaxy selfie so the 1 plus 5 is in
that middle with good field of view
exposure is fine and white balance most
of the time is okay so now the dual lens
situation at the front is well
implemented although it needs to be
clarified that it's not an optical 2x
zoom it's actually 1.6 X optical zoom
and the rest is handled digitally in the
software and so despite the high
resolution the fine detail is kind of
missing and it looks too processed and
really kind of falls apart in dark
setting as with any smartphone camera
you want to have the best lighting
possible but I think the hyped optic
camera resolution and detailed so much
like it's literally written on the side
of the box that I was kind of
disappointed to not see the detail that
I was expecting the portrait mode is
kind of cool and edge detection is
passable you can even do self-portraits
which are really cool with this nice
background compression it doesn't work
all the time and honestly I would have
taken a wider field of view for that
second lens like on the g6 versus the
extra zoom and that is because just like
on the iPhone 7 plus the second lens is
only engaged when there's enough light
so actually most of the time even with
like good lighting in my studio I would
cover up the zoom lens and take a shot
or actually see what the camera is
looking at and it will still be using
the main lens with a 2x magnification
and not the zoom lens so that's kind of
unfortunate I rather do that on a
primary lens but have like a really nice
wide angle like on the g6 to capture a
lot of the environment and stuff and I
think that would have been a much better
direction for oneplus to take some other
important features to note include a
reading mode so it turns everything into
grayscale with nice warm paper look I
read books on Kindle so this is very
relevant to me you can also choose your
vibration intensity and even pattern
though it is kind of weak at least
nothing beats the iPhone vibration the
lockscreen has expanded a little bit to
accommodate more room from the
education versus what we saw on the 1+3
and - charging remains the same it's
super fast never have to worry about
battery life when plugging in and for
like 20 minutes gets you good recharge I
also want to mention the flashlights on
the month plus five is pretty weak when
compared to the iPhone 7 something to
keep in mind if you use the flashlight
often and as of July 20th 1 + have
patched out the 911 one rebooting bug
when the phone would restart when try to
call 911 - services so that wasn't
Pleasant
but they've patched out the software
update and they released like 5 OTA
updates so far so that means they're
kind of staying on top of things and
listening to what the community is
figuring out in terms of the bugs and
the 1+5 so overall I'm pretty happy with
the oneplus five but we're in a
difficult price territory where the
device is kind of expensive to not have
any rubber seals or adhesive for water
resistance 4k video is actually worse
versus the 1+3
because for some reason there is no
image stabilization on the 1 + 5 at 4k
and from the value perspective the 1 + 3
T sounds like a better deal because even
if you're after that 2x zoom in most
situations like I mentioned earlier
you'll still be utilizing that main
camera for that 2x magnification unless
you have the ideal ton of light in your
in your scene for that second lens to
engage and so to the most part the 1 + 5
checks off many of those priority
elements that people want to see but I
wish that the touch latency was reduced
alongside have some water resistance
rating so that its feature set could be
closer to all those flagships that a lot
more expensive while still maintaining
that price advantage and that price
distance and so that's all I have to say
about the 1 + 5 what do you guys think
are you picking one up yes or no let me
