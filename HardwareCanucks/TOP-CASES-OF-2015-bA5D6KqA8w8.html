great technology selection and service
wow this has been a full year coming so
the categories are so the categories are
whoa let's do this what's up guys I'm
Dmitry with Haruka Knox and welcome to
our annual roundup of the best cases of
2015 I'm super excited to bring you this
video because we reviewed 25 cases in
total in 2015 I'm surprised that my
reference system is still working
everything is functional despite being
taking out of a case and build and being
inside the single case for 25 times
individually throughout the year and
check this out I bought this thermal
paste exactly a year ago and I'm still
using it there's still thermal paste in
there left I have no idea how that's
possible and in this countdown to the
chassis of the year we're going to have
six categories to play around with in
which we're going to have a winner and a
few runner ups or your honorable
mentions that should also be considered
so without any further ado the
categories are the best mini ITX case
the best budget enclosure the best this
is my first time building a computer so
which one should I buy type of case the
WTF what were they thinking type of case
the most beautiful enclosure of the year
and finally we'll finish off with the
case of the year now the way we compiled
this list is only include cases that
were both released and reviewed by us in
2015 to keep things fair and you can
check out our 2013 and 2014 cases of the
year with the links below or in the I
but if you have any other suggestions or
options that you think may suit into any
of the categories that we'll be
mentioning make sure to go like this on
the keyboard so the first category is
ITX and this one hands-down goes to the
N case M 1 V 3 so building inside an M 1
was truly an amazing experience from the
first time you easily pop open those
aluminum panels and realize how freaking
light the frame is but oMG how solid it
is to
everything about this tiny beautiful box
screams quality from the refined
aluminum edges to the way all the
exterior panels are to lists but when
you make your way onto the inside get
ready for a tiny world of space
optimizations thanks to continuous
revisions by in case we have a variety
of storage options that don't compromise
on hardware compatibility this really
awesome sight bracket for installation
of in either an extra bracket with
additional storage while leaving that
one extra fan spot near it open or
utilize the entire bracket for a 240
millimeter radiator you come out a full
sized ATX power supply in here and still
have room for a 12 and a half inch GPU
all without obstructing the CPU area
which is fantastic so if you want an
all-encompassing
compact ITX enclosure this is our winner
of 2015 our runner-up ITX case includes
the fractal design no 202 for a lovely
and simple exterior with flexible
orientation and what they did well here
is the structural separation between the
exterior panels and the main interior
frame so you can assemble outside of the
case sort of without any hassle it
supports 12-inch GPUs with awesome
ventilation everywhere and if you can
deal with the totally clunky drive
installation for the 2 2 and a half inch
drives you'll be fine but to complement
this runner up is our RV zo2 from
silverstone now it offers a similar slim
Tower form factor but with a totally
different physical character the GPU
chamber here is totally separated from
the main one as to minimize airflow
mixup and I love their implementation
for drive installation with this very
convenient angular two and a half inch
drive brackets but if you got that
enthusiast feeling bubbling up inside
the last runner up in this category is
the evolved I TX by fantex
now yes it's slightly larger but offers
a no compromise approach for water
cooling with this fantastic removable
bracket at the top and overall
outstanding airflow throughout and given
its a much wider enclosure compared to
what we are used to with ITX cases it
offers the easiest cable management in
its class the next category is the best
case and this one easily goes to the
coarser 100 R and the Silverstone
PS 11 at only 50 bucks I've grouped them
together because the frame is about my
5% identical and both come and silent
edition that has some noise dampening
foam spread throughout or with this
window that reveals a good portion of
the interior at 50 bucks you have good
storage options for both mechanical and
solid-state drives and okay build
quality and interior to accommodate for
budget systems no problem
stick to an air cooler for the CPU and
thanks to the many cutouts around the
motherboard cable management should be
not a problem at all just make sure to
control how many cables go behind the
motherboard tray because there isn't
that much room left of course these are
the compromises for 50 bucks but these
are the two of our budget selections for
2015 next let's talk about the entry
category the case I would recommend if
you're doing your first build and
looking for something comfortable hands
down the define s from fractal design
they take an open concept to the next
level by literally having nothing on the
interior gone are the hardly ever used
drive cages that restrict air flow and
what we have here is a perfect equation
for water cooling builds no modding
required the motherboard tray is
slightly recessed to help with cable
management the top fan mounts are offset
closer to the side panel for better
radiator clearance and while I'm not a
huge fan of the mod you vent system
because there is no top dust filter when
they are removed you can pretty much let
the front of the case handle all the fan
mounts all the storage is moved to the
back with a clever three and a half inch
drive mount and dual SSD brackets that
clean up super well thanks to the ton of
space and you don't have to worry about
any structural support either once those
side panels are on you can sit on the
damn thing for a job well done the
runner-up for a fantastic first timers
experience is the NZXT Noctis 450 which
brings us a very much needed upgrade in
the airflow department as the exterior
ventilated panels allow for less
restrictive front intake and top exhaust
plus for those not really interested in
that elegant form factor of the age of
40 now have this
as they share an identical interior
frame which I really like the power
supply shroud is awesome the drive cage
is solid and hardware compatibility is
top-notch
inside the n450 plus you get a fan hub
and gorgeous red underglow accents and
we also gotta give the cooler master
master case five shout out in here too
because they are attempting to take a
customization approach to the next level
with a very well-designed
interior space that is like chameleon it
adapts based on your needs and
everything from cable management to
excellent air flow options to the
modular cages to the best-in-class side
panel design that hangs on the hinge and
they don't just drop plus they brought
back the handles which even just during
assembly are super beneficial if you buy
into the master case concept you are
almost guaranteed for a future-proof
investment the next category is fun the
WTF what were they thinking and this one
easily goes to the antic s10 now don't
get me wrong it's a beautiful enclosure
with quality tempered glass side panels
with a unique tooless magnetic mount but
that's about it
because it's 500 bucks this is the case
I was hoping that would revive antique
with that competitive edge but
absolutely nothing new was introduced on
the interior layout and they've actually
broke some things and made things worse
like having no clearance for a top
mounted radiator because the bracket is
centered and far too back and cables are
also on the way sure the front chamber
is cooled separately but cable
management becomes a nightmare
especially because of that one entrance
point at the bottom we have a molex fan
hub you serious for a $500 case and it
seems that unless you're using an e ATX
motherboard then ntek is not really
worth it because interior cutouts for
cable management around the motherboard
tray will definitely test your patience
there's just not enough of them and they
also really far away from where they
need to be did they even build in this
case I'm confused this may be the worst
building experience of 2015 for me and
even if you throw out the price out of
the window switching gears a little bit
let's talk about something that we did
enjoy working in the most beautiful
chassis of the
year goes to the Leonie PC o8 this is
the case where the tempered-glass side
panels are not the only thing to talk
about Leonie has always had fantastic
aluminum build and they're unique and
less conventional layouts are kind of
fun to experiment with this dual chamber
design allows the main portion of the
case to remain very clean and exposed so
if you've been dreaming of having this
multi side showcase PC this is it and
the rear side panel is solid to hide
anything you've not fully cleaned up
busts the case has this awesome lighting
system built in that lets you position
these LEDs anywhere you want and adjust
the hue with the three knobs at the back
my favorite part with this PC case are
the added reflections in a darker
environment that would make your
workplace absolutely beautiful
especially if you light up the insides
in all the right places
the Leonie PCO 8 may not be for everyone
but it sure is beautiful and now we've
come to the last category the moment
we've been waiting for the case of the
year a word goes to the evolved ATX by
fantex now I think this case offers a
very good balance between build
functionality and internal customization
starting with the build on the exterior
we have these fantastic three millimeter
aluminum panels complemented by internal
solid frame
I love the elegant character and the
sandblasted surface to both side panels
are a toolless and swivel to open but
it's really when we get onto the inside
that really highlight a functional
layout for today's needs like a
slide-out
top bracket for easier radiator or fan
installation outside of the case that
accommodates for wide and thick
radiators without interfering with the
motherboard
it is an open layout so you get the best
possible front airflow but these parts
can also be populated with these
independent brackets and be moved in any
of the five slots for best compatibility
with your setup there is an additional
side SSD mount at the front and two more
at the back with two dedicated three and
a half inch drive caddies which isn't a
lot but that's why those optional
brackets exist achieving organization
with cables is super simple there's a
PWM
and hub included chromatid cutouts
everywhere cable ties in all the right
places and an interesting shape for the
side window that reveals all the
important goodies all while maintaining
a fairly small footprint without any
hardware or cooling limitations and
really the only factor to keep in mind
is the price at $179 which is steep but
it's a really good reflection on the
build the flexibility to get the
mounting and awesome water cooling
support and thus deserves our case of
the Year nomination well that concludes
the case of words for 2015 I really hope
you enjoyed oh it was a fantastic year
I'm looking forward to 2016 seeing what
type of minimization of the frames we
can achieve further on and what type of
efficiency we can get with space
optimizations but if you have any
suggestions on any of the cases or
options that we've picked per category
make sure to let us know in the comment
below I'm Dimitri with Harbor Canucks
thank you so much for watching we'll see
you the next video and Happy Holidays it
was a good year case so it was a good
year I'm looking forward to seeing one
that 2016 shopping - I'm frame putting
larger emphasis on modular aspect of a
case some of the year we'll get one
compiled list of the best cases of this
year we've reviewed 25 cases I'm
surprised my references and my thermal
paste they're about a year ago still</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
