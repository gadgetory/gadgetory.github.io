NCIX for our CES coverage what's up guys
I'm Dimitri with Harbor Canucks and one
more first stops at CES 2017 was fantasy
where they are showing off their new
flagship and two elite chassis it is not
finished but we saw a work in progress
at last year's Computex in many ways
this case represents the best of the
best that fantex had to offer over the
last two years it's like a combination
into the elite they basically
incorporated all their premium features
along with some new evolutions
exclusives to the elite so let's talk
about this massive case first thing
first this case is so big but is also
extremely clean looking with this
graceful lines fantex is known for and
some amazing build quality beautiful
curvature and nice lifted case from the
bottom so it can be carpet friendly no
problem this is a high-end chassis so
they're using machined formulator a
thick sandblasted aluminum exterior that
can be available in satin black or matte
gray there's also a large side panel
with four millimeter thick tempered
glass insert that swivels to open which
is one of the first cases to integrate
this type of glass mount with this a
swivel technique in the unique
ventilated area on the glass itself to
visually separate the chamber inside
while the other side panel holds a small
cutout near the power supply where you
can remove the dust filter and a large
spot on the side that can be removed to
install a side mounted radiator the
front panel on the elite is hidden
behind a seamless aluminum shot a door
connectors include four USB three
connectors in two banks of two an HDMI
port for that important VR a
decertification two sets of audio i/o
connections two recent buttons a dial
for integrated RGB LEDs and a USBC
connector that USB 3.1 type-c will be
added sometime after the launch but will
be treated as a free upgrade for initial
buyers that RGB controller will allow
users to properly sync their case lights
with supporting motherboards RGB LED
headers that means asus or or msi mystic
light will be natively compatible with
the elite sliding system inside the
elite there's plenty of space but
there's also designed to be an extremely
easy case to work in despite its size
without the need to actually put it on
its side so it is meant to be standing
up during assembly every piece is
screwed in rather than being riveted
together so modding and
component installation will be a breeze
there is a sliding multifunctional area
to hide cable clutter that includes
additional aluminum covers that are
meant to hide the mounts underneath the
bottom chamber is an isolated area for
storage and water cooling components
separated by this large aluminum plate
that can be removed to open up this area
so it's part of the main interior if you
desire to do so
the power supply mount is behind the
main panel it's hidden away to preserve
the space including a very capable
layout for cable management with more
SSD mounts and two PWM fan hubs to allow
separation control of all the fans that
can be installed inside the case but one
of the biggest selling points of the
case is the modularity which fantex has
incorporated there's a ton of
accessories which allow for enhanced
functionality like modular five and a
quarter inch drive brackets swap low
side and top panels for high-performance
cooling or silent operation and if you
want storage expansion fan decks has you
covered
- with six SSD mounts and space for up
to thirteen three and a half inch drives
though only six brackets are included
another item fantex includes is what
they call a vertical GPU mount that will
allow you to point graphics cards fan
shrouds or water blocks covers towards
the side panel and this allows for some
serious highlight of your gaming gear
and the integration here actually is
pretty solid now you may be wondering
why there are two sets of almost
everything on the front panel and that's
because the Anto elite is designed to
natively support and control two
different systems within its main
chamber so to cover that an ITX
motherboard mount is included which can
be installed above the lower chamber
right underneath your main motherboard
and this will of course limit some
component installation but the case is
large enough to comfortably accommodate
dual systems and as you can imagine the
m2 elite has been built with a mind
towards accommodating custom water
cooling loops and I think using it for
air cooling setups would be almost a
waste there are two pump mount brackets
and mid plate radiator area reservoir
mounts and enough space to run for four
hundred eighty moment of radiators a
single 360 radiator and one 120 rad all
at the same time so the anti elite is a
premium case with a huge price of 899
this might cause a mini
uproar in the case market and while
fantex may justify to themselves on the
price for tooling and all the meticulous
details to bring this to its own class
of a case you really need to have that
price sink in for a while as it clearly
is for a specific type of user who will
spend you know thousands of dollars on
the water cooling equipment alone so
stay tuned for our full review of this
case coming right after CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
