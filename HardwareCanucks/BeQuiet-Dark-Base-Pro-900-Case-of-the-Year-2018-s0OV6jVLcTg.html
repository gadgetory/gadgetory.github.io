old this was the case of the year for
2016 so well this is revision - no it's
bad at all let's check it out right
after this hello I'm looking for some
fans well are you married yeah I have a
ring what is your favorite number
I would say three do I have the perfect
fan for you this is the new Thermaltake
ring trio twelve fans with good static
pressure for radiators it is a beautiful
frame with double side and center ring
illumination with soft and super-bright
spill with razor chrome and
compatibility control it through your
smartphone the RGB plus software on the
PC or Amazon Alexa well I'm gonna take
these home perhaps you should to check
them out in the description below all
right you people so it is better if you
familiarize yourself with a dark base
900 Pro and what made it so special and
the fact that it won our case of the
Year award for 2016 you can check out
that video right over here but I want to
know what makes the rf2 so special today
so here's a list of all the new features
with Raph two blackout sections on the T
G panel and new i/o upgraded fan
controller new plastic drive slot covers
new silent wings three fans and the
power supply shroud so price-wise it is
not very competitive at $270 this is a
$20 price premium over the original and
they say not competitive because the
evolve X just launched at $200 so
there's that for comparison but this
close to $300 price point may be
justifiable because not many cases can
do what the pro 900 delivers now one
thing I was hoping we'd see changed is
the brushed aluminum exterior it was
fine two three years ago but the
sandblasted surface kind of has made its
way into the modern time and just a
better way to go to eliminate any
fingerprints and ref2 you would have
been the perfect release to integrate
that unfortunately it is not the glass
panel mount is still the same for short
thumb screws with rubber housing on each
peg and a slight lip at the bottom to
hold the panel and
a black out top and bottom sides to hide
the frame underneath now from a feature
standpoint this thing is absolutely
loaded I'm talking about a Qi charger up
top convenient not only for phones but
for peripherals
as well the chassis is both silence and
airflow focused with noise dampening
material throughout and ventilation
channels surrounding the frame with
three 140 more fans included which are
fantastic silent wings three the top IO
is good with a type C gen 2 port and
fast charging port as well the front
door can be switched to open from either
side to accommodate your layout and it's
one of the only few full towers that
still has a removable 5 the quarter inch
drive bay I would call them outdated but
at least in this scenario it is
removable and many people are requesting
them to be included on future cases the
fan controller hub is super handy for
case of the size it's good for 8 4 pin
fans with this front toggle for speed
and you also have this dual channel
configuration with performance and
silent modes and of course these all can
be controlled via PWM cable through your
motherboard you can also connect the
included dual LED strips into the hub
for some interior or exterior
illumination with solid or blinking
modes and you also have a 12 volt RGB
plug for more strips and this can also
be controlled via your motherboard these
strips are super bright and colorful but
they are solid and kind of limit your
installation of them inside the case for
water cooling you can install up to 420
rad at the front and the top you just
have to remove the 5 in the quarter inch
drive cage and maybe the Chi dock as
well to get everything mounted properly
but I was hoping for an upgraded rail
system like we saw with the dark bass
700 for the top fans but by far the most
unique element of the pro 900 is the
modularity of the interior like these
plastic covers over the drive cages that
can be extended in multiple levels
because of these ridges on the back side
to allow cables to pass through a 4e ATX
motherboards now I wish to refine these
brackets and this whole design because
they're not comfortable to work with for
example needing to compress all three
pieces at the same time on one of the
sides in order to extend them or push
them back is just not user friendly as
for clearance with these cages installed
you have 35 millimeters from the
so enough for standard reader and since
the fans are installed on the outside of
the frame that all space is good for the
rad the motherboard tray is also fully
removable it's height adjustable to
accommodate the radiators up top and the
entire tray can be inverted if you
desire to build such a system and all
this remains in the RAF - but now we
have a new power supply shroud so this
one's actually been ported over from the
dark base 700 and that the top plastic
pieces can be removed to reveal
additional functionality of the shroud
like an SSD mount right in the center
it doesn't particularly look good but
installation is easy with the caddy and
dual 120mm fans on either side so these
plastic covers close those sections that
are not used with 63 millimeters
available for cooling hardware at the
front and of course the entire thing is
removable so you can access your power
supply and this is where the experience
might get a little frustrating since the
shroud is screwed on both sides of the
case and removing it isn't so simple but
this is what the rf2 looks like without
the main bottom shroud it's low buoyant
it's kind of bulky for the hardware
there's lots of room available for water
cooling experimentation but then you'd
install the shroud last and
unfortunately it's not an easy drop in
place solution you have to almost force
it in place and go at a certain angle so
it doesn't catch one of the front pegs
it looks fantastic once installed and I
do appreciate the extra cooling and
storage functionality plus the good
spacing to pass any bottom cables but
the overall user experience is poor and
I think that might be one the inevitable
consequences because of this whole
inverted layout because the power supply
shroud can also be installed on the
opposite side therefore it has to be
symmetric and match the alignment on
both sides I just wish that it was
refined a little bit more so the user
assembly is easy and speaking of the
other side cable management is fine but
feels dated given there are no
additional panels to close up the
section and hide those cables but you
could say it's not really necessary
given the science panel is solid anyway
cooling in this case where the default
fans is okay I got to 80 degrees Celsius
on the CPU and 82 degrees Celsius on the
GPU this is with the fans at maximum
1600 rpm and the system wasn't
loud with the five fans at full blast
but you could definitely lower the fan
rpm for a much quieter system alright so
for conclusion I would say that the ref
tube brings appropriate upgrades over
the original while keeping the
modularity at its core the power supply
shroud section being the main addition
to this enclosure I like how it looks
and unlike the additional functionality
but I don't like the assembly process
and the additional $20 price premium
over the original and for case that is
two years old and that expensive I'd
still say dark bass pro 900 ref 2 is
still kind of competitive because it can
do something that not I can't think of
another case that has the ability to
invert the layout and it does it quite
well despite the low hiccups with the
user assembling with a shroud you know
it does cater to builders who want to
experiment with this whole interior
modularity and like flipping your system
and maybe populating something that you
would normally not do in a regular style
chassis so the question is are you that
person I'd love to hear your thoughts in
the comments below I'm Dimitri thanks
