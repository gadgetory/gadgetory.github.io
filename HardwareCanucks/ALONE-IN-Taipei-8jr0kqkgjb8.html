for Taipei
hardware canucks is at another fantastic
show all thanks to Nvidia fantex
and MSI
alright I'm finally here that is my
hotel right there
I'm a 901 which I'm pretty sure I stayed
in the exact same number previous times
now I know one day up let's see this
view well hello there
okay so I've actually never looked in
this direction before so this is the
main train station right there this
large building and I've looked this way
and this way where Taipei 101 this but
never in this direction well awesome
awesome stuff check out that traffic
this is where I was stuck for almost two
hours coming in here but of course the
lady had to take me through the city a
little bit sightseeing which was
appreciated oh my god finally here water
journey I will actually not that bad but
let me show you what this hotel what
this hotel room has to offer it's a very
dark room so like this is all the lights
turned on you know feels like the
outside is brighter with all the
blinding light pollution but okay the
weird thing about the hotel is in Taiwan
especially with this one is the bathroom
so first of all we have this nice
circular tub with a window check this
out so you can be taking a tub while
also there's this giant mirror you know
and check out this bathroom shower
situation so the shower here also has a
window which is nice so you have a
little bit of you in the past
when I was looking out towards the
Taipei main train station which is right
there
you were actually looking from your
shower onto somebody else's shower
so this is why this is here I think the
most exposed of them all would be the
actual bathroom check this out so we
have a bathroom and it's like a little
triangular this is this is better view
than the bedroom over there nice long
bed a very tiny table with this gigantic
lamp like what what's the point of
having so little desk space if you have
this Gigantor of a lamp occupying half
of it okay this is pretty cool BAM
get your coffee water for the road some
fruit mini-fridge and check this out
this is a really cool way to power up
all your electronics damn so this will
be my third Computex I'm really excited
because Ebers coming in tomorrow then we
have a third surprise member on the team
make sure to stay tuned for the the
grand reveal and ever since 2013 which
was my first Computex
I went out to 7-eleven and I'm a huge
chips guy so I saw a very interesting
flavor that I cannot find anywhere else
and I does the first thing that I buy
when I land in Taipei
so unfortunately that 7-eleven did not
have what I wanted to buy but there's
always tomorrow
you

harbor Canucks is attending Computex we
are super excited to deliver some unique
content as we normally do there's going
to be some new things in this show
