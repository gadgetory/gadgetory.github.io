good people look where I'm at what's up
guys come to meet it's micro txt case
two systems stay present and now
well hello good what's up guys hello
good people I'm Dimitri welcome to the
case of words of 2018 you know I feel
like the case market has redeemed itself
this year based on the disappointment
that was 2017
I feel like new trends are emerging that
I'm excited about and 2019 is looking
kind of a mystery like I can see certain
things becoming more mainstream and more
popular but then a large portion of that
remains a mystery so I'm excited now
some 27 cases have passed through the
studio there's some good options in
there my friends some good options the
new master liquid ml AI a liquid coolers
from Coolermaster come in both 120 and
240 millimeter variants now with
addressable RGB LEDs both the fans and
the pump that can be controlled via this
hub with options to adjust the lighting
effects and speed along with the ability
to control them through the respective
motherboard software check out the ML
120 and ML 240 ra iOS down below as
usual the rules are simple the cases
must have been released and reviewed by
us in 2018 and I make sure to double
check all the availability as well
because in our last case awards video
for 2017 the define are 6 1 the case of
the year yet the holes not yet available
until like January so none of that this
year alright I hope you enjoy the
categories for this case words are my
favorite case the best overall value
case the most innovative case best water
cooling enclosure The Vow collection of
features the fan favorites fail
compilation and of course we got to
conclude with the case of the year
oh all right let's begin all right so
let's start off with something fun my
favorite case of the year came on April
1st
this tiny wooden case you construct
yourself from colormaster I feel like
this should legitimately become a thing
from more brands if you're the type of
person to collect unique items when it
comes to PC building like the detail on
a cooler the
the motherboard tray is kind of insane
and is definitely something any builder
will appreciate as my real favorite case
of the year this easily goes to the new
NZXT age 500 so this is a replacement
for the s 340 that was one of the best
selling cases on Amazon and the age of
100 is a nice compact mid tower that
usual NZXT character it's boxy it's full
metal frame a very nice tgd mount the
interior layout is perfect for most
systems whether your air cooling or
installing a 240 rat at the front with
actually pretty decent air flow to with
that side ventilation
despite the fully solid front panel I do
appreciate the plastic keel magma
channels the perforated power supply
shroud the old one front IO connector
and purple USB ports and for 69 bucks
you should definitely consider the NZXT
H 500 and the only crappy thing is the
hard drive cage as it was on the s 340
there are no draft carries and therefore
can only house 3.5 inch drives moving on
to the best value enclosure
I feel the P 350 X from fan tanks
deserves the spot at 69 bucks over the
NZXT th 500 simply because it's likely a
longer so you can stall more fans at the
top the drive cage is easily accessible
from the front with drive caddies it has
built-in lighting that actually is quite
tasteful the interior has expanded over
the p300 granting EE ATX motherboard
support with deeper section at the front
for cable management you can install
radiators up to 280 millimeters at the
front cable management is easy and the
only downside is that you cannot install
a 360 rather than the front because the
shroud is closed the runner-up is the
very basic micro ATX frame from
Coolermaster the q 300 L at $39 now the
interior is fully open to support large
PS use and GPUs it's nothing fancy there
are no rubber grommets plus the side
panel is acrylic but I love the fully
perforated exterior so you can have more
flexibility on where to mount your fans
with these unique looking dust filters
steel and even the side that yo can be
repositioned and for ITX and micro ATX
budget systems the q 300 L is a must
consideration now let's get into the
most innovative category I want to give
this one to the cooler master SL 600 m
because it is not at all what I was
expecting and really a
appreciate the different direction with
the interior layout so the PSU shroud is
relocated to the front opening up this
bottom section from massive intake with
those 200 millimeter fans that's
delivering the best cooling for the GPU
you can also rotate that entire PCI
bracket for vertical GPUs as long as you
get additional riser cables and I feel
this case is all about
experimentation and needs refinement as
vertical air column mean the CPU cooler
must face up for proper exhaust or you
need to install a 360 rat up top as well
I love the illuminated IO the rail
system for PSU installation and the
exterior design it is kind of risky but
I really want to see more like it the
runner up is not the case itself because
the execution is kind of poor but the
concept of real tour Morpheus is what
I'm more excited about so this case
comes disassembled with a few extra
pieces to expand the frame height wise
in its smaller configuration you can
still fit an ATX motherboard but with
only 5 PCI slots available so it's
perfect for you know single GPU systems
while expanding the height is both easy
and grants you extra PCI slots for
multi-gpu configurations and I want to
see more designs that incorporate this
type of frame level flexibility perhaps
going from smaller ITX to full sized ATX
with sliding exterior panels like we see
with the Morpheus no for extra spacing
for radiators and hardware and I'm
really hoping we'll see a derivative of
the Morpheus in 2019 moving on to the
water cooling category the corsair 1000d
is kind of a no-brainer given its
massive size and just a frame that's
built for multiple radiators thanks to
these convenient sliding brackets at the
front and the top they are
interchangeable so you have the
flexibility with the size of radiator so
you can install the extra height and
length of the case means push-pull
really thick radiators is kind of the
way to go with a ton of room available
beside the motherboards for reservoirs
and pump installations so this is kind
of your super tower that needs a custom
loop for dual systems and the fantastic
lay out behind the tray for cable
management with these doors but a
smaller run route for water cooling is
the latest define s2 from fractal design
they've always delivered the fantastic
experience when it comes to user
assembly and hardware support and
who doesn't love the simplicity of this
exterior there are several minor changes
versus defined r6 but without the hard
drive cage so the s2 is all about
radiators to the front the top and the
bottom and the rear to the top bracket
has a fill port there are several
mounting strips for a reservoir near the
front and everyone who has built a
custom loop in the fractal enclosure
will guarantee an awesome experience
this next section is my collection of
WoW features the deep good quad stellar
is highly impractical difficult to work
in has bad cooling but is one of the
coolest frame designs from 2018 with
this mechanized front flaps for airflow
and even an app for RGB control and fan
rpm I absolutely love the curved acrylic
panel on the view 37 from Thermaltake
again this departure from traditional
side panels to deliver this wow element
is appreciated despite the totally
choked front fans and non-existent cable
management the end when a one ITX
enclosure has several wow factors like
the glass top panel with the built-in Qi
charger a transparent and RGB
illuminated bottom section for extra
flare support for normal CPU towers up
to 160 millimeters and an included 600
watt power supply with short cables
while the street come that too is one of
the most elegant ITX enclosures with an
innovative mounting system using these
universal brackets it's unconventional a
bit uncomfortable during assembly but
the flexibility on what you can use them
for is appreciated who knew you could
comfortably fit a second ITX system
above your main motherboard inside the
evolve X by fantex and then route a
riser cable behind the motherboard tray
so both systems could have a graphics
card it's very cool but it does lock you
into the revolt X power supply that can
power those both systems and finally the
angle GPU bracket on the cosmos c 700 M
is all about show-off vertical alignment
is kind of old news so why not try this
45-degree wallet cleanser this even lets
you mount it on the side of the
motherboard perhaps for proximity to
that front intake but the consequence is
an extremely ugly system that leads us
to the fail compilation of 2018 you know
it's very nice to have handles on the
cooler master q 300 P so you can easily
carry it into the garbage because those
plastic panels one
to kill your hardware anyway with no
airflow you know what's really nice to
have for a full glass enclosure
absolutely no cable management system in
place whoever designed the level 20 VT
has an even lower IQ all I'm asking for
is some effort the return of land cool
as the budget lineup for Liam Leigh is
great with a nice front panel design but
please reinforce your frame so it's not
easily bent ditch the molex connector
for the RGB controller and promise we'll
have a more interesting name for the
next release the lien leo 11 heir had
everyone's expectations super high
despite not having adequate dimensions
for the most popular CPU towers but a
larger disappointment came with a dust
filter that eats air cooler master
please have a team meeting to discuss
consistency because the age 500m from a
feature standpoint is amazing but the
user experience is so frustrating with a
thousand different panels on the PSU
shroud and behind motherwort ray perhaps
set on where to put the RGB controller
because the age of 100 p mesh and the
age of hundred p have them all in
different spots for no reason Corsair
with a 500 D wins on the word for the
most frustrating top fan bracket
installation with non captive thumb
screws and access only from the interior
and no 360 rad support either despite
the bracket being the same as the front
bracket revert back to your old days
please just like you did with the tramp
stamp logo I'm actually very happy to
fix the side panel installation on the
car by 275 R because it is absolutely
absurd to have no caching pegs and use
an allen key to tighten four screws
while holding a pretty heavy
tgd panel hey be quiet I love the
silence focus on the 601 in 801 cases
but please stop lying to yourself about
the front panel airflow because there is
none I dropped ten degrees with a front
panel removed man I love doing the fail
compilation because it's hilarious and
really reveals all the crap that's been
going on the case industry you know I
bring you guys down but then we spike
right back up with the case of the year
so this one's from my eyes goes to the
Liam leo 11 dynamic I feel partially
because it revived me and Lee as this
competitive brand with the case selling
for only $129 while delivering something
beautiful and
the two side glass design is an
opportunity to showcase your hardware
without sacrificing cooling as the
bottom top and the side areas can all
mount triple 120mm fans or dual 140 mils
the elevated motherboard tray is a
brilliant designed for cable management
and this whole dual chamber separation
as the 11 dynamic is not much taller or
wider than your standard mid tower but
because the PSU is rotated behind we
have so much more room in this main
chamber there is a Type C port the front
and do a PSU option if you remove the
drive cage and many ways to configure
your airflow provided your air cooling
or stick with a CPU tower below 155
millimetres all the vents are dust
covered I love the slide and mechanism
for the side panels and this is just an
exciting beginning of dual chamber cases
that are not conventional for all the
right reasons in the 11 dynamic from
nearly deserves our case of the year
word for 2018 whew alright so that is
this for me I hope you enjoyed this case
awards for 2018 I'm excited for 2019 and
let me know if you agree with my picks I
know there there's some cases that did
not pass through my hands but 27 is a
lot for our Canadian audience memory
Express is a place to go for home
business and gaming electronics you can
try before you buy especially great for
peripherals by visiting one of their
stores in Winnipeg Calgary or Greater
Vancouver and more with a new victorious
store now open with the same quality of
service and product selection they do
custom pcs and will beat any Canadian
price guaranteed how many trip thanks
much for watching we'll see you guys in
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
