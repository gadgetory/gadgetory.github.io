great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Huracan
ox and alienware has been sort of
rediscovering themselves as a brand with
competition rising they are looking at
ways to maintain their unique presence
and after getting our hands on with
their latest Alienware 13 I gotta say
I'm excited to see where they're headed
the Alienware 13 is a fully decked out
gaming notebook with gtx 960m 16 gigs of
ram and that 2 SSD for storage proper
IPS display with up to 2560 by 1440 P
resolution so this thing is a tiny
powerhouse that is also surprisingly
light inside very familiar-looking shell
that is easy to clean and not splattered
with annoying brushed aluminum the side
ports are quite limiting with dual USB 3
and Ethernet along with audio power and
the last USB 3 port on the other side
however take a look at the back and we
get dual exhausts for better cooling and
more silent fan profiles plus an HDMI
and a mini DisplayPort output to expand
your display real estate but the most
unique addition is the amplifier port
that allows you to connect an external
GPU to power your games so if you'd like
a review of that leave us a like below
getting inside the slightly rubberized
perimeter around the really satisfying
keyboard with great travel distance
full-size keys and nothing too cramped
and look at that beautiful back like
peeking through that is controlled by
the command center for full RGB
customization although they have removed
the side LED strips and the trackpad is
no longer backlit now people have been
asking for proper compact gaming
machines where the only compromise I can
see here is the price when fully
outfitted and just imagine getting
something like the Alienware 13 to power
this new dell 34 inch 34 40 by 1440 p 21
by 9 ultra sharp display with a 99% srgb
color gamut beautiful viewing angles and
of course the curve when up and personal
would be an awesome experience because
it would actually curve around for extra
immersion and I also want to mention
awesome and solid that monitor stem is
what all types of adjustments so leave a
comment below if you'd like to see this
combo in gaming action and we'll do our
best to deliver so this has been our
quick hands-on with the Alienware 13 and
the del u 34 15w make sure to subscribe
as we have the El anywhere 13 coming in
for review shortly so you don't miss
that thanks for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
