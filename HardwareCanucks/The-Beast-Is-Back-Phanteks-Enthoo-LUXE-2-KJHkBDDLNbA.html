and look at this backdrop it's like a
little water fountain through the roof
through the wall wow it's pretty it's
just water falling us going down the
crevices and it's creating this little
homey texture Wow
very cool very cool now let's go seek
manta and thanks here we go alright so
last year when we were at CES here
visiting Compton
coffee thanks alright so last year when
we were visiting fanfics here the CES
they have impeccable lighting they
replaced all the bulbs and the problem
most years is the fact that absolutely
nobody has proper lighting in their
Suites or on the show for so we will
have to see what fantex does this year I
see someone I know
alright so the moment of truth beautiful
view let's see if they have changed
their light bulbs this time around and
looks looks like they have wow this is
the best suite the entire CES to get the
best even lighting everything is great
love it now you probably already have
watched our P 600's preview make sure to
check the router over here but we have
the Black Edition which is like all
matte black but it is awesome to see the
metallic gray version which has the same
interior which is super cool so not just
on the exterior but on the interior for
a little extra accent stuff and all the
light will bounce to the interior - and
there's the white edition which is a
slightly more glossy so matte black gray
white but the main star of the show for
fantex at CES this year is this new
fantex
n2 lux - but first big thanks to our
sponsors Thermaltake Razer fantex
corsair and msi for making our CES
possible so what fantex wanted to do
with the lux 2 is basically just
redesign the full Tower and kind of
focus on the features so the lux 2 is
premium but it is like the less
expensive than the evolved X so this
one's gonna go for 189 dollars and the
target the release date is around q2 so
it is cheaper than the evolve X because
the lux - reduces the aluminum enclosure
for the
exterior so there's some different
materials and focus on internal features
so it's a super efficient design we're
told in this price segment so it has
some primo and elite elements so at the
original bottom design for example like
putting the power supply on the side for
more airflow from the bottom we have
that L design soft illumination that
spans the top the front the bottom and
now it's actually enters on to the
interior to highlight the PSU shroud and
this is actually the first time that
they're adding lighting to the interior
that's tasteful and addressable to match
the exterior design theme and as with
the P 600 s they've gone with this
fabric material on the exterior I really
like it on the sides because it Slim's
down the frame and gives you the
perception that was likely you know not
as gigantic of a tower it is a pressure
fed fabric material both for airflow
channels and aesthetics to the backside
panel has a small TG window to reveal
three SSDs so if they are RGB they look
awesome and they might add a tiny LED
strip at the bottom of this window to
illuminate this area if you are using
non RGB SSDs which would be sweet
there's that big side mount because of
the available ventilation on the rear
panel so you can install either fans
here a radiator and you can install them
on either side of the frame because
there is enough clearance between the
frame and the side panel and as for the
interior there are four covers that kind
of like basically block this area so you
can either use it for SSD mounting or
remove those four fan installation the
i/o will be located in its usual
position behind the front cover wood
type C and a reset switch that you can
reroute for the second system to be for
power and the interior let's get into
that now it is completely open basically
so all the sort of you know four corners
of the enclosure are within easy reach
and it's not designed for your
traditional systems really as the
basement section is quite tall below the
main motherboard tray for example you
can install a second power supply for
stacked HDD caddies which are included
so you know if you want to go with
storage focus system you can install an
ITX system in here which is what you see
now or fill it with a really thick
radiator for push pools so they had an 8
even more radiator
here and it still has plenty of
clearance until you're you know your
main ATX motherboard area now no
optional kits are required for any of
this mounting so you don't need to
purchase an additional ITX mounting kit
because everything is kind of built into
the frame by default which is awesome
and so this whole thing is very much
water cooling ready and simultaneously
at the same time you can do two 480
millimeter radiators so one at the front
and one on the side and two 360 moving
radiators one at the top and one at the
bottom the motherboard tray is flat and
wide for eb motherboard support those
are those really gigantic dual socket
int'l motherboards so a standard ATX
motherboard looks kind of you know small
inside this enclosure and what fantex is
trying to do is develop an ecosystem
where deluxe two is fully ready for dual
systems where the revolt X power supply
might come in handy
and you know it's kind of your really
enthusiast full tower where you either
go with the dual system configuration or
just go crazy water cooling and you know
knowing and the user assembly that you
get with a fan --tx of this type of
caliber it is definitely going to be an
enjoyable experience and in $189 I would
say it is highly competitive and almost
competes with fan tanks themselves and
now the metallic gear series so it's
powered by fan tax if you guys recall
with it the original sort of overview of
the Neo line at Computex
but now they've expanded that selection
into a lower price territory so the
Nevis island which has closed off side
panel with noise dampening material
applied on it $49 then we're moving on
to the new air so it's a high airflow
style case with a mesh front panel so
you can see the the kind of the fans in
on the interior $59 price point and the
finally Neo G so it's more of a tempered
glass Edition still has a little bit of
spacing on the front so the airflow is
not completely choked and they're going
to modify the front panel for better
airflow and I'm really excited to check
out the Nira series Neo air near-silent
and Neo G and this guy is 69 bucks
alright good people so that is the
fantex luxe - I'm really liking the
direction that they're taking you know
incorporating elements from the original
locks and the end - primo
and really focusing on a feature set and
you know it is not really competing with
you evolve X because the evolve X is so
premium it's got design elements and
feature set whereas this is more towards
the feature set so let us know what you
think about this whole dual
configuration for systems power supplies
water cooling and what would you do with
the lux 2 if you are you know planning
on doing something like that and do you
guys like this whole fabric approach I
love the texture and this new different
direction but what do you think let us
know in the comments thanks for watching
we'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
