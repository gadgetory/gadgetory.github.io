interesting and full tower from Zalman
okay this thing is huge and just for
size reference it's almost as big as the
appendix and two elite cases are getting
way too big these days so the case is
pretty huge but I appreciate that the
tempered glass panels have been removed
during shipment so the actual frame is
much lighter to you know carry and work
around and then you can list all the
glass side panels when you actually
finished that's brilliant
so let's find out what this thing is any
good right after this the new master
liquid all-in-one coolers are available
in 120 and 240 millimeter stylish
radiator sizes with air balance fans
included for best air flow and RGB sync
on the pump and the fans and that are
controlled via this hub or through your
motherboard check out the ML 120 ln 240
l down below alright so the salmon x7
full tower is an interesting case in the
area because of Computex two years ago
basically we saw an early prototype in
development stages and Zalman requested
feedback from the community you guys and
they actually were reading in comments
and actually a lot of the feedback that
you guys provided in the comments was
taken into the final product but in
order to keep a little bit of suspense
for this video I'm gonna review the
price in the end so this should be
interesting
now you guys may know my thoughts about
really large super towers and if you're
going for water cooling build then a
large Tower makes sense if they're done
right but unfortunately Zalman failed on
so many accounts with the x7 it's not
even funny
it's just large for the sake of being
large so this is supposed to be their
most premium enclosure yet we still have
misaligned mounting screws there's a
vibrant red Mullis connector on the rear
side this is where a glass panels
supposed to sit the fans use a
proprietary six pin connection because
is that what premium users want the
aluminum edges and a few spots are
warped and because we have the aluminum
surface running on the top the front the
bottom and even the rear you gotta be
careful not to cut yourself because the
edges are not
and they're super sharp everywhere the
bottom panel is the perfect example as
the case feet are these tiny plastic
pieces and so my table got all scratched
up because of the aluminum edges and
seriously zalman this is just lazy a
dust filter that is not easily
accessible and there's practically no
room for the power supply to breathe
anyway this open space in the front
should have been switched with the back
and they also feel that the brushed
texture also feels outdated sandblasted
aluminum is the better way to go forward
on any aluminum surface I do like the
overall shape of the frame though it's
got some elegant elements but oh my
goodness what's happening on the power
supply shroud with that giant branding
let this be a realization moment that no
PC enthusiasts or hardcore brand
loyalists find this type of model text
attractive if anything it's embarrassing
and they should have kept the original
shroud from the prototype case from two
years ago now the one unique part of the
exterior is the i/o / fan controller
knobs they all have this extremely
satisfying smooth rotation and analog
feel to adjust the fan speed brightness
of the leds and the speed of the
lighting effects but everyone is moving
towards the software control so this
already feels outdated but of course I
do enjoy a throwback and the 4 USB 3
ports are appreciated too unfortunately
the lighting integration on the shroud
is far from a uniform if anything it
makes it look even worse when the x7
part for example is not even illuminated
with the internal LED strip and even
when the glass panels on the tint is so
dark that you practically cannot even
see the model name on the shroud which
is actually a good thing there's a front
ambient strip that is nice but it
doesn't sink in color with the fans for
some reason and none of the fans
displayed anything in the blue channel
so I had no blues or purples and overall
this is a disappointing execution all
around of course this would not be a
2017 released without a front section
choking point what's strange though
there is a dust filter right behind the
aluminum plate it makes no sense as the
aluminum cover is flush with the plastic
frame so the only ventilation points are
on both sides that have this coarse mesh
also you can probably notice more frame
restriction on those fans even though
the mounting points are flexible this
whole front section is a total failure
and on the inside you can fit a second
ATX motherboard beside those fans
because the interior proportions for the
x7 are just way off even with an e ATX
motherboard you'll need to preserve ours
beside that second row of rubber
grommets to occupy that space the power
supply shroud has a few good features
though like a mount for a vertical GPU
but they didn't actually include any
accessories for this to happen and
actually aside from these standard screw
bits and this poster size quick guide
accessories are non existent then we
have proper rubber grommets beneath the
motherboard and then we find rivets that
hold the non removable hard drive cages
in the shroud chamber so when you're
building a crazy water-cooling build you
also can have six three and half inch
hard drives in your system and lastly
the front section of the shroud is only
open a bit to accommodate maximum a 50
millimeter radiator and I would say this
is normal in like a regular mid Tower
but for case this long they couldn't
have made the cutout larger to support
let's say 60 millimeter rods with the
push-pull fans this tiny EVGA case in
comparison has more radiator room it's
absolutely embarrassing for the x7
although I do like these GPU brackets
but again it's a cheap plastic
implementation that almost symbolizes
the x7 in its entirety moving on to the
top the fan bracket is super
inconvenient to access first removing
the three screws that hold the top panel
on which all the i/o is assembled so you
can't fully remove it for convenience
next the bracket is secured with two
thumb screws underneath the frame making
installation incredibly difficult
especially with wide radiators the
bracket on the other side has three pegs
that need to align so it must be
installed at an angle first and why
didn't they just stick to the original
on rails bracket like we saw at concrete
Tech's two years ago it's completely
boggles my mind that the final mounting
procedure is so frustrating it does
support the 360 rad without any issues
but the mounting points for it 280
radiator are misaligned and you cannot
have it somewhere in the middle of the
bracket instead you need to use the
corner mounting brackets to install it
to ADA grad and I find this to be a
ridiculous compromise on the bracket
this large and just to finish off the
tour with the rear side which has
nothing practical and form of cable
management for a case this large and
this exposed we have five SSD brackets
for storage I guess that's nice but no
covers on anything to hide the cables
and all this mess not even a single
cable tie point beside those SSD caddies
what a disappointment
now let's put this case into this
hypothetical situation where you'd want
to install dual radiators for a custom
loop so my 360 rad is comfortable up top
although installation was a pain the GPU
support bracket is good to eliminate sag
but might interfere with SATA cables and
the first row of rubber grommets is just
way too far for a standard ATX
motherboard it really sucks how there's
no PCI extension cable included so I
can't utilize that vertical slot for my
GPU and if you really want to experiment
with how to occupy this empty space in a
case then the x7 is for you now the
thing is the size is not even the
biggest issue but it's lack of
refinement and elegance of this tower
that makes it so unappealing like the
branding on the shroud and it's crappy
illumination the tempered glass side
panels are fully bare with a dark tint
but no blackout perimeters nor any
blackout portions on the cable
management side so everything is exposed
and there's the sense of poor attention
to detail every step of the way and it's
a big slap in the face because the price
like I said in your intro would be
revealed in the end is two hundred and
ninety-nine dollars
ouch let that sink in for a little bit
and it's competing with the latest C
700p the new cosmos from cooler master
which is a $2.99 but it feels like it's
more premium than this thingy and cases
like the dark bass 700 and the H 700 I
all have similar radiator and cooling
options but costs significantly less
plus have all somewhat of interesting
and unique interior options which this
thing doesn't and I want to say that the
Z machine design team needs to enter the
present get out of their bubble because
if they don't that is how brands start
to die then you coarser
avoid pro gaming headset is comfortable
stylish in different colors delivers
fantastic wireless performance even for
competitive gaming with an all-new
microphone for clear communications

in the description below so thank you
guys so much for watching make sure to
subscribe and check out this other
relevant content let me know what you
think of the Z machine x7 in the
comments do you think it's as bigger a
failure as I make it out to be or have I
missed something that you guys
potentially let me know yeah thanks so
much for watching we'll see you next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
