into launch there's 750 series nvme SSD
enthusiasts started to move away from
custom based PCIe models it was just a
matter of time for nvme to gain momentum
with the launch of Intel's first nvme
SSD the 750 Pro and then Samsung's 950
pearl came into the market and now we
have Toshiba and their OCC divisions
latest Revo drive or RT 400 that has
been launched today and we will be
taking a look at two variants the 5 tall
gigabyte and the 1 terabyte variant to
see what these nvme drives have to offer
the z9 neo by Zalman brings all the
right features on a budget with a large
windowed side panel 5 included fans and
the excellent interior layout with super
simple cable management get it now link
in the description below let's get some
specs out of the way the RT 400 comes in
capacities ranging from 120 gigabytes
all the way up to 1 terabytes ocz claims
a theoretical read speed of 2.6
gigabytes per second and a write speed
up in 1.6 gigabytes per second on the
512 gigabyte version the NAND endurance
is 296 terabytes while the one terabyte
variant sports a whopping 592 terabytes
in other words you will need to write
324 gigabytes of data every day for 5
years before the NAND is pushed beyond
its weighted durability price-wise we're
looking at 329 and 759 for the 512
gigabyte and one terabyte SSD
respectively and an extra $20 for the
version which includes the PCIe add-in
card adapter perhaps the most important
aspect of the RT 400 is its form factor
unlike previous Revo Drive models which
were essentially 2 or 4 SATA base drives
crammed onto one full-length PCB with a
custom software RAID controller to join
them together and they worked natively
over the PCIe interface this meant you
absolutely needed to use an expansion
slot not this time though the new RT 400
does rely upon a single nvme controller
it uses a compact 2 to 8 0 m dot two
form factor and connects via a piece
the IE 3.0 X 4 interface I'm definitely
installing one of these on my msi gt72
notebook for a scratch disk that last
point needs to be discussed though if
you're actually interested in purchasing
the RT 400 pay special attention to your
motherboard specifications some actually
have an m2 slot but it may not operate
with a full pcie 3.0 x4 link speed and
for those situations the RT 400 comes
with that m dot 2 add-in card option I
mentioned earlier the latter is simply
an m dot 2 2 PCIe x4 adapter card that
allows the RT 400 to plug directly into
any free four-lane or larger pci slot on
the motherboard this is an excellent
addition for desktops that are a bit
older or which don't support the full
bandwidth required over the native and
dokdo slots the build quality is
excellent and I love how stealthy it
looks the only minor negative issue is
that there is no room on this small PCB
for true enterprise grade data retention
the RT 400 is using a modified version
of OCC's firmware based power failure
management plus with the help of some
onboard components in either case what p
fm+ does is ensure data written to the
land is secure but any data that was in
the process of being written from the
RAM buffer to the NAND will be lost in
the event of an unexpected power loss
all right with all of that now behind us
let's see how well the RT 400 stacks up
with its competitors
the numbers do speak for themselves as
the performance is extremely good but
only in certain situations if you want
the absolute fastest SSD for game
loading large file transfers or some
other operations the Rd 400 is going to
be one of the best options around in
many real-world tests it was easily able
to match the performance of intel's
715 series whether or not the RT 400 is
right for you will be determined by what
you intend to use it for if game or
system load times fast access to onboard
data and the quick transfer of large
data files are all critical for your
enjoyment then this will be near the top
of your list however anyone who wants
the workstation SSD is better off
looking for alternatives with the Rd 400
OCC and Toshiba have succeeded in
creating a drive that effectively
combines high performance a compact form
factor and a relatively reasonable price
point don't think of it as a reward
drive as we've come to known them rather
known the Rd 400 is an excellent
evolutionary step forward that perfectly
needs today's expectations it's a
perfect choice for enthusiasts well that
concludes our review of the Rd 400 make
sure to let us know what you guys think
