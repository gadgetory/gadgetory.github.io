packages from China especially from
companies that cold it chewy
oh so this is their lab book err it's
some kind of as a budget territory but
it's still a little bit expensive for
the hardware but we're still excited to
come on box this doesn't open so it is
tackling deep under $500 price point for
a 14 inch notebook that is all aluminum
it's got some eight gigabytes of RAM
look at this it's it's already set up
hold on alright this is a little bit
sketchy there's something in the sound
recordings white
sounds like someone's clapping you can
see this file was created on November
9th this is actually before we received
in the review request email I don't know
it's kind of fishy but I guess a clean
format will do so let's review the chewy
lab book air right after this the new
master liquid all-in-one coolers are
available in 120 and 240 millimeter
stylish radiator sizes with air balanced
fans included for best air flow and RGB
sync on the pump and the fans that I
controlled via this hub or through your
motherboard check out the ML 120 ln 240
l down below i am pretty sure that the
clapping in the beginning was for our
videos so thank you so this thing is
here because we want to explore what
this sub $400 14 inch notebook gets you
from like a standard user experience for
people who want something just good
enough for basic office work for youtube
email etc now the price point may seem
affordable but for a machine with the
same CPU like this Acer Aspire One
you're looking at $200 with half the RAM
and less storage but still it's a
significant price reduction so I feel
the premium where the lab book comes
through the build the first impressions
are positive so we got great color
scheme with this medium gray too high
the handling marks although only the
trackpad is slightly lighter in color
and it would be nice to have the
keyboard stand out a little bit too
because it kind of gets lost in all that
gray the aluminum chassis it feels great
it is a bit heavier than what I would
perceive for a 14-inch notebook to be
that is also this thin but I'm confident
you know carrying this inside a backpack
without that warping or bending or
something like that all the screws are
properly aligned and I didn't see any
quality issues now because this thing is
slightly used having found os and
everything pre-installed and the
recording file that I found in the trash
bin there is a bit of a scuff on one of
the sides most likely from something
sharp maybe like a watch that hit it
from the side but other than that it's
held up pretty well the illuminated logo
on the lid is a nice touch but the hinge
here is way too stiff you cannot open
this with one hand but the gloss coating
on the screen while super reflective
does give off this quality vibe to
prevent the panel from bending also I
would like to say that despite the very
tough hinge the screen wobble is just
insane I'm touching the desk right now a
little bit and you can see that wobble
is extreme and that also happens when
you're typing on the screen and because
of that reflective nature of the display
it really helps to emphasize that wobble
even more this is a 1080p IPS panel with
okay sized bezels for 14 inch form
factor brightness could be better too
because of the reflections but indoors
it's great with pleasing colors the
turning point however is the backlight
bleeding which is severe and especially
visible when turning on the machine when
that logo pops up and perhaps it's a
reminder to basically lower your
expectations
I am surprised with all the port
selection so we have dual USB 3 and the
headphone jack that by the way sounds
awesome it compensates for the crappy
stereo speakers that are louder on the
right side and kills the stereo effect
we even have a micro HDMI port and a
micro SD card slot to expand your
storage because the internal 128
gigabyte of EMCC
is limiting mine arrived already
partitioned into allocating 40 gigabytes
for the OS drive that seemed to be not
enough when Windows decided to update
itself there is an additional SATA M
that to port at the bottom for 22:42
drives but transferring the OS on to it
be a challenge the power brick is nice
and small with a red LED beside the port
to indicate charging the charging speed
is about I would say 10 to 15 percent
for every half an hour so it's a bit
slow and depending on your usage battery
life for me has been not that great
playing a youtube video on one side and
browsing the web on the other while
windows was updating in the background I
actually didn't know it was updating
until you know it's looking in the CPU
search it's like a hundred percent and
then wondering why but it is because of
Windows Update I lost 40 percent of my
battery in just one hour and here's a
depressing fact I've had this for about
a week and for the last three days it's
been updating windows the keyboard
layout is good with full sized arrow
keys and overall typing is great I don't
mind the slightly mushy keys travel
distance is perfect and I do like that
the FN button activates the standard F
keys while all the useful things like
volume brightness and media control are
set to be activated by default the
backlight of the keyboard is very weak
but it does help a little bit in the
dark now the trackpad size-wise it's
good but the surface is terrible it
makes my finger vibrate as I slide
across regardless of pressure the
built-in clicks are super hard and the
actual cursor movement is not accurate
where it keeps moving about 10 pixels
after I stop my finger making basic
navigation extremely frustrating it is
using the precision drivers so gestures
work really well but the actual cursor
movement sucks
you need a mouse for proper navigation
now performance is acceptable when you
work within the limits of this selar√≥n
processor it is a quad core model at one
point one gigahertz and it only clocks
to 2.2 gigahertz while charging I'm
plugging this thing from the wall gives
us a maximum of about two gigahertz so
performance suffers the eight gigabytes
of RAM is enough for multiple tabs in
Chrome and you can even squeeze a few
like games if you'd like just keep in
mind the storage is limitation unless
you add your own so it is a super weak
machine and we get to about the 100% CPU
usage while it's updating windows
unzipping files take forever and I
actually don't see the appeal of this
running Windows OS at all it seems like
chuyia has created the perfect machine
for Chrome OS instead which is a much
lighter ecosystem so putting windows in
here really just hinders performance and
it clouds this entire hardware
the Wi-Fi module is dual-band but it's
only a G so the signal strength is
weaker across a single wall that I'm not
usually used to the left side of the
machine gets much warmer during like
casual operation so you can definitely
feel that's where the processor is
located and their customer support is
apparently unreliable their live chat
feature on the website directs them to
their Twitter page where someone
responds to people's comments once in a
while so just keep that in mind and
don't go in it feeling like you're gonna
get the full support and the full
experience because it is a pretty cheap
notebook so for 350 to 400 dollars the
best thing about the lab book air is the
form so the build the thin body the
screen the additional storage options
and the keyboards performance wise for
the basic user I would say is totally
fine but it is hindered by the US and
battery life has been disappointing
because of all the damn updates that
Windows is forcing on you and disabling
those things it shows that I have about
70% left and under 4 hours of use the
worst thing about the machine is the
touchpad and then seems like I'm the
only one who's experiencing some cursor
issues based on other reviews that I've
read however the surface itself and the
button mechanism are truly terrible now
I remember buying my very first notebook
it was an Acer 49 she was this thick and
overall user experience was totally
passable given you understand the
compromises for the price and the thing
is about the lab book err is that it's a
pretty package with flaws that is
somewhat cheap and so it's good thing
that we've come to the place where we
can have machines like that sub $400
price but as long as you understand that
you're going to need to use a mouse and
that Windows perhaps is not the best OS
for this hardware I also hope that
customers are receiving brand-new units
of the laptop where you go through the
setup yourself and not something like
that where it arrives it's been used
there's files in the trash bin that's
sketchy man so sketching so that's it
for my review of the lab book err let me
know if you've experienced something
similar in terms of receiving something
that's already been used from any brand
whatsoever I'm Dimitri thanks so much
for watching we'll see you
