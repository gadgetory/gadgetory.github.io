gaming notebooks have come a long way we
have the entry level gaming notebook
starting at $1,000 that can play modern
titles at low settings with reasonable
frame rates and then comes the mid tier
laptops that start at $1,500 to $1,700
that can do sixty frames per second at
medium and then comes the high-end
gaming notebooks that start at $2,000 I
can go all the way up to $5,000 and
these notebooks are capable of playing
games in 4k one of my favorite things
about Technology every year is that
products become more efficient faster
and the best part is that we're starting
to see desktop class graphics migrating
into the mobile space and this in turn
shrinks the performance Delta between
desktops and notebooks that being said
the price to performance ratio still
lies heavily upon the shoulders of
desktop PCs and you will still need to
make some pretty large financial
sacrifices if you want to combine
portability with high in game frame
rates silverstone reversible cables
feature beautiful aluminum housing in
various colors and nylon braiding for
protection with reversible USB 2.0 on
one end for the really easy plug and
play and on the other end available in
both Lightning connector for the iPhone
or reversible microUSB get your cables
now with a link below we're taking a
look at three notebooks today that
occupy the high end space and we're also
interested to see what similarities and
differences they share
welcome to the harbor connects showdown
between these three powerhouses pricing
and specifications first let's start
with the eurocom sky x9 this thing is a
monster
it's rocketing i7 6700 desktop processor
32 gigabytes of fast 24 hundred
megahertz memory and two gtx 980m
eight gigabyte GPUs in sli perhaps the
crowning or pointless addition here is
the 4k IPS panel and I'll talk about
that in a bit we also have a standalone
desktop class gtx 980 with an MXF 3.0
added card so we can test frame rates
with what amounts to less expensive
option in your comes extensive setup
page now these specs are very impressive
but as configure
it tops out at around five thousand
dollars and you can take some time
browsing through your coms website you
can pick and choose which parts need to
go in but most importantly the upgrades
are horribly high in price moving on to
the next notebook did you notice a
change this is the origin Aeon 17s LX
gaming notebook from all angles it looks
identical to the eurocom sky x9 as both
are using a generic sager source chassis
and the motherboard combo upon which
they install components this means both
will likely perform the same and when it
comes to things like keyboard trackpad
and speakers milk quality they're all
the same and the third contender is the
msi gt72 dominated pearl it's the least
expensive gaming notebook out of the
three and you do get a lot for the price
a gtx 980 32 gigabytes of ram 17.3 inch
1080p IPS display with g-sync and a
refresh rate of 75 Hertz and unlike the
other notebooks msi opted for a core i7
6820 HK mobile cpu unlike the desktop
class grade chips on the other two all
three notebooks come with a base MDOT -
256 gigabyte SSD and on top of that you
get a standard 1 terabyte hard drive and
speed wise the msi seems to have the
fastest SSD on the market available
while leon has the 950 Pro and the x9
sports a newer but slower SM 951 SSD
build and design is the next the Sega
source chassis on the X 9 and the eon 17
is a fully plastic affair but that
doesn't mean that the build quality
suffers there's very little top cover
flex and with the laptop weighing about
10 pounds and 2 inches thick your comm
needed to add structural stability to
ensure damage wouldn't occur when this
monster is being carried around
I appreciate the matte surface for some
stealth character with having an ex
lighting strip on the top cover that can
cycle colors inside it's the same matte
black finish the palm rest is very stiff
although it picks a ton of fingerprints
the keyboard and trackpad aren't
anything spectacular
it looks basic and performs like that
the backlighting lacks feature
and I wish they added macro buttons on
the side or any value-added rocket
functions all this applies to the EON
17s LX as well although Origen offers a
custom paint option which will cost
extra the typing and gaming experience
on this keyboard was fine but not
totally satisfactory the keys lack
sufficient travel and bounce back is
sluggish this all leads to a mushy
feeling which certainly hurts typing and
gaming the trackpad however is pretty
great the surface is smooth plus you
gotta appreciate quality physical
primary buttons with great feedback and
they are so much easier to use compared
to the tap gestures on Windows 10
Palmer's action ended up being in bridge
too far and fingerprint reader never
worked properly on the x9 but just fine
on the EON 17 swinging at the IO it's a
copy and paste in between the two we
have a pair of land ports that connect
directly to the killer neck a trio of
USB 3.0 ports one of which features
super charging capabilities and jacks
for headphones a mic lining and spdif on
the left side to the right we have two
mini DisplayPort 1.2 ports a combo USB
3.1 type C slash Thunderbolt connector
another USB 3.0 port and an SD card
reader the rear facing area is mostly
designed for ventilation but you'll find
a power input another USB 3.0 port an
HDMI 1.4 output and honest opinion I
would have preferred one of the mini
DisplayPort connectors here I like how
your common origin encourages you to
upgrade their notebooks as we did not
spot a warranty void if removed sticker
but taking a peek inside the x9 you see
a pair of gtx 980m cards installed on
the left side of the motherboard while
the 6700 desktop CPU is enjoying its own
dedicated heatsink in the upper right
hand corner the memory is accessible but
the storage drives and the m2 slots are
located below the battery so getting to
them will require the removal of a few
more screws overall it's a very clean
and organized pathway to upgrade
components in the future on the e/m 17
the layout is a little different since
we have a desktop class gtx 980
basically the GPU uses a single contact
plate which transmits its heat to a set
of large heat pipes and
then on to the integrated fin array in
the front of the left fan the MSI
Dominator Pro definitely stands out from
the other two laptops for one thing this
beast is more portable at 8 pounds
compared to 10 on the other - it's also
built really well there's barely any
flex on the chassis and that's
appreciated physical character here is
very much different compared to the
understated body of the origin and the
eurocom notebooks this one is taking a
more gamer ish route this is the dragon
edition with a red metallic plastic lid
and an etched dragon print with a
glowing eye the theme continues on the
inside with the dragon design on the
palm rest and I'm pretty sure most of
you guys love the red and black color
scheme that's going on here MSI has done
a fantastic job with the keyboard layout
with function keys off to the left that
I'll get to in a moment the palm rest is
very stiff it's built like a tank
and I have to admit I enjoy typing this
review and gaming on this laptop a lot
it does tend to pick up grease from your
sweaty hand but luckily it can easily be
cleaned and while we're on the topic of
typing and gaming on the dominator pro
why don't we just talk about that
keyboard it's a remarkable collaborative
effort between MSI and SteelSeries and
it's freaking amazing
the keys are properly separated and one
of the travel distance is short the keys
have excellent tactile feedback with
instant bounce-back the cherry on top of
this is the incredible and robust
software that allows for easy macro
editing RGB backlit modification and
profile setup the keys are lined with a
very thin layer of silver which allows
the backlit to shine through its natural
form and it looks gorgeous especially in
the dark there are too subtle lighting
strips on the bottom that adds an extra
layer of bling since RGB is the thing
these days I also enjoyed listening to
soundtracks from the integrated speakers
there's a whole strip above the keyboard
which is designed by the folks over at
dinner audio it's backed up with a
downwards firing subwoofer and man I
have an experienced audio from a laptop
like this before let's take a listen
the four buttons towards the left side
of the keyboard excluding the power
button are pre-configured and cannot be
modified I wish I could have that being
said they do offer some additional
control over the notebook right at your
fingertips button one switches between
the integrated and discrete GPU button
two cycles two different fan profiles
button three allows for quick boost of
xsplit game streaming and button 4
cycles through different lighting
presets within the chassis amazing job
MSI looking at the i/o we have four USB
3.0 ports gold-plated audio connectors
and an SD card reader on the left side
the right area holds two more USB 3.0
ports and a DVD drive which we think
does not belong on a gaming laptop in
2016 at the back we have a mini
DisplayPort USB 3.1 type C port HDMI 1.4
Ethernet jack and power in placement of
these is more ideal compared to the
sacred body with majority of bulky
cables hidden behind the computer
unfortunately MSI doesn't want you to
upgrade the storage or memory but
ignoring that I plunged my screwdriver
through the warranty sticker to see
what's inside the layout is definitely
different from the x9 the hard drive can
be accessed on the left as well as the
MDOT two SSDs the memory is also
accessible without too much trouble
both the GPU and CPU are cooled
separately with large fans and proper
heat sinks and they are positioned in
the best possible way to let hot air
exhaust through the back alright
display and key mean performance next
the origin and MSI models have the exact
1080p 17-inch 75 Hertz IPS panel with an
integrated g-sync module while your comm
boasts a 60 Hertz 4k IPS display NC
hefty pricetag if your content creator
like me you'd appreciate the 10 bit
performance from the x9 since it covers
100% of the Adobe RGB spectrum where it
says 70% on the other two but if you're
after gaming going for a faster and
gsync equipped 1080p display is the best
option the 10 bit panel on the sky x9
does have slightly better contrast and
brightness output but the other two
notebooks are not bad at all for gaming
now 4k is a hot topic these days and
come
starting to use these screens as a means
of marketing while it is true that you
get a lot more detail and real estate
when working I just don't see the point
of implementing that into a notebook
because windows killing is not caught up
to be enjoyable plus it's very difficult
to drive this resolution even with a
pair of nine ATMs why don't we take a
look at some benchmarks these results
are pretty much expected the 6700 K and
the origin is the clear winner here
since it's overclocked while the 6700
and the much slower 6820 HK falls behind
testing the memory the sky' x9 pulls a
little ahead due to its higher frequency
modules one thing to note is that the
origin is equipped with 16 gigabytes of
RAM while the other two with 32
gigabytes so you can see we're not
testing capacity rather the total
bandwidth the Toshiba nvme SSD with an
MSI's Dominator is exponentially fast
and it destroys the 950 Pro and the SM
951 SSDs
however the Acer 951 was able to
overcome the other drives in write
focused tests 3dmark synthetic benchmark
results don't typically translate into
actual in-game performance but they can
be used for a reasonable good metric of
where the notebooks will stand in
relation to one another
that means the beasley sli set up from
your comp trumps all corners while the
old clocked origin is able to overcome
the Dominator so now comes the best part
gaming performance the sky' x9 s
expensive gtx 980m sli setup was able to
top out at 1080p on most titles but for
a few due to some SLI gaming profile
issues this is always the case for
multi-gpu configuration so it shouldn't
come as a surprise when it was replaced
with a single 980 the performance was
lower but it was consistent across the
board the EON 17s LX was a beast pulling
great numbers while the slower processor
on the MSI notebook did drag down its
performance still the frame rates are
completely playable at Ultra settings at
1440p they all perform really well once
again but we're starting to see offering
notebooks closing the gap within each
other
moving up to 4k and the sky x9 does
start to show signs of struggle
rendering at that resolution even the
SLI configuration requires tweaking
within the games to hit playable
framerates
once again all three notebooks deserve
sincere recognition for what they can
output with the given hardware testing
the battery it is to be expected that
the MSI is the clear winner here
considering a more powerful CPU expect
around three hours of browsing the web
on the msi and by doing the same task on
the other two with the desktop class
processor and two GPUs it's guaranteed
to give you a limited time taking a look
at CPU temperatures the MSI once again
shines here like a star
especially with custom fan profile
configuration the sky X line
surprisingly showed lower idle
temperatures in SLI compared to the
standard 980 the 6700 K on the origin is
definitely the coolest during idle and
under load all that power when
overclocked
turns into heat the msi ran into some
problems with GPU temps with the default
fan profile the 980 was throttling all
over the place but turning back the
custom profile solved this issue the
dual 980 ms on the sky x9 performed with
expected temperatures and the same for
the single 980 on the EON 17s LX the MSI
Dominator pro was the quietest among the
three notebooks the Sky X 9 and the EON
17s LX with a single 980 was louder than
the dual nine ADM set up on the sky X 9
I thought it was supposed to be the
other way around but I don't know what
happened here
finally conclusion time out of the three
notebooks which one would I pick from a
performance and portability standpoint I
think the answer lies itself very well
from the whole video the msi gt72 s
dominated pro receives our pick for the
damn good award
but the story doesn't end there Europe
comes sky Eckstein and origins Eon 17s
LX are performed just like what they
should perhaps even better than the MSI
but I can't seem to justify paying that
much for gaming notebook past 3k but
what do you guys think about these three
notebooks and which one of these would
you actually pick as your ultimate
gaming laptop I will make sure to check
