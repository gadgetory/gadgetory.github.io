Hard Rock's review the evolution of
mobile gaming is actually quite
fascinating
while the medium of physical device
changed the association of light gaming
while you're on the goal remains the
same that's you know some angry birds
here play some pseudocode err and you
get the idea but this idea of mobile
gaming is being challenged by Razer that
is bringing together of mobility with
performance so you guys are looking at
the Razer edge the most powerful tablet
in the world
now this isn't product for casual gamers
the hefty price tag of the tablet alone
puts it in sort of a luxury category so
spending a thousand dollars on the basic
version of the edge is not for
everyone's pocket let along the edge pro
which we have here will set you back
close to $1,500 plus all the optional
accessories that will add up to the bill
for example the gamepad controller costs
$250 the docking station is another 100
plus any extra batteries that you might
want to get is $70 a piece also a
keyboard dock is going to be released
soon so already if you're planning on
using the edge with its intended purpose
you're looking at pricing competitive to
that of some really good gaming
notebooks so pricing is definitely going
to be a breaking point and the Razer
edge actually may not have that edge
when it comes to spec versus spec
competition now comparing the Razer edge
versus the Pro Edition you can see why
such drastic pricing differences exist
you get a more powerful processor an
additional gig of VRAM for that powerful
geforce 640 ml e and double the system
memory but the most important upgrade is
the SSD now I do wonder why razer opted
for only a 64 gigabyte SSD on the basic
version as that leaves practically no
room for any of your games now let's
take a look at the edge pro now this is
a 10.1 inch IPS touch display with a
resolution of 1366 by 768 I personally
don't mind such a resolution at this
size especially for intense gaming as it
allows me to crank up all the other
settings but keep in mind this is a
Windows 8 computer crammed into this
package so it's a little beefier than
your conventional tablets so it's not
the most comfortable
parents using the tablet on its own at
the top of the edge we get the power
button and the volume rocker rotation
log and a dedicated keyboard button we
also have a USB 3 port and a microphone
/ headphone jack combo I still would
have preferred dual jack so I can plug
in my gaming headset but one thing to
note is that when the gamepad is
installed some headphone jacks won't fit
due to limited clearance also notice the
large exhaust slots that really do a
good job of keeping the edge cool during
intense gaming now I also noticed a
slight play on the exterior cover near
the GPU exhaust this is a review unit so
it has been passed around so it is used
but seeing this happen is a bit alarming
as this is caused by the heat at the
bottom we find speakers and a charging /
docking port now the charger doesn't
actually clip in place but instead
simply slides in and can just as easily
pop out now her product of this caliber
I would've expected a bit more attention
to detail with regards to this charger
now the windows button is located in the
middle for landscape mode pretty
standard then using the edge in portrait
mode for online articles is also an
option and lastly we have a 2 megapixel
front facing camera with built-in
microphones well of course the edge
wasn't designed for reading so how does
it handle proper gaming well before
getting to that let's check out the
gamepad dock this is where the edge gets
interesting because it turns this year
Windows 8 tablet into a powerhouse of a
mobile console now each handle features
all the same controls as found on
console joysticks and of course having
the tablet sit right in the middle helps
with comfortable holding position so
when it comes down to handling simply
resting it on your lap with suffice and
all the heat is exhausted away from you
now you can insert an extra battery into
the gamepad controller to just prolong
your use but this also adds some weight
so with the extra battery the entire
package weights about four pounds now
what's cool is that the optional battery
installed inside the gamepad controller
gets used up first so you can continue
working with the razor edge after the
gaming session and same goes for
charging first charges the tablet itself
and then
answers on to the extra battery so I've
gotten a little over three hours of
gaming with both batteries fully charged
this is on high performance mode so
you're looking at an extra hour of
charge with the additional 2800 milliamp
hour battery now you can also enable
vibration on the gamepad controller
which is really awesome and makes you
feel like a right in the action but I
was quite disappointed at the quality of
the buttons for your point finger they
don't have good feedback and they're
very flimsy which is not at all what I
was expecting for $250 product also
given this a sort of the selling point
of the edge
I really wish raised it would make the
buttons a lot sturdier now the gamepad
works like it should with big picture
mode on Steam and obviously for all the
supported games but there is no other
integration in Windows 8
now also cool thing is the various input
keyboard layouts are available first we
have the standard let's say they are a
little oversized and take up a little
too much real estate on the screen then
we have the full keyboard layout with
the numpad and also this handwriting
option that detects what you're writing
not very useful but it's there
regardless but of course gaming on this
thing is actually quite interesting I
think I pulled over 10 hours on grid
alone of course with everything maxed
out graphics intensive games like Metro
2033 ran quite smooth with the little
optimization now personally I'm not a
big fan and not comfortable using the
joysticks for FPS shooters so there's
really nothing like using a mouse and
keyboard for perfect aiming so that's
where the docking station comes in with
3 USB 2 ports HDMI out headphone and
microphone jack and a charging port the
edge simply is placed on the docking
station again we have no clips here this
is for easy pickup and go situations but
I still have preferred more secure
docking mechanism now playing some Max
Payne 3 and metro 2033 everything set to
normal you get really acceptable frame
rates it's just not really comfortable
looking down in this 10-inch screen so
that's why we have the HDMI port on that
docking station connecting this to a
larger screen then you have yourself a
very powerful and capable computer
unfortunately the HDMI cable is not
included so the Razer edge formerly
known as Project
fionna a little less than a year ago has
come to life with a great list of
features and capabilities gamers now can
truly take their game wherever they go
because the package is so small now this
being the most powerful tablet at the
time this review make this a unique and
an attractive product especially with
the gamepad controller that really
brings console type gaming to the next
level but we also have to consider the
non practical aspects of the Razer edge
starting with the tablet itself
you really have to either get docking
station or the gamepad otherwise it's
just too thick tablet which brings me to
the next radik and that's the price
starting at $1000 for the i5 version
four gigs of ram and a 64 gigabyte SSD
it simply cannot compete to similarly
priced notebooks now you are paying a
lot for the gamepad which can hold an
extra battery and really provide a
unique experience but we also have to
talk about price here and that $250 is a
lot of money for a required accessory
given the gamepad controller was
included in the price that's another
story but otherwise this makes the Razer
edge more of a luxury item than anything
else it certainly is an interesting and
an innovative product but given mobility
is not a priority for most gamers the
Razer edge actually may not have that
edge to alert customers but it still
deserves the hardware canucks
damn innovative award so thanks guys for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
