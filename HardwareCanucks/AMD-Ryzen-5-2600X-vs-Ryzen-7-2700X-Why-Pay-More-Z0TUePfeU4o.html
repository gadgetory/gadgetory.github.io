and today we're testing out the horizon
520 600 X a processor that many of you
are requesting me to benchmark and
compared to its older brother the Rison
720 700 X as you may know AMD recently
announced their second generation Rison
processors along with the x4 semi
platform so I decided to put this $230 6
core twelve threaded beast of a CPU
through its paces so let's find out how
well it performs okay so before I get to
the performance results on the 2600 X I
want to quickly go over its specs this
is a six core processor featuring 12
threads comes with a base clock of 3.6
gigahertz with a boost up to 4.2 AMD has
also included a write spire cooler out
of the box unfortunately it does not
feature any RGB lighting but considering
the $230 price tag on the CPU this is an
absolute steal in my opinion now my test
bench hasn't changed from last week's
second gen rising 7 review I'm still
walking the MSI x4 cemani gaming m7
motherboard 16 gigabytes of G skills
Sniper X ddr4 memory clocked at 3400
megahertz and a reference GTX 10 ATT I
asked for cooling I'll be using the
included great spire cooler to see how
well it can Cooley 2600 X perhaps play
around with overclocking to see how far
I can push the thermal limits after
playing around with a core voltage and
clock speeds for a while through AMD's
rising master software I did manage to
get a stable four point one five
gigahertz at one point four to five
volts the sad news is that I wasn't able
to achieve this with the rate spike over
so I ended up using the noctua D 15 now
I do want to point out a few things that
I noticed while testing the 2600 X at
stock settings you see under idle tasks
or light low scenarios like browsing the
web or watching content etc the CPU core
speed fluctuated between four to four
point two gigahertz which is it's rated
to turbo speed and this was with all six
cores I'll be it I did notice one or two
out of the six cores clots slightly
lower than three gigahertz
but I think this has to do with XF r2
and the way how the algorithm works
under load
I notice clock speeds hitting as far as
3.9 gigahertz on all cores and this kind
of makes sense because once again X so
far to detects the thermal Headroom that
your cooler has and then it would
automatically adjust
Scott speeds so if you install an
aftermarket cooling solution those
frequencies can obviously boost up to
four point one to four point two gears
because it's obviously a lot more
superior than the included stock cooler
speaking of the stock cooler the rate
spire cooler is pretty capable of
handling the 2600 X at those weighted
speeds as you can see with my Ida 64 fbu
stress test which is the worst case
scenario the CPU got as far as 9 DC
under load and 38c during idle if you're
building a PC around a specific budget
say for example you don't have the money
to spend for an aftermarket cooling
solution and when you offset that budget
to a GPU because currently GP prices
let's not talk about that so if you are
a little bit limited on that budget you
know the stock cooler is actually very
capable of running the 2600 X at stock
settings with the stock speed so you
won't have a problem reaching 4.1
gigahertz to 4.1 to 4.2 gigahertz with
the stock core just keep in mind don't
expect the best overclocking
capabilities with the stock cooler just
as I did I actually wasn't able to get a
good OC with the included stock cooler I
had to obviously install an aftermarket
cooling solution like the D 15 so you
know you can always start with the stock
cooler and then later on once you have
the money you can upgrade to an
aftermarket AIO solution or an air
cooler with that being said let's get
into the benchmarks starting with
Cinebench r15 running the CPU test the
2600 x at stock settings with the stock
cooler by the way scored a little over
1300 points
that's roughly thirty four percent
slower than here Eisen 720 700 X at
stock settings makes sense because it's
a six core CPU compared to an eight core
processor the four point one five
gigahertz overclock on the 2600 X with
the memory speeds again at 3400 Hertz
gave us a score of 1416 pretty
impressive
switching to OpenGL it's a completely
different and an odd scenario
interestingly enough the 2600 X at stock
sayings yielded a little over a hundred
and twenty frames per second compared to
118 on B 2700 X overclocking it to four
point one five year heads I gave it a
massive boost dishing out over 130
frames per second honestly I don't have
an explanation here so feel free to have
your thoughts in the comments down below
they're running the BMW scene took
around 6 minutes to complete on the 2600
X compared to 4 minutes and 26 seconds
on B 2700 X this was expected because
the lower core count on the 2600 X is a
bit of a hindrance especially when it
comes to CPU based 3d rendering if you
are looking for a faster solution in
that department I'd highly recommend
picking out the Rison seven 2700 X
thanks to the addition of two extra
cores overclocking the 2600 X to four
point one five gigahertz shaved a little
bit of time but not by that much
same story goes for a 3d max Corona the
2600 X takes an extra 40 seconds to
render the scene compared to the 2700 X
the 4.1 5 gigahertz OC shaves like 9
seconds compared to the stock so it's
not that significant Paul Ray didn't
really show that much of a difference
between the 2600 X and the 2700 X and
this is likely due to the lighter render
load with the benchmark but when you run
more complex scripts the 8 core 2,700 X
would complete those tasks faster moving
on to some real-world tests I took a
one-minute 4k timeline exported it to
the YouTube 4k precent using Adobe Media
encoder and as you can see there's
roughly a 20 second difference between
the 2600 X and the 2700 X which isn't
that significant even the four point one
five years OC didn't really make much of
a difference but rendering a 12-minute
project using the same 4k precent shows
the true potential of those two
additional course on the 2700 X the six
core Rison 520 600 X took an extra six
minutes to render the video and the four
point one five gigahertz OC shaved off a
few minutes which is pretty nice but I
did notice something interesting while
playing around with the 4k timeline with
an Adobe Premiere Pro so I noticed while
playing back 4k videos this is DS RGH
five videos played back in full
resolution I didn't notice a lot of
frame drops with the 2600 X when
compared to the 2700 X so for complex 4k
editing I wouldn't recommend the 2600 X
you're much better off upgrading to be
2700 X because you're gonna get a little
bit of a better editing experience
compared to the Rison 520 600 X for
1080p edits I think the 2600 X is just
absolutely just perfect
all right let's move on to some gaming
benchmarks and right off the bat you can
see that there isn't a significant
difference once again between the 2600 X
and the 2700 X take 3dmark times pi and
firestrike for example the overall
scores are almost neck to neck with each
other and you'll see this trend with
some games as well depending on
optimization now I did run all of my
gaming tests at 1080p so let's kick
things off with battlefield one set to
ultra settings the 2700 X dished out a
hundred and sixty three frames per
second compared to one hundred and fifty
three on the 2600 X so that's roughly at
10 FPS difference over watch a 1080p set
to epoch yielded roughly the same frame
rates on both the 2600 X and the 2700 X
doom at 1080p set to ultra using the
Vulkan API yields as the same result
around 200 films per second on both CPUs
which is more than enough to be honest
but remember that we're smashing right
into the game engines framerate cap
lastly we have Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
at 1080p set to very high settings and
here once again we notice similar
performance on both processors which
shouldn't be surprised because coming to
think of it a while back we did compare
Intel's very old i 720 600k to the 87
enrique paired it up with a gtx 980ti
and noticed a minimal improvement in
most titles at 1080p and 1440p if you're
interested in checking out that video
I'll link it right over here so there
are a few things to take away from this
video aim DS Rison 520 600 X is by far
the best value focused creativity slash
gaming CPU because at 230 dollars you're
getting six core processor with 12
threads comes with a stock cooler by the
way which is incredible because you know
you don't have to fetch around for
aftermarket cooling solution and if
you're on a tight budget this is an
excellent bundle and when it comes to
performance I think you're really going
to notice a difference between the 2600
X and the 2700 acts in multi-core
workloads for example if you are working
with
you know 3d rendering that's heavily
based on CPU workloads then the 2700 X
is your best bet because those two
additional course can come in really
beneficial and we've seen a similar
trend with Adobe Media encoder and you
know the 4k exports you're definitely
going to notice a huge improvement when
you upgrade to the 8 core processor but
needless to say the 6 core processor the
2600 X is actually pretty capable of
editing a 4k and just 1080p videos in
general and that's something that
impressed me a lot with this processor
now when it comes to overclocking here's
a thing I don't think you're going to
notice a significant improvement when
you decide to overclock the CPU and
remember you need an aftermarket cooling
solution to get a proper stable OC in my
case 4.15 yards was too stable
overclocked I was able to get but
honestly I didn't notice a significant
increase in Europe you know productivity
and just gaming performance in general
when you overclock this processor you're
actually much better off letting the CPU
at stock settings because you know from
my tests I noticed that you know idle
situations and if you throw in an
aftermarket cooling solution this
processor can easily run at 4 gigahertz
and plus doing those scenarios which is
impressive because it's a lot better
than what first generation Rison
processors did offer so that's something
to keep in mind lastly I wanted to talk
about pairing this up with an
appropriate motherboard because during
my test I did use the CPU on an
extraordinary motherboard but if you are
on a tight budget pairing this up with a
b250 motherboard makes a lot more sense
I'll be it make sure that that board
comes with the appropriate up-to-date
BIOS to support these second generation
Rison processors and I'm not exactly
sure if you're going to be losing
performance from x4 70 to be 250 on the
2600 X or even the rest of Rison CPUs
that's something that I have to
investigate later on perhaps I'll create
a build video featuring the featuring a
be 350 motherboard and you know one of
these processors I should also mention
that some online retailers are offering
bundles so for example you can pick up
the 2600 X with an X 470 motherboard and
save a few extra dollars on that part
but one of the things about this
platform is that you can always upgrade
down the line so you can pick up a 2600
K today and when you have the budget
later on you can upgrade to be Rison 720
700 X and get an extra
multi-core performance which is
incredible so that about wraps up this
comparison between the Rison five 2600 x
MV Verizon 7 2700 X what do you guys
think about this comparison do you think
the 2600 X held up pretty well with the
2700 X and multi-core applications
through the test let me know in the
comments down below also do you see
yourself picking out be 2600 x over the
2700 X and what do you guys think about
the overclocking performance are you
impressed or are you not that impressed
let me know in the comments down below I
me bro with Harbor Canucks thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
