hardware canucks product review today
we're taking a look at the budget met
hour from BitFenix this is going to be
the shinobi Windows version and for
those who prefer a simple look
windowless model is also available now
the company has been on the market only
since last year and are already making a
name for themselves this Shinobi's
chassis is priced at the reasonable $70
mark being considered gaming /
performance enclosure it is bound to
attract a lot of attention from
budget-conscious buyers now this met our
is fairly small so placement on or under
the desk should be no sweat when the
selling points of the shinobi is the
soft touch powder coating on the front
and top panels which sort of feel
rubberized and helps you get rid the
cheap plastic you feel that budget cases
often have the mesh venting strips on
each side of the case also add to the
overall design and a touch of blue is an
appropriate color choice for the
enclosure market starting from the top
we have four USB 2.0 ports on your audio
hard drive activity lights power and
reset buttons now Big Finish should have
included the USB 3.0 ports to stay
competitive considering the current
direction of most case manufacturers and
the front features only three five and a
quarter inch drive bays and underneath
dual 120 millimeter fans can be
installed with securely mounted dust
filter
the top panel features dual venting area
which also sort to help to improve the
overall design case the windowed version
which is tinted and has mounting for
optional 120 millimeter fan to cool
those toasty graphics cards now this is
an excellent addition to a case this
price and also for those wanting to show
off the internal components at the back
we have IO area exhaust fan 7 ventilated
expansion slots water cooling holes and
then bottom mounted power supply and in
the bottom case we have 2 easily
removable dust filters one for the
optional internal fan and the other for
the power supply
both side panels are removed thumbscrews
unfortunately the side panels feel kinda
flimsy and the overall structure of the
chassis just does not have that tough
feel to it but that is one the corners
BitFenix had to cut in order to maintain
the competitor pricing take a look at
side it's nice to see they have
maintained the same white color theme
and it's especially nice to see those
front panel connectors in black the case
supports a 3.5 inch drives on the hard
drive cage and three optical drives both
with two low systems there is an
included exhaust fan support for dual
120 or 140 millimeter fans at the top
fairly large CPU backplate opening
multiple cutouts around the motherboard
tray to route your cables mounting for
120 millimeter fan at the bottom and
then included 120 millimeter intake fan
with mounting options for an extra fan
in the front at the back cable
management should be fairly
straightforward the scavo's can be
tucked away in the provided area beside
the hard drive cage and there are
multiple cable tie mountings around the
cutout to help you clean up any cable
mess which is necessary if you want a
side panel to close properly as there's
about an inch of space to work with
between the back of the motherboard and
the side panel the case comes with
sticker type rubber feet which are
attached at the bottom of the case
unfortunately you do expect them to wear
down over time and become useless and
perhaps a more secure mount by using
screws would have been more appropriate
both the shinobi window and the standard
model come with this 2.5 inch adapter
which is installed into one that five
and a quarter inch drive base but
unfortunately can only house one 2.5
inch drive also strangely enough their
mounting holes for one 40 millimeter fan
to be installed at the bottom of this
adapter possibly providing additional
airflow for the internal components
moving on with installation the power
supply with lengths of 180 millimetres
or longer may have clearance issues with
the bottom fan
next up is the hard drive installation
using this tula system which is very
simple to use but unfortunately it is
another price cutting corner with
Phoenix underwent to keep the price
competitive for one the hard drive cage
is facing the motherboard so clearance
will definitely be able concern for
longer video cards second you must
remove both side panels when you mount
the drive and the actual construction of
the mechanism is flimsy and the middle
knob tends to fall out when it's not
secured to the hard drive cage and there
are no anti vibration grommets to
prevent the extra noise from the hard
drive would be nice to see BitFenix
shift away from this older hard drive
mounting system and into a more current
where the drives are facing the back
side panel and have support from more
than one 2.5 inch drive now how does
this case deal with cable clutter and
cable routing is quite impressive for
case this caliber hiding most of them
behind the motherboard tray and leaving
the interior looking clean now you can
see here how the drive sticks out and
mounting the drive facing the fan is not
an option so with the drive installed it
leaves about ten and a half inches for
your graphics card so a 69 70 is a snug
fit otherwise there's just under 13
inches of clearance and the 6990 should
fit in just fine installing our 11 1/2
inches long card you can see how much
clearance ters between the hard drive
cage and the card depending on your
motherboard you can install 3.5 inch
drives at the top to our bottom three
slots and still have clearance for a
triple card setup and here it is fully
assembled the case interior is
surprisingly easy to work with in terms
of writing in cables and hardware
installation despite the little fiddling
around the 3.5 inch drives and then the
back as I mentioned previously I didn't
cables buy the hard drive cage makes the
side panel closed with no interference
with the cables overall the Shinobi's
chassis is one to impress with the
high-end features with an attractive
design and the windowed side panel
airflow options for great cooling and
lots of hard drive storage with a fair
price for the total package however you
do notice some features that could have
been improved and made this case even
more
them like the Thewlis system for
mounting your drives and the hard drive
cage itself and for all the water
cooling enthusiasts yes it would be very
difficult fitting an internal dual rod
with fans installed so water cooling for
the shinobi is quite limited if you are
in the market for a budget chassis we
would recommend not to settle down to
the shinobi just yet simply because
there are many great cases available and
the similar price tag offering the same
great features but with a more practical
approach and that is it for this episode
of Hardwick Knox product view and we'll
see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
