check this out I got a red puck from
NZXT very nice it is December 30th but
look how beautiful and sunny it is
outside I am right now in the Sun just
gotta soak it in soak it in so let's
talk about a few things so obviously in
the last week it's been kind of a crazy
show in terms of trying to fit all our
roundup videos in terms of the best PC
hardware the best PC cases our perfect
Android smartphone for 2018 and all
those things really kind of highlighted
how awesome this year has been for us in
terms of content and we are super
excited to bring you guys more in 2018
the blooper reel by the way is hilarious
make sure to go watch it because it's
just like a little glimpse of what
happens when those little pieces are not
made into the final video it's
completely cringe-worthy and hilarious
well guys the day is finally well guys
so a few things are around the corner
like CES and 2018 in Vegas Vegas is not
my favorite city but it's really lovely
to meet fans on the show floor and just
random and also collaborate with other
creators and I'm really happy to say
that we are gonna be working with random
Frank P on our CES content so really
excited to see what we can come up with
together so make sure to stay tuned for
that second so I'm not gonna give out
too much away and hopefully you know
things just go smoothly but we released
the worst case trans video make sure to
check it out over here and the case
awards video right so a lot of the
comments relate to something about
launching a case of our own or some
collaboration I'm not gonna give out too
many hints but Computex
is a place where perhaps something like
that may you know be revealed or
something so I'm not gonna say anymore
but I'm really stoked for what's coming
up at Computex did I say Computex
Computex yeah by the way if you guys are
interested in something particular from
CES let us know but we are meeting with
Nvidia NZXT Corsair Razer be quiet still
serious pantex asus EVGA Thermaltake
HyperX msi ocz silverstone Linley
gigabytes Anheuser color master and then
we're going to visit the LBCC show floor
no sleep team and I'm actually super
excited to check out Corsair see what
they have in stock because we have not
reviewed a single case from them in 2017
and always frantic has something really
sweet to show off to and for number
three we want to diversify the type of
content that we do so more mobile stuff
I love my whole relationship with
oneplus and delivering this like
experience that you can't get anywhere
else and Ebers fantastic camerawork and
analysis just like out of this world but
also doing more roundups you know like
I'm collecting all these headsets and
keyboards and mice and other things not
because I'm a hoarder big because I'm
waiting for that moment to time to
happen when that can be like the perfect
collection of items to do this massive
and epic roundup but if there is a
product category that you guys want us
to expand into let us know in the
comments we'd love to hear what we're
missing on the channel and one more very
exciting announcement is that Harmonix
is looking to expand its video
production crew so if you're in the
Toronto area and are passionate about
video creation passion about technology
and other things that we cover on the
channel to get in touch and information
on how to do that is linked below we're
pretty good people yeah I'm going to
close it off by saying this has been
such a fantastic year all thanks to you
giving us feedback given as constructive
criticism giving us other things to
think about because we're people we make
mistakes as well if you wanna meander
our away in terms of what type of
production we can do to satisfy your
eyeballs and also whatever is fun for us
to do and on that note make sure to
check out the list of videos that I've
compiled from 2017 that were my favorite
the ones that I'm really the most proud
of
and I think you guys should check out
perhaps if you missed them along the
year I mean it's been a busy one
wondering how to fix a boring fan
check out halos RGB they are super slim
fan frames that light up your blades of
any shade
come on 120 and 140 member sizes to fit
any fan and a control through your
motherboard or your fan text case
available in beautiful aluminum or
simple plastic it's time to halos your
build outline what matters and so on
behalf of the entire Harbor Canucks team
thank you so much for watching make sure
to subscribe and watch this other
relevant content we'll see you in the
new year and yeah check out the
description for a bunch of awesome
things for you to read check out and
perhaps get in touch with us about that
