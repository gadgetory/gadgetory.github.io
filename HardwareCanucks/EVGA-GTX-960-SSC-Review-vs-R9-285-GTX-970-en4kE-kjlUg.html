great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with hurric
Knox and welcome to another video review
today we've got something exciting today
we're taking a look at the latest
Maxwell GPU from Nvidia this is the gtx
960
and if we take a step back to review
what Maxwell architecture has delivered
is incredible performance per watt and
the GTX 960 is continuing that trend
with a TDP of only 120 watts and to put
that in perspective the r9 285 the
closest aim the GPU in performance and
price has a TDP of 190 watts
while the GTX 980 invidious current
flagship card is rated at only a hundred
sixty five watts this has to be
mentioned because power efficiency of
Maxwell architecture is totally
outstanding and AMD is slightly lagging
behind pricing wise we are looking at
$199 for the release of the GTX 960
would just slight markups for their port
partners this is right in line with aim
these offerings of the r9 285 and even
the 280x
that if you are just after pure raw
performance it's an excellent competitor
the EVGA gtx 960 super super clocked the
card that we have here today is a $10
premium due to its a CX 2.0 cooler it
comes factory overclocked at 1279
megahertz on the core with 1342 boost
clock that is 17 percent higher than the
base clock on the reference card and
this leaves a ton of headroom for
overclocking and that makes us happy it
ships with 1024 cuda cores and eight
streaming multi processing units 2
gigabytes of gddr5 memory on a 128-bit
bus and really aimed at hitting that
sweet spot for 1080p gaming at an
attractive price point it still carries
over all the features that were
introduced with GTX 980 like MF AAA
which is multi frame sampled a a dynamic
super resolution there are text 12 G
sync support GeForce experience a new
h.265 encoder and a decoder and it can
output for 4k displays simultaneously
from a single card for display output on
our EVGA super super clocked we're
looking at a total of 3 DisplayPort 1.2
HDMI and dual link DVI EVGA has added
the memory mosfet cooling plate you can
see it right above the PCB that actually
helps to lower temperatures of both the
memory and MOSFETs a backplate though is
not included on this car
but the black PCB is still stealthy
enough
speaking of cooling the a CX 2.0 is
somewhat of an attractive cooler you've
got dual 8mm or double ball-bearing fans
and the aluminum heatsink with three
eight millimeter heat pipes that run
across the card and the heat pipes are
not bent allowing more efficient cooling
the reference gtx 960 runs off a single
six pin power but with the added
headroom for overclocking the super
super clocked 960 requires an 8 pin for
power and i want to mention that it is
closer to the center it slightly offset
and is no longer at the edge of the card
like you normally see and one really
awesome feature of the super super clock
960 is the quick switch dual BIOS it's
right behind the eight pin power when
it's in the left spot the fans don't
spin at all so the card runs completely
silent until the GPU goes over 60
degrees Celsius this is actually a
brilliant feature to reduce the
operational noise of the card perfect
for home theater pcs plus in some games
the fans don't even kick in because the
card does not reach 60 degrees Celsius
the right spot for the BIOS is the
performance by us with a specific fan
curve to spend and the lowest rpm
possible when at idle and with that out
of the way let's see exactly how the
EVGA gtx 960 super super clocked a CX
2.0 performs
now one thing to keep in mind is our r9
285 do Lex from sapphire is also factory
overclocked that would introduce about
plus or minus 5% in performance compared
to the reference r9 285 looking at pure
performance numbers it's pretty much
next to neck with the r9 285 although it
is lagging slightly behind the dual X
even when overclocked I was able to
reach stable speeds of 1555 megahertz on
the core with only a marginal
performance gain compared to the 25 to
LX moving on to temperatures 31 degrees
at idle is outstanding especially
considering the fan wasn't even spinning
72 degrees Celsius at load is still
super fine considering the thermal
threshold of this card is 95 C at the
end of the day Nvidia is here to move
volumes and this is their best chance
targeting this price point in such
excellent performance per watt users
will appreciate the low power draw cool
operation literally silent performance
until 60 degrees Celsius and all the
added values like mfa a dynamic super
resolution and gsync support when
looking at pure performance numbers the
r9 285 from sapphire this is the dual
exhibition puts on quite the fight but
at the significantly higher TDP and of
course also slightly higher price point
but the latest on the GPU will have the
surplus support for upcoming freesync of
course mantle is their virtual super
resolution through audio and gaming
evolve if you main purpose is 1080p
gaming and Ori perhaps you're looking to
upgrade from your GTX 560 667 60 then
the GTX 960 is right in your valley
especially a $10 premium for the EVGA
gtx 960 super super clock a CX 2.0 is
totally worth it on with the reference
card given all the added features well
that concludes this review let us know
which side you are inclined to take
given the competition has sort of
leveled off but for you gtx 960 or the
r9 285 let us know in the comment below
