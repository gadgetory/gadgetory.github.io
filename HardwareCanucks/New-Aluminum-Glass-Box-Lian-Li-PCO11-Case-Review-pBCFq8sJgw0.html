today we're reviewing something with
class yet another absolutely stunning
aluminum enclosure from Leon Lee for
those who like semper glass clean
corners don't mind the absolute
nightmare dealing with brushed aluminum
unless you have some silica gloves and
are prepared to name your build as the
case model is typically unattractive
labeled as the PCO 11 w X let's see if
this 2017 relief is worth the cash and
figure out exactly who this case is for
right after this
introducing the new odv X 500 all state
drives from Toshiba it offers great
well-balanced speeds build with mlc nand
flash for superior endurance and is also
backed by five years advanced warranty
program learn more about the VX 500 at
OTG com
so the O 11 is a double wide case
separating the hardware for a cleaner
system in which the main compartment is
beautifully revealed through the glass
front and side panels that have a warmer
orange eat into them just keep that in
mind
but one thing really needs to improve on
is the glass Mouse it utilizes the four
thumb screws which is pretty standard
but the lip at the bottom is the only
surface holding the panel in position so
while mounting it on and off it can
easily slip off and potentially break or
you'll fall off the table or something
so be very careful with it the front
panel on the other hand is held in with
two thumb screws only and slides behind
this aluminum piece for support from the
other side which can also be removed
with ease the frame is fully squared off
even at the bottom which helps to
deliver this unique character but having
no open area with the case feet made
this one of the most difficult cases to
move around one because I don't really
want to touch the aluminum or glass too
much because that will require cleaning
right after so perhaps traditional case
feet would have been more functional
especially since you need to fully tilt
the case to one side in order to access
the large filter the i/o is minimal
perhaps to avoid complicating the design
with a slim rear chamber thanks to the
rotated power supply but this means the
four rear exhaust
only 80 millimeter fans are supported
and it's a weirdly interesting
compromise going extra wide on the frame
yet eliminating traditional 120mm
exhaust mounts for the rear and airflow
in general here is a bit unusual having
no real fun painting because you know to
the piece of glass there so to fully
utilize this open interior it's meant to
hold a 360 rod at the top and also the
bottom for this elegant showpiece system
which would be the primary targets for
this case but again interestingly only
120 mil amounts are available at the top
and bottom covered with filters and
instead of having mounting strips for
best flexibility the mouths are pretty
locked so for example you won't be able
to mount a 240 millimeter closer to the
center or some symmetrical looks unless
you go for it 360 rods at the top the
bottom pole is the same concept and I
don't understand why Liam Lee decided to
eliminate any 140 member mounts
there's clearly enough space for them
but there's a pump bracket included with
only two default mounting positions
right at the front of the case which has
to be removed if you are installing the
included fan bracket and the front and
so on one hand this bracket has the
potential to deliver extra airflow and
give you build some visuals but the
intake vents are pretty closed off on
the side and my temperature test only
resulted in one degree Celsius
difference across my components which is
not significant I do love the tulip
nature of all the exterior panels with
these small extensions for easy handling
and quality pegs for secure mounts
there's a dust filter behind the power
supply area and in this chamber all we
find there are two Drive cages that are
easily removable and they cover two
rubber grommets by the way there is
facing the Lodi Drive cage to route the
cables no problem but total storage
capacity is a business appointee to say
the least
with only two or three and a half inch
drive mounts and a single SSD per cage
it might be fine but the amount of
physical space is occupied on the rear
chamber feels a little bit inefficient
before starting with the assembly tow I
did notice just how wobbly the frame
structure was without the exterior
panels installed this is very unusual
given the aluminum frame is held in with
screws none of which were loose I did
double-check the motherboard stand-ups
are pre-installed but it's missing that
longer one in the middle that caches the
motherboards not a big deal but they
should become the standard now what I
find really interesting on
here are these modular cable routing
plates below and above the motherboard
so they like to open up some channels
for cables or tubing also nova rubber
grommets are provided to use if they are
open more cases should use this modular
system that is quite handy but come on
one step forward and two steps back as
the openings below the motherboard are
just way too down and the cutouts on the
side of the motherboard are just so far
away maybe this to accommodate the 1%
with the excel motherboards but then we
already have those two columns of
cutouts so why not space them out so at
least to provide the necessary framework
for cleaner cable management regardless
of your motherboard size which brings me
through this optional hilarious as the z
mount on the rear wall I appreciate the
thought but when it comes to cable
routing there's absolutely no way you
can use standard SATA cables because
there they're not long enough to be
routed through the back chamber so I'm
not confused as to how and why one would
utilize this SSD point and look I
realized there's a lot of modding
potential with the O 11 and enough space
to both the top and bottom for
comfortable water loops but I think the
layout of a case should be first
designed to you know accommodate a more
traditional system that establishes a
good foundation for more enthusiasm and
it baffles me just how the rubber
grommets are spaced out the lack of any
flexibility for fan mounts that is to
move your fans like on the rail system
the back chamber is greatly
underutilized both in cable management
department and layout there's not a
single cable tie hoop in here and all
this space above the power supply is
just space but you know maybe that's the
point it's sort of open to allow
creative imagination to work its magic
when it comes to like enthusiast systems
but you are sure paying the premium
because it's really not because it's
some innovative internal frame design I
do love these modular cable cut outs and
the case is gorgeous it's got potential
but you definitely gotta work for it
thanks for watching we'll see you in the
