brought to you by and CIX
technology connected okay so CES seems
to be all about moving giving us 4k
giving us high-resolution displays and
we've seen here some of the very common
trend is giving us those high-resolution
displays with massive sizes at the very
at the fraction of the cost of what we
were able to get about a year ago and so
what we are here now we're at thank you
and we're checking out their very
interesting very something that I
personally would be interested in this
is their 32 inch monitor this is the BL
3200 P T as you can see it's a 32 inch
widescreen LD monitor using the 1440p
resolution so giving us that still
acceptable resolution for all your type
of productivity work and all that so the
actual panel here is on a hv8 which
delivers you with great viewing angles I
know it's kind of difficult to show you
exactly how far you can see but you guys
can trust me
vert side to side viewing is absolutely
not an issue and actually top to bottom
viewing angles are really nice so if you
do want to sort of angle the monitor
towards you that would be an issue at
all so this is a 32 inch panel right so
very very impressive you do have an
adjustable arm for your height it does
have a swivel and there's a lot of
features this is designed for that
professional CAD work or just that could
be used for that but also for anybody
who is sort of my field that really want
that real estate so one of the features
they incorporate is these is this Auto
pivot mode which means if you pivot the
screen to you know if you put it into
portrait mode
it's gonna actually automatically rotate
the screen you don't have to go into
your settings you have to rotate
anything this is an automatic feature
and we like it
now turning this back around it also has
navigation controls so it has its own
remote that isn't it goes into the base
of the monitor in case you use this a
lot so it does it's not just on your
desk anywhere it actually has a
dedicated place so with this you can
control your menu but the menus also be
able controlled with capacity
button is built into the the right side
at the bottom here so that's very good
to see in case you don't want this wire
that's what I told him that I
potentially wanted to see this built
into the base but they said you can
remove this with a cable if you don't
you if you're not using it another thing
is that this is a 10 bit panel so color
accuracy and the sort of the amount of
colors that you can do this is going to
be very good panel also for color
editing and color grading so any type of
color work any type of massive real
estate work because of this massive size
and obviously the resolution the 1440p
at this form factor is very nice you do
have a slightly larger pixel than what
we used to it like 27 inch panels but
for massive real estate this is this is
totally perfect now of course the
selling point is the price right so the
price is under the embargo it's not
exactly we can give you the details but
it's not gone it's going to be under
$1,000 but wait for it you know it's
gonna be it's not like 99999 this is
going to be under estimated about under
$800 so that is a huge thumbs up for
Bank you guys I want you all to like
this video because if you are like me
and you want that high resolution
display for that massive real estate
work this is the 3200 PT from Bank you
so let's go ahead and check out what
they else they have here at Bank UCS
2014
