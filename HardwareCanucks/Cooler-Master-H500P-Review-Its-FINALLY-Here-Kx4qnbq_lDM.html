for four months and it's finally time
let's unbox it is the new H 500 P very
excited about it because it's the
continuation of the half series or the
high airflow so let's see if this thing
is any good accessory box I like that
they come in bags now it's good Wow so
this thing is absolutely beautiful
despite having so much plastic they made
it feel and look premium and that's an
awesome thing but you know what I'm a
little bit disappointed that the half
series is no longer revived now we're
stuck with H series so let's see how
they did shall we
right after this
what inside the view 31 you should put a
ring on it yes time to make it hard to
be official
there will take ring high static
pressure fans because your case deserves
a ring full details in description below
alright so this is the beautiful new
airflow focused case the H 500 P priced
at 149 it's available in only one color
the metal gray that I absolutely love we
have a couple of 200 millimeter RGB fans
at the front they do all the heavy
airflow lifting and there's a tempered
glass side panel as well with an elegant
mount that you can open would just you
nail a coin or some other slim object
now I think there are many features on
this one that will see spread through
the case industry so really glad to see
Coolermaster setting examples once again
now I want to start with the exterior
that like I said earlier feels and looks
awesome the front and top panels are
fully plastic so they reduced the weight
but the color uniformity is fantastic
between the metal and the plastic and
unless you're touching the surface you
can't even tell that that's transparent
plastic and not glass it looks like
clear glass both at the front and the
top although while convenient neither
are secured by anything so removing the
top is super simple you simply pull it
off and we can't ignore that unpleasant
sound the plastic is flexible it
scratches easily and I'm not sure why
the top is fully transparent also here
the fan bracket is awesome with flexible
mounting strips so you'll definitely
want to utilize this area for radiator
or fans so my 360 rad fits the stick 280
millimeter EK radiator fits as well and
even triple 140 mm lot of fans will fit
into this bracket which by the way is
symmetrical so you can rotate it after
mounting your hardware on it if needed
and we have about 70 millimeters until
the rear fan so clearance is plenty both
panels are pretty deep to allow airflow
to enter or exit with mesh built in to
catch the dust but just be prepared for
routine maintenance to keep that plastic
clear I was surprised to find a gap on
the front panel on both sides that will
surely contribute to interior dust
buildup the front panel has a two-step
mount that is also easily removable and
here we find those giant 200 number of
fans that intake air from the sides and
I'm curious to see how the interior of
that plastic window will look like after
a few weeks but it is this way so the
fans act as the lighting centerpiece and
I wish that the assembly line took
stur care with those center black
stickers because they are misaligned on
both fans and that makes them look like
they're wobbling it's really distracting
and takes away from that gorgeous RGB
illumination that by the way is not
controlled through the i/o like I was
expecting as you can see we only have
USB no type-c and fortunately audio
jacks and power reset buttons with the
main power button feeling slightly
wobbly but we'll tasteful outer glow so
instead to control the fan lighting we
have a four pin RGB connector that's
quite common the motherboards so the
user has the full control of the
lighting and you can also link other LED
strips or potentially other fans since
we have an additional four pin plug as
part of that cable bundle so faint
illumination is quite nice they are
bright in the middle would spill into
the blades and this way you can color
match to other Hardware set whatever
lighting effects and not really worry
about pre-loaded color presets or
effects that might not match your
hardware and I think this is the way
forward for built-in illumination since
most recent motherboards and include the
4 pin RGB connector and if you don't
know fan lighting for you and there's
also a 141 that exhaust fan included
also the front fans are a little bit
loud obviously you can lower the RPM
through the motherboard but this way the
airflow is pretty weak and it doesn't
help they're installed outside of the
frame so half of that ventilation area
on the sides is behind the fan both side
panels have a two step removal process
when they anger off the bottom rail and
can be lifted off after with capital
thumb screws included on the right side
panel as you can see the interior is a
bit different from the master case
series and that the module rail to the
right of the motherboard is no longer
there so you cannot install drive gauges
or other accessories like we see on this
mastercase 5 t instead this area is now
occupied by this metal shroud cover that
is supposed to cover up the cables
exiting from behind it but it's only
used for ei TX motherboards as otherwise
you'll obviously just use the rubber
grommets and round the cables through
that I find it odd that this bracket has
no reservoir mounting holes in case you
decide to work cool so perhaps they are
targeting this for air cooling systems
only I do like that we have vertical PCI
slots that can be used with optional GPU
bracket to show off your graphics card
through that one
now the power supply shroud is a dual
piece design with two SSD caddies on top
and notice there are no cutout openings
anywhere aside from underneath the
motherboard and behind those SSD caddies
removing the first shroud gets us access
to the drive cage with dual caddies
underneath it that can be moved away
from the front to make room for a
radiator and we have additional 60
millimetres of clearance in that case
but then installing back the shroud
it doesn't fit unless you remove the
closest SSD caddy I don't like this
compromise at all even though we have an
additional SSD mounts behind the
motherboard tray for relocation
furthermore it appears that we have
three mounting locations for the drive
cage but only to secure points at the
front so this entire basement feels
rushed and not exactly refined
especially since we need to remove the
second shroud piece and that's an
additional five screws to install the
power supply which has a dust filter and
so that's good on the other side notice
there are two more covers a plastic
plate that sits over the CPU cutout that
I find a little bit pointless since the
side of the case is closed anyway but
you can stuff cables inside of it so
that's good but the larger front metal
cover in theory needs to hide all those
cables entering into the other side but
notice the spacing and how close it is
to the actual frame this means that we
can only route cables from underneath
and this makes cable work a bit more
difficult and then it needs to be now I
do appreciate all the modular panels
where everything is kind of removed we
get this bare-bones frame but they need
to do something about the mounting as a
screwdriver is definitely needed
but at least it's all the same screw for
everything now I haven't talked about
the front airflow options because if you
swap out those fans then what's the
point really but you can install a 360
rat at the front without removing the
200 millimeter fans so we have plenty of
clearance from the top but notice this
frame has a top section cut out for
fighting the quarter inch drive base and
therefore this bracket is included for
front top fan installation on my unit
the mounting holes are misaligned so I
wouldn't be able to secure the top
portion of the fan if I went that route
and this is clearly the cause of reusing
the frame that has not gone through this
strict refinement process and that's
unfortunate
I keep using the lack of refinement with
cooler master cases but you know
that's the way it is for some reason so
now all right so this is the interior
it's super clean that's expected with
all the paneling is installed the cutout
on the power supply shroud could be
expanded slightly it's already a little
bit crowded and I haven't even routed
the SSDs and this front cover is a
little bit bare since nothing can be
installed on it so I'm thinking this
case doesn't really need to be this long
on the other side getting that large
panel in place took some force I really
wish that it was more open to make
routing easier but this is one of those
things that I hope to see on more cases
to me this looks better than even
installing that solid side panel and
depending maybe on your color scheme you
can highlight some sleeved cables here
and everything is already flat and
really adds to the character of the H
500p the only thing missing is some form
of cover near the power supply area so
you can have that full industrial
exposed look and finally putting the
glass on the H 500 P is bring back
airflow focus trends with some excellent
paneling direction that needs some
refinement but let's leave that to the
competition because this open frame
concept is pretty unique and I can't
wait to see more venue coarser avoid pro
gaming headset is comfortable stylish in
different colors delivers fantastic
wireless performance even for
competitive gaming with an all-new
microphone for clear communications
check out the void Pro Wireless or wired
in the description below so coolermaster
here again demonstrated forward-thinking
with four pin RGB connectors for those
fans rear paneling is awesome the
visuals are fantastic but you know what
that lacks refinement in the shroud
design stickers on the fans are
misaligned interior panels need more
function front fan bracket on my unit is
misaligned
and the plastic exterior panels need to
be more rigid and so that's all I have
to say about the new half I'm both
excited about this new feature roll out
but I'm a bit disappointed
their implementation and their
refinement hopefully we'll see more
similar things from cluemaster really
soon and maybe something from the
competition as well but let me know what
you think about the New Age 500 T the
