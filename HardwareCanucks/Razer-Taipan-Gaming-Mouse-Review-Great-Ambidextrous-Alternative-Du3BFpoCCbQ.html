great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Eva with harmonics and
we received many requests to review some
gaming peripherals from Razer as they've
established a reputation as a strong
gaming brand with excellent name
recognition in the industry but with
going strength of the competition from
coolermaster horse-hair logitech and
many others it'll be interesting to see
how razer adapts to the diminishing size
of their market share so this is the
Razer Taipan and $80.00 ambidextrous
gaming mouse and a $10 premium for the
white version the symmetrical body does
land itself nicely for left hand users
while not limiting white hand operation
if you like the ambidextrous form the
rubberized grip on both sides helped to
secure a tighter hold for your thumb
plus a slight rounded it just allow the
thumb to rest comfortably in place
overall the ergonomics are fine
considering the symmetrical body the top
matte coating is anti-slip but compared
to the AV or 7000 from my onyx that is
my daily driver the Taipan falls short
with how the coating actually feels it
also seems to wear out quickly with the
surfaces that makes the most contact the
build quality of the type hand feels
great and only 95 grams the mouse does
feel light and it's all saying
well-balanced weight distribution lack
of a customizable weight system was a
disappointing factor especially when you
consider the price point at a poun feet
at the bottom of the mouse complement a
smooth glide and I didn't notice any
signs of peeling great the Taipan is
equipped with the 8200 dpi Avago laser
sensor and from our experience there is
a noticeable difference in tracking
between optical and laser mics comparing
tracking between the Taipan and a viewer
mouse at the same dpi levels the razer
mouse has a less precise tracking at
below 2000 dpi while prude more
comparable to the optical sensor on the
a viewer at higher sensitivities and
we'd suggest sticking to the sensor that
you feel most comfortable with there are
9 programmable buttons on the type and
the left and right primary switches do
provide excellent tactile response with
perfect travel times Razer is also known
for their pleasant switches sound
they are not as loud as some competing
offerings so let's take a listen the
scrollwheel unfortunately is difficult
to press with very weak scroll steps
that are easy you activate for example
every time I try to press the scroll you
unintentionally scroll down the page or
switch weapons during games it is really
disappointing to see such a terrible
scroll wheel on a gaming mouse that is
apparently designed by gamers not
impressed the DPI shaped buttons are
located right behind the scroll wheel
that are easy to reach and the two side
buttons on both the left and right side
provide smooth travel time with great
tactile activations for left hand users
the buttons on the right side are
perfect but the two opposite buttons are
a bit awkward to reach unless you
reattach your grip every time so this is
a great design to accommodate for left
hand operation but the two buttons on
the opposite side will yield useless
regardless of what hand you are using
the cable is braided and it comes with
proper logo on the tip to help
differentiate between other cables that
you may have plugged in the illuminated
portion here are subtle and invasive
style with green logo up top and an
internal illumination of the scroll
wheel you cannot change the color and
the only adjustment is a breathing
effect or turn the illumination
completely off it is limiting but it
looks like razer has taken a step back
with the less is enough approach with
the Taipan to color match your
accessories Razer has the RGB line of
peripherals that seemed to cover that
element quite well
the driver software is done very well
with Razer synapse 2.0 that can detect
all your Razer gaming peripherals we are
greeted with the customized tab where
you can store up to 12 profiles but the
lack of access to them from the mouse
makes it inconvenient as you always need
to have access to the software in order
to change your profiles on the right
hand side you have a physical layout of
the
with five different programmable buttons
and the left hand whites I'd have the
two extra buttons that you can customize
to your preference the performance tab
essentially helps you adjust the DPI
settings along with the pointer
acceleration and the option to change
the polling rate the LED lighting tab
allows you to turn the LED light on or
off the calibration tab helps you to
calibrate the mouse to your surface that
you're using and the option to record
macros and store them on the
microprocessor that's built inside the
mouse is also available which might come
in handy especially for game plays and
you don't have to run the software in
the background so in conclusion the
Razer Taipan did impress me with its
excellent build quality and ergonomics
particularly for left hand users which
is a major bonus plus a well balanced
weight structure all of the seven
programmable buttons do provide
excellent tactile response on-the-fly
deep Ashis was a great feature that was
included and the driver software was
easy to use however I didn't like the
matte coating on the surface of the
mouse that didn't feel premium adding a
few grams would have been nice for those
who prefer a heavier mice and the lack
of customizable LEDs while a minor
drawback was still a disadvantage
considering the price point so at the
end of the day if you're looking for a
mouse that just plain out works and if
you are a Razer fan then I guess the
Taipan would not disappoint especially
as this is one of the few ambidextrous
mice that covers the ergonomic element
properly but we can't help to recommend
to explore alternatives like the my onyx
AV or 7000 that's rocking an optical
sensor but what do you guys think about
the Razer Taipan do you think it's worth
the eighty plus dollar investment let us
