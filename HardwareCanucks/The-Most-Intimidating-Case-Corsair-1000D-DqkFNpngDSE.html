was a case that arrived back in January
so right after CSI received this massive
box and we can finally do something
together with it shall we
hi Fred it is this my friends the
Corsair obsidian 1000d and so this thing
has literally become a piece of
furniture for my hallway I'm gonna
finally take it out no joke when this
thing was delivered the FedEx guy told
me he had a hernia surgery next week I
laughed because I thought he was kidding
I'm such a jerk
yeah this thing is heavy so this
definitely needs two people to carry and
potentially a set forth apartment too
maybe I'll use a bigger desk too
man this is huge it really is like
unboxing a piece of furniture so these
are side panels I can feel it right
underneath here oh yeah
and now it somehow we need to remove the
cardboard
need more light Wow
now that is a monster so it is slimmer
from what I remember at Computex but I'm
guessing that's a good thing you know
they slimmed down the frame a little bit
while it still accommodates dual systems
and crazy amount of water cooling should
be fun now normally I don't like
gigantic enclosures I prefer small
compact simple ATX systems but I feel
like for this one we're definitely gonna
have to do something special but first
let's see what makes to 1,000 be so
unique right after this the new master
keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic wrist rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection cooler master
doing it right check it out below
alright so the Obsidian 1000 d is like
on a whole other level of a case it's
not particularly for me but I appreciate
what it can do
it's pretty clear that this case is
designed for water-cooling builds only
and I think it's there to directly
compete against the fantex
elite as they're roughly the same size
and support a dual system and the dual
power supply configuration it's a huge
case here's me for size reference
they've really not held anything back
for radiator clearance so I think it
should be pretty clear who the target
audience is and why this case exists I
do want to say the build quality in the
1,000 is actually a pretty spectacular
despite the entire frame being out of
Steel you know nothing creaks and it
doesn't feel cheap when I'm handling the
case it is incredibly heavy so I
definitely just keep that in mind and
have your back ready for when you need
to work inside something like this but
build quality no complaints or any red
flags throughout my experience with it
as with previous obsidian cases I
appreciate that it doesn't have branding
all over the place the front glass is
spaced out for that unrestrictive
airflow and the Corsair logo is hidden
behind the dust filter that illuminates
once you power on the system it's an
elegant case and I feel that Corsair has
an advantage with the price at $4.99
almost half that of the fantex elite and
their approach to simplify the frame to
make installation of Hardware easier is
actually pretty awesome on all levels
so that means we have easily removable
gigantic dust filters at the front and
the top they slide out and they're also
magnetic plus the mesh is super fine but
I really like their approach to fan
brackets that sit on Rails slide fully
out of the case to make mounting easy
both of the front and the top by default
we have a 120 mount times 8 bracket at
the front and the 140 mount times 3 for
the top and they are interchangeable
since the sliding mechanism is identical
and there's also the secure flap to
prevent the rails from sliding out now
I'm not sure of having a 140 mount only
at the top is a good default
configuration perhaps if the bracket was
interchangeable with 120 and 140 Miller
amounts it would eliminate any
incompatibility with your choice of
radiator but you can purchase additional
brackets for 120 sizes and there's even
a bracket for dual 200 millimeter fans
and for rear exhaust we have a dual
120mm mount because the height of the
case allows for that many fans just keep
in mind the 240 right here is not
possible because the rail closes off
that clearance actually I take that back
you can mount a 240 rod in this rear
section but only with the tubes at the
bottom so right now if I line the holes
here we have the radiator making
clearance right below the bracket so
there are no issues but only if the
tubes are sticking from the bottom now
I'm going to need your suggestions as
what type of system I should build
inside the 1000 D and I'm not really a
water cooling enthusiast and I've only
done one water cooling system with just
a single loop for the CPU it was inside
the cooler master 693 that was a fun
build but you know the 1,000 he really
does inspire me to do something special
and go back to the the water cooling
days to see what we can do with this
giant case wow that rhymed and I will be
approaching it from my dual system
configuration and we'll see that makes
sense and yeah should be interesting
coming inside the motherboard tray is
well equipped for a ATX motherboards and
beyond
there are standoffs already
pre-installed there's a second row of
rubber grommets and this multi mount
ventilation looking area for reservoirs
we have additional rubber grommet
above the motherboard tray and overall
this is an extremely open layout with
about five-and-a-half inches of
clearance above them on the board and
five inches from the front bracket till
the hard drive cage so it's a bit
surprising to me that the second ITX
mount is right below the main
motherboard that means you'll need to
water cool that one also or use a low
profile cooler to avoid any clearance
issues and to keep the frame pretty slim
we have our main ATX power supply
alongside and sfx L power supply in the
third chamber for that second system so
for that second power supply mount you
have to remove this little piece here
that allows the ITX motherboard
installation so it makes sense you only
remove it if you need to install the
second system so here it is your SFX L
mount sits nicely secured here with low
ventilation area but notice this check
this out the side panel doesn't close
because of this bottom SSD mount which
you can relocate to the top here so
there are four positions but otherwise
it closes just fine
the main IO includes four USB 3 and dual
type C Gen 2 ports plus the power and
reset for one of the systems while the
other set of power reset connections is
located in an awkward spot behind the
case I don't know if the separation
makes sense I've never owned the dual
config before but just having two power
buttons right at the front would be
definitely more convenient now the rear
chamber is actually pretty clever and
that these French doors completely
conceal your cables and storage area so
when the glass panel is on you don't
have to worry about loose cables or the
panel not closing properly in total we
have 6 SSD caddies on these French doors
and the conventional drive cage with
five vertical caddies plus the courser
command the pro which is necessary for
case of this caliber it has six PWM fan
headers to USB motherwort pass throughs
and optional LED connections for the
lighting of the note pro now I'm pretty
happy they did not include any fans
because for a case of this caliber any
builder will use their own but I was
hoping that we would see a second
commander Pro and this way you'll be
able to connect the minimum of 12 fans
instead of 6 for case that can support
up to 20 and so the corsair commander
pro is super important here because it
is your fan controller
it is your lighting controller it allows
other USB accessories to pass through it
so it doesn't have to buy USB headers on
your motherboard and you control all
that through the corsair software so
it's a nice little hub for control in
fact that the only include one here may
not be a disadvantage because you can
use fan splitters and connect at least
12 fans in here and i know for their
like overkill system that they've
showcased at like at shows they used for
command the pros to connect all those
fans and so that's something to keep in
mind for a case of this caliber it's
good that it's included because it does
nudge you into this direction to
potentially purchase more of these also
the drive cage is non removable unless
you Dremel out rivets and I assume
wiring the SSD caddies will introduce
its own set of challenges based on their
orientation as for the side panels
they're just a giant slab of glass with
aluminum front and back I appreciate
that there are off the case during
shipment so handling the frame is much
easier because it's lighter but keep in
mind the tint is quite dark and
illumination is necessary to reveal
anything behind it and also because
they're quite heavy opening them up may
tilt the entire enclosure if it's empty
so keep that in mind for safety and just
for fun before we journey out into
building an epic system in here I'm
quite nervous doing like a water cooling
build you know going from zero to
something like that I installed an ATX
motherboard just to give you a reference
point at how big that interior is we
have so much space above and in front of
the motherboard for thick radiators and
post pool so that should be fine so I'm
thinking X 299 for the main ATX
motherboard and a gaming ITX system with
like coffee like CPU and I am happy to
say that there is a rubber grommet
behind the ITX motherboard for all your
connections and cabling should be pretty
clean job for cable management now for
water cooling enthusiasts they would
absolutely appreciate all this
additional space above the motherboard
tray to me it's a bit strange to see a
45 million radiator with a set of fans
and then yet have so much extra
clearance above the motherboard but this
entire area is intended for push-pull
with thicker 60ml
for sure all right people so what do you
think of the Obsidian 1000 d for $4.99
is that a good price to pay for the case
of this calibre I'm not exactly sure
I've never done builds like this but
there's definitely cheaper than the fan
Tech's elite and I would say it's in
competition with what Thermaltake offers
with their gigantic enclosures too
specifically for water cooling so wish
me luck the second phase of this entire
project is just beginning I'm excited to
share my journey along the way yeah let
me know what you think of this case in
