hurricane accent today we've got another
product from ergo tech who specialized
in monitor stands arms and they also
have some mobile stands as well
now we're releasing the review their
basic dual monitor desk stand so make
sure to check that out if you're
interested but on the review table today
is the freedom arm that looks like a
perfect solution for a clamp style
alternative instead of using the default
support that comes with your monitor
this will set you back around 100
dollars it seems like an excellent value
for the flexibility that you get the
freedom arm comes well packaged we have
just the two main pieces so assembling
is super easy plus there's some
accessories for mounting including an
allen key an adjustment wrench different
size and length screws five and 10
millimeter spacers that are super useful
and a few other pieces that are needed
for installation now I have to say that
both the base station and the arm itself
feel incredibly solid with aluminum and
steel construction and I would give my
full confidence in one of these holding
some expensive panels this is a clamp
type mount meaning you don't need to
have anything pre-drilled on your desk
it is using a heavy-duty knob that's
large enough for manual operation and
you simply tighten it based on the
thickness of your desk you can also
change the location of the knob as there
are three mounts available so desks up
to 55 millimeters thick are supported
while you can go even as little as 5
millimeters of spacing each end of the
clamp is properly padded as well with
large rubber bits on the base and some
foam on the bottom support to prevent
scratching the surface and allow a more
secure hold the main support pole is
removable as well in case you need the
replacement and that's one thing that
every tag does really well
allowing compatibility and expandability
from these basic systems for example you
can install a dual monitor arm on this
pole no problem and moving on to the arm
it is covered in metallic silver that
looks great and also feels really solid
with quality joints there is a large
spring inside the arm that controls
vertical resistance and there's also
cable management system in place with a
few hooks allowing very convenient
routing that doesn't affect flexibility
the vast amount at the end does not use
a quick
the system like we saw on their desk
stand but that's okay it's very simple
to install anyway it features standard
75 and 100 millimeter mounting holes
monitors up to 27 inches are supported
with 18 pounds maximum weight capacity
air codec also offers both PC and Mac
versions for this arm and to set up the
freedom arm and manual is included with
the parts list to double check you're
not missing anything and first we mount
the arm onto the monitor by design the
mount might not fit into many inserts
like you see here but that's why the
spacers are included I actually ended up
using both spacers so I could properly
secure the arm with longer screws next
week tighten the base to the desk it's
as simple as that making sure the back
of the clamp is fully pressed against
the edge even from this view it looks
very clean so I'm happy with the design
next we lower the arm support block onto
the pole and using an allen key and a
screw to secure it to the pole and this
will act as a height adjustment for the
arm itself giving users flexibility in
that sense but also rotational
adjustment for the arm as it sits
securely on the base block then we
insert a small metal piece followed by a
plastic axle sleeve that allows that
freedom of rotation but using an allen
key you can tighten the hold
so it doesn't rotate on the pole then
you simply slide the arm onto the base
and this is basically it depending on
the weight of your monitor you might
also need to type in the spring using an
adjustment wrench and this amplifies the
resistance on the angle of the arm so it
properly supports the monitor and once
everything is in place there's just so
much flexibility with positioning with
full rotation and more rotation for the
upper portion as well then there's the
height adjustment with a type of low
mode for the arm there's a full 90
degree swivel for our 24-inch display
without modifying the position of the
arm itself and the best amount is really
versatile with 360 degree rotation and
you can even go in this horizontal mode
with the panel so that's pretty
impressive one thing is that you cannot
adjust the tightness of the VESA mount
but from our experience it proves very
reliable with all the angle and rotation
when
our panel the freedom arm is named like
that for a reason and this type of
monitor movement would be impossible
with the stand included with your
monitor plus the support base is
actually impressively small compared to
the original monitor stand and here it
is next to my phone so you can get a
better idea of really how compact this
thing is now even though the curved
design means you cannot utilize this
space it's still quite elegant and
should totally fit into any environment
now I have to say every tech has done an
excellent job with the freedom arm
everything from the outstanding build
quality simplicity of assembly
incredibly small base with a sturdy
clamp system both the arm and the best
amount allows so much flexibility for
movement plus thickness adjustment for
the base clamp and the design is
expandable in nature in case you'd like
to add a second freedom arm cable
routing system is very effective and
that $100 this offers an outstanding
upgrade over the standard base included
with your monitor and really the only
gripe I have is the curved base design
that doesn't let you put anything on top
but that's just me being very very picky
overall we are very impressed with the
freedom arm from ergo tech and we're
giving it the Huracan axe damn good and
damn good value awards for an
all-encompassing freedom of movement for
your monitor and an excellent value well
