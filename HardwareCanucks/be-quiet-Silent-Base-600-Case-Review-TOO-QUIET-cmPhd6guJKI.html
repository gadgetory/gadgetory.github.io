great technology selection and service
when building a silent system we often
prioritize on the enclosure to block out
the noise of the hardware and yes the
case is an important part of this unique
quiet equation but it's the system
itself that also must be used with
appropriate components for completely
satisfactory acoustic results so here we
have the silent based 600 mid tower from
be quiet
priced at $119 for the windowed version
and $10 less for the solid side panel
this thing is competing directly with
the define r5 and I'm curious to see if
the silent based 600 will yield
satisfactory building experience since
the interior frame is based off the
silent base 800 it's bigger brother
which I remember to have some problems
starting with the design
I appreciate the consistency of color
accents which are available in orange
black and silver outlining the intake
vents on both sides of the front panel
the outskirts of the side window and on
the inside so all of the rubber pieces
are also in bright orange like the
vibration pads on the fans the hard
drive rails plus the rubber grommets
around motherboard even the power button
is in character with an orange LED and
white illumination for the other two
colors speaking of the i/o the reset
switch is built into the hard drive
activity LED nice then we have four USB
ports and centered audio jacks the front
panel is plastic and it's covered in
this very popular brushed look looks
very nice doesn't have to be cleaned as
often as aluminum it opens at 90 degrees
and is covered with sound dampening
material on the inside and also can be
swapped to be open from the other side
depending on the case orientation
there's a three speed three fan
controller here which is nicely
accessible yet hidden and a very clever
dust filter that is removable from the
top like so be quiet you gain some happy
points from us but the power supply dust
filter covers almost the entire floor
and can only be removed by sliding out
towards the back making it super
inaccessible not
coming back to the front panel though it
is incredibly difficult to remove like
seriously they should do something about
that and just shows that recycling of
frames without appropriate adjustment
grants you outdated status here we have
a 140 mm fan that is included with
support for dual 140 or 120 ml fans but
check this out you can only install fans
outside of the frame so radiators are
completely out of the question here and
why is the case frame so restrictive
when there's nothing on the interior I
really want be quiet to open up this
area and allow users to install fans on
the inside of the case for you know
radiators and such as otherwise this is
not water cooling friendly at all the
top of the frame is also just as
difficult to remove my god it's just
such a pain but it's almost completely
closed off - aside from these
ventilation strips and extra height on
the panel to allow air to exit through
the rear here the metal frame is a lot
more open than the front and can support
dual 120 or 140 mm fans inside the frame
but look at where the ventilation strips
align on the top panel meaning you can
only utilize the back slot to avoid
choking the fans or avoiding airflow
bouncing back into the case I put a 140
ml exhaust fan here and likely the
venting strips do an okay job with
letting the air flow exit but the
majority of it it's actually directed
through the higher portion of plastic
through the back thus silencing the
exhaust even further so thumbs up the
takeaway here though is this case is not
meant for any type of water cooling you
could install a 120 mil all in one at
the back but I feel traditional CPU
towers may be a better choice for
airflow since the rear fan spacing is
quite tight despite the wide overall
shape of the case now be quiet actually
have done something interesting and
unique with a side window that past my
nail scratch test for anyone wondering
and many have this understanding that
window panels don't totally fit in this
silent category but the polycarbonate in
here has dual layers making the window
portion significantly thicker with an
air gap in between the two plates and
we're told this helps to
frequently reduce the noise when
compared to just a single sheet of
polycarbonate the weird thing though is
the metal panel itself isn't coated with
any noise dampening material like the
other side panel is which I think would
have been beneficial I don't think
there's a compromise and transparency
factor but the interior layer almost
amplifies the reflection making your
hardware sort of less visible the other
side panel has noise dampening but with
the middle spacer plate that can house a
fan and opened up to let this side
breathe I don't think you should install
a fan here but I do like the design
element that it adds to an otherwise
flat panel coming inside I'm pretty
happy with the color coordination of my
orange cable mod cables and the interior
just looks awesome despite me using a
reference GPU this is the quietest
system that I've ever built thanks to
the incredibly quiet case fans and the
dark rock 3 CPU cooler now when it comes
to interior modularity it still needs
vast improvements you can reposition the
hard drive gauge into the top slot which
supports triple hard drives with this
tooless anti-vibration mount and a
single SSD on top of the drive cage but
I think I'd rather prefer standard
caddies to diversify my storage options
as the dual SSD brackets at the back
just might not cut it but my main
disappointment is with that front
portion of the frame that is both
outdated and restrictive and the same
goes for the top that would not properly
accommodate for a radiator because of a
lack of clearance it is really meant to
either remain fanless or just a single
fan at the back for the top portion for
additional airflow a fan can be
installed on the floor since it is dust
proof but ironically would be quiet its
own power supply it blokes both mounting
positions so you can't install fan there
with this power supply but the keys feet
are quite tall to potentially allow
fresh intake from their cable management
at the back is workable but
disappointing workable because the gap
is plenty wide to concentrate your
cables around the perimeter of the case
but disappointing because there are
simply not enough cable tie points
around those
key areas they do include a single
adhesive hook that I gladly utilized as
a cable tie holder at the top here but
thinking there's a fool year actually
more than a year time difference between
this and the bigger brother silent bass
800 which suffered from the exact same
limitations so this is not okay
the frame is clearly outdated despite me
being really happy with the build here
because it's so freakin quiet so let's
talk about that all right so now comes
the interesting part and testing out how
quiet the silent bass 600 really is and
subjectively to me this feels like the
choir system that I've ever built I
chose to go with an actual CPU heatsink
to eliminate the extra noises that you
generally get with all-in-one solution
so like the pump noise is quite evident
so here you know you get rid of that
having a single CPU heatsink one fan one
friend for exhaust and one for one more
top fan four exhaust as well so in total
of four fans the loudest component in
the system is actually the GPU which is
surprising to me because I always
considered 980ti is like super quiet and
all my other builds but in comparison to
the rest of the system and how silent
the fans are and the CPU heatsink is
it's actually quite incredible
so I actually had to hold my breath the
duration of that sound test because even
my breathing was being picked up by the
microphone because I turned up the gain
sensitivity on this thing super high so
you get very a clearer idea on how loud
the system is versus the ambient and
versus the three different fan profiles
and for conclusion I want to say the
silent base 600 delivers perfectly well
on what be quiet stands for and with
their own fans their own CPU cooler and
their power supply this is the quietest
machine that I've ever built but it's
the assembly process itself that is the
weakest point here totally non
user-friendly panels it lacks any sort
of potential for water cooling and just
not enough work on cable management that
loses on so many competitive points
despite being the quietest case in our
review history and that is all for today
