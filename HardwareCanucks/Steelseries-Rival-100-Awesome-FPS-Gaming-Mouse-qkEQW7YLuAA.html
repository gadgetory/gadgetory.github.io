great technology selection and service
if you're looking for a gaming mouse
upgrade that offers excellent sensor
tracking and ergonomics but don't
necessarily want to lash out a bunch of
cash at this upgrade then my friends you
have come to the right place what's up
guys I'm Dimitri with Hardware Canucks
and the steer Series rival 100 maybe the
budget Gaming Mouse to get going for
just $39 which is half the price of some
of the competing mice that offer pretty
much the exact same thing so the rival
100 in my opinion would be the
definition of bare-bones with spice
because the body is plastic and
superlight Aalto with a very pleasant
coating on the top the textured sides
feel kinda cheap because it's glossy
plastic and also slippery but if you
lift your mouse a lot the lightweight
body kind of saves the day is you don't
need a pressure grip to maneuver the
shape in my opinion is awesome but give
yourself some time to adjust
particularly because the ring finger
kind of sits on top of your pinky finger
which was an uncomfortable transition
from my my onyx castor it is a
symmetrical Mouse but I find the thinner
portions at the front and slightly wider
at the back to complement my hybrid grip
but it would also work very well for
claw grip the primary left-click is
light enough for fast presses but has a
considerable amount of travel distance
so it's not as easy to miss click the
right button however feels a stiffer
which is nice to complement abs but you
have to train the pressure point to
avoid distracting your aim the scroll
wheel is great which surprised me to
have such a nice wheel on the budget
Mouse with solid scroll steps great
texture as well on the wheel but
unfortunately with a really hard middle
click so in game it will never be used
the DPI shift button is also too far
back for comfortable reach requiring my
entire hand to shift to the right in
order to press it but I don't use a dpi
shift often and it only has two settings
which is nice to cycle between the two
settings when needed the side browser
buttons have satisfying click
registration
they're well-positioned for my thumb to
do the job so no complaints here and you
notice the illuminated scroll wheel and
the logo at the back that is RGB and
this shows that still series our own
point with the lighting demands from
gamers and while the logo isn't
consistently lit up it's such a minor
complaint that for $39 mouse I'm happy
that lighting wasn't ditched completely
and before we talk performance the cable
is non graded but it is light and non
intrusive and the Teflon feet at the
bottom Mouse offers smooth glide and
notice they are actually removable for
future replacements although no
additional feet are included with the
rival 100 but before a jump at this
year's go and show you what this sensor
is capable of the sensor is actually
very good it is an optical sensor that
is firing off a red LED so you need a
dark surface map
nothing glossy nothing white will work
here so you either want a fabric matte
plastic mark and mats also work well and
I prefer to use the aluminum pad from in
wind which gives me the best tracking
performance you want pretty much any
mice that I've used and so after getting
comfortable with the grip and button
pressure the results speak for
themselves
there's no acceleration and I could
actually see myself replacing my my onyx
caster with the rival 100 but there's
one major problem with the rival 100
that is most likely on purpose for
SteelSeries to sacrifice these elements
to add value to their higher end mice
and that is the limitation of certain
key elements of the driver software now
I love what steel series has done with
the engine 3 software as the UI looks
beautiful and simple to navigate with
easy button remapping and color
configuration but when it comes to CPI
adjustment the increments are in 250 CPI
so you cannot nail down your preferred
CPI and I think 250 increments are just
way too large plus there is no lift off
distance adjustment and that is a
crucial element for any current gaming
mouse and they say this because my play
style revolves around lifting the mouse
because I don't move it too
much on the mouse mat and therefore the
sensor starts to track about one
centimeter off the surface so when I
lift off the mouse and when I start to
descend at one centimeter off the
surface the sensor starts to pick up any
tracking and therefore as you almost
nailed down to the surface the cursor
will either move into whatever direction
and that's not good because my aim will
be constantly off and I have to readjust
my playstyle in order to actually use
this mouse properly so with any other
previous gaming mice I always set my
left off distance to the lowest possible
amount so that when the mouse connects
with the mouse mat that is when the
tracking occurs not in the air and that
is one major disappointing issue here
because it's all through driver software
I don't think that it's a sensory
limitation I think it's just driver
limitation that has been kept out to
preserve the added value of SteelSeries
other more expensive mice but I was
still able to adjust my game style so I
could still be accurate with my aim so
not lifting off the mouse too much but
if only we had smaller increments of CPI
adjustment and lift off distant
adjustment now this would be the budget
Gaming Mouse to buy without any question
but I do still think that the sensor and
there ganar well in line for the price
and the rival 100 deserves our damn good
value a word now many of you have
requested to see my optimal gaming
peripheral setup so it's something that
we've actually start to do so make sure
to subscribe to not miss that and give
us a like if you want to see more gaming
reviews in the future I'm Dimitri with
Heric Knox thanks so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next
