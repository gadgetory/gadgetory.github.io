hard-working axe and in a world where
wireless gaming mice are slowly start
dominate the peripheral market space
it's always good to go back and check
out some amazing Wired gaming mouse and
in this case I'm very excited to share
my experience using the HyperX pulse
fire surge gaming mouse you heard that
right a gaming mouse from HyperX in fact
their very first entry into the gaming
mice market was with the launch of the
pulse fire FPS mouse that retails for
$40 which was amazing considering an
entry-level product especially for their
very first launch and then for an extra
$20 they later on came up with the pro
version of the exact same mouse that
came with a better sensor and of course
RGB lining now we have this the pulse
fire search that retails for $70 and
this thing is a well rounded package for
that price because it's got a fantastic
sensor great ergonomics and the RGB
lighting is just amazing especially
since it's 2018 and you know you've got
to have it on a gaming mouse at this
point so given how saturated the gaming
mice market is this HyperX really have a
chance to compete with the big brands
like logitech SteelSeries and a few more
well let's find out but first a quick
message from our sponsor the new master
keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic wrist rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection cooler master
doing it right check it out below okay
so I'm aware of some of the quality
control issues that some existing owners
of this particular Mouse have
experienced especially with the primary
left and right click buttons essentially
the gap between those two buttons were
was pretty minimal so when you're
clicking them both of them would sort of
actuate at the same time and it was
pretty uncomfortable rex has addressed
that problem by increasing the gap and
they've addressed that very quickly so
if you have a defected unit you can
actually fill out this form online with
the model number located behind the
mouse and then you HyperX will take care
of you right away so I'll leave a link
to that form in the description down
below just in case but I do have the
unit that has been completely addressed
so let's move on to the review kicking
things off let's talk about the design
and HyperX has taken a safer up this
time
with a somewhat minimalist approach
there's nothing aggressive here which I
really like the body is ambidextrous
although the forward and backward
buttons are right hand only it is a
little bit on the slimmer side when
compared to my g43 wireless mouse but
given that I have big hands the klog
grip was my preferred setting but if you
have smaller hands you can comfortably
rest your palms on top of the body and I
have to say throughout my usage both
editing and gaming on it the experience
was really comfortable you really have
to feel this mouse for yourself in the
first place because it really is an
amazing body it's very compact not too
super bulky so if you're looking for
something a little bit on the portable
side as well this is certainly something
that you should look into the build
quality of this mouse is really good for
the price it's mostly constructed out of
hard plastic materials and I didn't
experience any signs of creaking which
is awesome I also appreciate the matte
texture choice throughout the body it
really complements the grip and it's
miles better than the glossy plastic
finishes did you get with some other
gaming mice that also attracts scratches
and grease easily the mouse weighs at a
hundred grams which might be a little
bit on the heavier side for some users
but I was pretty comfortable gaming on
it
do note that the weight isn't
customizable the cable is braided but
unfortunately it's pretty quick at
forming kinks and part of that has to do
with the thickness of the braid and the
type of material that they've used now
ironically the HyperX cloud alpha gaming
headset comes with this amazing braided
cable it's super smooth and very
flexible so there's really form kings
that easily and I really wish if they
use the same material choice or the
headset cable on the mouse because
really as you can see it's just it's not
gonna last that long at least that's
what I think but you can easily address
this issue by adding a mouse bungee to
your setup but if you're on the other
side of the train or this might be an
annoying factor now I do have a question
for you guys though do you think
switching to this might be one of the
reasons why you know gamers are
switching to a wireless setup because
you know not being able to deal with the
cables and all that kind of stuff is it
is a primary reason to switch from a
wired gaming mouse to a wireless gaming
mouse I don't know let me know in the
comments down below
the pulsefire search features amnon
switches rated for fifty million clicks
which is amazing and the primary left
and right buttons feature great tactile
feedback they don't require a lot of
pressure to press which is nice so you
can concentrate more on the gameplay the
scroll wheel has a nice grip to it and
the scroll
are well defined which is great the DPI
shift button is right beside it and it
can cycle between three different
deepened levels plus there are some key
combinations that can let you adjust
certain settings within the mouse for
example if you want to adjust the
brightness of the LED you just have to
hold down the dpi shift button and had
the backward button to reduce the
brightness and you know turn off the RGB
lining but if you want to increase it
and if you want to turn that back on
you can hit the DPI shift button and
press the forward button it's very
intuitive again little details that sort
of add to an amazing experience using
this mouse moving on to the sensor
well this mouse feature is the Pixar
3389 optical sensor that's rated to go
as far as 16,000 dpi which is again way
to overkill but at this point I think
it's just a marketing gimmick I was
really comfortable gaming at the
standard you know 800 to a thousand dpi
which is sort of my preferred setting
but needless to say tracking has been
fantastic and I really enjoyed my time
both editing and gaming on it jumping
into a quick battlefield one session I
was able to quickly aim and shoot my
targets faster
there was also zero acceleration which
was amazing and liftoff distance is also
very low meaning when you're adjusting
or readjusting your position you won't
really experience any interruptions
within the gameplay the defined scroll
snaps really help when it comes to
switching weapons so overall a fantastic
gaming experience that you're getting
for $70 you know what else you do get
for $70 RGB lighting my friends and this
mouse looks absolutely stunning
especially in the dark there is a subtle
lighting throughout the body that looks
very consistent the diffusion is also
very nice and the gradient is certainly
minimal it's super smooth so you're
really not going to notice the LEDs
inside it really looks amazing in the
dark and it gives you a cool 360 degrees
subtle effect there are two individual
zones that you can customize so there's
the logo that's located in the palm rest
area and you can also adjust the
individual LED colors within the mouse
which is also pretty nice the drivers
software is actually fairly easier to
navigate around with as you can see
you're greeted with a physical overview
the mouse but I do want to point out
that you have to create a profile in
order to customize the functions like
lighting and all that kind of stuff it's
not a really big deal but it's something
to keep note of and as you can see on
the left hand side you do have the
option to adjust the lighting on it so
you can cycle between different effects
like solid color cycle breathing
wave trigger and of course you do have
the option to turn the lining completely
off if you're not a fan of RGB la now
when they switch over to the advanced
tab this is where things get a little
bit interesting because you now have the
ability to individually adjust the
colors on the LEDs depending on the
effect and you also have the ability to
adjust the lighting effects along the
speed and of course the direction as
well as that's awesome moving on to the
performance tab and that's where you
have the ability to adjust the DPI but
what's really interesting is you can
assign an individual color to a certain
dpi so if you are switching between
certain dpi levels the mouse will
actually illuminate at a specific or
respective color depending on your
choice and what's even cool is that
there's a little pop-up notification
that shows on the desktop indicating
what dpi level you've chose so all these
little things really add to an amazing
experience using the pulsefire surge and
finally there's macro recording on the
pulse fire surge along with the ability
to store profiles within the mouse so
that's pretty nice so to conclude the
pulse fire search from HyperX is a
fantastic mouse for the price at $70 you
really can't go wrong with this mouse
because you're getting an amazing
package with great sensor performance
the button clicks of the online switches
are fantastic the body by itself is also
very comfortable to use and you cannot
go wrong with the lighting on this mouse
because it really competes with what
razer offers so some of their gaming
mice as well so really it is an awesome
package for $70 and I think this starts
an interesting conversation as to what
HyperX has planned for the future
because if you think about it
HyperX started selling fantastic gaming
headsets within a sub one and Adella
price range and then they moved on to
gaming keyboards starting with the a low
FPS then came the a low elite eye which
we've done a full review on and it can
check it out right over here and then
they came out with the RGB version
optilead where you can adjust the color
or the RGB lining through the drivers
software so just like what Corsair has
with their gaming keyboards their gaming
mice and their gaming headsets hi 4x is
taking the same approach by introducing
this whole new ecosystem of gaming
peripherals and I'm really curious to
know your thoughts on the pulsefire
surge is it an underrated Mouse for 2018
but more specifically if you're looking
for a mouse within the sub 1 and another
price range and if you don't want to
spend 80 or $90
on a gaming mouse and considering that
this is only there's only cost like $70
and you get an amazing package for that
you know with great RGB lighting
fantastic sense of performance and just
great ergonomics would you actually
consider this I'd love to know your
thoughts in the comments I need better
with hardware connects thank you so much
