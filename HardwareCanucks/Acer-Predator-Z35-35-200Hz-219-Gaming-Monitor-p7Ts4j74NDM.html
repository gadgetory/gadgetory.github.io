possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex and NCIX the Acer predator Z 35
is going to be an interesting gaming
monitor because it combines so many
awesome elements that we love like the
aspect ratio of 21 by 9 the subtle curve
that complements this giant 35 inch
panel beautifully plus the ambient LED
underneath the monitor that can cycle
between multiple colors so you can color
match to your setup
it features g-sync for tear free and
smooth gameplay it has an awesome
looking and stable monitor stand that is
also color coded with red so the last
two specs are the resolution and the
refresh rate it is 2560 by 1080 which
for a 35 inch panel seems to be quite
disappointing but the reasoning behind
this is the 200 Hertz refresh rate yes
you heard that correctly 200 Hertz
imagining that it's already quite
challenging to drive 144 hurt panels at
1080p so let alone bumping that
resolution to 1440p or even 4k but
having max refresh rate of 200 Hertz
would be super challenging to drive
anything higher than the resolution of
this monitor
now the impressive part about the Z 35
is that it's a VA panel so viewing
angles are much better than standard TN
and it's almost like an IPS kind of
panel and I wanted to verify to myself
that in fact we were getting full 200
Hertz I went into the menus enabled the
overclock and boosted the max refresh
rate to 200 Hertz which was then
recognized inside the Nvidia control
panel and enabled just fine but you
gotta ask yourself if 200 Hertz is that
much different from 144 Hertz which is
already blazing fast so don't worry this
monitor is in-house and we will have a
fool of you once full testing is
complete but until then do you think
that the 200 Hertz is totally in
overkill for example if you find
yourself not totally happy with a
hundred forty four Hertz already
maybe the 200 Hertz will be that little
extra upgrade that you
waiting for but let us know in the
comments down below I'm Dimitri this has
been the Predators e35 and we'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
