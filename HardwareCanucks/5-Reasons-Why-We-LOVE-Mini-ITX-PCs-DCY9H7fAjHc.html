ride fred is already on this guy
the in wind a1 you see I love me a good
quality ITX enclosure hopefully this is
one of them let's unbox Wow so that
thing is looking pretty sweet let me
show you through view
all right so now that's out of the way I
know you guys like and of course I do
too my take of b-roll but in this video
I won't talk about five reasons of why I
love ITX
and why that low a one is replacing my
current large tower so let me tell you
why I love ITX so much right after this
the new master keys MK 750 keyboard
comes with a comfortable magnetic wrist
rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection Coolermaster
doing it right check it out the low so
the first obvious advantage with ITX is
size don't get me wrong I love my PC Oh
11 dynamic it's a beautiful you know
glass enclosure I can fit a lot of
things in there but it requires its own
little pedestal so it's kind of on the
same level as my desk but look at this
guy he's tiny and you can definitely put
it on the desk itself and not occupy
another piece of furniture so relocating
this case is really not an issue if you
decide to move it around a little bit in
your space plus you can potentially put
it in some form of a duffel bag if
you're going to a LAN event or just want
to carry this thing wherever you go and
for size comparison here's the H of
hundred i from NZXT the latest mint
tower
this thing is pretty compact but look at
how much smaller the a1 is here's the
GPU right next to it for a little size
reference this has a glass top which is
awesome so you can accessorize obviously
the perfect space for Fred and by the
way the glass top has a Qi charger
built-in which is awesome so you can
charge your smartphone or and in my case
I can charge my mouse on top of the case
a really unique feature for the a1
reason number two potentially the less
obvious one aside from the much smaller
form factor would be the unique designs
that we have with ITX cases for example
take the shift X from fantex are really
unique towering ITX case make sure to
check out our review over here the MKS
m1 is a really popular format the new
streak on da2 that we checked out the
Computex that's a really unique one here
and the a1 sort of fits within that same
formula of being compact space efficient
and doesn't have any hardware
compromises in terms of what you can
in terms of GPU some storage and cooling
there is a lot of happening with the a1
in terms of design
so like the curvature of the front panel
different materials you know that
transparent section the bottom is not
something that we have seen but the only
thing that kind of stands out to me is
the in wind text at the front it's not
my thing but at least it's not too
intrusive
whereas with ATX case designs they all
feel too similar to each other so there
is less differentiation in the ATX space
versus what you can get with ITX which
brings me to my third point and that is
size does not matter for powerful
hardware you can still have an
incredibly powerful and capable machine
without it occupying much space and to
prove that point I'm going to relocate
my main system from this giant full
tower into the tiny a1 without changing
any of my main hardware components so
that is an 80 600 K inside this ITX
motherboard I have had no issues
overclocking into 5 gigahertz which is
awesome
the titanic's piece again going here the
m-dot to drive which is my OS drive is
gonna go underneath this heatsink and I
have three other snow SSDs which is
perfect because this motherboard has
four SATA connections the only thing
that's different will be memory capacity
which is cut in half because I only have
two RAM slots instead of 4 but still 32
gigs of ram is totally fine in some
aspects this motherboard is far superior
versus my z3 7080 X prime because this
one has a type C front IO connection and
a 5 volt addressable RGB header which is
perfect for this case it also has
built-in Wi-Fi excellent so now that the
system swap assembly into the a1 begin
so there she is fully assembled
everything's working fine which brings
me to my fourth point the satisfaction
of building something like this because
you know it's more challenging
everything is more cramped there's less
space to work with you have to approach
it from like a strategic point of view
and when you're routing the 24 pin cable
the 8 pin cable for example here I had
to insert the CPU tower after the
motherboard that all the cables were pre
routed because otherwise it would just
not fit and so you kind of have to go
around a certain way to work around the
limitations of such a tiny space but in
the end if you're doing it the right way
it is super rewarding
now the underglow of this skirt is
actually pretty cool as long as you have
a 12 volt RGB header on your motherboard
otherwise it's just simply blue if you
power it via eSATA now the a1 comes with
a built-in 600 watt bronze certified
power supply so it's not that efficient
but 600 watts should be enough for my
system the thing is it only has three
SATA connections so for my three SSDs
that's fine but the lighting control
here also requires SATA power so just
keep that in mind and check this out
there is this plastic cover that goes
over the cable exit hiding that stuff
really nice but it isn't physically
attached the power supply via a screw so
if you were to replace the power supply
maybe pop in your SFX or another ATX
power supply in here you will not be
able to install the bracket back so be
nice if this thing was installed to the
frame and not on the power supply itself
now this whole situation where the power
supply cover is unfortunate because this
is a terrible design and when come on
because you have to slide it from the
side but that's where my CPU tower is
you know be nice if this was just like a
little clip on from the top you don't
have to worry about like passing any
cables to it really bad because I cannot
install this now and you can see the
cables exiting from the power supply now
I will say I'm pretty proud of my cable
management job you know nothing is
sticking out the front so there is no
restrictions for air flow and like I can
remove components without cabling being
on the way but I'm also pretty happy at
the cable management job at the back so
both us as these are connected and you
know no cabling is sticking out so I can
close the panel nope
but now you may be thinking hey Demetri
what's up with the airflow
you went from a 360 all-in-one cooler
and potential to install six more fans
inside the Leonie case to something like
that where you have one intake fan from
the side and just the CPU tower fan
doing all the exhaust for you and that
brings me to my fifth point of why I
love ITX if configured correctly for
airflow you're looking at less volume of
air that needs to be replaced every
second and therefore you don't need to
cram that enclosure with so many fans
because one intake from the side and one
exhaust will definitely do the trick for
cooling with my CPU tower that does a
pretty decent job at 5 gigahertz on the
CPU and the GPU is thing pretty nice and
cool too and the only real compromise I
have with my ITX motherboard is that I
only have two fan headers which means
that I cannot connect more fans without
splitters which I don't have but I would
potentially install one intake at the
bottom to deliver a cool air for the GPU
and one additional exhaust vent at the
back so that you can create this nice
channel of airflow and these the fans
are super quiet anyway so I wouldn't
worry about noise now sure in mid towers
you have more radiator space and space
for fans and just general emptiness
inside the enclosure so things can feel
like you know you're not crammed in but
with a proper set up in a tiny space
you're looking at the same temperatures
if not better alright so those are all
my reasons of why I love ITX and
potentially encourage you guys to move
into that direction because you know
there is some challenge that is involved
in working with such tight quarters but
it is a rewarding experience as long as
you approach it from that mentality it's
not like a giant food tower where you
have a lot of space to maneuver you know
it's a it's a compact space and you have
to approach it accordingly now the one
split point one comes to ITX systems art
visuals you know it's not really about
how the hardware looks on the inside
instead it's all about the exterior
visuals so I'm using the Titanic speed
the collector's edition it looks
beautiful but it's almost semi wasted on
the interior because you can't see it
and so I was gonna use the T for steam
group memory the knifehog because
the lighting on here is fantastic plus
this is a white module so it kind of
fits in with the white theme of the case
and the silver motherboard majority of
the time with ITX you'll have to steer
away from beautiful hardware into
something that there's just functional
and non visible and by the way you can
check out the team group Emery down the
description below now aside from having
fewer fan headers on the motherboard
because of ITX
for this case in particular we only have
two USB ports on the i/o which is fine
for ITX but that is one of the
advantages of larger mid towers and full
towers that normally come with four but
I would say the main deterrent or the
disadvantage when it comes to ITX for
most people would be price regardless of
the difficulty of working and something
like this this Z 370 motherboard inside
there is more expensive than my z3 7080
ex-prime motherboard which is you know
definitely more future-proof more
expansion stuff so yeah but aside from
more expensive hardware you're also
looking at more expensive enclosure so
this one sells for $169 and while it has
that unique underglow and just the
entire format that's pretty cool plus
the Qi charger the power supply built in
you know it's more expensive than my D&amp;amp;D
encoder and I love this thing it's also
quite unique or the H 500 for example
the new ones from NZXT that thing is 79
or 69 bucks and sure it's much larger
but the experience I would say is
definitely a lot more pleasing to most
people but yeah that is what you have to
deal with when you go towards the ITX
route I don't know maybe we should call
it the Mini ITX tax because all the
hardware is generally more expensive you
know the process of assembly is more
difficult however you can't ignore the
fact that it's much smaller and the end
result is rewarding satisfying at least
to me I don't know what about you
alright good people so those are my five
reasons why I love ITX
perhaps you should try the same
direction as well pretty happy how this
turned out you know I'm keeping all the
same hardware as I have on mid towers
that I've had that are what
at least three times in volume and the
cooling capacity in here with just two
fans is actually pretty awesome and so
let me know if you're also considering
downsizing because it's not bad at all
join the wireless club with Corsairs new
