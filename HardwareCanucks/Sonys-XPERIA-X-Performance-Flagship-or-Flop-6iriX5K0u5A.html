years ago if I were to ask you the same
question the quick response would have
been a phone that has the
top-of-the-line specs a great camera a
long-lasting battery good build quality
and great design and the last piece of
the equation its price we've seen plenty
of phones over the past few years that
have performed great and are still
performing great despite their age every
year when a company launches their
flagship device people start looking for
reviews and if it stands out from the
competition they start to look towards
upgrading their existing phones even if
their current device works just fine
trust me I'm one of those guys but this
year Sony did something a bit different
with their Xperia lineup toshiba now
offering ocz products that are awesome
and affordable like the RD 400 TR 150
and vt1 80 that are backed by advanced
warranty program now stronger than ever
under toshiba if you recall our xperia x
review i had some mixed feelings about
this phone because priced at $550 the
build and the design was excellent and
the display was nice the battery life
was outstanding but the camera wasn't
that great and that was unacceptable
considering the slightly low price point
meet the $700 xperia x performance in
simple words this phone is an exact
replica of the xperia x except with some
minor specification differences on the
inside and a slight change of texture on
the outside specifically at the back you
now get a brushed metal finish over the
simple plain design on the Xperia X
internally is where all the differences
happened and those higher specs are what
you pay an extra $150 for there's a
Snapdragon 820 quad-core CPU and a
slightly bigger battery we're talking 80
million powers more to compensate for
the more power-hungry processor but
that's it
it still has three gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of internal storage that can
be expanded the same camera sensor and
the same 5-inch 1080p IPS display but do
those specifications who really change
the experience or are they just about
achieving higher benchmark numbers to
tell you the truth my experience using
this phone hasn't
that much coming from the xperia x for
everyday tasks this thing feels just as
fast with snappy screen transitions it
still feels like a premium device - and
given the compact form factor it should
be a good size for users with small
hands I did notice to display on the
Xperia X performance was a bit on the
warmer side compared to the regular
xperia x the dual front-facing speakers
performed just like the Xperia X and I
always appreciate this feature since it
makes content consumption a lot more
pleasing when the phone is being used
without attached headphones another cool
feature is that this phone comes with an
IP 68 water-resistant rating so that
should prevent damage from accidental
spills which the xperia x does not have
and once again just like its little
brother that's where my positive
thoughts on the phone and I'm sad to
report the camera quality on the X
performance is just as bad as DX the
lack of detail along with poor focusing
is disappointing and it does not feature
4k video recording
seriously Sony paying $700 for a
so-called flagship which doesn't meet
today's standards for some entry-level
devices just feels odd I also have bad
news for battery life it was
significantly worse than the regular X I
could blame this on the 820 CPU but
theoretically speaking the 1080p display
should have balanced daily usage without
having it to plug it in in the middle of
the day and to be honest I didn't notice
a massive speed difference between the X
performance and the X from my daily
usage app open times are the same
webpages load at the same time and the
same story applies when multitasking
makes me wonder if paying an extra $150
or where the regular X is even worth it
I'm gonna stop here for a second and
touch base on current value oriented
phones that offer excellent features for
the price let's start with the 1 plus 3
priced at $400
it's got a Snapdragon 820 CPU 6
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of
internal storage that can't be expanded
a massive 3000 milliamp hour battery and
a 16 megapixel camera that features raw
support and 4k video recording in his
review Dmitry loved to build the display
the battery life and the camera was
surprisingly good and even though he had
some minor quirks with YouTube playback
issue that was fixed with a software
update not to mention it's 300 bucks
than the xperia x performance moo-hyun -
phone that has been trending lately as a
budget smartphone the ZTE axon 7 also
priced at $400 you get a 5.5 inch quad
HD display Snapdragon 820 CPU 4
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of storage
that can also be expanded via microSD a
3,250 milliamp hour battery a 20
megapixel camera that can also shoot 4k
video now I can go and talk about phones
that cost less than the xperia x
performance and even the xperia x but my
point is you don't need to spend a lot
of dough on a phone to get an amazing
long-term experience the important word
here is experience and as we've seen
here ultra high and specifications
without accompanying features leads to
poor value specs aren't everything if
you already invested into a flagship
phone that costs more than $600 chances
are it's gonna last you a while and I
don't feel like the regular xperia x
would offer any less future-proofing
than the more expensive performance
model let me give you an example I
bought my Nexus 6p last year around this
time and I absolutely love using it the
display is clear and sharp and since
it's AMOLED it helps a lot with battery
life I'm still getting a full day of
usage and sometimes even more and it
still feels lightning-quick even with
today's slightly more demanding apps I
cannot live without the dual
front-facing speakers either the camera
still performs great and it's still my
primary shooter for Instagram and
Twitter pics and best of all stock
Android has always been my cup of tea
given the operating systems usual
excellent memory management without any
unwanted bloatware it's still performing
like a champ
as a matter of fact I'd almost say that
Sony's Xperia U I like Samsung's
TouchWiz could cause these phones to
feel dated before their time is up due
to usually slow updates to Google's
newest operating system versions perhaps
the best part is that I haven't felt a
need to upgrade this phone to a flagship
offering from Samsung or any other
manufacturer that sports the latest and
greatest specs I use the Nexus 6p to
write scripts when I'm traveling check
email and watch videos and yes I did try
editing videos on it and it just worked
fine
there are plenty of great phones out
there that cost less than the experience
performance and offer flagship like
features I feel like this phone was a
disappointment because
for one the camera was not that great I
mean I'll be honest I was expecting a
upgraded and great camera over the
Xperia X plus the battery life was not
worth $700 and if you're willing to
spend that much money for just a few
hardware internal upgrades you're much
better off looking at the s7 series from
Samsung or maybe even an iPhone recently
an ephah Sony announced the Xperia XZ
that's supposed to feature a
revolutionary camera and a unique body
design I don't mind taking another shot
at it when it's in the studio but until
then I would hold off on pulling the
trigger on current experience from Sony
so are you satisfied with your current
phone or are you looking to upgrade in
the next few months how long have you
had your current phone for let us know

I'm Ebert with hurricane axe thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
