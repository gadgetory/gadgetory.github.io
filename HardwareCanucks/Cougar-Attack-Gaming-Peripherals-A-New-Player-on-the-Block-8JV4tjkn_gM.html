for RGB keyboards and mice we're going
through so many debt honestly they're
all becoming a little bit of a blur with
each other now
Kouga has their attacks x3 and their
avenger mouths here today and i'm going
to be honest this either has to stand
out or it's going to sink into the
market with the wide range of other
keyboards and mice out there so let's
see if there's anything new or anything
different that the attacks and the
revenger bring what instead of you 31
you should put a ring on it yes time to
make it hard to be efficient
so we'll take ring high static pressure
fast because your keys reserve the ring
cool details in description below
okay so let's dive into it so first
thing to consider with this board is the
price the second is the fact that it
uses genuine Cherry MX switches
underneath red switches in this case the
third is the build quality of the board
and the fourth is of course that nice
RGB lighting that you get with this now
I'm going to go a little bit into the
details but I'll make sure to be quick
as I won't bore you with it too much
it has a full sized layout with the
media keys on the FN row and abs key
caps the bottom has to flip out feet and
it features of one point 8 meter braided
cable terminating in two USB ports we've
also got a thousand Hertz polling and
full n key rollover as well as software
support for macros with a physical
windows key lock the board weighs just
under a kilogram and finally it comes in
Cherry MX black brown blue and red
switches which are on my sample okay so
that's out of the way now let's see what
makes or breaks this board the aluminium
frame is the standout part not only does
it provide some structural rigidity but
it also just kind of looks cool it also
helps to reflect the lighting which does
look good even though this aluminium top
plate is present the build still feels a
little bit underwhelming though and I
think the plastic frame let's it down a
bit the switches are pretty much what
you'd expect they feel like MX Reds this
is one of the cheaper RGB boards with MX
switches though so if you're just a
little bit short of cash when you're
looking at some of the pricier boards
this might be nice let's have a listen
to what the switches sound like
so before we get into the admittedly
beautiful lighting on the board I want
to go over some of the minor gripes I've
had with it the first off is the lack of
dedicated media controls I like having a
volume wheel and play/pause buttons and
it'd be nice for a bigger board to have
them
my biggest issue though if they change
the left windows button to the function
key trigger consistently does this and I
really do hate it
you can remap them in software but you
still can't switch the stop key caps
around so you have to get some
third-party ones for that overall it's a
bit of a hassle and I just wish that you
wouldn't have to do it okay so let's get
into the lighting and the software
finally obviously the lighting does look
really good because the keys are raised
the backlight is bright and colourful
and it's really not much more to say so
the software that Kruger provides is
pretty simple we've got three main modes
where you can rebind and set profiles
you've got your performance tab which
you can set polling rates and repeat lay
and key roll over and repeat rates here
a key assignment where you can change
the keys set custom macros on the side
here new macros I you've got some
default modes which you can add to it or
you can bind your own ones which helps
also rebinding some of the keys which
you don't like lighting control this is
where I'm not a big fan of it as you've
got the three modes but it's not a very
intuitive design you have to select
these weird tabs and drag them into each
of the three circles and maybe that
would be alright once you got used to it
except I found that a lot of the time
when I'm switching them around instead
of adjusting the intensity of the
lighting or the mode it simply just
turns it off and I can't get it back
until I reboot the software and replug
in the keyboard maybe it's just a bug
for my specific one but still it's a bit
disappointing and I wish that the
software was redesigned to be a bit more
intuitive and easily programmable and so
that's just about wraps up the attacks
x3 it's a solid board with a decent
price but it's at risk of not standing
out in this already oversaturated market
so now let's move on to the revenger
Mouse priced at $55 it is in the upper
class of mice and it's aiming for the
FPS market once you get past the corning
name of
there's some solid stuff to look at here
the standout feature of this mouse is
the sensor choice squatting the
top-of-the-line 12 K dpi picks RPM w
3360 sensor this shape takes some
angular approaches near the front and
has a moderately aggressive curve to it
into largest Mouse and I find it fairly
comfortable to use and I think it's
going to suit a fairly wide type of hand
sizes and grip types but if you can try
it before you buy it's always a good
thing the build feels good but not great
the materials just feel a little bit
average to me the top plastic finish
with the textured rubber sides works
well and there's no reasoning issues but
overall it lacks some of the premium
quality feel of other mice the scroll
wheel is good and the primal clicks use
online switches which is always great
you have two side buttons as well as the
DPI toggle on the top which you're going
to have to push back to use it's a bit
weird at first but once you get used to
it it's fine for the occasional use it
gets the lighting looks great it's
fairly subtle and classy I like it
my main gripe with this mouse is
actually the weight at 115 grams it's on
the heavier side for an FPS Mouse and I
found myself missing the lighter weight
of other mice personally I'd prefer was
below 100 grams ideally in the 80 to 90
range when I'm in game the sensor has no
issues but I wouldn't expect the 3362
it tracks perfectly and performs
admirably but the shape and the weight
of the mouse does leave a little bit to
be desired it's almost there but for me
it's just a little bit off from being
what I want
that being said personal preference will
come into play and some people might
prefer the shape and they're slightly
heavier weight and now let's go into the
software and here's the software for the
revenger mouse so it's pretty similar to
the software for the Kruger keyboard
earlier you've got three main modes
where you can saw settings you've got
your performance tab key assignment and
lighting so in performance you've got
three dpi modes where you can adjust x
and y axes you've got sniper dpi setting
you've got polling rates angle snapping
lift height all of the expected stuff in
here as well as the option to enable or
disable Mouse acceleration good to see
in key assignment you can rebind any of
the keys on the mouse pretty simple but
works well
and in the lighting control you can
choose what color it is the breathing
fully lit off it's not as advanced as
the keyboard but it works better so in a
lot of ways I actually prefer it even
though you do give up some of the
functionality game management profile
you can set profiles for games it's all
pretty simple as once again I don't
really like the skin on the Krueger
software but if you can get past that
the software for the mouse is pretty
manageable always be charged with
linking power up power banks housed in
gorgeous aluminum enclosure with dual
USB and type-c port with support for
quick charge 3.0 to get two devices
recharged fast available up to 20
thousand one hundred million power
capacities check them out in description
below so that about wraps it up both the
attacks x3 and the revenge of mouse are
pretty Souls offerings and decently
priced as well but they're a little bit
too little too late I think maybe six to
twelve months ago they might have had a
better chance but in the current market
it's very oversaturated and there's
nothing to make these stand out so that
