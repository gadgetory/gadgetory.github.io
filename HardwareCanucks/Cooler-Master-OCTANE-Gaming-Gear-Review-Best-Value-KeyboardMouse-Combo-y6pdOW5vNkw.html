great technology selection and service
hey guys
Eva here with her mechanics and today we
are going to take a look at one of the
most value friendly gaming keyboard and
mouse combos meet the CM storm octane
that just retails for $60 and of course
at such a low price we expect to have
compromises and type corners but we are
genuinely impressed at what coolermaster
is able to deliver covering the basics
with some understandable drawbacks
having the two peripherals packaged in
one box is convenient and it saves you
from dealing with multiple boxes inside
you'll also find a brief user guide
which keeps it simple the main frame is
plastic and we weren't expecting
anything fantastic it's actually strong
enough so it barely flexes coolermaster
adopted this very aggressive design with
a sharp-edged cool looking thing on both
the left and right side at the bottom
there are proper rubber strips for a
better grip and appropriate brazzers for
the user to change the angle I was
really surprised to see Coolermaster
include dedicated media playback buttons
on the top left side is where you'll
find the usual stop play pause skip
track buttons and the volume adjust on
the top right side the keys are coated
with a matte finish that gives the
keyboard a more premium look while also
helping to grip fingers for fast typers
there's something about this coating
combination that sets it apart from many
other value keyboards it's a membrane
switch as expected at this price but the
rebounds is pretty quick they are very
quiet a little mushy still but no stuck
keys and the one thing that stood out to
me was the lighting the keys are not
individually backlit but it's well
balanced with seven colors that you can
cycle with a press of a button the light
spill between the keys adds an extra
layer of illumination
there are several brightness levels and
the color vibrancy is totally on point
plus a breathing mode is available with
really smooth transition that it's great
to see this is a plug and play keyboard
meaning there's no driver software nor
any additional profiles which can be a
disadvantage but
can't have it all for this value combo
switching gears the mouse is crafted out
of plastic and it wastes a lot less than
a typical gaming mouse the styling
follows in the aggressive footsteps ask
the keyboard and side-by-side it feels
like a part of the set there are six
buttons that include the primary left
and right clicks the DPI shove button
behind the scroll wheel that are
pre-programmed to change sensitivity
starting 500 thousand two thousand and
thirty five hundred dpi the forward and
backward clicks are located on the left
side of the mouse and overall button
placement is excellent without any
awkward - weak spots the scroll wheel
comes with very weak scroll steps which
won't be useful for switching weapons
while gaming but most of the time it'll
get the job done ergonomically we are
happy to report a mouse is well shaped
regardless of the sharp edges and a
symmetric design palm type grip is
preferred over claw grip as the contact
points between your thumb and the
surface might be a little slippery and I
wish coolermaster include a rubberized
for textured sides which would have
helped strengthen your grip this mouse
is equipped with an a vago 3050 which is
regarded as an excellent entry-level
optical sensor I had no issues with
skipping and tracking on dark plot matte
surfaces proved reliable the lack of
fine-tuning your dpi is a letdown but
switching between thousand and two
thousand dpi was my preference setting
the lighting integration on the mouse is
okay we have two sharp looking LED
lights on the palm rest that can cycle
between seven colors by pressing the
lower button right beside the dpi shift
button allowing you to color sync the
mouse to the keyboard in addition there
are two subtle lights on the front of
the mouse a nice touch but being picky
the scroll wheel stays white it doesn't
coordinate with the rest of the color
zones and we find that an oversight and
so in conclusion coolermaster has
brought a lot of features that an
average gamer would see fit with the
octane gaming gear the dedicated media
playback buttons and the lighting on the
keyboard just looks gorgeous and I love
how the mouse provides the basic
functionality with excellent tracking
however with a super light and plasticky
construction regardless of that they
managed to hit an impressive price point
and we
the harbor connects damn good value
