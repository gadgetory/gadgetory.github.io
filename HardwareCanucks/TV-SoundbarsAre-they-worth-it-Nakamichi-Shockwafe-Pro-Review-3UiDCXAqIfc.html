lackluster they don't provide the hit in
the base for movies the cloudy for TV or
the world balanced sound a music
listening as such many people opt to
pick up a speaker system whether it be a
two point one set of speakers a sound
bar or a surround setup many people will
opt towards a sound bar to minimize
visual intrusion that conventional
speaker system might bring and while you
get this more seamless integration you
lose the flexibility of speakers and
often because of the smaller drivers in
a sound bar the sound suffers as well
today we're looking at what Nakamichi is
offering with the shockwave Pro 7.1
sound bar system priced at 399 this set
comprises of a 45 inch sound bar and
eight-inch wireless sub and two
satellite speakers so let's take a look
at what Nakamichi has to offer
now I'll preface by saying that I
haven't had very much experience with
sound bars I've mainly used speakers to
get an idea for where this system is
most suited I tested it in two
environments of different sizes to
identify how it performed in each and
I'll assess both usability and sound but
before we get into that let's take a
look at each section of the shockwave
Pro the centerpiece is the sound bar
with NAT amici touting its 45 inch
length and its 11 speaker drivers housed
within it the front has a plastic mesh
finish and a small Nakamichi logo as
well as the IR receiver on the top you
have five clicky buttons to control
power source demo playback and volume
controls on the back you have a brushed
plastic finish with a wide selection of
ports we have the non removable AC cable
for 110 volt power only meaning without
a step-down transformer this can only be
used in countries with 110 volts which
is unfortunate and I would have liked to
see multiple voltages even if it is
mainly aimed at the US market there's a
USB port for firmware updates optical
digital and aux for audio as well as two
HDMI inputs and one pass through this is
a great selection of inputs
accommodating for all sorts of setups
really great stuff here on the bottom
are two rubber feet for grip and on the
sides you have these silver accents
aesthetically this is a mixed bag for me
while I like the black and silver color
palette the design is a two angular and
just a bit bold for my preference a more
subtle design would have been a benefit
however the same can't be said for the
accompanying 8 inch wireless subwoofer
I love the design here the silver looks
great and while it has those angular
hints it ties together nicely I love the
concept and the execution of this
subwoofer having the wireless
functionality means you can hide the
subwoofer and rear speaker cables and
connecting the woofer and sound bar
happens immediately and seamlessly on
the rear are the connections for the
accompanying satellite speakers and the
power switch the only thing is because
of the wireless nature you can't use
this subwoofer with any other system
which is unfortunate I would have loved
to see the option to use the sub in a
wired mode to allow for more system
expandability the only other nitpick is
that the sub doesn't seem to have a
proper smart sleep mode so when you've
turned off the sound bar the sub will
still have a light flashing at the back
overall though I like the execution of
the woofer and finally you have the true
satellite speakers these are pretty
simple they aren't very large or
exceptional but match well with the
design of the system and have a pretty
small footprint the cable they use isn't
the standard speaker wire which could be
annoying if you plan on using
pre-existing cable runs for these
however the cables are extremely long so
they'll fit in even very large areas and
the last thing is the accessories
packing in here you have all the needed
cables with aux optical and a short HDMI
cable included nice the only complaint
is the HDMI cable is very short so your
source device will have to be very close
to the sound bar
you also have velcro wraps for cable
management and mounting materials so
that you can wall mount the sound bar
and the satellite speakers pretty solid
accessories nice stuff nakamichi so
how's the system in use and does it
offer any advantages over a set of
speakers well first we'll look at one of
the features I found most enjoyable and
that is Bluetooth you can connect any
Bluetooth capable device and use the
shock wave pro with it and I found
myself using this way more than I
thought I would it's great to be able to
sit down on the couch and play some
music easily or has some improved audio
and watching something on your phone or
your laptop I really love having Blu
truth in a system like this and if I was
looking at spending my cash on a speaker
system Bluetooth would certainly be on
my list now the only drawback is that
the audio quality is understandably
degraded compared to hate to my and I
did encounter some breaking up of the
signal occasionally although hopefully
that can be revised in firmware
nakamichi also includes their own remote
which is interesting to say the least
they've attempted to enter
by changing the angle the remote is used
at intending for it to be used in a more
vertical position for me I found that
using it at this raised angle felt weird
at first and even once I got used to it
I didn't feel it provided an advantage
over the traditional design however that
wasn't the main issue that I had with
this remote the biggest thing was that
the remote was inconsistent and
unreliable while it would mostly work if
the sensor was directly lined up with
the soundbar sensor even at just a
slight angle from sitting on another
couch it meant that the signal was just
often not recognized the only reason
this was manageable was that you can see
if the command is registered by the LEDs
on the soundbar however the remote made
the entire system seemed clunky having
an inconsistent remote is something
which is a really big issue when it's
the primary means of interaction and
hopefully Nakamichi can fix it as
otherwise it two tracks from the
experience otherwise when there are
remote functions it's pretty decent but
not particularly exceptional you have
the basic controls as well as EQ presets
and you can also program the remote to
control basic TV power and channel
switching which is nice one of the big
advantages I see for some users that
might sell a sound bar over a set of
speakers is the inputs the shockwave Pro
has the ability to pass video and audio
through so in my case I can connect my
computer via HDMI to the sound bar and
then also connect the projector to the
sound bar it will then pass the video
through the PC through the sound bar and
to the projector which isn't something
most speaker systems have the ability to
perform but many this might not matter
but it will be very useful for those who
need it so that covers most of the user
experience leaving only the sound as
always this is the most subjective and
the most difficult part to cover and
similar to the rest of the shockwave Pro
this is once again a mixed bag before we
start there are a couple of big things
to take into account
firstly you have to think about where
you're going to be using this I used
this in both a small living room and a
much larger and more open space in order
to get an idea of how it suits different
areas most of my reflections will be in
regards to the large environment as
Nakamichi recommends their system for
use in a medium to large open room with
a distance of about three and a half
meters between you and the sound bar and
I do tend to agree
so I'll first look at some positives I
did quite a bit of movie watching with
the shockwave Pro in my large
setting and overall I was very impressed
the samples were performed very well
providing plenty of Rumble which was
great in movies for immersiveness and
managed to fill even a very large space
well in the smaller space the Sabbath
got loud to the point of being
overpowering especially in bass centric
movies with the movie EQ preset the rest
of the system sounded pretty good as
well and the sound was pretty balanced
between verticals and atmosphere and
overall it was a pretty enjoyable and
full sound which I found myself pretty
satisfied with for watching most casual
content I found that especially in the
larger environment it was more than
satisfactory and volume was overall
adequate Nakamichi advertises up to 105
DB and I believe for almost all content
I kept my volume at around 60 out of 150
and even in a large room 150 was
ear-shattering ly loud so you'll have no
issues with cranking the volume up the
shockwave Pro is also one of 25.1
systems to offer both the Dolby 5.1 DTS
however I found that to my ears I didn't
hear much of a discernible difference
even using supported content of which
there is only a very select amount while
it is nice to see it's not a feature
which would sway me once we move past
movies and TV and start to critically
examine the sound we start to hear some
of the flaws however the mid and high
range the paths that stand out most
clearly to me as they need quite some
work on the music EQ setting I found
that the high range was extremely
piercing and harsh not only leading to a
more tinny sound but also making high
strings and vocals extremely fatiguing
whether this is the fault of the speaker
or the EQ preset is unbeknownst to me as
when I switch the movie preset this was
less of an issue except that the high
range thus became really muddy and lost
clarity it might be that with additional
EQ tweaking these issues can be resolved
but currently for music listening I
found that even in the larger
environment it was just too harsh and
while certain sections could sound great
the weak sections really killed it the
last notes are on the surround sound and
the environments that you should use
this in using it in a small living room
I just found it wasn't suited for that
type of space the shockwave Pro really
needs a larger space to excel and in
that smaller room the sound bar
overpowered the sound and the balance
was just off that's not to say that it
was perfect in a larger room either
though
while the sound certainly opened up with
space I found that the rear speakers
still didn't add that much the sound and
I didn't get that surround effect with
the subwoofer and the sound bar bearing
the grunt of the work now for
conclusions
the Nakamichi shockwave Pro shows
promise with some great features and
decent hardware and the use of a
wireless subwoofer is really great
having the features of a sound bar is
certainly appealing and the system would
work well for a large TV room where you
don't want the front speakers visible
however it's the small things where the
shock wave falls flat the remote needs
an overhaul and the sound definitely
needs some tweaking it shows promise and
with more work the shockwave Pro could
be a very solid contender but as it is
more refinement is needed so thank you
