great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with
hurricane axe and today on the review
table we've got an excellent value
oriented chassis from silverstone this
is the coupe y PL 0 5 and this price
range the e coupe like al 0 5 is up
against some tough competition
particularly from NZXT with the S 340 or
the fractal core 3500 but the chassis
seems to hit every aspect of what is
needed in the case without any major
compromises and that is very difficult
to achieve at this price point now there
are some elements that reveal the value
nature of the product like slight tone
mismatch on the plastic panels that can
be easily spotted and the thin side
panels that have a fair amount of flex
and also the slight weakness in the
frame can also be felt there are no
rubber grommets on any of the cutouts
and I questioned how much they act the
cost of the final price of the the case
and finally the ugly colored front panel
cables that I wish were all black and I
wanted to get all these minor
not-so-positive mentions out of the way
as none of these are really deal
breakers and I would strongly recommend
this for first time builders so check
this out now we get a side panel window
that could be wider but still is
revealing enough I'd like to point out
that the window is also attached with
screws that is a pleasant sight although
sorry to report it scratches easily a
simple nail swipe would introduce marks
the plastic finish has a fine brushed
aluminum look that adds a bit of
elegance close up the front panel is
easily removable with a built-in dust
filter and only one blue LED fan is
included inside the case for a little
touch of color with dual 140 mm fan
holes available at the front as well
also notice a fairly open hard drive
cage design that would help with air
flow above the two five and a quarter
inch drive base is the front IO with
power and reset switch mic and headphone
jack with two USB 3 ports and
color-matched power led the top panel
has a built-in fine mesh
prevent and the settling dust it is
removable with two thumb screws at the
back to reveal this height advantage
that would allow users to use the space
for a thick radiator and actually have
more internal clearance above the
motherboard for example I installed the
38 millimeter thick radiator at the top
and kept the fans below for a less
cluttered interior and this space is
compatible with dual 120 or 140
millimeter fans and the back we find the
120mm fan mount with some height
adjustment just slight eight PCI slots
and thumb screws that stay with the
panel on both panels I love this feature
coming to the bottom a large dust filter
spends the entire floor I really dislike
these type of dust filters as they are
extremely cumbersome to remove and
install back but at least the case is
fully dust proof on the inside there are
many cutouts for cable management either
drive cage can be removed to accommodate
for extra airflow or have that mid
section completely open with one cage on
the floor and one at the top to allow
clearance for GPUs longer than 11 inches
also the cage platform is removable that
would allow installation of dual 120mm
fans for extra airflow at the bottom
coming around to the back I was honestly
surprised to find these two SSD brackets
that are easy to remove what with a
thumb screw and are facing towards the
front of the chassis that makes cable
routing easier then if they were to face
down the spacing is also plenty to talk
away any cables and the rear and here is
a finished system
I love how spacious it feels and that
extra height advantage complements all
in one water cooling systems beautifully
I was even able to slightly color match
the build to the blue LED fan with a
blue ring plate on the cooler and also
some blue accents on the GTX 970 now if
there is one thing that I would suggest
that would make this the best budget
case we've reviewed that would be the
inclusion of rubber grommets there are
just so many cutouts around the
motherboard that reveal all the cabling
behind it and while it's a clean system
regardless at least having rubber
grommets for the two large cutouts in
the front and the power supply
would be nice and last thing cable
management was a total breeze there are
many key without points all over the
back and I made sure they were as flat
as possible
so what Silverstone has released here is
an outstanding an almost perfect frame
to accommodate for any hardware
requirements for you build some corners
have to be cut to preserve that really
competitive $65 price but fortunately
all the elements that add to enjoyable
and seamless building experience were
preserved and knowing Silverstone will
most likely see an upgraded version of
the KL 0 5 with perhaps premium
materials and more refined interior but
until then the keel 0 5 is one of those
cases to consider if it's in your budget
this is a damn good value product so
guys thank you so much for watching make
sure you subscribed as we have a value
case showdown coming your way shortly
