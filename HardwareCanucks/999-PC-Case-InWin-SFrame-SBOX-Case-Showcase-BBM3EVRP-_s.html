two-time case of the Year winner fantex
the always incredible Corsair and NCIX
so after visiting and win at CES it is
clear that they are really reaching for
the high-end market share on the
showcase they had the s frame the
chassis is unique in so many ways but
the major wow factor is the frame itself
it is unibody meaning it is all one
single piece of aluminum that has been
bent or manually over 30 times and this
has to be done manually as there's no
manufacturing process in place that can
do these many folds so from that
standpoint you can appreciate the
workmanship and the manual labor of two
individuals that goes into production of
each single s frame the one on display
is the special edition gold with accents
everywhere so this is a very specific
themed case even the thumbscrews on the
doors are gold and internal draft
caddies are also gold the tempered glass
panels revealed the build and the very
open concept should tell you this is
more of an art piece or a system
showcase piece or even collector's item
I've rather than a chassis you would
normally use however they've also
revealed the prototype for the masses
also built out of full aluminum and
tempered glass we are looking at a more
conventional designed form with evident
chamber separation this is the in with s
box for example this entire front
portion is slightly wider than the rest
of the body and this would be your drive
cage that is ventilated but I don't see
any intake fans so that might be a
problem there are two five and a quarter
inch bays at the top but then facing the
back also might be problematic as access
will be inconvenient and potentially
difficult on the inside we are looking
at the e-atx support maximum a dedicated
fan bracket on the side for the drive
cage for intake and dual 140 member fan
mounts up top and a really large and
open interior so give us a like if you
want to see a review of either the s
frame or the s box and thanks for
watching our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
