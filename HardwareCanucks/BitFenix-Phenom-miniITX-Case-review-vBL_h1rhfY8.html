knocks and welcome back to another
review
now beat phalanx recently rolled out
with a new line of phenome cases giving
us the micro ATX and mini ITX options so
they actually look identical because
both use the exact same housing same
soft touch coated panels to create a
rather simple design kind of love it or
hate it type of style same dual dust
filter at the top and unless you open
them up or check out the rear you really
want on the difference so this is the
Phenom Mini ITX priced at $79.99 are
completely different functions with mini
ITX sole focus on water cooling support
while micro ATX with multiple expansion
slots unlike with the micro ATX version
the power supply is actually located at
the back in its normal spot we also get
an exhaust fan and a clamp style PCI
bracket but sadly the side panel does
not feature any ventilation which is
kind of a big deal
the GPU will certainly not stay cool and
it is a little surprising that we don't
see any different side panel options
power supply intake is filtered plus we
get these nice rubber case feet all the
connections are attached to the side
panel just like on the Phenom M with
only 2 USB 3 ports plus a USB 2 adapter
is included and I really think placing
them on top of the case at the front
would have made things a lot easier as
dealing with that many cables introduces
more hassle plus the two optional SSD
slots if utilized will be quite
difficult to route and we all know the
best thing about the chassis aside from
functionality is user friendly assembly
and taking off the front panel we get
our front intake and notice the second
120mm fan has to be mounted on five and
a quarter inch metal cover and this
starts to look very familiar to the
prodigy I also don't like the fact that
ventilation strips are almost closed
with a few circular cutouts but this in
a nutshell is a prodigy with a phenom
look what Beatrix is trying to do here
is recycle the design with a slight
facelift and I think this is a good idea
for those not completely in love with
the prodigy look as this would be the
alternative the interior design is
is not the best and it's disappointing
we haven't seen anything changed from
The Prodigy 11 months ago still rear
mount a power supply without an extended
bracket to allow longer units true you
might not need a unit longer than 160
millimeters but it is about having
options the top drive gauge is to list
easy removal which cleans up 12 inches
for your GPU with the front fans
installed so this can easily turn into a
powerhouse just too bad there isn't any
ventilation for your GPU the oddly
placed 5 in accordance drive cage at the
top is to be utilized for extra storage
as a bracket is included that can house
an SSD and a mechanical drive at the
same time I like the fact that this
option is included but it's not
efficient and removing it would get rid
of the stability for the top drive cage
the power supply cage also the main
support for the motherboard is quite
open with cutouts has its own bracket to
mount the unit from the rear and while
our 180 millimeter 1000 watt power
supply is completely overkill for a mini
ITX system it just shows that longer
power supplies do not fit cable routing
tow is completely simple thanks to an
ample of room on each side of the unit
and large cut outs the phantom mini ITX
is targeted for water coolers the rest
of the drive cage can be removed as well
with a few screws at the bottom plus the
case feet as they do block some screws
and what this allows you to do is
install a 240mm radiator and push pool
and the best part of all this it doesn't
affect the GPU as you can see with our
GTX 590 installed there's certainly
clearance between the rad and if your
main purpose is water cooling at small
scale this definitely serves a purpose
without compromise with the bottom drive
cage removed you can still mount three
SSDs one on the floor and the two on the
power supply cage wall and aside from
front water cooling support the top can
be utilized for that as well with 180
millimeters of clearance until the
motherboard and looking at the finished
build aside from not having clearance
for our long power supply it cleans up
well and just impressive that this sort
of interior design is almost without
compromises except there should be
ventilation for the side panel and I'm
sure beat Phenix is kicking themselves
for this
very important design flaw also I think
the bottom drive cage could have had an
extra spot it looks like there's enough
room and the rear looks completely clean
and just putting that side panel on is a
pain
now what big Phoenix is done is take
away the flexible handles and add a new
front cover to create the Phenom lineup
the basic idea is still there create a
minimalistic and simple chassis that can
handle internal water cooling and the
final mini ITX achieves this perfectly
and the still growing popularity of the
prodigy cage shows off exactly that you
can water cool without compromises in
such small form-factor but the biggest
flaw I see with the case is miss
potential this was a chance for big
Phoenix to show that they're listening
to critical feedback about very
inconvenient silent connections and all
the wiring that consequently follows the
lack of appropriate ventilation at the
front and complete absence of it on the
side make me want to buy a drill and do
it myself
I'm very surprised this was released
like that but let us know what you guys
think of the phenom lineup we will be
giving away both the micro ATX and mini
ITX versions of the chassis so leave
your thoughts down below and we'll see
you in the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
