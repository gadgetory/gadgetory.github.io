Canucks and in our previous noble
ground-up video we compared three high
end gaming laptops starting at $2,500
all the way up to 5k not all of us have
the means to invest on such expensive
machines nor do we need that much power
so today we will be taking a look at the
P 57 W from gigabyte the z9e oh by all
means all the right features on a budget
with a large windowed side panel 5
included fans and the excellent interior
layout with super simple cable
management get it now link in the
description below it's priced a little
north of $1700 which I would say it's a
reasonable price bracket for a 17 inch
form factor and specs but a smaller
model the p55 W can be picked up for
$1400 hardware wise I love the powerful
combination of an i7 16 gigabytes of RAM
256 gigabyte m2 SSD along with a one
terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive a gtx 970m
and a 17.3 inch 1080p IPS display the
above average price here is because of
the faster CPU and a larger display it
is IPS so viewing angles and contrast
ratio are excellent it's also really
bright at max settings and since its
matte coated you can say goodbye to
reflections and no backlit bleed
detected thumbs up gigabyte the build
quality reminds me of the p55 which is
okay but improvements could be made the
screen is pretty rigid thanks to the
tough plastic material but prepare to
clean it often as the surface tends to
pick up a ton of fingerprints the
notebook weighs about 6 pounds which in
my eyes is very portable for a 17 inch
laptop especially coming from the 8
pound msi gt72 and as you can see it's
nearly half the size of that monster 4
ports we have a Kensington lock Gigabit
Ethernet two USB 3.0 ports and SD card
reader a separate headphone microphone
jack on the other side we have our power
input VGA output mini DisplayPort HDMI
2.0 USB 3.1 type C port and is
Ingle USB 3.0 port at the front you'll
find a blu-ray drive which is so
unnecessary I'd rather have a slimmer
profile but luckily you can substitute a
drive in that spot for extra storage
placement of the eject button though is
totally annoying it's right underneath
your thumbs so there's no way to avoid
accidental presses the speakers are
placed at the front they're okay to
listen to casual tunes but you won't be
blown away
I would have preferred front-facing
speakers as they project sound a lot
better sadly I encountered issues with
the headphone jack on our sample often
times I had to plug it numerous times
for the notebook to actually recognize
the headphone moving on to the keyboard
the typing experience on the P 57 was mm
okay I really enjoyed typing on its
younger brother the p55 but I'm not sure
what happened to gigabyte this time
keystrokes fell on Moshe with less
tactile feedback and there was quite a
bit of flex when typing as well it
features two levels of backlighting and
this can be useful in darker
environments gigabyte in our experience
have a poor history with trackpads
and the same applies here the surface is
pretty smooth for navigation but there's
quite a bit of latency with tracking and
the cursor was skipping frames the
primary left and right click buttons are
built into the trackpad no consistency
to press across the surface and we
prefer to have dedicated buttons but
gave me aside you can't really do
anything productive and I highly
recommend picking up an external Mouse
crack opening the notebook it's nice and
well laid out the GPU and CPU are cooled
by separate fans the m-dot to SSD is
upgradable our model dished out a little
over 500 megabytes per second on read
and 433 megabytes per second on write
with crystal disk mark and I want to
hear your thoughts on this is it fast
enough for our needs in 2016
let us know in the comments section down
below the RAM is also upgradeable to 32
gigabytes the hard drive is easily
accessible and overall gigabyte has done
a fantastic job with the internal layout
the 970m is a pioneer for the mid-tier
GPU space with acceptable results so if
you're looking to play medium to high
settings
1080p you'll totally be content the
division on this machine averaged at 47
frames per second
watchdogs at high settings ran a little
over 50 frames per second and for easy
run titles like csgo getting over 150
frames per second is a satisfactory
number temperatures were respectable to
the GPU hovered around 71 degrees C at
load and during idle it was sitting
around 41 degrees Celsius battery life
met our expectations for gaming laptop
with a respectable 4 hours of heavy
internet usage with max brightness
lowering that will eventually yield more
time it's interesting to see how these
large gaming oriented notebooks are
becoming more popular as they aim to
close the gap between portable space and
desktop replacements and let us know how
likely you are to choose a 17 inch
notebook over something smaller for
conclusion the P 57 w was a good machine
with a nice display competitive specs
and great performance the price premium
or the 15-inch variant is a tough sell
though especially when the extra cost
does nothing to improve the poor
trackpad nor the speakers this notebook
is a perfect example of how simple
hardware specs on everything as there's
nothing particularly interesting or
exciting about the P 57 I think those
wanting a 17 inch notebook wanted for
everything it has to offer
taking into account usability plus
performance and we feel the user
experience of this machine needs to be
improved to stand out within the market
today let us know your thoughts on this
form factor and reasons why you would
pick the 17 inch over the 15 inch given
the same specs
I'm Ebert with high reckon axe thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
