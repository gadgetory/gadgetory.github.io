possible without the innovative fantex
world-leading nvidia graphics memory
partner Corsair and the retail partner
NCIX along with Silverstone and in win
at computex coolermaster was leaning a
lot towards modularity and how gamers
and modders can add that personal touch
to their products especially with the
master case 5 we also took a quick
glimpse at some of the peripherals that
continued the trend of modular design
which in my opinion looks really cool
starting off with the headphones
coolermaster is playing around with an
idea of interchangeable drivers for over
the year headphones something we haven't
seen in the consumers fear yet this
perhaps could diversify the application
of the headphone with one particular set
of drivers tuned for gaming while
another set for music listening I'd love
to see coolermaster take this a step
further and allow you to build your
headphone with different sized ear cups
material of the frame ear cushions and
the headband they were also showcasing a
mouse with interchangeable surfaces that
were magnetized making the swap really
simple we've seen this modular concept
from a few companies now but it seems
cooler master is focusing on the
customization of the actual surface grip
and not the form this could perhaps lead
into an all modular design taking cues
from the madcatz broke at and logitech
so we can wait to see the final product
and these are all prototypes and cooler
master is still in the process of
refining some details and feedback is
always welcome proper cooling for your
laptop is essential if you want to take
full advantage of the performance of the
laptop without thermal throttling so you
guessed it coolermaster has also come up
with a modular cooling stand for your
notebook the aluminium build feels
sturdy and should act as a perfect heat
sink itself there are 21 40-millimeter
fans inside set to exhaust that will be
the main cooling force behind the stand
they have also added expansion for the
i/o of your laptop so you can pre route
your cables directly to the back for a
cleaner look
