great technology selection and service
the beach phoenix pond or enclosure is
one of those interesting attempts to
bring extra excitement into the case
category the original micro-atx pandora
had some unique design choices inside
and out and to continue this momentum
beat phoenix has released the ATX
version trying to wow individuals who
love this exterior design language the
pandora TXS price at 150 dollars with a
front display a key ad icon and $130
without it making this a TX tower sort
of in line with competing for towers
price-wise now I really love the
exterior direction they've decided to
take with these curved side panels that
wrap around the front
creating unmistakable brand recognition
with the Pandora Line the gap between
the metal panel and the front plastic
panel allows the air to enter thanks to
large intake ports on both sides of the
glossy surface the original Pandora took
the aluminum route which proved to be
difficult for Beach Phoenix to get right
so instead they've stuck to metal this
time around and one thing that I still
don't find satisfying is the overall
build quality and how the chassis feels
the side panels in particular are
massive and very thin creating these
lovely wave forms of the metal when
handling the side panel and the
attachment mechanism includes two pegs
in the front and two attached thumb
screws in the back which surprisingly
with just these few points of contact
they are so difficult to attach at the
back of the case and also the front
which in turn fueled is unsatisfying
built quality perception of this entire
Pandora lineup the window is large
enough though to reveal all the goodies
inside of it but falls victim to my nail
scratch test you gotta be careful when
handling that side panel the IO is at
the top with included PR buttons 2 4 USB
ports and audio then the entire top is
covered with the dust filter that is
removable in this open from the sides
fashion which is nice and easy and
inside we find pretty deep clearance for
triple 120 or dual 140 millimeter fans
and their respective Reed
sizes so the intent here is to install
everything above the frame because the
motherboard is right below those contact
points and this space is tall enough to
accommodate for thick olan ones with a
set of fans but first of all the frame
itself is restricting in its nature so
in my example when I'm trying to install
the radiator first the tubes interfere
the second issue is the metal frame
itself it is so thin I could easily bend
it one way or another and we again come
back to this point of poor execution of
build quality and then this price point
it is a massive turnoff
the airflow options for the front are
satisfactory with triple 120 or dual 140
mm outs the panel moves with ease you
just gotta be mindful of the icon
display and not pull out the cable here
a dust filter is present and needs to be
removed from the bottom and you can see
it's not fun at all
and also only covers the fan portions
leaving the five and a quarter inch slot
above it open to incoming dust
fortunately I found this space to work
great as a handle because at the back we
have this a reinforced handle just in
case for transportation while nothing at
the front so you can use that opening
and not rely on the plastic cover
because that can easily pop out now
despite the rounded front panel having
enough depth clearance for a set of fans
to be installed outside of the frame
because of the notches for the dust
filter all of your fan mountings will
have to be kept exclusively for the
interior which is fine as the floor on
the power supply chamber is cut to
accommodate for a 360 mm ER radiator
with a single set of fans but no push
pull with a 360 rad now here I installed
three 120mm fans for intake but the
Pandora ATX comes with a single 144
intake and a 124 exhaust coming inside
here we find a common chamber separation
which in my opinion is great to remain
competitive and no dedicated hard drive
cage to allow that front intake to be
least restrictive on top of the bottom
chamber we find two brackets one for
water cooling so for pumps and
reservoirs and there's also a bit of a
soft padding here to avoid vibrations
and the other one is
for your drive so either an SSD or a
three and a half inch drive there are no
cut outs right outside of the SATA
connector so keep that in mind for cable
routing and also the height of the drive
interferes with the bottom two PCI slots
and blocks access to those bottom
motherboard connectors but at least it
is easily removable if you need to
access that point on the motherboard to
the side of the motherboard we have two
SSD brackets that mount vertically so
you're OCD might kick in if you prefer
text and proper orientation especially
if you want both drives to face the same
cable cut out for easier connectivity as
one will be facing up and the other one
will be facing down but one thing I
noticed is how far these SSDs stick out
overlapping with the area where a
radiator would be installed at the front
and you can see that here SSD is further
out than where the 120 moment of fan
frame stops so this is very unfortunate
because in case a front radiator is
installed you lose both SSD mounts as
they simply will not fit coming around
till we find two more SSD brackets so
these might save the day and we have
also two more three and a half inch
drive brackets on the floor in front of
the power supply and I appreciate this
modular approach for spreading a storage
but if only the interior SSD brackets
weren't compromised by a potential
radiator now the build itself looks fine
although I really dislike these rubber
grommets because they fall out with just
a breath of air and also one thing to
keep in mind is CPU tower clearance as I
initially mounted the new master air
maker eight cooler by cooler master
which is way too tall so stick to towers
160 meters in height or shorter cable
management is a strong point for the
Pandora ATX so thumbs up we have these
large velcro straps and an appropriate
amount of cable ties all around to
secure all of your mess at the back and
this enclosed power supply chamber is a
great time saver oh and also there is a
removable dust filter underneath the
power supply now as for the icon display
it connects to an internal motherboard
USB and can display PNG
graphics only which is kind of cool to
customize the face of the case but it's
not the best of quality with poor
viewing angles and lacks the ability to
show any meaningful information like
temperatures or time you know incoming
email whatever so we can only do
graphics here no animation is possible
and if you want to show brand loyalty a
bit Phoenix adhesive logo is included
for preferred placement and that is the
story of the Pandora ATX I like the
consistency in design language with
unique wraparound side panels and this
strive that you can feel that they're
trying to be competitive with decent
interior options and modular approaches
but there is one area where improvements
must occur and that is build quality
big Phoenix to me always fell within the
lower tier in the build quality
department and unfortunately that has
not changed with the Pandora ATX
especially with those few minor
compatibility and clearance issues for
the top radiator inside SSD brackets and
all the thin metal all I can say is the
case is unique in some ways but it's not
unique enough and so that concludes this
