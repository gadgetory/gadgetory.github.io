been on top of their game from the very
beginning they entered the chasis market
they're more budget-conscious carbide
series has been very impressive with
delivery of practically everything we
need in the gaming chassis and this new
500 R is a sub $150 mid tower that packs
in a lot of features found on quarters
more expensive graphite and obsidian
series so good news for all the builders
as courser has now reached out for those
price conscious consumers as the chassis
market is becoming more and more
competitive this chassis is sort of a
mix between the 400r and the obsidian
650d so for those who like the interior
layout of the 650d with the airflow
options of 400 or you will have yourself
this 500 or so let's dive right into it
on the top a convenient cutout for
storage your power button hard drive
activity lights USB 3 ports your audio
and firewire LED off switch along with
the speed control for the front 2 fans
and they reset button the front panel
has four five the quarter inch drive
base all the dust filters and two
included 120 millimeter intake fans the
front side panel includes a mesh insert
with a 200 millimeter intake fan that
can also house two 120 or 140 millimeter
fans as well now take a look at the back
120 millimeter exhaust fan IOA area of 8
ventilated PCI slots water cooling holes
and they bottom mounted power supply
with a dual removable dust filter
speaking of dust filters coarser
includes easily removable top cover that
gives you access to the top pans
either 120 or 140 millimeter dual fans
can be installed and they also take into
account the wiring for your fans with a
little cutout to pass through all the
fan cables the backside panel has a
specific dent to provide a little extra
room for your cable management in the
back also a neat feature for your thumb
screws on the side panels this Corsair
has thought of a way to secure them to
the side panel so you never lose them
opening up the case it looks practically
identical to the 400 or and the only
interior modification is down to the
hard drive cage here we have a large CPU
backplate opening plenty of course
there's rubber grommets around the
motherboard tray for your cable
management and your removable hard drive
cages a feature that is both welcome and
should be set and standard for all
gaming chassis this allows for a number
of benefits for the user
like installation of longer video cards
and the extra airflow that will be
directed towards the main components but
if a need for extra storage
no modding is required just for thumb
screws to secure the cage back in place
also each of the cages can mount an
additional 120 millimeter fan on the
side to improve the overall airflow and
the tools mounting system for the 3.5
inch drive bay is nothing new and we
really like to incorporate a 2.5 inch
drive mounting holes so no need for
converters or designated space just to
mount your solid-state drives again the
feature that is extremely convenient and
makes it the assembly this much easier
also all the optical drive bays include
this tula securing mechanism take a look
at the back plenty of space for routing
your cables even for beginners and hold
by cables blend in with a black interior
for a tidy look coarser also took into
account the routing for your 8 pin CB
connection as now there is no
interference with the top panel since
the case is USB 3 ready
and connect through the internal 20-pin
connection Coursera provides USB 3 to
USB 2 adapter for those who do not own a
compatible motherboard so finally
putting our system into the case to no
surprise the 500-hour handles extremely
well both for hardware and cable
management with the top hard drive cage
removed GPUs on length of 17 point 8
inches can be installed otherwise twelve
point four inches support for the hard
drive cage in place this is both
future-proof and will handle any GPU on
the market with no problem due to the
designated dent in the side panel cable
management at the back becomes a breeze
considering this is targeted towards
beginners now with this many airflow
options this case supports dual 240
million rad if you want to install an
internal water cooling system and with
so much room the 500 R becomes a
pleasure to work with and this sort of
became an expectation when dealing with
courses chassis they seem to get it
right from the very first time and use
the concept of convenience and
practicality to bring competitors
chassis to the market the tools design
inside and out is how we like it with
plenty of room for cable management that
cleans up nicely with all of the rubber
grommets in plenty of airflow options to
keep an enthusiast setup cool with
support for internal water cooling and
the best part the 500 or is its price
being released at the retail of sub 100
$50
bring to the table the combination of
course there is best features the 500
are truly deserves the damn good word
thank you guys for watching and we'll
see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
