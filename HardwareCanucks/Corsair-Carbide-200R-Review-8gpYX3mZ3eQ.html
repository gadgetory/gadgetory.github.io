today we're taking a look at the budget
case from courser this is part of the
Carbide series the 200 are now I'm sure
many people appreciate the fact that
coarser is fine thinking about the price
conscious consumers and is able to
contribute to the vastly saturated
market of budget cases so let's see if
the $60 case is in any way unique or
it's just a standard black box that we
are so used to with a courser logo now
this price tag is the lowest we've seen
so far from coarser so the risk of
filing compromises and cutting corners
is definitely there but does it manage
to be functional well let's find out so
starting with the front panel the
connections are kept to a minimum with
two USB 3 ports your audio jacks and
your power and reset buttons then we
have three five and a quarter inch drive
base and blow that unfortunately a
closed front intake pulling air from
each side through the venting strips
that have a built in dust mesh now
courser includes a front 120mm intake
although I would like to see mounting
options for a 140 mm fan just to have a
little more cooling potential and an
additional 120mm fan can be installed
right below to cool the drive cage
however as you can see there isn't much
opening for the airflow now the front
panel is easily removable and we have
this brushed aluminum look on the
plastic it's a very convenient way to
add style to the chassis without paying
premium and moving to the top we have
dual fan support for 120 and 140 mm fans
with pre-installed rubber grommets which
is always a bonus
unfortunately no dust filters here but
we can't have it all at this price point
the side panel can house dual fans as
well with this vertical alignment for
cooling your GPU and your CPU and looks
like the route grommets are also
included here great to see these on such
a value case and we have a difficult
scene in the back 120 exhaust IO area 7
expansion starts with venting holes and
the bottom mount the power supply with a
removable dust filter the case is also
slightly elevated with rubber feet this
will allow your power supply to breathe
and prevent the chassis from wobbling
and make it a little more stable
all right so far so good no major issues
yet let's dive inside and see how it
handles with our usual gaming assembly
so right off the bat we have three tools
mountings for your optical drives GPU
and air flow opening an SSD cage and the
3.5 inch drive cage below are two lists
and extremely easy to work with the SSD
cage can house four drives they simply
slide in place and are held in by clips
on each side and you can also secure
them by screws so they're not going
anywhere and this would actually work
really well for a raid configuration one
thing though are the cables facing
inside that will add the bit to the
cable clutter and the drive cage below
also uses the same concept of just slide
in place and the drives are secured by
clips and screws as well so continuing
with the internals it looks very similar
to every other coarser case simply
because it works like the cutouts around
the motherboard for routing your cables
yes they are not grommeted but they
still serves the same function a rear
exhaust fan is included and you can
mount an additional intake for the
bottom unfortunately no dust filter here
however clearance will depend on the
length of your power supply so in this
case anything up to 160 millimeters
would allow for either 140 or a 120mm
fan and in the back we have some cable
tie notches and the area below the
motherboard is indented to give you a
little more room for cables and notice a
slightly longer cut out for you eight
pin connector which would come in useful
for wiring any top fans now one thing
that impressed me was the consideration
to offset the mounting holes for the top
120mm fans from the rear exhaust fan now
this would allow for a rear or top
radiators to be installed without
interfering with the fan of course if
you are mounting a dual rat at the top
you most likely will run into clearance
issues with your motherboard and it
would be nice to be able to have that
option
despite its value status the courser is
standing strong behind their tools
commitment towards assembly the 200 R
comes with the motherboard standoffs
already pre-installed so your workflow
is completely hassle-free and the only
time you'll need the screwdriver is to
secure
your motherboard in place so how does it
handle longer graphics cards no problem
with just under 17 inches of clearance
for the top slot and anything up to 12
inches with the your SSDs connected and
all wired up there's really nothing to
complain about with regards to cable
management and they cleaned up pretty
well for under five minutes spent on
wiring so to wrap it up the new car by
200 are offers great value for a mid
tower we have easy to ask workflow
excellent drive gauge support for long
graphics cards and direct airflow into
the motherboard area however while it is
not intended for water cooling having
such an option is a bonus and the little
extra clearance at the top
wouldn't hurt and having fully meshed
front panel would allow for better
airflow but as I've said already do 200
are serves as an excellent entry-level
budget gaming chassis with great
functionality that offers pretty much
everything we want and deserves a damn
good value award so I hope you guys
enjoyed the review and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
