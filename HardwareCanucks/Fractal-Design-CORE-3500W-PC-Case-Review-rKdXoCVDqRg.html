great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dimitri with her
broken axe and the core series from
fractal design is there value
concentrated line they remove some of
the features to hit a specific price
point but they've always been able to
stick to their core formula of
uncompromised cooling ease of assembly
and outstanding build quality and their
less-is-more foundation here is fitting
so this is the core 3500 windowed the
latest line of fractal case is priced at
$89 and $10 less for the non windowed
model that follows that simple
Scandinavian design that we've come to
love from the company so in short the
3500 utilizes the same internal frame as
the defined our committee and the
definer for just with a few
modifications this is the first chassis
from fractal with an angular front panel
as we usually see curves they have
maintained the brushed plastic that
looks excellent without the messy
characteristic of the brushed aluminum
as you see the panel is mainly closed
with ventilation on each side
with built in dust filters a single 140
mm er fan is included at the front and
you can put a second intake fan for
improved thermals up top we get two USB
3 ports audio jacks and PR buttons and
dual 140 and 120 mm fan mounts with
120mm fan holes offset to allow better
compatibility with radiators and
fractals and has always been great to
consider such an important element Auto
to cut down on the price the core 3500
does not have a top dust filter coming
around to the back a standard seen here
with a 140 mm air exhaust fan seven PCI
slots and a fan controller that has now
been relocated to this middle section it
is molex powered with three fan headers
but you'll have to deal with this
obvious wiring that I'm not a fan of
they are black cables so that's
appreciated
although the exiting tips are not
sleeved that would have been nice and as
you can see how to route the molex below
the power supply for appropriate
connection and I really would love to
see the hub relocated behind the
motherboard for any future models
the key stands on top feet plus we get a
large dual dust filter at the bottom for
the power supply and the optional fan
mount so with our 170 memory units or
below both 140 and 120 member fans will
fit in just fine and I really love
fractals approach towards windowed side
panels especially the tint and the
styling that has become sort of their
staple just like the brushed plastic on
the front and for the internals aside
from the V located fan hub not much has
changed as their core equation for the
frame and layout is excellent to begin
with what we have here is a minimalist
approach so only one drive cage is
present here with excellent opening for
direct air delivery and 11 half inches
for your GPU clearance for the bottom
three PCI slots I love their metal drive
caddies when centered SSD mounts that
are sturdy with rubber grommet to
prevent any vibration noise of course
taking into account additional water
cooling options the drive gauge can be
relocated slightly behind allowing a
240mm radiator to fit at the front this
of course comes with some compromises
for example the drive gauge blocks the
bottom vent intake and GPU clearance for
the bottom three PCI slots drops to 10
inches also with the drive cage in the
second position at 280 memory radiators
will not have clearance due to the width
of the frame of the drive cage
however everything is well laid out at
the rear with such a set up for routing
and I also love the small considerations
to include cutouts for the front fan
cables that are also sleeve by the way
so clean routing is almost an
expectation and the rear we have many
cable type points plus almost an inch
for cable routing and a small sleeve at
the bottom to talk
cables there are also two SSD mounts but
even despite the lower price tag I
really would have liked to see SSD
brackets instead as removing the SSDs
would require entire disassembly as
you'll have to get behind the amount of
I would say double-sided tape is your
friends until we can see similar
brackets as we saw on the arc mini r2
also you can notice how small the CPU
cutout is and I'll definitely would like
to see that enlarged but if any bigger
and we would see even more unstable
motherboard tray as there's practically
no support on the right and it does
exhibit a lot of flex as you can see and
finally looking in the finished build as
expected it cleans up well plus we've
had plenty of experience with this frame
in the past as the highly popular
definer for and the arc MIDI r2 are
practically identical with a few minor
differences same story of the rear with
controlled cable mess and just a joy to
build inside the core 3500 a small gripe
over is the length of the front panel
audio cable it is very short and doesn't
even reach the motherboard on our sample
now we do have just two inches of
clearance up top but as mounting holes
are offset closer to the side panel that
shouldn't really be an issue and for the
conclusion it's easy to see why fractal
hasn't done much with the layout as
they've got a great frame with excellent
cooling flexible water cooling options
with relocation of the drive cage
without compromising on storage capacity
proper cable management and ease of
assembly and at this price point it's
great to see rubber grommets and a fan
controller and an awesome side pan
window however it lacks top dust filter
I'm not fond of the fan how placement
also appreciate its presence front panel
audio cable is too short plus no
brackets for SSDs and rear and while
these are all features we usually see in
more expensive cases it's definitely
direction I'd love to see fractal to go
to compete against likes of fan text and
latest NZXT offerings so make sure to
check out the following reviews to get a
good sense of how competitive the sha
C's market is becoming and why all these
tiny details we're mentioning now are
going to be sort of your main deciding
factors and what case to purchase for
your future bill so as always thanks for
