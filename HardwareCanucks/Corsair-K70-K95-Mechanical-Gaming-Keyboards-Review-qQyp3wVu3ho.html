back to another eric next review so of
course they recently released sort of an
update to the very popular keyboards the
K 60 and the K 90 so what we have here
is a black anodized version of the K 70
a solo edition on the K 70 and a bigger
brother the K 95 now you definitely
don't have to pay a premium for these
keyboards these are not cheap $150 for
the K 95 and the black anodized version
of the K 70 and $130 for the silver
edition of the K 70 now these keyboards
have received a lot of attention from
the gaming community that's because
Corsair has taken the feedback that was
given based on their K 60 and K 90
designs and they've improved with with
these with these releases by adding all
these features that we've been asking
for so aside from the irregular MX
cherry-red switches which are excellent
for gaming very fast response time
aluminum body which is a really really
solid construction throughout we have
customizable individual led keys so now
you can either turn them off or on for
any key that you want which is not
really practical for gaming but still
pretty awesome to map out your WASD zone
and your killing zone and any other
often used keys now all these keyboards
have the MX cherry red switches
identical from the previous sesor they
are linear and don't have tactile
feedback which I personally find best
for gaming they also need only 40 grams
of force to be registered so it's a very
light key now those who have not used
linear switches in the past you will
find that your typing will improve and
your gaming response will also improve
that's because the key balance is almost
instantaneous the keys never Jam and
there's just no reason to stick to the
conventional rubber dome switches if
your main purpose is gaming now the K
70k 95 have a few new features that we
didn't see in the case 60 first the
keyboard now is 100% mechanical whereas
the F keys on the K 60 were not second
the color option now we have the black
version which looks fantastic
although doesn't conceal fingerprints as
well as the silver third this key
illumination which is red
the black anodized version and blue for
the silver k70 and white on the black
k95 now the red on black and white on
black combination is really something
very pleasing to the eye the blue and
silver however seems significantly
brighter and was actually very
uncomfortable to look at at full
brightness it was very distracting no
likely you can turn down the brightness
to preserve your eyesight now the extra
cherries that each key LED can either be
turned on or off so allowing your
preference to be the boss of what's lit
up and what's not now the issue of
non-uniform backlight is present here
despite the high price that's because
the LED is located on the top of each
key
therefore introducing a brightness
gradient as you move down the key it's
also much visible for individual letters
but very much noticeable with the tab
shift entire numbers line and the fourth
new feature is the bios switch now first
notice the numbers one two four and
eight these represent your response time
so one two four and eight millisecond
response time these might be useful to
synchronize the response time of your
mouse but in reality you most likely
won't even notice the difference however
the last switch is the bios which which
corsair has added to a lot of
compatibility with older bios you most
likely will never have to use this but
it's still there in case you are trying
to enter the bios using the usual
conventional f5 or delete keys and
nothing's happening so switching on this
bios makes your keyboard compatible with
that bios now right there beside it is
the USB port and this is excellent to
have because it connects through its own
cable so users aren't limited with the
type of devices you can connect also
each keyboard has a very comfortable
armrest which is rubberized and has a
slight texture which prevents your pumps
from sticking to the body and we also
have a set of media controls with a
volume wheel now the k95 as you can see
has an overkill of programmable buttons
on the left side the total of 18 G keys
with three profiles so you do the math
of how many combinations are possible
well 54 in total and if anybody can
utilize and populate those program
buttons you're a champ
now the key 70 comes with an extra set
of texture
gaining keys with a key remover that
will help you contain your fingers
within your killing zone with a slight
curve on the key and sort of this
anti-slip texture however we don't have
anywhere to put the keys that are not
used and it would be awesome to be able
to mount these to the back of the
keyboard meaning you'll never lose them
now one comes to anti-ghosting the k70
features full anti-ghosting so you can
literally press the entire keyboard at
the same time and each key is going to
be registered whether it's useful or not
that's up to you
the k95 however has 20 key rollover
meaning you can only use 20 keys
simultaneously and the next key is not
going to be registered so you'll
definitely not be having any issues by
crouching throwing a grenade turning on
the flashlight firing looking through
binoculars and things like that
so then this raises the question of what
is wrong with the keyboard I mean we
have mechanical switches excellent
quality aluminum construction media
controls and individually lead LED keys
and a comfortable armrest that doesn't
take too much real estate on your desk
for the K 70 keyboard we have extra set
of gaming keys for the K 95 which is
more focused for strategy and MMOs a lot
of programmable buttons and all have
full USB pass-through which kind of
makes this keyboard sort of an ideal
candidate for any type of game now
although of course there is not
releasing the ski boards with any other
switches which could be seen as a
negative
I find that MX cherry Reds are
appropriately placed here for gaming and
also for typing so this really brings
down the question of price into this
picture as it's a hefty amount to spend
on the keyboard but you sure won't be
disappointed if you do get any of these
keyboards and we're giving them the hard
work knocks damn grant award so this
concludes a review of the K 70 and K 95
keyboards if you were to get any of
these keyboards which one would you get
and why leave your comments down below
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
