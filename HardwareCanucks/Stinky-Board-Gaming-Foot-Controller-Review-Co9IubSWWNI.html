great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Huracan
ox and when we were first approached by
stinky to review this a stinky board we
had her recognize were a little
skeptical and honestly hesitant
accepting anything from a company with
this name seriously it is one of those
names that is what inducing but after we
stink they're over got all of the laughs
our our system it was time to take
stinky for real but before the review
were giving away - stinky boards - to
lucky gamers who wanted the most and can
utilize the board to its full potential
so leave a comment down below of what
games you would use this with and what
type of key bindings you would set with
a comment below and we would choose two
winners so on the review for today we
have their stinking video gaming foot
board it's a tool designed to add extra
functionality for your games
by utilizing your feet with a $100 price
that is a little steep so I'll start
with the packaging inside a wall
protected and came broken box you
receive three sets of various resistant
Springs that they're color-coded for a
total of four Blue Springs that are soft
for green ones that are medium to red
ones with the highest resistance and
optional yellow Springs for super soft
effect lastly an allen key that is used
to replace the springs is included a
2-meter micro USB cable and a stinky
sticker the foot controller itself is
built wall it is designed to take some
abuse first because you'll be stomping
on it in the heat of battle and instead
of smashing your keyboard if you've been
cumulated you might channel that energy
into the footboard instead and if you
encounter more humiliation
the aluminum plate on the top the hard
plastic outer shell and the steel
internals all reinforce our confidence
in the build quality department multiple
rubber feet stabilized the board
regardless of how much pressure and from
which direction it's applied and I love
the lock and tunnel for the USB cable
that you can replace our time and it
will protect the main connector joint
from long-term tension size wise I think
it's a moderate fit for your feet any
smaller and you might encounter unwanted
presses on any of the keys and any
bigger would make single food operation
more difficult there are two red LEDs on
the top they only light up for
registration of the two corresponding
switches I found the sticky texture
helpful to determine correct orientation
of the board as it can be used
horizontally and vertically so the
premise behind this product is there are
4 MX cherry blue switches inside the
board one on each side that can be
mapped to anything from your keyboard
thus if used correctly can complement
your gameplay greatly stinky emphasizes
the footboard is designed to accompany
your mouse and keyboard and not really
replace it once you place your foot on
the top it supports it without unwanted
presses in either direction and applying
a bit of pressure will tilt the main
cover and activate the corresponding
switch generally the travel is smooth
and the bounce back is fast enough so
you can perform multiple presses one
after another without issues and this is
where you can customize the feel of each
direction with tension Springs this user
flexibility is very much appreciated and
important based on your personal usage
and how much pressure you are
comfortable with applying for example I
put the red spring for the heel switch
because I wanted to avoid it being
registered if I rest my foot off-center
and closer to the bottom and I also
replace the top switch to the lightest
spring so I don't have to apply a lot of
force to activate it one thing to keep
in mind is how low the entire
construction is when the switch is
activated the top cover practically
meets the floor at this point and this
could introduce compatibility issues
with thick carpet
so after setting up the software for my
style it's pretty basic you select the
desired switch choose from the four
actions that include normal that
register the key bind continuously while
the board is pressed key down activates
only a single actuation even if you hold
the board down
next is pulse the key bind which is a
set amount of clicks per second and each
switch can be disabled as well the only
downside here we have no macro
recordings with the software but if your
keyboard supports macro recordings you
can remap those macros to the sync
keyboard also they have not still added
mouse support so you can only add
keyboard bindings to this board and plus
multiple profiles can be created that
can auto launch with an executable so I
tried using this with Adobe Audition and
my Adobe CC package to edit then exactly
work but it still auto launch that
profile that I've created for my editing
suite while it can also do the same
thing for all your games and once I had
all that setup it was time to take
stinky for a spin so it is recommended
to start with only one switch for your
game time this way you get comfortable
with the board and remember to use it
the first thing that came to my mind is
remapping the voice talk function in
most games as I don't want to distract
my already busy wast zone and this
worked beautifully having this function
not under any finger on the mouse or
keyboard but under my heel it's a unique
way to bypass some awkward to reach
keyboard keys then I want to get more
comfortable and using the entire board
so my FPS profile looked like this with
the Crouch and prone we mapped along
with left out that are used for voice
and Y for team chatter for csgo for
example having those functions Keys
remap made my warzone completely
independent as I could perform my most
common actions with the foot board
instead and it didn't feel weird at all
after some time and became more natural
to actually use the board and release
some tension from my left hand this is
one of those gaming products that may
actually never be used by the pros
because they are already good at what
they do but my gaming experience
actually
you went to a different level as I get
to experience my keyboard functions a
different way as I could remap certain
things that I hate on a keyboard on to
the sting keyboard and that way improve
my efficiency and give me a little bit
better gaming experience it is a cool
item to try out and I actually found
myself coming back to it once not using
it for a couple of gaming sessions but
it is $100 for for extra additional
functions so the value there is a bit
stinky in that sense also you cannot
register two keys at the same time and
therefore realistically it can never
replace WASD zone but it's still a
really cool product to complement your
keyboard and mouse it is a well built
product and it's functional and it's
clearly designed for gamers who want to
experiment with moving some key bindings
around and you for example can remap
some of the things that you really don't
like on the keyboard on to the sting
keyboard I had fun with it and will
definitely live under my desk for a
little longer so guys thank you so much
for watching let us know what you think
of the stinky foot controller and how
would use it with the comment below for
a chance to win one as always thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
