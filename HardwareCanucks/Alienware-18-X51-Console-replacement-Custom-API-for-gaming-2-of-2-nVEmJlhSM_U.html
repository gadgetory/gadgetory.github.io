and he's going to talk to us about some
of the new things that are being
released with this something you
announced at e3 so first of all the x51
it's a it's not a new product but you
guys have done some upgrades to it so
tell us about the alienware x51 and
exactly where does it fit within the
whole gaming pc / console market yeah
the x51 we we originally released it
back of January 2012 but this year we
upgrade it with the latest Ivy Bridge
processors as well as next-generation
nvidia geforce graphics card so we've
got the 700 series graphics cards in
place now the system we like to call it
a console size gaming PC it's just a
little bit larger than your older xboxes
it's made to either be set up on a
desktop or placed into a living room
next to a TV and it has an aesthetic to
match that so that it doesn't stand out
in a living room either we've been able
to pack a ton of power into the sky into
the system so if you get the base
configuration you're going to be able to
play your games at 30 frames per second
it's only 699 price point which is the
lowest price point that you can start
out with an alienware and then if you
want to configure up the system to over
a thousand dollars you're going to be
able to have 1080p gaming on your big
screen TV at over 60 frames per second
and that's what we really designed the
system to do in the system fully
upgradeable as new graphics and new
processing systems and technologies come
out every year you can upgrade the
system it's made with
desktop arts and so you can continually
stay on the edge of performance and
outpaced those console games right so in
terms of the 699 base price for the x51
stock model so that featuring i three
eight gigs of ram yeah what is it it's
featuring an i3 eight gigs of ram a one
terabyte hard drive in a GTX 645
graphics card at the base right and how
about comparable as well as a
slot-loading DVD Drive this one and how
is that comparable to the next gen
consoles like a ps4 in terms of
performance so that will be on par with
next gen consoles in terms of
performance you'll still be able to play
1080p graphics and you'll still have
over 30 frames per second on those games
if you want to outpace those next gen
consoles I would recommend upgrading to
either an 8 99 or a 1099 configs right
so in this roundtable discussion you
guys brought up the idea of you guys are
working with game developers and custom
API that allows the game to interact
with the color options on your alienware
machine so can tell us about what's
going on I'm titles are in the
development and things like that so we
call the technology alien FX in each one
of our systems has between three and
eight different lighting zones that you
can control on the computer all of those
are controlled via an API which we give
to game developers so the game
developers can program that API into
their game so that the lighting on your
system can change depending on what's
going on in game so in battlefield 3 as
an example when you're getting shot at
your system will flash red at you to
tell you that you're losing health and
that you need to do something right
we've worked with you know EA in
battlefield 3 that's a huge title we
worked with a lot of smaller titles as
well we have over 50 games currently
within our portfolio that support alien
FX and we're continually looking to
onboard new developers whether it's game
developers or other software as well
right and so you announced a few
machines at e3 now they're finally
making their way into Canada so tell us
about the debate I guess the the monster
notebook sound so the monster notebook
is the alienware 18 it is an 18 inch
gaming laptop it comes standard with
dual graphics card configurations in the
nvidia sli it has a 1080p IPS screen at
its base so you're going to get better
viewing angles with that type of screen
and it's going to have better brightness
and you would if you are going to get
another type of screen right and led the
system starts with i7 processors and
eight gigs of RAM if you can figure up
the system you can get up to three
different hard drives that fit within it
and you can also get overclocked
processors as well you can get in either
factory overclocked where we overclock
it and send it straight to you or you
can choose to overclock the system
yourself deeper first so what are the
advantages of people going with an
alienware versus building something
themselves when you get looking into a
desktop the alienware x51 the small form
factor of this system is going to be
very hard to construct on your own as
well though I think there are a few
options out there where people have
tried to really get into that but you
might be pinching your fingers a little
bit inside the tiny case but when it
comes to gaming in general you know if
you want to build your own system go for
it we fully support it we understand
that that's a big part of what makes PC
gaming
cool but an alienware system is going to
come to you out of the box it's going to
work you're going to know all of those
components have been tested to be fully
compatible with each other deliver a
high level of performance and if you
ever have any problems we're there with
warranty and support that can help you
all right thanks man yeah thank you all
right so guys this is a wrap it's been
sort of a cool event talking about the
future of gaming talking to Big Blue
kiss and bunch of guys from alienware
right right behind me it's really cool
the 4k gameplay of the latest batman
game which is quite amazing to see in
such high resolution the form and
monitor that has not yet been released
I'm not allowed to give you any more
information about it but it's definitely
a technology that's making its way into
the consumer world and becoming more
accessible so again thanks for watching
and we'll see you in next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
