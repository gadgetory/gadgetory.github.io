keyboard is it the build the simplicity
of the design features like RGB lighting
programmable macros the switch type I
think it's safe to say that we all have
our preferences when it comes to
mechanical keyboards some may not like
having RGB lighting some may want pretty
much everything that could on a
mechanical keyboard some may just prefer
a simpler and cleaner looking keyboard
that can just get the job done for
instance take this corsair k95 platinum
mechanical keyboard i was fortunate
enough to test it out and you can check
out my full review over here but to sum
it up it was Corsairs best offering that
came with all the bells and whistles
like RGB lining programmable macros
dedicated media playback buttons
detachable wrist rest and a faster
switch that I fell in love with
instantly all for $200 now on the
opposite end of the spectrum there's
this guy the input club night fox that's
set to retail for a hundred and eighty
nine dollars and check this out it's
plain simple very compact that's for
sure when compared to the K 95 but it's
still a keyboard that's targeted towards
a completely different demographic you
may recall my review of the white fox of
wild back and I absolutely loved it
because of its compact nature build and
the seamless integration with my setup
but most importantly I felt like I was
being part of an enthusiast community
just so you're aware you can preorder
both the night box and the white fox
from the corner store that's directly
managed by input Club expected shipping
date on these models are set to February
18th of 2018 and you can check out my
full review of the white fox if you're
interested right over here but today
we're going to be talking about the
night fox and see what it brings to the
table when you compare to the white fox
which you know I long to see isn't that
different but we'll get into it but
first a quick message from our sponsor
so it was kind of love at first sight
you know there's really nothing like
this exterior I love the metallic color
the tinted glass panel the RGB fans at
the front it's basically a see-through
case and who doesn't love that your
graphics card can go vertical the top is
radiator friendly and the right side is
so unique when exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got
with
age 500p my coolermaster check it out
inscription below alright so from a
design perspective there's not a lot to
talk about here since it resembles the
white fox this guy features dark black
primarykey caps and bright color accents
that contains just a hint of orange but
my sample was a bit brighter and from my
conversations with input Club they're
working very hard to achieve that strong
red accent with the production models so
that it can complement the rest of the
keyboard as for the layout you'll be
missing out on dedicated function keys
and the numpad is totally out of
question but you can program commands to
the keys through software and we'll talk
about that shortly the build quality is
absolutely top-notch I have nothing more
to add from what I said in my white fox
review the main chassis is constructed
out of cnc anodized aluminum and the
keys are PB TDI sublimated for the best
longevity plus it resists fingerprints
and grease really well unlike some other
plasticky caps have encountered on some
other mechanical keyboards honestly
you're paying $189 for the premium
materials to complete the night fox the
paint job takes time and labor
eventually ax cost so please do keep
that in mind before even considering
this now don't expect things like RGB
lighting with a night fox it's just not
going to happen in fact out of the box
you won't find LED backlighting
whatsoever the black text on the dark
key caps makes it extremely difficult to
distinguish certain keys and darker
environments but on the other hand the
lighter key caps on the white fox
reflects the ambient lighting from
sources like the monitor or a table lamp
which makes the letters more legible to
the eye so LED lighting isn't completely
necessary for the white fox but the
night fox certainly needs it now I was
told by input club that existing owners
of the night Fox and the white fox will
be able to purchase an LED lighting kit
for 10 to 15 dollars but that involves
soldering so if you're comfortable with
that you obviously do have the option to
add lighting they are working with a few
LED options like red and white to see
which one would perfectly complement the
color scheme of the night fox and yes
you'll have the option in the web site
later on where users will be able to
purchase this keyboard that comes with
backlighting out of the box the cable is
detachable and graded my sample uses the
standard microUSB connector but the
production model will come with a Type C
USB connector so kudos to input Club for
that the attention to detail on this
cable is just
staggering I don't think I've ever come
across a USB cable that has instantly
given me that wow factor it complements
the black and gray color scheme really
well I didn't experience any kink for
mation plus it's not as thick as
Corsairs offering but I wish that the
cable was a bit longer especially if
it's being routed to the rear i/o of
your PC the night fox comes with input
clubs newly designed heyco true
mechanical switches these are using a
box switch architecture from chi-wah
that's totally different from Cherry MX
the company claims that they're
structurally superior to Cherry style
meaning they've redesigned the slider
that results in less wobble with every
keystroke and they've expected it to
last a lot longer now my prototype
sample didn't come with these switches
built-in because input Club was still in
the process of developing hako so
unfortunately I won't be able to give
you guys my full verdict on these
switches but from a specs point of view
they are linear and feature one point
nine five millimeters of actuation
overall travel distance of three point
six millimeters with about 55 grams of
actuation force and they support led
styles that are SMD or through-hole so
the end user can actually add their own
flavor of LED lighting as long as it
meets the specification now do note that
the white fox can be pre-ordered with a
variety of switch configurations
including heyco true Haeckel clear which
features lighter tactile actuations than
hako true there's also Cherry MX clear
and some more options from kiowa the
night fox only ships with heyco true so
do keep that in mind alright so the
white fox and the night fox are plug and
play keyboards so technically it doesn't
require a driver software to operate but
if you intend to add shortcuts to keys
like adding media playback buttons
function keys etc you're gonna have to
do that manually by downloading a few
programs and I'll link them in the
description essentially you would have
to go through the exact same process of
reinstalling drivers through zadig
configuring the layout online or through
a dedicated software and then flashing
the keyboard using the DFU utility it's
definitely not as user friendly as some
other mechanical keyboards that I've
encountered in the past so please do
take that in mind before even
considering pulling the trigger on one
of these guys I also want to quickly
mention that my experience programming
the layout on the prototype sample of
the night fox was definitely challenging
so just to quickly sum it up I went
through the same exact process as can
figuring the whitefox with this guy but
the PCB for some reason wasn't able to
or the driver software was not able to
identify the PCB and there were some
quirks with just trying to flash the
preferred layout of my choice on this
guy we didn't really work out so I had
to obviously get in touch with the input
club I had to go through like three
hours of troubleshooting to actually
finally make it work and so like I said
I've been working with the prototype
sample I'm sure that the production
samples won't have a problem and of
course they do have a full manual on
their github forums so you can
definitely check that out and I'll leave
a link to that in the description if you
want to take advantage of that
step-by-step procedure well there you
guys have it the night fox from input
club it certainly is an interesting and
unique keyboard in the market because
for one it's it costs a hundred million
dollars which is super expensive for a
keyboard and when you compare that to
something like the k95 from Corsair or
even the Logitech G pro which is just
twenty or thirty dollars cheaper than
this guy I think you're getting a lot of
features with both of those keyboards
like the K 95 the GPRO then this so this
is certainly targeted towards a certain
type of audience someone who's just
desiring a simple stealth looking
keyboard that just looks cool with their
setup and of course the build quality
because these key caps are super
expensive they're PT die sublimated so
it's really durable and of course the
aluminum unibody chassis and just the
way how it looks I think it's quite
unique so I definitely hope to hear your
thoughts on the night fox remember club
I certainly have to wait for the full
production sample to test out the new
hako switches and how they play out well
when compared to the MX cherry offerings
so definitely leave your thoughts on
this guy I meet both harken axe thank
you so much for watching make sure to
subscribe for more summer content and
we'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
