hair is still kind of a huge mess but
today I'm taking my case outside in the
park really excited to see what that
footage became you up there so stay
tuned to see the behind the scenes on
that but first a message from our
sponsor
introducing the new OCC vx5 hundreds all
state drives from Toshiba it offers
great well balanced speeds built with
MOC NAND flash for superior endurance
and is also backed by five year advanced
warranty program learn more about the VX
500 at OCC calm
as usual I will show you the
surroundings the cardboard I'm still
keeping there because I will put the
case back when I go to the park but the
really cool interesting thing about this
enclosure is because it's such a
beautiful aluminum cube it goes
perfectly for symmetric shots so for
example something like this perfectly
centered nice table nice lines you know
you can do you can do things like this
but I am fortunate from a little bit
different angle and trying to shoot
something that is a little bit more
abstract because this case is definitely
like a piece of art and deserves from
something different check this out so my
lines are perfectly fine but here we
have the table a little bit skewed on an
angle which is which looks awesome and
the case again kind of like off-center a
little bit different a little bit
abstract cannot wait to film more with
this guy so the thing is I want to get
the part before people start to go there
so that I can be shoot in peace the size
is sticking out a little bit but I have
a handle and that's perfect now let's go
to park the Sun is out thing about
working from home is that you need to go
to the gym or do the weight for example
my weights cases the benefits of working
from home and I write these guys just
arrived the client sees in the mini
Steve from fractal obviously got a bit
of a workout is how I roll so my outdoor
gear today is very simple I am bringing
a slider because there's a lot of
potential to utilize low angle shots of
me sliding away from the case as it's on
the ground obviously my tripod the g7
with the Sigma lens
I do have an ND filter on top because it
is super bright out I want to utilize
fast aperture and my messenger bag you
guys will never guess what maker of this
bag is it is actually one plus all right
so luggage wise it's not that bad they
got my tripod bag so it's easy to carry
wish me luck
so it is noon right now I picked a
really good time not that many people in
the park which is great don't want
people just passing by
unboxing something this high-end quality
inside the park on the bench is
definitely interesting but I set up my
shot here we're gonna do a nice slide
let's see how this works
there's still a bit of snow around left
which is fine my main concern is for it
to kind of look dirty because of this
type of brown and white combination but
I'm definitely liking the yellow
contrast on the bench and I'm definitely
liking the the length of these like
corridors so when I'm shooting something
with the camera you know I can
definitely compress the background
literally nobody this way or this way
this is very good because it's kind of
close to my house but also this is the
entrance to the park and I'm happy that
I came out here just at the right time
so there are many hilariously confused
faces wondering what the hell I'm doing
on the bench I have now translated or
transferred on the ground giving me a
really cool low angle shot and
especially with all these shadows coming
out from the trees it looks really cool
because I'm bypassing one there and then
one load behind here so they're in the
shot and looks really cool with this
type of low angle shot I definitely did
come out in the right time there's zero
people in the park I'm actually standing
right by the entrance but as I said that
there are two bikers that almost hit my
camera passing by so yeah
so I think I'm finished with my slider
shots now it's time to take off the
camera off the slider put it in tripod
and capture something really cool with
these shadows alright that's a wrap for
my outdoor stuff with a DB or four from
streak um well one thing that I got all
my shots that I wanted thank you
yellow bench and the public that has
been very cooperative aside from the two
bikers that almost hit this camera
that's a wrap
a little bit of a walk and the box fell
apart from me a little bit but I'm home
hopefully now it's time to actually
shoot this thing inside my office inside
the studio but the cool thing about this
enclosure is that it's fanless we also
have a fan the power supply but you'll
be seeing where the heatsink is and I'll
let you give a little hint it's aluminum
on the exterior on purpose you heard
that right so guys think as much for
watching this behind-the-scenes I am
working on this enclosure as you watch
this video so let me know if you have
any feedback for this stuff some video
is moving forward I'm going to meet you
with her ok max we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
