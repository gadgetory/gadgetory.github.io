possible by our partner nvidia it has
also made possible thanks to corsair
phanteks and NCIX CES was a whole lot of
cool and crazy and weird so here's a
collection of everything that we needed
to share that then make it into our
individual videos starting off with
these fantastic quantum dots Samsung TVs
that were not only freaking large with
everything from 65 to 70 80 to 90 8 inch
screens but Samsung is really pushing
the boundaries of incredibly tiny bezels
and floating like panels but a huge
emphasis has also been placed on image
quality with regards to sharpness
vibrancy beautiful contrast that makes
those black and whites true to real life
with 4k resolution and HDR or high
dynamic range compatibility basically
I've never seen an image this good
coming from a TV Samsung is also all
about the Internet of Things and now we
have a giant interactive touchscreen on
a fridge they can take pictures of
everything that's inside of it and let
you label the expiry dates plus cycle
between your photos give you color
updates and news it's basically a giant
tablet with some proprietary fridge
functions built in are you looking for a
totally CQ away to hold you data
Kingston's new data travel 2000 has a
physical numpad that unlocks your drive
and after 10 unsuccessful tries goodbye
information saved on the drive if you're
into 3d printing the Ultimaker 2 plus is
out with an extended model available
that is larger for bigger projects but
here a new cooling system is in place
with these duel fans that allow the
material to cool much quicker and thus
allow the machine to perform more
accurate prints faster so you can create
the next innovative project all from the
comfort of your own space but while you
wait for the printing to finish relax
and watch a movie of this absolutely
tiny projector called the cube riff 6
don't be fooled by its compact nature as
we have a micro SD card slot and micro
HDMI for connectivity and the one half
hour battery life if you require to go
wireless you can achieve a good 100 inch
screen with good detail but don't
forget to turn those lights down to get
the best brightness range possible and
while you watch your film don't leave
your pets hanging introducing the pet
cube camera it has a built-in laser with
the good distance range that you can
control directly off your smartphone aka
playing with your pet via a video stream
and a two-way speaker so you can still
send off those commands and let you pet
hear your voice when your phone dies
though because of too much petcube
charge you up with enter plex kicker
mini it's a solar powered battery bank
with a five-thousand milliamp hour
battery and this thing is actually quite
compact for what it is recharges quickly
and as long as you have available
sunlight when you get low it's a
reliable way to stay outdoors to make
sure you capture the perfect moment with
your new nikon d 5 for outdoors it's
built like a tank full weatherproof
features the most powerful processor
nikon has put out it is based on the FX
format which is full frame with 12 burst
frames per second 4k video capture up to
30 p and crazy iso up to 100,000 but
with an extended crazy range up to 3
million is oh so you can practically see
in the dark and all this so you can
finally view you work on this ultra HD
blu-ray player that will deliver each
pixel as it was intended</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
