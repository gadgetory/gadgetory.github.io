great technology selection and service
RGB lighting sixteen point seven million
colors all the spectrum lines or the
chroma lines and etc are all found in
today's gaming peripherals so in today's
video the question is RGB actually worth
it
but first let's outline all the benefits
of all the spanking colors around our
peripherals and taking all the marketing
behind RGB peripherals and I can
summarize them in three words
revolutionize gaming battle I for one
need to have all my peripherals set to
green color when I jump into csgo
because I need to create that forcefield
of LEDs that will allow me to win the
match but truthfully if any of those
peripherals do not feature RGB color
lighting then they will feel visually
out of place and some gamers despite
having zero functionality for lighting
may not want to deal with the lack of
cohesion which brings me to cohesion
which is a very important point for set
of peripherals if your brand loyalty is
diverse for example my travel gear set
consists of Razer BlackWidow tournament
edition keyboard this is a tkl edition
with Razer green switches and for some
reason I just like to stick to the
purple illumination as it has the most
soothing color tone for my eyes my go-to
mouse is the newly released my onyx
caster with excellent quality lighting
and I can easily color match to all the
colors and for the headset I choose the
Logitech G 633 with RGB rear and side
illumination and thanks to companies
realizing the need to include RGB
peripherals I have a visually
interesting combo that I can show off
beautifully on video the big however
though is are we sacrificing anything
when we choose to go with RGB and
marketing for gaming peripherals has
become such an integral part of
highlighting the lighting features that
you know you sort of start to question
the functionality and the rest of the
products when always see on packaging is
RGB and anything that surrounds lighting
and visual aesthetic of a gaming product
without actually touching down on the
core mechanics or the core components of
the gaming product in question
particularly the battery drain is a huge
issue for wireless peripherals it's just
an annoyance needing to charge your
mouse every night for a full day of use
the next day and this is especially
evident on RGB wireless headsets where
battery drains in about 6 hours when the
lighting is on because we are sold on
the premise of interactive lighting like
showing health status of with your
teammates through color or showing color
interacting with your peripherals based
on in-game atmosphere and it's such an
awesome point that it sells us well to
go and choose RGB peripherals but as of
now it's such a fresh concept that is
not well integrated for the consumer
however as companies enter the eSports
arena it is becoming a huge selling
point to drive brand recognition and to
expand all that play all types of
possibilities for RGB lighting for the
professional arena but not so much for
the consumer arena just yet but on the
flip side of that coin let's refer to
RGB as reactive garnish bombardment yeah
I came up with that myself and I think
it's accurate to describe lighting on
peripherals as reactive as companies are
constantly trying to give us new ways
for customization for your peripherals
even if it's beyond reasonable I also
think it's accurate to describe it as
garnish it is still very limited within
game integration yet there is an
insanely heavy marketing push when it
comes to RGB and it wasn't long ago when
we were asking for RGB lighting to
become the standard under the foundation
of color matching all your peripherals
luckily we are approaching a point where
RGB implementation does not add a
significant cost to the product unlike
it did 1 to 2 years ago and thus we can
treat it as a welcome addition but of
course of it being optional and being
optional is very important because
pulsing in all different types of lie
effects can become distracting within
your peripheral vision and finally
bombardment I think it's a pretty
self-explanatory let's face it RGB
lighting is now everywhere I think it's
a point in time until we see RGB on
gaming chairs on monitor integrations on
laptops while I guess laptops already
have that but anything gaming in its
title will soon have some sort of LED or
another and talking about where actually
matters on gaming mice for example I
love the visual presentation of
different profiles or dpi settings on
keyboards I love mapping my gaming mode
you know WASD zone and some other keys
or highlight all the letters when I'm
script writing and as weird as that
sounds it actually helps to narrow my
focus of doing writing instead of being
distracted by something else
and recently RGB lighting has found its
way onto headphones or gaming headsets
that as of yet has zero functionality
for the consumer aside from giving you
the visual satisfaction as we are
seemingly becoming more obsessed with
the cohesion of not just the lighting of
your PC or your build but your entire
setup so guys let's have fun with the
RGB acronym how would you define it
within the means of its purpose do you
find it useful on RGB peripherals or not
leave your thoughts in the comments
section below
now we also ran a poll to see what you
guys think on Twitter and majority of
you said no it does not make sense it's
pointless on gaming peripherals so based
on everything that we talked about today
based on all the comments that you read
down below has your stance changed so
we'd love to hear what you think I'm
doing tree with higher conducts make
sure to give this video a like if you
want to see a new office door as I'm
finally almost settled in and we'll see
you in the next one
