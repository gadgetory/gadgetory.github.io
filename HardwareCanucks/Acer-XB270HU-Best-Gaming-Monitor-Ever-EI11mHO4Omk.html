practical design maturity fans know just
for computers oops
Gaming monitors have always occupied
that single spot on the usability scale
primarily for gaming applications thanks
to fast TN panels seriously once you try
144 Hertz for gaming you just simply
don't go back and just feel slow and
sluggish and you just you don't know you
way around the screen anymore
and for the longest time gaming monitors
suffered with bad colors and really poor
viewing angles because IPS panels did
not catch up yet to the refresh rate
that we expect on the game until now
this is the acer xb 270 hu which is a
fantastic needed monitor on the market
that checks off many features that would
categorize this display as an ideal
gaming monitor and an awesome
multipurpose display thanks to the
resolution and panel quality so this is
a 27-inch panel at 2560 by 1440 p
resolution refresh rate of 144 Hertz
it is g-sync equipped and the cherry on
top it is an IPS display that offers far
better viewing angles over other
similarly priced 2tm gaming monitors so
it is targeted perfectly for gamers and
also creative professionals and this all
comes at a competitive price point at
$750 u.s. that kind of makes sense given
the future-proof stance of this monitor
now let's do a physical tour surrounding
the panel is a thin an exciting bezel
with a circular foundation that
integrates rotation directly at the base
and not on the red ring around the stand
there is a convenient cutout to pass the
cables with all the expected
maneuverability with tilt swivel plenty
of height adjustment that unfortunately
reveals the cable pass-through space
when at full height and portrait mode is
also available I don't know how you feel
about this but the glossy plastic does
not fit on such an expensive monitor
especially for the base that gets
covered in dust quickly and you can't
comfortably store anything on top of the
base I know it's not an expectation from
any monitor but if Acer could just get
rid of that slight curve and that would
have space for my Trabant and all other
things I can place on the base there are
a pair of USB 3.0 ports on the left side
along with two more in the back of the
monitor a single display port due to
limitations of the g-sync module but it
would have been great to have more
inputs here just in case that bypass the
g-sync module but unfortunately that's
not available and finally there is the
power input at the front bottom right
corner we find an ambient blue power LED
with the physical buttons for OSD
navigation that lets you access presets
with four modes like equal
drive standard that boost brightness to
100% and is set by default the graphics
preset is absolutely terrible that
messes up with the white tones and it
loses a lot of the information in the
highlights and I don't know how this is
meant for creative purposes it's simply
unusable and the last is movie mode that
shifts the entire color profile that is
just not passable we would recommend
sticking to the user profile and you'll
be golden the second shortcut is
brightness control then we have
overdrive mode that helps boost pixel
gray to gray response time and you
better stick to normal setting at 144
Hertz to reduce ghosting and then we can
enable the ultra-low motion blur that
only works at 85 and 100 Hertz when
g-sync is disabled and it helps to
deliver a cleaner motion at reduced
brightness which is a good alternative
if your graphics does not support g-sync
lastly you can enter the full menu which
gives you gamma and contrast control and
I just use a color temperature with
these RGB sliders now for the price of
this monitor the OSD is completely
lacking and does not offer the same
features that competing monitors offer
so for example there is no six axis
color calibration inside the monitor
there's no proper gamma adjustment
there's no easy game mode that you can
select and also the presets that are
available the four presets are
completely terrible and do not offer any
anything valuable to the user like the
graphics mode is kind of insulting how
it over blows up the highlights and you
lose so much information it boggles my
mind so you could go in and take it with
the RGB values but to get the proper
experience for color accuracy you would
need to use a color meter now for the
panel itself we were happy with the
viewing angles you lose a bit of
brightness with extreme side-to-side
orientation but it's not a big deal on
the first panel toe color uniformity was
significantly warmer in the top-left
corner but was fine on the replacement
unit and one thing Acer could have done
differently is an anti-glare coating
that does blur out the light sources but
there's always a
noticeable reflection element that could
be just so annoying but now this is part
of the review when all the drawbacks
mentioned simply disappear when we get
into the gaming section the combination
of 144 Hertz g-sync and IPS all round up
for a really perfect experience I truly
cannot game on anything else anymore
especially for fps when your response is
affected by fluidity of fast refresh and
nailing accurate aim feels fantastic
complemented by non jewelry and
completely smooth frame rate thanks to
gsync and I think this monitor has
something to do with me returning to
play csgo because XP to 70 hu is a
perfect all-around foundation for
first-person shooters the IPS panel here
is also part of the awesome equation I'm
satisfied with the contrast and vibrancy
of the colors that goes hand in hand for
strategy games where movement on screen
is not as rapid as with fps but you
certainly appreciate the fluidity of any
movement thanks to the refresh rate and
gsync wear frame rates around 40 fps
feel like they're in the range of 60 FPS
allowing mid tier GPUs to drive your
games properly and concluding words the
Acer xB 270 hu is a truly unique gaming
monitor that combines the best elements
for a fantastic experience very happy to
see an IPS panel at 144 Hertz and in
this resolution and also g-sync enabled
from a functionality standpoint the
monitor stand is perfectly fine but why
all that gloss finish would be great to
see a matte surface instead and ASA
really needs to catch up with the
on-screen display and better anti-glare
coating for this to be the king of
gaming monitors but despite the
mentioned flaws it is still
one-of-a-kind and deserves the heirarchy
Knox dam innovative award
