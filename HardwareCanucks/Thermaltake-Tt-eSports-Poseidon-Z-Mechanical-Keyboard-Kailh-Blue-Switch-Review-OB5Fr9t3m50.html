great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hurich knucks and looks like we have a
new mechanical keyboard switch on the
block and thermaltake is certainly
taking advantage of this new switch kale
that doesn't carry is such a significant
price premium as MX cherry switches did
making the Poseidon z2 very attractive
buy for just $89 now the keyboard is
very basic it is well built however has
a continuous blue backlight with four
brightness modes that you adjust with a
function key and dedicated brightness
keys if you like the overall stealth
look as well that can be enabled because
the LED is not centered below the keys
the characters on the number line
they're very much muted even at the
brightest mode that makes them very
difficult to see and it also doesn't
help that they're very tiny I would have
loved to see an armrest for comfortable
long gaming sessions and it just seems
like a feature that is included on many
other gaming keyboards there is a
dedicated Windows lock button that has
no lighting indicator when pressed but
instead doesn't protrude as much from
the frame when activated the FK is also
function as media controls with volume
and that's as basic as it gets
there is no macro recordings there no
drivers to be installed and there is
also no different location based
lighting modes there's also no USB
pass-through again something we've
gotten accustomed to with gaming
oriented keyboards at the bottom we have
a few rubber pads for stability and also
razors that also have rubberized bottom
and a really convenient cable routing
system throughout cable in either side
or the center now cable is not braided
it's just a standard black and I would
have loved to see a different color USB
port for easier distinction of what is
what behind your computer in case you
visit that area often like I do and the
poseidon's that doesn't offer full MP
rollover despite what it says on the
packaging and only six to eight keys can
be registered at the same time without
conflict the keys are not rubberized by
the slightly curved top does the job and
keeping your fingers on the keys without
hitting the surrounding
is by accident so the blue switch
Edition mimics the tactile nature of the
MX cherry blue switch that is a bit on a
heavy side but the tactile responds with
a fast balanced and incredibly
satisfying a sound for fast typers the
disadvantage would be the loud operation
compared to standard membrane keyboards
and even MX cherry-red switches that are
linear that we use in the office there
is some skepticism on this new Kail
switch in terms of quality and
durability considering MX cherry
switches were made in Germany and the
Cale switch is now will be manufactured
in China but the fact that thermo tech
has gone ahead with a five-year warranty
on the switch is a good sign
considering Mikey 70 from courser offers
only two years but I have discovered
inconsistency on some keys that feel
lighter than the rest and that sort of
reveals the potential drawback of KL
quality control now those users
switching directly from MX cherry blue
switches will find poseidon's ed very
different with lighter keys and we're
about to see many manufacturers employ
the KL switch so it's a matter of time
until the true and tested come to light
and over the period of four weeks I
really have gotten accustomed to the
tactile blue Edition switches of the
poseidon's ed both for gaming and just
really all-around use for typing and
editing as well and to keep this one
short I do feel the thermal that you can
stake in the right direction adopting
the new KS which to hit that price point
yet with a very solid build quality a
nice blue backlight and the five-year
warranty to back up the somewhat
skeptical kale switch now the lack of
features on this keyboard like the no
USB pass-through unidentified cable no
armrest and no fancy lighting features
and also very hard to see secondary
characters on the keys are just some
limitations that some users may not even
care about as the poseidon's that is
just the good enough keyboard for those
wanting that mechanical feel without
breaking the bank
although I think it might take time and
convincing that these new KS which is a
reliable and manufacturing quality
control
can get up to similar standards as what
we've come to expect from the MX cherry
line so how do you guys feel about this
introduction of the kale switch and
thermo takes implementation of it into
the Poseidon's II leave a comment down
