great technology selections and service
hey guys this is dimitri and welcome
back to another Harwick next review so
sony is quite late in this whole scene
of tablets particularly after the
previous xperia tablet s was
discontinued because of issues with
uncovered ports that then exactly prove
water-resistant so sony has released an
update to the xperia tablet lineup with
a few key features modified to improve
durability and use your experience so
you guys are looking at the Xperia
tablet Z a 10-inch tablet that's sure to
compete with Apple equivalent and many
other 10-inch tablets on the market with
the sub 500 dollar price tag under the
hood the experience that is running
Snapdragon s4 pro this a quad-core
processor at 1.5 gigahertz with two gigs
of ram it comes unusual 16 and 32
gigabyte capacities and running android
4.1 with a custom Sony you I the
displays a high-res 1920 x 1200 that
equivalent of the latest Nexus 7 it's
really nice very vibrant colors and when
the screen is off the tablet looks like
a single piece of glass as the black
bezels blend in with the screen it looks
really cool and more elegant when
compared to something like a low-end the
asus HD 7 for example video playback is
beautiful with vibrant colors and
excellent contrast the blacks are not
washed out and given such a nice high
res display media consumption on this
tablet is very enjoyable my only
complaint here is how reflective the
glass is and since the blacks are very
deep black they tend to blend in with
the reflective bezel now let's talk
about the form factor the Xperia Z is
incredibly slim and extremely
lightweight at a little over a pound
obviously tenish tablets are less
portable when compared to smaller 7-inch
pocket sized devices and just for
reference here's the latest asus HD 7
which is really nice to hold with one
hand but it's a different story with the
sony now it is a 10 inch device designed
for operation with two hands primarily
in landscape mode and the rubberized
plastic backing helps with secure grip
now because the device is so thin
also turns out to be quite flexible the
both qualities just fine but I wish the
frame was reinforced to prevent the
tablet from this much flexing now one of
the cool features of the Xperia Z is the
fact that it's waterproof so all the
connections are covered by these rubber
seals just make sure they're all tightly
in place before throwing it in water now
they're quite annoying to open and flap
around when using the ports but we have
all the regular connections starting
with a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
power button and the volume rocker at
the bottom we have a standard micro USB
for charging and data and the micro SD
card slot for expandable storage the
speakers are placed at the two corners
at the bottom so regardless of how you
fold the tablet or what orientation
they're never muffled and have a fairly
loud output and they even plain water so
I was eager to do the water test play
youtube video and see how it handles
some water cooling and well it works
just fine of course this feature would
not appeal to everyone but the Z tablet
also doubles as an underwater camera and
a little underwater entertainment system
so speaking of the camera the Z tablet
comes equipped with the 8 megapixel rear
facing cam and flipping the Xperia
around a 2-megapixel front-facing camera
is also present so the camera here is
alright and the camera functions have
been taken directly from Sony's digital
cameras and we have a smart all auto
mode 1080p video recording and many
other different functions for scene
selection and bunch of effects picture
quality here is all right there's quite
a bit of noise even in brightly lit
environments and the black seem to be
washed out but you do have iso and
exposure compensation controls to adjust
to look all your final image alright so
let's talk about the custom UI and
performance one of the very convenient
little perks is the double tap wake up
feature which is awesome for not needing
to pick up a tablet to access the power
button this tablet also has an IR
receiver and the universal remote
control app for your TV for example and
a bunch of other useful apps like movie
studio which is a built-in video editor
Sony's own Walkman for music playback
and Sony select which is a collection of
recommended apps
for the tablet but since it's an Android
pages wedges are highly customizable and
Sony's own UI blends in very well with
this whole Android environment so the
overall user experience is very
satisfactory with very fluid performance
for YouTube playback or gaming I did
encounter stutter when switching
orientation from portrait to landscape
mode for example there was a slight
hiccup with playback which is unexpected
for this calibre of a product and given
the high performance score the Xperia Z
lasted me an entire day of casual use so
about 10 hours and that's another
sacrifice due to such a thin body as it
can only carry a 6,000 milliamp hour
battery pack so overall the Sony
experience that is one fine device with
an extremely slim body that complements
its portability powerful specs and
expandable storage the high res display
is beautifully crisp with vibrant colors
and both front and back facing cameras
are a bonus it's also not loaded with
bloatware but instead comes equipped
with awesome apps to get you going for
media consumption and it's also
waterproof which might come in handy for
use around the pool but the Z tablet
because of its thin plastic and flexible
body doesn't feel as durable the battery
life is just ok because it cannot house
a larger battery pack and the 8
megapixel camera was a bit of a
disappointment given the price range I
do however think that Sony is heading
into a right direction with these
tablets is they do serve as
multifunction devices such as a remote
or underwater camera the Xperia tablet Z
has its flaws but if you are in the
market for an incredibly slim and the
lite premium device this just might be
it and we're giving it the hard knocks
damn innovative word so thanks guys for
watching let us know if you find this
waterproof feature in any way useful and
if you do how would you use it let us
