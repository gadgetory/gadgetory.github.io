great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry with Haruka Knox
and welcome back to another review
now one comes to gaming peripherals it
seems we're always bombarded with
pointless features and things like
sixteen million color palettes and very
often functionalities overlooked as the
priority becomes to create the most
flashy and gaming centric product on the
review table today we've got a gaming
mouse from genius this is the GOG X with
the heavy asking price of a hundred
dollars meaning there's a lot on the
line for the GX so let's dive right in
the mouse features an 8200 dpi laser
sensor I'm not sure why gaming mice are
going this far as I personally never
even go beyond 2000 now what is
important is 1000 Hertz refresh rate for
minimal latency and we also have onboard
memory to save your profiles the mouse
is symmetric in shape with thumb buttons
only on one side but it could still work
for left-handed users by switching left
and right click in the software
ergonomically the mouse works well for
either grip with rubberized angle
support for your thumb and two fingers
on the other side the rubberized sides
are slightly coarse allowing for a
better grip we have a total of 10
buttons with your left and right click
the scroll wheel two macro buttons on
each side dpi change with two more
macros and your thumb buttons the DPI
switch is not very effective for in-game
scenarios because you have to cycle
through the six different dpi levels in
order to come back to the original and
say you're playing battlefield 4 again
inside a tank ramp up your dpi for
quicker aim but jump out and have to
press the button a few more times to get
back to your normal sensitivity now I
was thinking we get this many macro
buttons so why don't I just set the DPI
plus and minus to either of the dual
buttons around and turns out you can't
you only get a dpi switch option that
doesn't let you lower your sensitivity
and that's a big turn-off especially for
gaming mouse not exactly the pro gamer
style the mouse over does feature a
weight adjustment system that I always
she ate with the total of six 4.5 gram
weights and a little compartment to
store them the mouse without any
additional weights comes in at 197 grams
so this flexibility is very convenient
now when it comes to lighting and gaming
I do appreciate the flexibility to match
my other peripherals and the geology X
features a total of three adjustable
color zones we have these front eyes
like LEDs that look really cool but you
never actually get to see any of it
then we have the GX logo at the top and
the scroll wheel that you can all set to
this pulsing mode so I think this looks
really cool but guys don't be expecting
miracles in terms of accurate color
there's a very distinguishable red hint
on all the colors so white looks pink
red is very deep and bright that's the
one I decide to go with and green is
slightly shifted to the blue and so on
now this obviously doesn't affect your
in-game functionality or aim but
advertising heavily on color adjustments
and then delivering such poor color
combination and variance between your
three zones is very disappointing now
moving on to the software this isn't the
best interface I've seen but it does the
job we have all the regular button
assignments macro recordings all the
sensitivity adjustments and polling rate
and lastly the lighting options with
that really funny-looking color palette
that looks something out of paint and
now because the mouse has onboard memory
all the profiles are saved onto the
mouse so if you switch computers this is
certainly useful now with all that
covered how does the mouse perform in
game now I've been using the mouse for
over three weeks and have gotten really
comfortable with the weight and the grip
and I'm really happy with how the
buttons feel especially the macro
buttons they provide just the right
amount of travel time and that tactile
response when the button is pressed and
I seriously could see this a popular MMO
or RTS Mouse
I initially completely ignored the two
macro buttons on the right side but soon
adjusted to using the middle finger to
quickly access those buttons in game now
I wasn't using the DPI switch at all
because I needed the option to lower my
DPI on the fly so what I did was I set
up three profiles at 800 1200 and 2000
dpi so I can quickly
which between my profiles either going
up or down so effectively acting as my
dpi plus or minus and after three weeks
of use my left click started acting up
on me with double presses and getting
slightly jammed at the corner where it
meets the frame effectively making me
switch back to my trusty m60 and this
brings me back to the notion of
functionality over gaming features as
the GX Jilla is a feature packed gaming
mouse with weight adjustments different
lighting options a whole load of macro
buttons with excellent ergonomics now
the issues with the left click to appear
this soon and its use is very
disappointing especially for the $99
asking price now while I didn't manage
to make the DPI to switch the way I
wanted using profiles the basic function
of dpi plus or minus is unfortunately
missing now all in all my experience has
been very satisfactory until the three
weeks in and the issues with my left
click started to appear but up to that
point I was really happy with tracking
and the fit it's a good thing we have
that 1 year warranty and well that
concludes our review of the geology X
