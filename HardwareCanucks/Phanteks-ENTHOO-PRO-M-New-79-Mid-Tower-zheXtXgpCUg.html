possible without innovative fantex
world-leading Nvidia graphics memory
partner Corsair and retail partner and
cix along with silverstone and in win
and so popping into the fantex suite had
me excited because we are aware of the
evolve ATX launch and you can check out
a review of that case here basically
it's a beautiful aluminum exterior
available in titanium gray and black
with specific focus and water cooling
and having a really open interior with
incredibly simple assembly process that
not only feels rewarding but really
enjoyable throughout and as always in
fantex fashion they are not ditching any
of their designs but instead modifying
the features to hit a specific price
point without losing any functionality
so you guys going to really like this
one this is their new chassis the enthu
pro m it sells for $79 thus competing
directly with the s340 from NZXT
and in a way with the defined s so hit
that like button if you'd want to see a
comparison video between all three the
basics of the pro am lie inside the
Evolve ATX as they share an identical
interior frame it's an open concept that
flexibility is key for modern consumer
today and fan Tech's have realized that
the exterior tone follows in line with
how the m2 pro looks and this being the
mid tower variant thus the m in the name
will see two color options this titanium
green almost a military-like and the
standard black one put plastic brushed
panels the window on here is not as
large as the one on the Evolve ATX and
we are told the thickness and the
quality of the panel has been improved
based on our nail scratch test so that's
pretty awesome
there's a single five and a quarter inch
drive bay at the front and the i/o ports
on the side with dual USB 3 and audio
jacks unfortunately at this price point
we aren't seeing any type-c connectors
just yet
behind the front panel is a removable
dust filter that covers the entire front
intake that can accommodate for triple
120mm fans or dual 140 mm fans mounted
on strips for placement flexibility the
top fan spot is covered with a dust
and I love this top filter that is
magnetic and at least it's included the
top fan bracket is removable that allows
installation of fans and radiators
outside of the frame that is super
convenient and all of the features have
been kept from the Evolve ATX line like
velcro straps for your cable management
at the back a couple of drive caddy is
at the bottom cage plus a single SSD
bracket behind the mobile tray there's
only one fan included with the pro m and
no interior drive brackets so your
storage capacity is limited but the fact
that we have such an awesome case it's
such an awesome foundation makes us
happy that fantex have not really
stripped this budget oriented chassis of
its most appealing originating functions
so make sure to subscribe for one our
full review of the pro M comes out and
what it gets think of the military color
let us know in the comment below thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
