legion cube c 5:30 a portable gaming
station that's all about the made range
spec and i'm actually quite excited
about this pre build system because of
its price warranty and performance it's
got its competitive advantage in that
regard but the higher model the c 730 is
also available with better GPU options
and just other hardware and RGB
illumination so the c 530 is all about
that sweet spot for the target audience
within that not exactly budget but value
oriented consumer now I will say Lenovo
Legion is a channel sponsor but they
were like do your thing we want an
unbiased genuine feedback loop so I
would love to hear what you guys think
about the system let's begin right after
this the new Toshiba XS 700 external SSD
comes in this beautiful and minimalistic
design its ultra portable form factor is
perfect for creative professionals on
the go and with blazing fast USB 3 Gen 2
transfer speeds and Toshiba's excellent
three-year warranty reliability
shouldn't be a concern
check out the X's 700 from Toshiba down
below alright so let's begin with the
most important aspect of any pre-built
system and that is value and naturally
we can expect some form of price premium
but this is where the C 530 becomes
really interesting so let's take the
base model for example at 879 dollars
you get an i5 8400 GTX 1050 TI 8 gigs of
ram an optic module with one terabyte
hard drive keyboard mouse windows
license and a sweet case if you were to
buy these parts individually you'll run
about 810 dollars which is about an 8%
price premium on the total value of the
C 530 which i think is pretty decent
this is not taking to account any
shipping that you might have to pay for
individual parts and of course the time
saved of building the system yourself
now for the higher-end configuration
with an i7 8700 double the RAM the PCIe
SSD and the rx 570 the price premium is
about 17 percent making it less of a
good value and so this base
configuration then becomes pretty killer
and price point but they do vary in
regions and I wish that we had more
hardware customization options like
actually like a GPU drop down menu so if
you don't want a 1050 Ti with your i5
potential a 1060
or anything higher and r-tx cards are
supposed to be in the pipeline whenever
they come out so they are thinking about
the future upgradeable options but I
wish that we had like a you know a
little customization that is there and
not just an entire spec sheet given to
you per model but the one thing I
appreciate is the warranty policy it is
only one year but can be extended
further but this whole system is
designed to be user upgradeable so if
you replace the hardware like your
graphics card or swap out for additional
CPU it does not void the warranty so the
Nova Legion will still cover all the
original hardware if anything goes wrong
with that
but one of the most interesting things
about the C 530 to me is the enclosure
itself I kind of wished it was sold
separately because there's got a lot of
cool elements like this front
perforation with a built-in coarse dust
filter behind it with a tasteful Legion
logo illumination the dark gray color
scheme looks nice and the side panels
are easily removable so you can access
the internals for hardware upgrades the
handlers part of the frame that complex
this compact size for transportation and
the transparent honeycomb top is this
good initiative to reveal the reddleman
ation spill on the GPU and the back
chamber although it is an acrylic piece
and glass would have been so much better
the front ago is almost hidden at the
bottom with dual USB 3 and audio jacks
while the rear i/o has six more USB
ports two of which are Gen 2 with land
graphics output and an additional HDMI
on the motherboard there's also this
rubber band to tighten exiting cables
for a little extra organization the main
airflow is delivered via the 292
millimeter fans at the front and 180
motor exhaust fan at the back the system
is pretty quiet at idle but ramps up at
audible levels upload so you'll need
headphones to drown out the loud fans
but I will be replacing those front fans
with some nock twists and also
populating a small low-profile CPU
cooler for better temps and also quieter
operation now lenovo tells us they might
release a standalone version of this
case which will be so awesome with some
minor modifications to complement you
know building system in it yourself so
let us know if you're into this case or
not in the comments below
as you can see the interior looks fine
cables are bunched up and secured all
over the chassis the only non black
cables are from the front fans but
otherwise it's a clean job on both sides
that
pee-yew has an airflow shroud separating
incoming air from the exhaust and I
could replace it with something more
powerful because we have an 8 pin PCI
cable from the power supply but the
power supply varies from 280 watts to
450 Watts so any upgrades must take that
into account and the power supply is an
ATX unit at 140 millimeters with bronze
efficiency but if you're replacing it
some units might not align with the
cutout for the power socket at the rear
now the sample configuration I received
here does not actually exist in stores
but with my i7 8700 GTX 1050 TI the
frame rates at 1080p with high settings
are quite good give me some Headroom for
extra resolution at medium settings with
ok frame rates but the gtx 1060 would
definitely complement this cpu better
the 1050 Ti used here is a non branded
thread PCB open-air 1.5 slot card with a
good factory overclock to 15 20
megahertz the ram is running in a single
channel mode and branded as Ram Excel so
finding an exact module will be super
difficult so any ramp upgrades in the
future will have to be totally new dual
module kits the nvme SSD here are
Toshiba XG 5 om drives with awesome
performance the hard drives are Seagate
7200 rpm dry so not bad and the power
supply is an ass belt branded Lenovo om
unit that they use on many of their pcs
now the cooler on here is pretty weak
throttling to 3.4 gigahertz with 81
degrees Celsius at full load while the
GPU stabilized at 78 degrees Celsius at
1520 megahertz and I wonder how many
degrees we can drop by populating new
fans and the beefier CPU cooler that
still fits inside the chassis stay tuned
for that Wow
could this be the one this actually is
the land cool one the case with a
fantastic front panel design with a
brushed aluminum plate complementing
airflow and the gorgeous RGB
illumination through the central cavity
we've got a type C port at the front a
capable interior for water cooling an
airflow and a totally flush glass panel
on the side and to spice things up the
leonie's trimmer cables give off unique
RGB illuminations for 24 and 8 pin
cables controlled via the case lighting
or through its own controller hub for
this interesting color spill on the
interior and you can check them out in
the scripture
all right so let's end this conversation
with some real talk I want to see a
standalone version of this case released
with a glass top panel instead I want to
see more hardware customization options
like a GPU drop down menu so you can
upgrade based on your preference I'd
like to see a beefier CPU cooler
included especially for the i7 models
and the base configuration with only an
8% price markup versus if you were to
buy the parts separately sounds like a
really good deal however if you're
entering the higher tier configurations
then in price markup it reaches close to
20% making it less of a good value I do
love the enclosure design and the
compactness of this machine especially
compared to other pre-built systems that
sell for roughly the same price with the
same configuration you know they're all
mid towers and I really appreciate the
compactness of something like this
because you don't necessarily need an
ATX motherboard for you know I 5 on a
three with a single GPU I'm happy
they're compacting things into this ITX
form factor I would love to see the
front panel redesigned to support larger
fans so maybe do 120 s or single 140
fans so you can have slightly more
airflow at quieter operation but now it
is your turn to speak out given this
whole user upgradeable nature of the
system and an enclosure what might you
upgrade first components wise would it
be the GPU would you swap out the CPU
cooler probably no the CPU itself you
know like an i-5 for gaming is totally
fine and yeah let me know in the
comments alright guys that is it make
sure to check out this other relevant

sequence Channel and yeah we'll see you
in the next video
