intense let's turn it down I think this
this yeah this looks a little better
sweet what's up guys ibrahim with harbor
connects and it's been a while since
I've done one of these vlog series or
behind the dam episode at least I feel
that for myself because there are a few
reasons for that one I've been working
on a few projects and number two I've
been looking for a perfect camera that
can give me a good balance between
vlogging and of course exploring the
photography side because ever since I
switched from my 5d Mark 3 to the Canon
c100 I've sort of it's I've almost sort
of demolished exploring that part I
haven't really looked back into
photography I mean sure you could
capture great stills on your smartphone
but I really do miss shooting with my 5d
so yeah after spending countless weeks
doing my research and watching a lot of
YouTube reviews I finally settled on
this guy the Canon a TD I've been using
this camera for about two months getting
a feel for itself and of course shooting
a lot of video and photos so you may
notice a few mural shots some on
previous reviews in the last few months
some of them are actually shot on the
ATD and you may or may not have noticed
a difference between that in the c100
but so far I'm actually really impressed
with what this camera is is able to
offer so let me walk you through my
experience but most importantly my
reasoning behind this pic R after
message from our sponsor finally an
ultra slim body keyboard with mechanical
red or blue switches designed and
perfected for work and play that the
Sorel Graham XS evolved to fit right in
check it out below
okay so I think it's time to step back
for a little bit and talk about the
Canon c100 because I've been shooting
with this camera for about three or four
years and it's been serving me really
well I absolutely love this camera it
only shoots 1080p video not 4k and for
those of you who haven't noticed pretty
much all of my hardware connects reviews
have been upscaled to 4k and publish to
youtube so if you haven't noticed a
quality difference between you know my
videos and Dimitri's videos let me know
the comments down below I'd definitely
love to hear your thoughts on that but
the problem with the c100 is that it's
primarily a cinema camera and not a
photography camera so if you're someone
who wants to explore both photo and
video you won't be able to do that with
this c100 but you would be able to do
that with a DSLR or mirrorless camera
because those type of cameras can shoot
both photo and video and coming to think
of it I've actually always been
passionate about photography and it has
been my passion ever since high school
but it eventually have liked me to
shooting video for hard-working acts and
it slowly led me into picking out the
c100 and I sort of explore I've started
exploring the video settings but I've
always wanted to go back into exploring
a photography because it is definitely a
great way to explore your creative side
and a lot of things actually apply or a
lot of rules and you learn from the
photography side applies to the video
side of things and vice versa both of
them are not different they're they're
kind of exactly the same once you start
applying your creative thoughts on both
fields are you definitely able to come
up with some great results now my camera
history is actually a little bit
interesting and a lot of you guys might
find surprising as well so my very first
camera was the Nikon d50 100 and back in
the day I used to compare the d50 100 to
the Canon t3i I did a lot of research
into both cameras and it looked like the
t3i was a great option for video while
the d50 100 was a great option for
stills
because it had an it had a post
processing center that can literally
just take a raw image and process it to
a certain effect so if you want
selective color or a miniaturized in
effect the camera can do that in body
without having to do that on a computer
which was great so I decided to pick
that camera because back in the day I
was super passionate about photography
but it eventually led me into video and
so I was sort of not impressed with the
video capabilities
5,100 it just had terrible settings you
really weren't able to explore the full
video side of things especially when
controlling was things like shutter
speed and aperture it just wasn't that
great so I sold my D 5100 and I picked
up the Canon 5d Mark 3 and poi it was it
was quite the experience I was able to
explore both the photo side of things
and the video side of things
both feels the camera was just great you
were able to control pretty much
everything you possibly could with that
camera especially on the video side of
things and it was the camera that I was
Ben I was using in the early days
working with hardware connects all the
bureau that was shot on my side was with
that camera
in fact Dmitriy was super jealous
because he was shooting with the 5d mark
ii fast forward about a year later and I
picked up the Canon c100 and it was a
whole new game in terms of exploring the
video side of things
so built-in Indies excel ours zebras
Peking and of course getting to explore
the super 35 sensor and grading si log
was definitely a learning experience
I still haven't mastered that part but
you know either way I still I still have
shooting with this camera but over time
as a channel grew we decided to
implement a few vlog style segments here
and there to add a little bit of dynamic
to our personalities and Dimitri has
been a master at that himself I'll
actually leave a links leave links to a
few blocks in the description down below
if you want to check it out he's done
marvelous works with his jh5 but the
c100 is not really ideal for vlogging
because if you think about it it's a
pretty bulky system and when you add a
lens on top of it you're definitely
gonna add a lot of weight to the overall
system and it just isn't ideal for
handheld stuff there's also a lack of
shooting slow motion it only shoots
1080p up to 24 frames per second which
still looks great by the way you know
when you're shooting b-roll but but yeah
it for slow motion stuff it just isn't
it isn't up for that task
another reason is the lack of a flip-out
screen so the c100 screen flips odd
right about over there so it's pretty
hard to review your composition when
you're shooting on camp segments so
basically what I do every time is I go
back to the camera and I flip the screen
all the way back and I review my
composition and then once it's done I go
back to the camera and start recording
so it's a two-step process and it is a
little bit frustrating but have you I'm
used to it already another important
factor was the lack of a continuous auto
focusing system so the
model that I have here doesn't come with
the dual pixel motor but Canon does
offer a service or at least they did
back in the day it was quite expensive
was pretty expensive you have to take it
you had to take it to a service center
to get it upgraded but I just didn't
have the time for that and I'm not
exactly sure if they still provide that
service for the c100 enter the canon a
DD it doesn't cost you an arm or a leg
like the gh 5 but it has one of the best
auto focusing systems that you can find
on a DSLR body and it's actually one of
the reasons why I ended up picking this
camera is just for its auto focusing
system because I don't have to worry
about that when I'm doing the behind the
Dan episode and of course when I'm
shooting outdoors especially when I'm
taking stills I can completely rely on
the other focusing system without having
to worry about you know making sure my
subject or is in focus which is great I
also love the lightweight body it's a
lot lighter than the c100 that's for
sure you can quickly you know pick this
up for handheld stuff and once you throw
a wide-angle lens I think you're looking
at a perfect setup and of course this
accepts native EF lens so I don't have
to worry about getting adapters of
whatnot and that's actually one of the
reasons why I skip the gh 5 or another
system because I'd have to spend another
thousand dollars on an adapter to adapt
the native EF lens I have right now and
of course you'd lose a few more features
like you know a good battery life and of
course this top little LCD screen
because this is something I've always
been wanting on a DSLR it's actually a
great feature that I'm sure a lot of
photographers might miss because if
you're shooting in low light or if
you're taking if you're going outdoors
in the night this is a great way to
monitor your sayings like ISO shutter
speed and of course are just quick
settings this this little L City over
here is a fantastic addition and this is
something you would definitely miss when
you go for something like the gh 5 or
another mirrorless system lastly I have
to talk about the flip out screen
because it is an important factor when
it comes to vlogging because you want to
make sure that your composition is
intact and you want to monitor yourself
to make sure that you're in focus this
is an absolute must-have for a vlogging
camera if you're you know looking for a
blogging camera in general but also just
if you're trying to explore photography
so if you want to take a low angle shot
so you can flip the screen and you know
look at your composition without having
to you know completely Bend yourself and
do that and it's a it's a lot flexible
then you would expect it to be and it
comes in very useful in every situation
I've taken advantage of this and a lot
of times over the past few months
especially no exploring outdoors with
photography and of course video so yeah
definitely a must-have for a vlogging
camera no lack of shooting 4k is a
bummer but in all honesty that shouldn't
hinder you from creating content I'm
very happy with the image coming out of
the ADT but the c100 is still supreme
dudes insane low-light performance and
the internal downscaling that takes
place so it's basically a 4k sensor down
scale to 1080p in camera hence a sharper
image and so that's the Canon a TD guys
I've obviously done a few modifications
like you know masking V branding because
I like to keep it as stealth as possible
that's just my way but I obviously want
to add a few add-ons to make it to sort
of build the perfect vlogging setup so
first of all foremost I have to get a
new lens because I'm thinking of the
Canon 10 to 18 millimeter with image
stabilization it's it's a 4.5 25.6 lens
it costs around $350 Canadian so it's a
fairly cheap lens but it should get the
job done I did test it out at the local
Canon camera shop here in Toronto and it
looks like a great add-on for the ATD
another thing that I want to get is a
proper microphone for the ATD for
vlogging I obviously can't rely on a
shotgun microphone because it just
doesn't work out that well but yeah I'm
definitely thinking of picking up a
proper microphone so let me know if you
have any suggestions when it comes to
you know proper lens selection for
vlogging of course a microphone setup in
the comments down below I'll definitely
make sure to check out some of them so I
hope you enjoyed this little behind the
damn episode and honestly I'm actually
really happy with the ATD and I really
can't wait to share my or just more
vlogs in general with this camera and
you know if I'm working on a shot with a
scene 105 I want to share my experience
you know creating that shot with you
guys and talking about the you know the
work that goes into it for example
lining and whatnot I can now do that
with the ATD because I don't have to
worry about you know shooting that shot
and then talking about that in camera
it's a little difficult to do everything
with one camera it's always good to have
an extra body to you know take it from a
different angle so I think that's an
excellent option and I think the ATT is
a perfect camera in that regard also for
those of you wondering I did get my
hands on the samsung galaxy s 9 overall
I'm having mixed feelings about this
device I've used it for about four days
right now and I'm not
impressed with the battery life I've
also tested the camera I'm planning on
doing some in-depth tests comparing this
to the Google pixel - that is sitting
right over there
and of course compare the cameras
because this guy's featuring that
variable aperture and you know I'm not
sure if it's if it's a big deal but but
yeah stay tuned for my long-term review
of this device so guys that pretty much
wraps up this behind the damn episode
let me know your thoughts on the canon a
TD and is this a perfect alternative to
something like the gh 5 or another
mirrorless camera and if you want me to
do a full extensive review on the Canon
a TD once again let me know in the
description or comments down below on
