great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Harkin acts and we have another amazing
product and a house for review if you're
not familiar they specialize in
headphones and earphones with different
wood implementations into the headphone
design both for the sound signature and
the aesthetics of course to adjust the
big elephant in the room with regards to
meze and their connection to e smooth
that seems to sell an identical
headphone just with different with
housing but at a fraction of the price
we contacted message to get their
comment and they're stating their
correlation with east mood as they are
an OEM manufacturer producing their wood
housing that apparently was designed by
meze and east moon cells missus designs
to other brands and their there's the
dispute now one thing is clear that the
drivers used are tuned differently
between what is sold through a smooth
and meze but the substantial price
difference of the two headphones is what
inspired this skepticism in the first
place but meze sticks to their story
with higher quality product than what is
sold by a smooth and will no longer
produce at the east smooth factory and i
just want to provide this background
story for you before we actually begin
with the review now the first product we
reviewed from them were than meza 11
deco which was an elegant pair of
earphones with the satisfactory sound
quality but three months in they
literally fell apart the glue inside the
housing didn't hold
but fortunately there are ma department
quickly took care of that and exchanged
our unit and we decided to give meze
another try with the 73 classics and
only your headphone designed with an
outstanding looking even you would
housing for the drivers followed by that
$200 price tag more than double of what
you would find with a smooth now in the
one hand you are paying for a beautiful
and unique with housing but then we
questioned whether this would be more of
a fashion item than an audio experience
now there's no doubt it's a unique pair
every time and i think it's fair to say
we perceive something as high-quality
who when it looks this good with the
subtle yet noticeable golden messy low
go peeking through the center of each
earcup covered in that glossy coating
they are available in both gloss and
satin finishes we have the gloss here
although a plane mount would finish I
think is more elegant as the glossy wood
does give off a perception of plastic
that overall cheapens the look and feel
there are several Carroll to the top of
the housing that leaked the sound that
in my opinion benefits the sound
signature the detachable Court is
welcome addition that snaps in place
with continents and will require
intentional force for removal you can
connect left and right to either side
with the cable labeled for your own
identification also featuring small wood
housing that is also found on a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack at the end of the one meter cable
now a few points of criticism here given
our choice of glossy wood why aren't the
wood pieces on the included cable also
glossy sure it's a minor detail but I
would expect every essential detail at
this price point on that note the wise
splitter down the cable is also not
coated to the rest design next the cable
while being extremely light and non
intrusive when wearing the headphone is
extremely thin I can't imagine that
lasting long even with their moderate
and safe use luckily we have an extra
cable included in the package and third
against some minor defects on the body
like exposed adhesive agents that was
used to glue the pleather on the
headband and the already peeling
rubberized coating on the plastic now
these were all things that I noticed too
right from the start so not the best
first impressions of this headphone at
the $200 plus price tag so let us know
how you feel given a price tag in the
comment below moving on to the forum
they are extremely lightweight the
headband is metal but the rest is all
plastic aside from the obvious wood
housing the ear cushions are pleather
not real leather unfortunately but they
do have plenty of thickness to form to
your ear they are removable we find an
extra soft material attached to the
driver so even if your ears get in
contact with the inside of the cushion
it won't be uncomfortable they are
really flexible of course size
adjustable but given everything is
plastic
expensive price was really on the back
of my mind when I took apart the
headphone literally taking the wood
housing off the frame and there's
something about this construction that
lacks continents and comes out
completely disappointing when compared
to headphones in the same price range
and also the plastic hinge inside the
swivel joint snapped off completely
allowing the ear cup to circulate full
360 degrees so this is far from premium
built quality on the better note the
light formed really nails down in the
comfort department as they set with
appropriate amount of pressure the
headband is thin but it has decent
padding and something I never
experienced was any headband pressure
and that's good news the round ear
cushions offer an on-ear design that
isn't actually something that I would
prefer but I love the low profile look
and given my sensitive ears the clamping
force was really spot-on for an on-ear
design plus I could easily aware these
with glasses so that's a bonus for me
moving on to sound quality I used mainly
my Nexus 4 to drive them while also
utilizing the d1 DAC on my laptop and
despite everything I just said regarding
the build quality and some lack of
attention to detail the 73 classics
proved to really satisfactory from a
listening perspective the eben II wood
housing does warm up the sound
especially for vocals bring out that
extra body in the vocal range to really
satisfying levels lose yourself to dance
by Daft Punk had me rocking my head from
the very first job of beat the mid-range
is really up front making the audio
environment closed off but not in a bad
way the wood housing really warm ups the
sound yet with a pleasant level of
detail on the high end without any sort
of harshness listening to together by
the xx' manages to really emphasize on
both male and female vocals while
allowing powerful low and extension to
get through the bass is a tight punch
but with an airy roll-off young and
beautiful had me wanting to hear more
precise lower frequency notes in the
same situation with Bang Bang as intense
amount of bass is dropped
throughout basically the entire song the
overall sound signature really suited my
preference for hip-hop soul R&amp;amp;B and even
uplifting trance
that's not as bright as what I usually
prefer but really enjoyable for lengthy
commute especially due to comfortable
nature and so in conclusion if you like
your audio smooth with a hint of Airy
bass and upfront mid-range the 73
classics satisfy plus add in the
incredibly comfortable design and that
woody elegant looks however regardless
of how gorgeous these might look the
price of over $200 cannot be felt with a
full plastic construction with
imperfections already peaking through at
least if we have real leather and
matching wood finish on the cable as
with the earcup it put perhaps would
have felt a little bit more premium plus
the really thin cable is a point of
concern for me as well and so the 73
classics is a disappointment on all
levels of quality despite having sound
signature that suits my listening style
and that would be it for our review of
the Maisy 73 classics and I'd like to
ask have any of you had any experience
with meze products or a smooth
equivalent so share your experiences
down in the comment section below give
us a like for doing a bit of digging
around to address the whole meze versus
e smooth debate and of course if you
enjoy the review as well and as always
