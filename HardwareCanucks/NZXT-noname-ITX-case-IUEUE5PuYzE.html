possible by our partner nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to corsair
phanteks and NCIX without them we
wouldn't be here so I'm just going to go
ahead and call this the No Name NZXT ITX
enclosure upon stopping over there sweet
from my peripheral vision I noticed the
small white thing covered in not enough
logos in my opinion and I literally
thought this was a backpack but they
made sure to point out that this is in
fact their new ITX enclosure something
they've actually been working on for two
years just to clarify the NZXT vinyl on
the exterior and the totally black out
panel are only intentional for showcase
and the t's of this chassis and not for
retail but the design was inspired by
sports car with this elegant curves even
the side panels are not just flat but
have some round shape to it and they are
all metal so it feels quite solid so
here comes the unknown part we did not
get to look inside so this is merely a
tease but from what we have noticed the
power supply chamber will support
standard ATX units there will be two PCI
slots and we are told the cooling on the
chassis will deliver better temperatures
than on the age for 40 and that's
understandable based on the size of this
case for an ITX build there are dual 140
and 120mm fan mouths at the front end
top and given the added height mounting
radiator at the top should work just
fine we can notice large ventilation
openings on each side at the front and
the same thing goes for the exhaust so
I'm super excited to check it out do our
full build in this when it launches on
January 26 but until then let us know
what you think of this design and what
you would consider this type of larger
form factor for an ITX system i'm
dimitri with high reckon axe thanks for
watching our CES coverage and we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
