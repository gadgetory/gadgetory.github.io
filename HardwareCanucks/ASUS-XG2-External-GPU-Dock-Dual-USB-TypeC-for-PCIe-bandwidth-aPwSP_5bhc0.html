fantex and NCI X external GPU enclosures
I think are going to be very popular but
it will take some time for the end-user
to consider the realistic usage
scenarios of when and how these external
GPU enclosures will actually be used by
you for example I love the idea of
having a portable laptop something very
small and like an ultrabook that I can
travel with and do my email
correspondence and script writing and
when I'm back in the office simply plug
the GPU enclosure in to gain that extra
graphics power for maybe editing or
gaming or simply running multiple
displays off that same machine the asus
rog XG 2 external GPU docking station
would allow to do exactly that
design wise it follows within the ROG
theme with a matte black surface this
awesome angular side window to show the
GPU inside and the red underglow plus
they are experimenting with this plasma
like array in the center which to me
looks quite pleasing very unique stuff
but serves no function and it'd be
really cool to have this plasma lighting
grow with GPU usage but so far they are
thinking of only having three color
choices
no RGB included opening the shell the
side panels do occupy quite a lot of
space but here we see dual 80 millimeter
exhaust fans positioned at the top and
the fact that this GPU dock supports the
gtx 980ti matrix addition which is
freaking huge tells us this this unit
will support most other graphics cards
as well two and a half slots no problem
really tall coolers designs no problem
either now unlike the Razer core which
uses the single Thunderbolt three for
connectivity the XG 2 uses dual USB
type-c cables for connectivity which
delivers PCIe x4 bandwidth with only one
to 5% difference between the full x16
bandwidth and having two USB type-c
cables with allow proper PCIe throughput
but also charge the laptop with that
second cable so at least we know that
Asus notebooks in the future will most
likely feature dual USB type-c ports for
ability with this GPU doc</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
