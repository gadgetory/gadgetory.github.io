better be I painted this company now
let's begin so what's up guys I'm
Dimitri with harbor Canucks welcome to
our PC hardware words of 2017 so this
year was a bit odd until went nuts and
launched four new architectures remember
KB Lake sky Lake and the new x2 99
platforms were all launched this year
aim D went on a bit of a winning streak
with Rison but had a complete flop with
vague launch and it seems like they're
you know processor and Radeon divisions
are doing exactly the opposite with this
is the processor side doing so good but
the radio and division kind of fooling
everybody with marketing before Vega
launched and just you know two years of
hype for basically nothing on top of
that all the pricing confusion regarding
Vega and the bundles and what's
available and then increasing their
prices just a complete mess but of
course we had some good elements in the
hardware so the categories for the
awards are the best bang for the buck
the most surprising hardware the most
innovative hardware the most
disappointing hardware and finally the
best of the best
let's dive right in after this so it was
kind of a love at first sight you know
there's really nothing like this
exterior I love the metallic color the
tinted glass panel the RGB fans at the
front it's basically a see-through case
and who doesn't love that your graphics
card can go vertical
the top is radiator friendly and the
right side is so unique when exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
age 500p way cooler master check it out
in description below so the first
category the best bang for your buck
goes to the i3 73 50k now on the intel
side this was one the best bang for the
buck this year for $170 this unlocked
dual core 4 threaded processor really
shines in gaming performance when
overclocked to 5 gigahertz that you can
do easily matching frame rates to that
of the i5 7600 K so for 1080p gaming
this is definitely one of the best in
its class
of course it's multi-threaded
performance it's kind of weak when
compared to the 7600 K because it's only
got two course but for gaming at 1080p
it's awesome from the red site oh we got
the new Rison 5 1600
honestly this is one of the best bang
for your buck processors around right
now with six cores and twelve threads it
over clocks just as well as the 1600 X
so you can go up to 3.8 gigahertz or
even 4 gigahertz if you're lucky but you
save yourself the twenty to thirty
dollar difference between the X model
but it has the same number of course and
the price is amazing for what you get
that complements the value perspective
of be 350 motherboards which are our
next item on the list honestly you can
get literally all the same features as
on the X 370 except crossfire and SLI
compatibility but it's great for users
who want to use a single powerful or
maybe not so powerful GPU it also has a
few less connectivity options but for
literally 95% of the users out there the
P 350 will be superior to X 370 and it
could save folks almost $100 and the
last thing on the list is the asrock Z
270 and Z 370 Taichi motherboards
so we did a video on motherboards Auto
overclocking abilities and the Taichi
line have great features and can auto or
clock processors very well their BIOS is
much more user friendly than the likes
of MSI and gigabyte and the price is a
real selling point with all your usual
goodies like endo two slots fantastic
audio implementation and one of my
favorite visual designs on a motherboard
moving on to the next category of most
surprising starting with the core i7
2670 surprises this year for us and how
well the 2600 case still performed
against the latest CPUs in gaming in
1080p with the gtx 1070 we basically get
identical results to the 8700 K so
upgrade those z68 systems with a new GPU
instead and save some money and make
sure to check out the full comparison
right over here the next item on the
list is how all-in-one coolers still
fail to beat air coolers now this is
less of a surprise but still something
should be discussed here all in one's
getting prettier with more lighting
features but good old heat Singh's
hanging off your motherboards are still
superior and cooling granted we have
more compatibility issues with accessing
RAM slots and sometimes even tedious
installations I am looking at
you be quiet take some notes from knock
to a place but even the most premium
heat sinks from like knocked over or be
quiet can actually cost less than your
standard 240 millimeter all-in-one and I
myself has switched to a nice CPU tower
to cool my 1700 X and with all the RGB
craze around
we weren't expecting the Trident Z from
g.skill RGB memory to look that amazing
seriously of course this is a personal
opinion but I think with all the RGB BS
that's going on RGB memory when done
right like on this g.skill RAM kit it
can look really good with vibrant colors
and uniform lining across the dim that
would complement your build quite well
and you are paying the big bucks for Ram
already but I never expected
illumination on the RAM to look this
good and the last the most surprising
award goes to the Intel i5 8600 k for
its overall performance not just for
gaming which by the way is fantastic but
also for adobe applications it's got 6
course without multi-threading but
overclocks to 5 gigahertz like a champ
and actually beats my 1700 x4 premier
rendering and it's got me thinking to
switching back to intel for my
workstation and it's also a little bit
cheaper than the 1700 X and that's a
bonus moving on to the next category of
the most innovative let's start with AMD
thread Ripper basically we're getting
more cores into the hands of power users
for less money
beating intel's new core series at its
own game and forced intel to launch
before they were clearly ready it also
brought in things like nvme raid for
insane speeds with a minimum of fuss
unlike requiring an unlock key for vrock
on the intel side overall it's a great
platform for super heavy workloads but
still it is quite expensive next up is
the zotac gtx 1080 and 1080i mini the
card measures at only eight point three
inches for compact ATX systems
delivering big performance and a super
small package the cooler on this thing
is adequate for overclocking it looks
pretty nice and it's also quiet
it means amazing performance for your
next compact system look into the mini
and the last most innovative mention
goes to the nock to our thread Ripper
coolers so this is kind of a carryover
from the most surprising but Noctowl was
first one out of the gate with
air-cooled thread looper coolers and
they are amazing the properly designed
larger contact surface covers the entire
die of the processor it's available in
120 and 140 millimeter variants and has
a flexible mounting bracket for better
PCIe lane clearance so you can offset
the tower towards the upper edge of the
motherboard and have a bit more wiggle
room for mounting on that first PCI slot
but most importantly coolant performance
is absolutely awesome and shifting gears
let's talk about the most dissapointing
hardware of the year starting off with
AMD vega so we got tons of high for
almost like two years then it comes out
as too hot to power-hungry and still not
beating what Nvidia had in that price
range and it wasn't necessarily bad GPU
but it was just too late to matter and
then aimed he still couldn't follow up
with sufficient stock and bore partners
are still struggling to launch custom
versions it's a rare breed in the wild
but it sure mines well and next up is
Intel octane what a mess
it is essentially Intel's rst SSD
caching by another fancy name and done
over am not - the problem is that you
need an opt in supporting SSD which cost
as much or more than they budget 128 or
256 gigabyte SSD honestly opting would
be perfect for all their systems but it
is only supported through the M de 2
slot on 200 or 300 series motherboards
essentially the platform is an expensive
starting point for Intel that can only
accelerate the system drive so you would
need $500 worth of hardware on the
motherboard in the CPU side and then a
mechanical spinning this for us and then
the Intel opting stick in order to
accelerate the hard drive so why not
just buy 256 gigabyte SSD on the first
place for your system drive moving on to
the next disappointing thing is the Z
370 platform so we have another
generation of Intel CPUs and yet another
motherboard revision and what's there
more to say even though there were
motherboards available the 8000 series
chips have been in short supply since
day one and that still causes people to
look towards the older but still very
capable Z 270 series but one of the most
annoying trends has to
the whole RGB everything trend so RGB
has now gone from something to pimp your
PC to like a commodity that means it is
being used to inflate pricing and drive
premiums and also it's poorly
implemented on color specific
motherboards and we still don't have
like a standard for RGB control whether
it's through a proprietary hub or a
12-volt RGB connector or now the
addressable LED connectors the industry
is currently in this RGB confusion and
that needs to be corrected luckily it
can be turned off but there's a price to
pay for RGB these days and the last
disappointment on the list goes to Intel
once again for KB Lake X oh man where do
we even begin it was created as a
solution to a problem that didn't exist
basically Intel was looking to offer a
more budget-friendly solution on their
higher end platform but people looking
at X 299 wanted the I 9 series of chips
and not an older version of cable a
architecture that still had limitations
for a number of PC islands for example
and this situation was made even worse
when coffee lake arrived and those chips
ran all over kami like X while offering
a lower platform cost and were
performing much better too
so buying a quad-core king deck X with
the expectation of upgrading to a 6 or
10 core sky like X CPU down the line is
just money wasted and now for the last
category best of the best hardware and
2017 goes to aim D Rison honestly this
feels so good after the flops of
previous AMD architectures this was an
absolute winner then provided amazing
IPC improvements and reasonable clock
speeds - which ended up competing very
well against cabling now the number of
course was less important for gaming and
Intel CPUs remain a better bet from
gaming but only by a slight amount and
overclocking and all processors really
helps things improve performance the
platform's the X 370 the be 350 and the
be 250 really helped to cross a full
spectrum of prices and user scenarios
and now with the potential of a revised
Rison and 2018 Intel has been put on
notice that AMD is back in a very big
way and both Eber and I switch to the
risin 770
100x for our video editing workstation
machines and we're super happy with them
but we also built numerous rise in five
machines that perform so well and offer
such great value Rison is also making
its way into the mobile sector with
power efficiency and expected awesome
performance let's just say we can't wait
to see what aim he had in store wind
rising in 2018 however on the graphics
side of things the NVIDIA GeForce GTX
1080i wins the best of the best it still
does not have any competition and it
likely won't for the foreseeable future
since Radeon is stuck in their Vega rut
it basically stacked the Pascal
architecture in the yard and dared AMD
to come and get it it may be expensive
and GPU prices have gone through the
roof but it is still the best GPU can
buy outside the expensive Titan series
gaming performance is fantastic and so
is the CUDA performance for Adobe
applications something that both Eber
and I utilize on a daily basis the new -
Sora gram SD spectrum is one seriously
beautiful keyboard with perky RGB
illumination macro customization
built-in and comes with to source new
removable optical switches that are dust
and water resistant with linear reds or
clicky blues full details on the SE
spectrum down below and so that wraps up
the pc hardware works for 2017 all the

comments on what you expect to happen in
the hardware realm for 2018 I'm looking
forward to reading those I want Dimitri
