to the mesh battle for the first case is
the Phanteks P600s and there's the mesh
and the second case is the fractal
Design Meshify S2 I as to which is
basically the define s2 but with a
front mesh panel so let's see which one
measures better between these two
Granite's this give you hardware the
power deserves with be quiet straight
power 11 power supply with a wire free
internal design fantastic cooling with
silent wings three fan a fully modular
layout with black cables and 80 plus
gold efficiency check them out below
alright so the reason why I'm comparing
these two cases is because their price
point is identical $139 for a solid side
panel and $149 with tgd the meshify s2
comes in two color options so white and
black and two TG options with a dark
tint while the p600s has three color
options available now the meshify s2
is based on the defined s to make sure
to check out that review to get the
basic understanding while the P600s
interior wise is based on the evolv X
so make sure to check out that out as
well here and so physically you can see
they are quite different so I really
like the grey P600s I'm not a fan of
the black one because it's just too
bland while I'm not a fan of the white
meshify s2 as well because there's
color inconsistency behind the tempered
glass side panel it's more yellow and
not white and also the texture and
consistency between the metal top and
plastic fronts but I love both of their
measure integrations because they're
totally different so with the S2 we get
that cool abstract pattern that is
visible at certain light angles you
might remember this from the meshify I
see it is metal with a thick dust filter
built in so there's no additional
resistance for the fans the P600s
however incorporates a high airflow
fabric instead of a metal mesh and the
fine dust filter underneath it so we'll
see which one delivers better airflow
now my worry with the P600s is
just accumulation you know inside that
fabric material because it's black so
any you know great dust particles will
be totally visible now that is not to
say that the meshify s2 does not have
the same problem however you just kind
of vacuum the front here instead of
needing to take off the dust filter on
the P600s but I do appreciate the
extra front cover that can be angled to
open this area for airflow or closed for
a more silent system and when it's fully
open the fabric pattern looks awesome
you know it's kind of part of the whole
design and it's not like an afterthought
both cases have the same I Oh with dual
USB three and a Type C gen two port now
the cable on the P600s is three inches
shorter so it might not be as
comfortable to route if the type-c
connector on the motherboard is
somewhere in the middle both cases have
three 140 millimeter fans both have
seven PCI slots at the back with three
vertical on the P600s and two on the
Meshify s2 and I do like the swivel
side panel on the Phanteks case that have
strong magnets at the front and rubber
edges around the perimeter for airflow
sealing while the s2 has thumb screws
and additional pegs for more secure
mount so you could be totally fine not
using the thumb screws at all the
phanteks case is slightly taller while the
s2 is a bit longer and I do like the
interiors of both and especially that
grey on black color scheme on a P600s
although I really dislike working
without sliding covers beside the
motherboard whereas the meshify s2
interior is a true fractal staple when
they clean PSU shroud and lots of room
for water cooling so radiator clearance
on both cases it's pretty much identical
for the top and front but the s2 can
also house some at the bottom given your
PSU is short enough for storage the P600s
has three SSD caddies behind the
mobile tray and four of these drive
cages that can be stacked in the bottom
chamber or moved inside while the s2 has
a couple of us as the caddies and three
larger drive cages at the back both
cases have SATA powered fan hubs with
PWM option and I do like the location of
the hub on the P600s
as it's not part of that main cable
routing area and finally some value add
things I do like this screw box with a
Phanteks case there's an anti GPU sag
bracket included an adhesive case badge
and the magnetic cover for the top
ventilation area to prevent
recirculation of air while with the s2
outside of your normal screws we have a
triple sabba extension handy for drive
connections in that side area and you
could also build a dual system config
inside the p600s it's not for
everybody and you can check out my
experience right over here because I'm
using the evolv X which has the same
interior and not for cooling we're gonna
do stock configuration to see which case
cools better out of the box and they
both have three fans included and also
to replace those fans with my nock to us
so just we have you know consistency in
our entire cooling assembly and just to
measure the variable in that mesh front
area alright so for my test system I'm
using 8700k at 4.8 gigahertz with that
wonderful knock to a u 12s cooler and
for the GPU we've got the GTX 1080 for
the win let's start at stock settings
for both cases you can see the meshify s2
takes the lead in CPU temperatures when
the front cover on the P600s is closed
but to my surprise with a really toasty
GPU in both scenarios reaching over 90
degrees Celsius now removing that front
cover on the P600s significantly
improves our cooling and while the CPU
is still hotter versus the meshify s2
the much cooler GPU is what really
stands out now look what happens when I
remove the front panel completely the s2
still delivers better CPU temperatures
but the GPU is much cooler on the P600s
and this is where the stock fans
running at the thousand rpm for both
cases now me replacing those stock fans
would knock to us is a good idea for
performance they are running at 2,000
rpm instead and really help with cooling
on the s2 but that high airflow fabric
on the p600s is not a gimmick and
those temperatures are very impressive
now I'm not sure why exactly those CPU
temperatures are so much better on the
mesh by s2
while the GPU is much cooler on the P600s so if you have any ideas let me
know in the comments and if you plan on
replacing
the stock fans in either of these cases
with something better the phanteks case
delivers better airflow as for noise
levels with the front closed on the P600s
is slightly quieter but you
compromise a lot on cooling but it does
suppress more of that noise with higher
rpm fans with the front plate removed
and at stock settings they are basically
identical but with faster fans the P600s
takes the lead

alright guys so I hope you enjoy this
comparison out of the two cases which
one would you pick let me know in the
comments below and which one to you
looks better your styling is very
subjective I preferred the black version
of the meshify s2 but I prefer the more
compact meshify C to be honest
while the totally you know that gray p600s
is gorgeous while the black one
and the white ones mmm
kind of look off to me but yeah let me
know in the comments I'm Dimitri I'll
talk to you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
