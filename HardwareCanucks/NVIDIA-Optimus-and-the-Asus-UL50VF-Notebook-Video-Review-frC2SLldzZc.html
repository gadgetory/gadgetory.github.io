taking a look at the isuzu UL 50 VF
notebook featuring and media's new
Optimus technology now this is the first
of a handful of notebooks that include
optimists who are excited to see how
well it actually performs the UL 50 v is
focused on Portability and battery life
this is seen in the system specs with an
Intel 1.3 gigahertz ulv Core 2 Duo
processor it also has 4 gigabytes of
memory immediacy - 10 mobile discreet
graphics a 320 gig hard drive and all of
the connection essentials it's powered
by an 8 cell battery and weighs a little
over 5 pounds and the best part it's
barely over an inch thick asus has
designed the notebook with smooth sleek
lines and the thin LCD features an
attractive brushed aluminum finish on
top the inside is well laid out and
looks sharp with the gloss finish they
use a single bar mouse button and dotted
trackpad the chiclet style keys have
great response making it very
comfortable to type on quick look at the
sides we have all the traditional
connections power input SD card reader
HDMI to USB and audio on the other side
d sub network connection and DVD ROM and
third USB
the notebook is designed with the
professional in mind someone who wants
something sharp and modern that is
incredibly portable they need
exceptional battery life but at the same
time want the ability to perform the
power-hungry tasks of a modern-day
desktop now this may seem like quite the
demanding list but a soos is done all
thanks to Nvidia Optimus so before we
get into testing what is Nvidia Optimus
now for an in-depth description follow
the link in the sidebar
however here it is in a nutshell Optimus
is a technology that allows a discrete
graphics card in a system to operate
alongside integrated graphics and here's
the clincher
unlike switchable graphics which require
the user to enable or disable the
graphics manually Optimus requires zero
that's right no user interaction so
that's great and all but what is the
benefit that's simple you get the full
benefit of a graphics card meaning
gaming HD video and GPU acceleration
along with far better battery life a
traditional discrete graphics system has
terrible battery life because the video
card runs constantly Optimus lets you
use low-power integrated graphics for
everyday things and then the video card
when and only when you need it how could
this be possible well there's a few
factors that allow for this to happen
with Windows 7 multiple drivers can now
be installed
so our system recognizes both the Intel
integrated and in media discrete drivers
Optimus works by physically cutting off
or providing power to the discrete
graphics when required and because of a
whole bunch of technical stuff the
change is instant no flickering screen
no having to flip a switch or wait it
all happens in a matter of milliseconds
the key thing is that Optimus operates
completely independent from the
integrated graphics driver so there's no
relationship needed between an media and
the chipset manufacturer meaning that in
this case Intel can't just decide to cut
off support so let's take a look at how
when video optimus actually functions
nvidia has included this handy little
developer tool which will show us
exactly when the graphics card turns on
and off when it's on it's using power
will pull up internet explorer here and
go to the harbour connects youtube
channel now YouTube utilizes flash as of
10.1 supports GPU accelerated graphics
as you can see the graphics card is
lay off we'll go play our video in a
notice load it up
graphics card is on we're accelerating
pause the video had closed it down watch
and off immediately off we're back using
integrated graphics and lower power next
we'll pull up a video transcoding
program which supports NVIDIA suited
technology graphics card turns on
program is up and we're ready to go it
really is just as quick as you're seeing
it here say for instance we want to do
something a little different watch an HD
movie perhaps ready video is on graphics
are on video is loaded and playing and
we are ready to go close that down and
back to low power integrated graphics
over if you know you're not gonna be
needing the video card the software does
allow you to specify which graphics
processor you want to use here you'll
see we can opt to run the media player
with integrated graphics now when the
video loads the NVIDIA GPU will not
engage the optimist system uses a
profile setup to determine what should
and shouldn't turn on the video card you
can see under the control panel there
are hundreds of different games and
applications supported and NVIDIA is
constantly automatically updating and
downloading new profiles for you but if
you do want to add specific rules for an
application in this case our media
player you do have the option you can
select use the default global settings
discreet graphics or in this case
integrated graphics now when we launch
our video we don't have to make any
custom selections and the video will
always use integrated with the
demonstration done let's check out how
well Optimus and the video card actually
performed check this out in left 4 dead
2 with our quality settings at low
medium the integrated graphics couldn't
even finish the benchmark while the
discrete card enabled by Optimus plays
with perfectly usable frame rates
in our next demo we actually got to play
the whole thing with integrated at six
frames per second and media graphics
well completely smooth now one of the
biggest benefits I see coming from this
technology will be its integration into
netbooks most can't play HD video or
even dream of playing blu-ray and if
they can they're using a chip that
absolutely destroys battery life as
we'll see in our blu-ray test optimist
will be able to pick up the slack for
video and we will be able to have
absolutely flawless playback through GPU
acceleration on the same note Adobe now
has support for GPU acceleration with
flash 10.1 so streaming 1080p video
which normally would look like this now
plays back perfectly smooth the other
great benefit of having an media's
discrete graphics on call is you get to
utilize CUDA technology for applications
that support it so especially in the
world of video and photo editing you're
not only are able to complete tasks
quicker but you enhance quality as well
now the most important feature for this
notebook is battery life and that's what
Optimus is all about for these tests we
present a worst case scenario where all
the wireless connections are on screen
brightness is high and the battery plan
is unbalanced at idle the system stays
up for over nine and a half hours
something unheard of with most other
notebooks jumping to the bottom both
gaming and HD video heavily utilize
system resources and require that the
discreet graphics are on a hundred
percent of the time here we see battery
life more in tune with what is expected
from a system with a discreet card while
watching regular DVD however we don't
need the video card optimist doesn't
kick it on and we edged out quite a bit
more battery life here's where it gets
interesting our general use test went
through a typical day of web browsing
emails image processing and over 50% of
our time was spent watching YouTube when
running the system with optimists
allowing the computer to utilize the
video card when it needed we only took a
nine-minute loss to the battery
throughout the entire work day
and to top it off the UL 50 BF is back
up and running within three hours and
with that rear a proper look at Nvidia
Optimus and the Isuzu L 50 VF notebook
overall the unit is pretty impressive
given that it's only around $800 offers
exceptional battery life and has the
benefit of discreet graphics to let you
do just about anything
asou specs their notebooks with a
standard two-year global warranty which
is almost unheard of for notebooks so
you know they stand behind their product
now as far as Nvidia Optimus Technology
goes it is quite possibly the best
technology to come to portable computers
in recent years notebook manufacturers
have fought for years to find the
perfect balance between performance and
battery life the two terms have really
been mutually exclusive the optimist
solution finally brings the two together
as we see with the UL 50 VF we can have
a low-power and in comparison slower
performing 1.3 gigahertz CPU and yet
still play games stream HD video and do
all of the things of a performance PC
the Optimus software is incredibly
intuitive and the profile system still
provides the user all the advanced
controls in case they want to mess
around the hardware implementation
allows for perfectly seamless switching
between integrated and discreet graphics
so there's never an interruption really
what's there not to like about it
both the Isuzu L 50 VF notebook and
Nvidia Optimus technology received a
hardware canucks damn good seal of
approval as always we encourage you to
