and when I published my video on what I
wanted to see for the case industry
moving forward I described little design
exteriors and how I want them to be
different so today we're at Silverstone
and we're going to play a little game
I'm going to go around then like six new
cases six different exteriors and you
guys are going to tell me which one you
like the most our complex trip is
brought to you by fan tech schoolmaster
and Emma sign this is the PMO one we
have a view of that so it's very angular
they've added tempered glass but the
full frontal airflow is open they've
also added these RGB fan grills but guys
move let's move on to the second one
this is the piano two prototypes so
based on the same exterior as the as the
PM one but now with a very minimalist
front panel with these perforation that
goes down LED strips on both sides which
I love got a plain top tempered glass on
the side here as well this is one of my
favorites but I don't want to bias you
guys so don't take my word for it you'd
better tell me which one you like the
most this is the RO six angular
perforation here into tempered glass as
well looks looks nice let's move on to
here this is the rlo seven prototype so
it's based on the RL or seven interior
and we have a view of video of that but
look at this sort of angle a thing where
one side is increasing in size one side
is going this way it's kind of
interesting and that allows for a little
air flow from this side and this side
plus an LED in the middle to highlight
that there's also a black version of
this so the both got tempered glass
panels let's move on this one is the our
low eight so I guess the interior will
be based on a slightly slimmer but look
at this front panel little curves so we
got a curve this way and we have this
interesting middle section that has an
LED shining through you can see that is
there an LED there yep led you there -
how about perforation only perforation
at the top it looks like in the bottom
so maybe not exactly for airflow maybe
maybe just more oven silenced focused
the RPO 15 prototype it's got this
square ventilation openings not a fan
let's just go on and then the LDO - so
here I
like the direction of these curved five
channels that has a curve the top and
has a curve on this side that kind of is
cohesive with the design let's see where
is our ventilation sports ventilation
ports are on this side and even on this
curve and this is all acrylic Ybor come
around so you can see here the
ventilation ports are built into the
acrylic and this is acrylic will be very
insane to do this with tempered glass so
that is understandable and the top
ventilation is kind of open it doesn't
align with the ventilation on the sides
so maybe ignore that maybe it's a
prototype only but here we have acrylic
I love this singular panel that kind of
closes off the case and it's like almost
two pieces two shelves to create
something like this and you have a
invertible multiple tray here which is
why this panel is this way as case is
very angular so we have a review of that
on the channel to go check it out but
yeah between all of these cases all
these front panels and exteriors which
one do you guys like the most
maybe maybe let's do a little quick walk
around Eber come come come show them all
again and yeah guys let us know in the
comments below this one is my favorite
I'm just gonna say that out there I
would love this to become the little bit
more I guess it's because of the white
and this very pure dark tempered glass
panel on the side if you have no lights
on the interior it's just a simple piece
of glass with the white exterior I love
that look but what do you guys think
which look do you like the most
now aside from those cases this my
friends is a USB stick that you can
build yourself using an MD to drive so
this is a simple aluminum enclosure with
a little sliding thing in the back that
reveals a USB 3.1 gen2 type a which is
very interesting but let me show you
what's actually inside of this guy so
here's the little controller we have the
actual port and you can install three
different and the twos and different
sizes so you can basically build your
own USB key with however however
capacity you want of the m-dot to drive
so if you want a one terabyte USB stick
that you know is going to be reliable
be fast this is pretty amazing I've
never seen anything like this before
and because it's Jin the USB 3.1 gen2
speeds you have to use a MDOT to SATA
based MDOT to drive but still pretty
awesome and another cool accessory is
this little guy so the riser card that
inserts into your motherboard it allows
you to place a front panel IO which is
USB 3.1 gen2 so the 20 pin connectors to
be inserted into this little adapter so
if your motherboard does not have one
this is a very good way to utilize your
front panel i/o table see without
compatible motherboard and the final PCB
we are told will be in black however if
your USB type-c gen 2 port from the
front i/o is not 20 pin and using still
the older 1910 connection the riser card
is available here so you can still
utilize the 19th pin to get those speeds
and to get that connection working you
just have to make sure that the cable is
thick enough to provide enough shielding
and all silverstone have that and the
last interesting piece is this guy this
is anna fanless SF x el 450 watt
platinum power supply from silverstone
and every time you show up to them on
whatever show they're like we have these
new power supplies check them out and we
don't really care about our supplies but
this is actually pretty awesome so it's
fully modular and it's based on the same
design is the 800 watt and they've
separated the PCB and all four sides so
the cooling is sufficient we are told it
will run hot but in perfectly safe
environments underneath I wonder if it's
like gonna be like nice and nice and
toasty to the touch but we'll see it's
fully modular let's get the power on
button at the back and it will hit of
course a higher price point
maybe over $190 so it does hit that
niche market but we recently reviewed
the DB for the fanless enclosure and if
you're going for the whole families you
know behavior of your system it will
cost you so you have to just swallow the
cost and the price and just accept the
fact that you will have a completely
silent system and silverstone is
delivering with this 450 watt power
supply i like how they are just like
shooing people away so guys i'm doing -
how recognize let us know what you think
about the family's power supply the
Adhan riser cards for USB type
see Jen - I love that little MDOT to
slot that you can turn it into your own
USB stick that's pretty incredible never
seen anything like it so yeah let me
know what you think how many trees are
connected thanks much for watching we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
