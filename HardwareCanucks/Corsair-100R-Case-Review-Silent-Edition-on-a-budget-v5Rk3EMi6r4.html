great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Hardware
Canucks and I am really excited for one
particular segment of the case market
and that's value oriented products
because how long can you go before
compromises over way the savings in
today's video review we're taking a look
at the coursers latest carbide case the
100 are aiming to even further close the
gap between giving users the most value
friendly but complete package at forty
nine and $59 for the windowed or the
silent hour we have the silent model
here Corsair is not really trying to
introduce anything new or unique but
instead they are finding ways to
minimize the cost for the most
budget-friendly release and starting off
with the looks the 100r looks very
similar to previous carbon cases with
plastic front panel that has a tiny
brushed look only noticeable at certain
angles and the rest is a simple metal
frame with a stamped side panels for
extra rigidity
although the metal is still fairly thin
and flex is evident above the two five
and a quarter inch drive base our dual
USB 3 ports headphone and microphone
jacks and illuminated power and reset
buttons removing the front panel we find
noise dampening material applied here
and being the silent Edition Corsair
made sure to cover both side panels as
well as the top panel so the entire top
portion of the case is completely solid
creating this linear front to rear
airflow channel a total of two 120mm
fans are included one at the rear and
one at the front while only a single fan
on the non silent Edition and notice the
extra mounting holes outside of the
frame for dual 140 millimeter fans that
can only be installed outside of the
frame as you can see internal high
clearance allows only 120mm fans
installed inside the frame the front
panel ventilation is adequate and the
panel is spaced out enough for the fans
to breathe and instead of removable dust
filter we find this coarse mesh on each
side the
would prevent some dust buildup but
don't fully expect it to be closed off
from small particles and if you decide
to populate the bottom fan slot outside
of the frame the drive cage will allow
airflow to enter coming to the back
nothing unusual here 7 PCI slots bottom
mounted power supply with the removable
dust filter that's a little challenging
to place back but at least I'm happy to
see it included the silent Edition also
features a three speed fan controller
this is not included on the standard
edition but it's on the back of the case
quiet inaccessible I would prefer this
to be at the front plus you have to deal
with all this cables it can support
three fans and it is SATA powered
luckily not molex and I guess we can't
really expect the PWM header on the
budget case however I was surprised to
see pre-installed motherboard standoffs
and the middle spacer for easier
installation and the interior frame is
designed well to accommodate for mini
ITX s systems with additional cutouts +
micro ATX and standard ATX cutouts all
around
if only Corsair included rubber grommets
even on just the power supply cutout
that would have been nice the drive cage
has four caddies with two O's three and
a half inch mouse and centered SSD mount
for convenient routing now one thing I
do have to mention is the lack of any
height availability above the
motherboard that makes routing the 8 pin
CPU cable very difficult I just ended up
running these through the cat out before
placing in the motherboard now I am
happy with how the bill turned out you
have direct airflow delivery from the
front GPU is over 12 inches are
supported in the top 4 PCI slots and
10.7 inches for the bottom 3 I'm also
impressed at the lack of any GPU sag
given how massive and heavy d r9 290x is
from asus the frame holds it in place
very well
I could easily route my front I Oh
cables through the bottom cut out for a
micro ATX motherboard and I would
strongly recommend using stealthy cables
on the power supply just to minimize a
new visual mess that you might create
but also help at the rear as Corsair
includes a few cable tie loops which is
a plus some space behind it
drive cage which is also a plus but if
using a power supply cables that are not
flat it would be very difficult to
complete a clean job just because the
spacing is very limited lastly let's
take a listen and how loud the system is
and see exactly how much noise the side
panels prevent alright let's turn the
machine on
and so I would say the 100 are silent
edition delivers on its promises and it
could be a great choice for budget
systems and for $10 more than the
standard 100 are you are getting an
extra fan and a fan controller along
with noise dampening applied throughout
but coarser really needs to reconsider
the placement of the fan controller and
while our system looks great here doing
cable management with anything but flat
or maybe all black cables would be a
total pain especially if you can't prove
out that 8 pin CPU cable and once again
this category is only now starting to
see proper competition and as companies
try to squeeze out those little extra
features that we as builders and users
want to see on a value oriented
enclosure and I really cannot wait to
see what the $49 case in the future will
look like as the standard sort of
improved and we get to see more features
incorporated into cases like this one
so guys thank you so much for watching
this concludes the 100 our review from
Corsair let us know what you feel about
the case and if you are considering to
do a budget system a budget build
whether or not you would consider
building inside the 100 our why or why
not and what are some of the features
that you would like to see in the future
