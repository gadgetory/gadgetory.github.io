insanely innovative fantex our trusted
memory partner Corsair and NCIX last
year Oris blew us away with an amazing
new notebook that had the power to push
a surround display array while
maintaining a very high level of refined
premium and gamer oriented features this
year they are presenting this new x5
laptop which they are billing as the
most powerful 15 inch notebook on the
market to date the 15.6 x5 PacSun intel
i7 cpu nvidia gtx 960 v in sli and a
beautiful 3k 2880 by 1620 display so
pixel density and the size is absolutely
amazing it might not be totally
necessary for gaming but amazing
regardless for productivity and the x5
is also spec for its ability to push 4k
via the DisplayPort with the dual 965 m
GPUs there should be just enough
horsepower to play games at high
settings there will be options to
include up to 32 gigabytes of ddr3 RAM
that's insane for storage there options
to include three listen to this m dot 2
512 gigabyte SSDs in raid 0 that's just
absolutely incredible as well as a 2
terabyte mechanical drive the chassis
looks very aggressive lacking an optical
drive however but most gamers are buying
digitally now anyway so it is something
that is fair to overlook when cramming
as much into this package as possible
the keyboard was decent however the keys
did seem a little mushy however there
are macro keys included on the left side
of the keyboard that are illuminated the
right side of the chassis features an
HDMI port two USB 3 an SD card slot on
the back there is a VGA out one USB 3
and Ethernet along with AC in on the
left side there is a USB audio jacks
HDMI and a mini DisplayPort with two
exhaust ports on each side to prevent
this thing from overheating from all
this insane hardware the most attractive
feature however has to be the glass
trackpad it is smooth and incredibly
beautiful and very accurate the price of
course falls into that premium category
Oris is looking to price this monster
somewhere around 2,200 to 2,500 dollars
so stay tuned for what we hope is going
to be an amazing review of this
beautiful and insanely powerful gaming
notebook the x5 from Oris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
