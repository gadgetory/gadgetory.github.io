Canucks and countless of times in the
past I always promote open back design
headsets or headphones for gaming
because they deliver much wider and
better soundstage over a closed back
pair but that might no longer be the
case if you love and own a closed back
pair because sanitizers new gsx 1000
gaming amplifier delivers the best
surround sound experience that I have
ever heard and I was truly surprised at
their surround sound engine but you know
what this thing ain't cheap at over $200
so you got to have appropriate
headphones first before considering an
amplifier but is it really worth it find
out after this the dark bass 900 may be
the most innovative case of the year
with a built-in Qi charger interior
lighting tempered glass that can be
installed on either side and a fully
modular interior that can be inverted if
you so desire be quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below unboxing of this
thing is straightforward you get just
the GS X 1000 unit and a red 1.2 meter
USB cable I feel like we've gotten a
little bit spoiled by pointless
accessories included on gaming products
that having only what you need is kind
of refreshing to see although I would
consider this cable to be short it's
great for like a notebook user but with
my PC I wish the cable was longer the
amplifier is quite small it is mainly
plastic visually it should fit no
problem under your monitor or beside the
keyboard plus the square format is nice
to neighbor beside other gear some
glossy parts though aren't fortunately
present around the silver aluminum
volume dial which is in the worst spot
for gloss as particles and dust just
accumulates here in this cavity the base
is not heavy it's not like a paperweight
and the rubber at the bottom kind of
secures the amp in place but it's just
too easy to move around with a headphone
cable it can be angled for better side
of the display but again it's not well
grounded the i/o is at the back which
cleans up the face of the unit with a
micro USB for power we have headphone
and mic inputs plus an additional 3.5
millimeter audio source they they call
for loud speakers for example now I
initially thought at this price it would
be nice for a quarter of an inch head
output to be included but this amp is a
gaming sound card first before even
considered to be like a replacement for
many other desktop amps for one
headphone impedance between 16 and 150
ohms are recommended making this not
exactly suitable for high-end stuff like
HD 800 or even the HD 650 s these
headphones are 300 ohms and there's just
not enough power at full blast to get
satisfying results out of these
headphones so what this amp is fantastic
for our gaming headsets the drive my
game one absolutely no problem
the same goes for their new GSP 300
headset and my other non gaming paired
the HD 598 all sound absolutely
phenomenal through the amp you get more
breathing room for higher volumes with
no distortions and I would say the
majority of mid-range headphones would
be a fantastic fit with the GS X 1000
but what makes this a gaming amp is
sanitizers surround sound engine that
blends beautifully with a simple
plug-and-play solution its driverless
and all the features are easily
accessible on the capacitive touchscreen
that dimly shows the volume but wakes up
when you hover your hand over it it's
kind of cool initially I was skeptical
this driverless nature because I do like
to play around my EQ curves and really
just fine-tune my sound signature to my
liking but I realized the simplicity of
just working out of the box is
appreciated plus it works on a Mac - the
volume dial is very smooth it's aluminum
it's also very light and has minimal
resistance fine-tuning and 2% increments
is okay the wheel doesn't spin out if
you try to and I only wish that we had
the mute function like double tapping on
the volume indicator but the only way to
mute your source is through your other
gear on the top left is our source
switch between headphones and additional
loudspeaker out beside that are four
presets gaming music movies and just
default and the bottom row is where that
magic toggle is located between 2.0 or
7.1 channel sound that enables front or
rear emphasis and surround mode plus
room scale adjustment on how much reverb
you want in your audio indicated by the
pluses and finally we have a mic pass
tube toggle if you want to hear yourself
and voice chat a feature that I love for
closed headsets
there are four more toggles one in each
corner that enables some built-in
presets which you can override with your
own by holding it for five seconds but
these are really poorly placed because
they are super easy to accidentally
activate while you're adjusting other
settings so I would love to have an
option to disable the corners that I'm
not using or remove the sensitivity on
how they're activated and by far the
best feature here is that magical 7.1
toggle instead of hearing audio
environment by you ears over here
everything literally expands the audio
atmosphere grows to the point of making
you feel like the walls are the speakers
and this is achieved without sacrificing
on the sound signature as everything
still sounds natural and that is very
difficult to achieve for example
standing in the middle of the forest in
witcher 3 to hear wolves running around
you wind in the air branches being
broken you can feel the scale of this
environment but yet they're still sound
very natural like they should sound but
in a much more open atmosphere
especially if you run this through an
open-back headset or headphone the audio
immersion is unreal and I don't use
immersion lightly it's like seeing 4k at
120fps you know for the visual side of
things it's kind of like that relevant
on the audio side of things it's just
utterly fantastic experience and what I
really love is you know son Heiser is
put in the work for the surround sound
engine to sound natural and not Hollow
not tinny and not concert like effect
that many other surround sound engines
sound like particularly if you looking
to improve the ambience of the games you
play or just revisit some games that
have fantastic audio engines bf1 is just
wow Witcher 3 is amazing I still you
have to explore some other strategy
games but as a 7-point one being inside
a large environment inside the game is
very well complemented by having this
large audio space virtually simulated in
a headphone or a headset and so the
signal processing here is truly the best
I've heard and it sort of restores my
hope in surround sound engines moving
forward but not always fine and dandy
with the GS X 1000 particularly the
presets that are here the eSports preset
utterly useless crushes the bass
increases the treble to this
tinny sound which is utterly unpleasant
the music mode it boosts the bass which
is fine for like if you want extra bass
out of like an open pair and the movie
mode it's okay just something doesn't
feel right there so I always referred it
back to the natural sound preset I'm
happy that the core component of the GS
X 1000 is solid truly the best surround
sound engine that I've ever heard and
most the time I leave it to 2.0 for
music and movies but going to the same
point one for gaming if you really want
to get that truly immersive atmosphere
that you potentially never heard before
that is delivered very well even for a
closed back design headset that usually
suffers from like a narrow soundstage
this basically solves it for all gaming
headsets that are closed off now you get
to experience like a really nice full
open and natural sound stage and
our audio environment that you would not
otherwise experience with you know
others around sound engines and when it
comes to the microphone quality I'm
using the game one headset which is like
the industry benchmark for microphone
quality this is connected to the amp now
the thing is you cannot control any of
the microphone properties through the
hub there is no way to enable or disable
noise cancellation there's no way to
control the game although you can
control it through the microphone
properties in Windows but I hear that
there's a little bit too much noise
cancellation processing going on in the
background
it does sound clean and there's no hiss
but I wish that it was a little bit more
detailed in the voice because when I
connect it to the my motherboard it
sounds a lot better because there's no
processing involved and so this is what
the microphone sounds now when connected
to my motherboard it's a little bit more
natural sounding but just notice how
much more background noise there is no
noise cancellation at all applied here
so the microphone has potential because
it sounds cleaner it sounds more natural
but with the compromise of more
background noise compared to what we
heard from the amp and that is it for
this video if you're in the market for
sound cards I would highly recommend you
look into this particularly for the 7.1
channel toggle that magic toggle is
amazing
but for the rest of stuff you know
everything else is kind of like add an
extra and I wish that it was a little
bit more refined on those other features
like those presets but let us know if
you are still interested I'm Dimitri
with Hera canucks see you in the next
video and bye for the better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
