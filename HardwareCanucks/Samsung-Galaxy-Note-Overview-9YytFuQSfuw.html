and today we're gonna take a look at the
galaxy note from samsung is it a phone
is it a tablet it doesn't even matter
now the Galaxy Note is a larger device
but as you can see here it fits in the
palm of my hand
I do have smaller hands so it is pushing
the limits but despite its size it's
still a rather sleek device now first
and foremost it is a phone so at the top
we have an earpiece right next to the
earpiece is a 2 megapixel front-facing
camera as well as sensors to adjust the
screens brightness along the bottom edge
are four capacitive buttons the first
button on the left is a menu button now
this button is used by any program or
the OS to bring up a ancillary menu then
the button next to it takes us back to
the home screen followed by a back
button and then a search button that
takes us directly to a Google search
along the left edge of the phone is the
volume buttons which blend in
beautifully with the side of the device
on the right hand side is a similar
button that puts the phone to sleep or
powers it off along the top edge is the
stereo jack for headphones or a
headphone microphone combination which
makes it easy to carry the note around
in your pocket and have a headset on
along the bottom of the device is our
mini USB port to connect it to the
computer and the stylus or as Samson
calls it the S Pen now the S Pen slides
out freely from its housing and slides
back in just as easily but it is it does
click in place and at no time did we
ever have the stylus come loose or feel
like it was going to fall out
Samsung really nailed it continuing on
with the back of the device we have our
speaker in the bottom left hand corner
and an 8 megapixel camera at the top
with the LED flash right next to it now
the back of the Galaxy Note is nice it's
plastic but it is textured and we
believe Samsung got it just right it's
comfortable in the hand it's resistant
to scratches but when it does scratch it
still looks pretty good and it's easy to
replace the front of the device is
covered in Gorilla Glass and although it
is smudge resistant it's not magic so
there you have it the Samsung Galaxy
Note</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
