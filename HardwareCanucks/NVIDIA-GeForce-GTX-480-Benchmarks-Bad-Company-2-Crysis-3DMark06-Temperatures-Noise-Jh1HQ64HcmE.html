about as high as I saw them all day 85
degrees Celsius and the fans spinning at
61% for all the complaints of
pre-production samples being mini space
heaters the actual retail products
aren't all that bad all right so here's
something I discovered a few seconds ago
for people who actually purchase the
card is for your own safety I would not
suggest grabbing this card after it has
been on for a while it will burn you I
as I discovered just a word of friendly
advice
all right so let's wrap it up now
obviously this isn't a complete review
or even a series benchmarking session
the cards were run through some games
3dmark etc and without a doubt the GTX
480 does perform better than the 5870
however it also carries a higher price
tag one thing I do want to mention
though is there's been sort of a lot of
bickering around the web about the heat
and temperatures that this thing
produces well to be honest it seems like
a non-issue for these upgraded retail
cards the temperatures of 85 degrees
Celsius really aren't all that out of
the ordinary but both ETI and invidious
previous generation cards pushed that
and the current 59 70 does as well at
the end of the day I think the noise and
heat complaints are complete non issues
and ultimately pay more but you get more
feel free to disagree that's just how I
see it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
