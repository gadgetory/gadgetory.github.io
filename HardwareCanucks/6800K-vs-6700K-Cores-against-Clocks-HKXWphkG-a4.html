months back when I switched from my six
core x79 platform towards a sky like CPU
with a z170 platform as my workstation
upgrade everybody flipped out everybody
lost their x99 they said six core they
said instead of this little dinky 6700 K
four core CPU let's see if I made a big
mistake the dark base 900 maybe the most
innovative case of the year with a
built-in Qi charger interior lighting
tempered glass that can be installed on
either side and a fully modular interior
that can be inverted if you so desire be
quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below what's up guys I'm
doing American axe and I've been so
tempted to find out how much time I've
been losing working on a fork or
workstation PC versus a 6 core we're at
workstation PC for Adobe applications
the answer will surprise you as it did
surprise me and so the battle begins
between the 6700 K and a 6800 K skylake
vs. Broadwell e fork or a thread versus
6 412 thread also look how tiny the size
difference is a bit crazy now it is
understood that an X 99 platform is more
suited for encoding work for
professional work for creative work
anything that requires computational
power because we have higher ram
capacity on the motherboard we have more
pci lanes on those processors and so my
primary reason for switching to a z170
platform from the x79 platform was
because i wanted to utilize the Intel
750 SSD which is the PCIe SSD as my boot
drive which was not possible on the X 79
so I've just kind of stuck with it and
it was been working great for me and so
now I get to finally reveal to you if
it's all been worth it or I should have
gone with an X 99 from the very
beginning in order to make the
comparison even I am using the same 64
gigabyte of RAM kit from g.skill at 32
hundred megahertz a GTX 980 founders
Edition and the same Kraken
sixty-one cooler and a whole lot of
patience for four days of testing
so aside from testing stock to stock
speeds between the two processors my
6700 K easily achieves 4.5 gigahertz at
one point two four volts while I didn't
get so lucky with the big guy that could
only reach 4.2 gigahertz at one point
four volts and starting with some
generic understanding of the system
performance we have 3dmark fire strike
ultra with the six core machine
performing 4% faster in Cinebench r15
the 6800 delivers a 34 percent better
score both at stalk and overclocked and
a 24 percent boost in OpenGL tests most
likely due to higher cache so clearly
more threads account for faster
computation and that's exactly what we
see in this collection with h.264
compression image editing heavy
multitasking and OpenCL tests with the
six core pulling ahead with a 28 percent
boost for video compression and 15
percent increase for heavy multitasking
while only 6 and 4% for image editing
and OpenCL respectively and now my
favorite part reel render tests in Adobe
CC with real projects that we've
published Adobe Premiere first so here I
use my most recent edit the GTX 960
versus rx 480 and I have color
adjustment layers applied with luma tree
effects that are GPU accelerated this is
very important because you can see both
the CPU and the GPU being utilized while
encoding but I wanted to make sure that
GPU accelerated facts were not
bottlenecking in my render so here are
encoding times with and without lumetri
effects this is very important again
which gives you only a four second
difference on my 60 second project which
is not significant and therefore I left
all my GPU accelerated effects in my
testing and so are you guys ready to see
the mothership of this entire video here
we go so I exported a one three and a
seven-minute timeline with both CPUs at
stock and overclocked and the six core
machine at stock speeds finished seven
percent faster on the longest time line
then the skylake cpu while
only 8% faster when comparing overclock
to overclock between these two
processors it's also very interesting to
see how my 6700 K at 4.5 gigahertz
finished 3% faster compared to the six
core at stock speeds then getting into
After Effects I tested a camera track
feature that analyzes the footage for
tracking reference points onto which you
can place tracking text and do all kinds
of stuff and then warp stabiliser that
analyzes the frames and smoothest
everything out so here on my 11 second
file regardless of clock speeds the 6700
K completed the analysis 15% faster than
the six core machine very unusual result
I'm happy to see that you know the four
core machine with faster clock speeds
performed better in After Effects for
these particular tests versus a more
core slower clock speeds and finally
getting into some gaming there isn't
that much of a big difference here the
six core showed incremental performance
improvement in CPU heavy titles up to
six extra frames per second on average
on an overclocked 6800 K in battlefield
4 and so the takeaway based on this
testing is that the 6700 K is an
impressive lordship I almost took it for
granted there for a while thinking man I
should have gone with a six core but
with my overclock of 4.4 gigahertz I am
out competing in encoding times compared
to a 6800 K at stock speeds the Gazza
goes up to three point eight gigahertz
however if you can overclock the six
core chip to past 4.2 gigahertz then
you're lucky then it will give you a
marginal you know 7% increase in 4k
encoding compared to my overclocked four
core machine but when you take into
account pricing for each system and x99
platform will be significantly more
expensive than a z170 platform and you
have to just take into account and see
if you will benefit for higher maximum
memory capacity so like the next 99 can
support up to 256 gigabytes versus z170
only 64 gigabytes you have to consider
more pci lanes on the CPU itself if
you're doing multi
you and stuff like that but all these
benefits will come at certain cost
obviously if your future proofing
however I am sticking with my sky like
6700 K for now because Adobe loves clock
speeds and that's a fact
any last words so yeah those are my
findings very surprised and my findings
to be honest thank you guys so much for
watching this video that's it you're
done can I go now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
