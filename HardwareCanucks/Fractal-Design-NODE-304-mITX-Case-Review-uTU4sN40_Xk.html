and welcome to another video review so
the move towards more compact yet
powerful systems is emerging stronger
than ever and of course knowing fractal
design
they sure cover the entire spectrum when
it comes to cases their node series is
the designated small form-factor line
with focus on home entertainment but
with ambitious enthusiasts it could
potentially be a lot more so they were
taking a look at the node 3 or 4 priced
around $90 now sure resembles a
microwave or some other appliance with
its glossy finish and it's also sized
appropriately for what it's designed for
on the left side we get GPU ventilation
with a removable dust filter and more
venting on the other side for your power
supply exhaust here we also find audio
jacks 2 USB 3 ports with a USB 2 adapter
included and a power button the note 3
or 4 is equipped with rubber standards
to prevent vibrations and better
stability and here we also find a
removable power supply dust filter now
cooling in this little guy is hidden
behind the front cover where all the
cables are attached and we have a
removable dust filter for the couple of
92 bloomer fans now because the front
panel is so closed off there is small
opening in the bottom and ventilation at
the top to help with air flow at the
rear we get a pair of PCI slots power
extender at the bottom left to speed fan
controller and the locking mechanism for
your PCI brackets removing the thumb
screws and taking off the cover we first
see a 140 millimeter exhaust fan and a
fan hub that connects all three fans
inside it is powered through a single
molex connector now dry storage in here
is actually quite interesting we have
three suspended drive brackets that are
first secured by two thumb screws at the
back and they low-profile screw in the
front now for a single time use that
front screw is fine but it did wear out
on me only after a few times so just be
aware of that the drive caddy itself can
hold both two and a half and three and a
half inch drives with rubber grommets
for the ladder and as you can see
mechanical drives must
face inside the case while as these do
to their small form-factor
can face either orientation I actually
kept the SSDs facing the other way to
avoid all the cable clutter which brings
me to cable management and I'm very
happy to see small integrations like
cable timeouts at the top bar for your
fan wires and plenty more on the floor
for the rest of routing now there is a
reason for the power extender and that's
because power supply is installed at the
front once that's in place I saw how
much room there was at the back and
that's a full inch underutilized and I
think this is a huge wasted potential
here as moving to the other side we have
all these cables and basically limiting
clearance for dedicated graphics cards
our unit is 170 millimeters so for a
chance to install a full sized graphics
card you must use a power supply of 160
millimeters or shorter especially if
using modular units and that is why that
extra inch in the back would have been
so useful allowing that much more
clearance without compromise so looking
at what type of graphics card clearance
we have it is impressive to see
basically 12 inches of space but this
will only fit with shorter power
supplies so I'd suggest around 140
millimeter units if you want to utilize
that full space for your graphics card
CPU towers of up to 165 millimeters will
fit but because of how the drive cage is
designed for one the drives
stick out slightly and also don't forget
about the cabling that will follow so
thicker coolers will not fit in starting
with the assembly getting our
motherboard in place and some wiring
done the front of the case looks a
little scary and also airflow
restrictive now what I did here was to
route my cables behind the drive
brackets to the other side to avoid all
the cable mess facing the motherboard
this still allows you to install all the
drive brackets without problems and
actually use the space between the SSD
and mechanical drive throughout the
large 24 pin cable and as you can see it
looks quite tidy for such a limited
space and again I don't think that's
full inch of the back is utilized even
after all the cabling is done so this
was a very poor this
choice from fractal now because of our
long power supply we couldn't fit a
full-size graphics card in place but our
low-profile r7 240 was able to fit just
fine measuring at 7 inches and before we
conclude there are two things to mention
the USB cable is backwards compatible
which is very considered from fractal
and since all the cable concentration
comes out on the left side the same side
the fan hub is located so it would be
easier to have that relocated onto the
other side without the need to route
molex all the way across the motherboard
into the top-left corner so the node 3
or 4 brings a lot of excellent features
for a home entertainment system starting
with a large storage potential and
pretty great default cooling now what
makes the 3 or 4 special is the ability
to turn this into a mini gaming station
with close to 12 inches of clearance for
your graphics card and a pretty seamless
cable management we also get an
integrated fan controller and dust
filters on every intake now on the flip
side there is wasted room potential
behind the power supply that
consequently restricts dedicated GPUs to
be installed if your unit exceeds 160
millimeters there's also no protective
shroud on the front fans considering
cable routing is going to be tight but
the note 3 or 4 isn't designed for an
enthusiast setup but it turns out it has
potential as long as you're aware of the
power supply clearance limitations now
it doesn't fully hit that damn good mark
but if future revisions take that into
account we'll be more than happy to see
it compete with the rest of mini ITX
offerings so guys thanks for watching
and between the recently announced 250 D
from Corsair the original beat phoenix
prodigy or this which one will you
choose and why
