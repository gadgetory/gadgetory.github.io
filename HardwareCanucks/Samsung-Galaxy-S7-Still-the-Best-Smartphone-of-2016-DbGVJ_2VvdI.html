I've been using the Google Nexus 6p as
my daily driver for a while now and as
you guys may know this was the best
Android smartphone to get since launch
until now its rival has emerged
meet the Samsung Galaxy s7 which along
with the s7 edge is considered by many
to be the flagship phone to beat in 2016
priced at $700 USD or $900 Canadian
without a contract this is an expensive
and premium class smartphone but you get
class-leading specifications for that
price specs wise you get a beautiful 5.1
inch quad HD Super AMOLED display with
the resolution of 2560 by 1440 a
quad-core Snapdragon 820 CPU or for some
regions like Canada the Exynos 88-90
octa-core chip paired with four
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
internal storage that can be expanded
via microSD a non-removable 3000
milliamp hour battery a 12 megapixel
rear facing camera and the last piece to
the equation Android 6.0 marshmallow
with the usual doze of Samsung's
TouchWiz high-end specs are great but
what I'm really looking forward on a
high-end phone is the design build
quality and the UI
I think Samsung killed at this time of
the design this phone just looks
gorgeous ghana's the plasticky looks and
feels from the s4 and the s5 they tried
hard with the s6 but personally I think
the looks and the feel of the s7 are far
beyond any of its predecessors the 5.1
inch display is perfect to hold in one
hand plus the edges of the screen blend
in gently with the metal frame via a
subtle curve on both sides
this makes the s7 extremely comfortable
when held in one hand
however Samsung's choice of implementing
Gorilla Glass on the back makes the s7
vulnerable to accidental slips and that
won't look good on the phone there are
third-party custom skins that you could
get hold of from D brand or slick wraps
or other companies that could solve this
issue but that's an added expense on top
of an already expensive smartphone I was
also surprised to see scratches on the
screen of our review sample after just a
few days of testing I'm not sure what
caused them but a screen protector is
recommended there's nothing like buying
a beautiful-looking phone only to cover
it completely with protective items a
few shifts that I noticed when the 6p
was the placement of the recent amps and
back buttons I'm not sure why Sam
still sticks around with this layout but
reversing the order of these buttons
makes it confusing to navigate through
Android systems but you get used to it
anyway apart from those design concerns
what really attracted me was the Super
AMOLED display I can guarantee you you
won't be disappointed here colors
popping a wonderful type of way and not
in a overly vibrant way the blacks are
so deep and in fact if you turn on the
always-on display feature you would only
notice these pixels lit up believe me
it's just a unique feature that works
perfectly for the clock calendar or a
custom picture for comparison the 6p
screen has a warmer tone that I
personally don't mind but the s7 stands
out with a much brighter and cooler
color space I definitely enjoyed
watching content on the screen but sadly
what took away from such an awesome
experience where the bottom plays
speakers all due to the added
water-resistant build sure you can use
your headphones to improve the immersion
but in other situations it's also too
easy to block the integrated speakers
with your fingers and that gets annoying
but let's say you listen and watch
content via headphones I have good news
for you the built-in app is fantastic it
outputs a clean signal and can easily
Drive most high-end headphones in this
case I enjoyed listening to music on my
HD 8 DJ's without experiencing
distortions or fancy eq's take my word
this is miles better than the 6p there's
a fingerprint reader integrated within
the home button it's fast but not as
fast as my 6p the unlock with the 6p is
almost instantaneous without the need to
press any buttons whereas on the s7 you
either have to press the home button or
the power button to wake up the phone
and then activate the fingerprint unlock
the galaxy s7 is ip68 water-resistant
well what else can I say if you
accidentally drop your phone down the
sink or pool don't worry you won't lose
your data the speakers suffer because of
this though the main highlight of the
phone is the 12 megapixel camera with
incredibly fast f 1.7 aperture this
helps to blur the background and isolate
our subjects very well thus inviting for
low-light capture the detail quality in
dark scenes is there but definitely not
as accurate to what can be achieved with
the Nexus 6p there's a manual mode that
allows the user to tweak around with
focus white balance
ISO shutter speed and exposure
compensation there are also other modes
like selective focus panaroma
video collage live broadcast slow motion
and hyperlapse
these are great features that you do not
want to miss on a device with a great
camera when utilizing the pro features
pictures look fantastic with excellent
dynamic range the colors are more
vibrant on the s7 compared to the 6p
when you take shots in daylight the
autofocus is ridiculously fast as well
both in photo and video modes seriously
I have yet to experience a camera faster
than this you also have the ability to
shoot 4k video at 30 frames per second
with digital image stabilization at low
resolutions and judging from these clips
it's hard to argue with what Samsung is
offering here let me know your thoughts
in the comments down below the galaxy s7
comes with Android 6.0 marshmallow and
on top of that you get TouchWiz I prefer
the clean and simple nature of stock
Android on the 6p where as TouchWiz is
another story the phone comes with a
bunch of Samsung related apps like
internet browser a separate mail app
messaging app and the list just goes on
you could use these apps on a regular
basis but coming from the simplicity of
Google Chrome Messenger and the
dedicated Gmail app makes me want to
avoid Samsung's alternatives you can
customize the looks of the OS with
Samsung's built-in team manager but
let's face it some of these teams comes
with a price tag and no one would want
to spend more on simple themes the UI
has become cleaner over time and memory
management is great you have
multitasking features like split screen
and app windows these are some great
features that stock Android lacks but
with the upcoming Android and operating
systems more refined look and
multitasking features it's a win win on
both sides performance was just as
expected blazing fast the Exynos 88-90
on our sample paired with 4 gigabytes of
RAM there's a great job keeping the
animations from app to app smooth
the chip had no issues gaming at that
quad HD resolution processing HDR photos
was done quicker than I would have
imagined and thanks to the excellent
memory management and the overall
experience was a pleasure battery life
was really good too
the phone easily lasts a full day with
maybe 15 to 20 percent left under my
usage and this was me browsing through
the web watching youtube videos and a
bit of casual gaming it should also be
mentioned that the s7 charges via
standard microUSB rather than USB C plug
on the Nexus 6p and Wireless Qi charging
has been built-in if you want to take
advantage of that so the galaxy s7 is a
great phone the design and the build
quality is fantastic the 5.1 inch
display is gorgeous to look at
performance is on par with what you
would expect from a flagship phone the
camera is by far one of the best
although I wish it to better pictures in
low-light features like ip68 water
resistance is very much appreciated but
there are a few concerns experienced
over the course of my testing the poorly
placed speakers at the bottom is one
negative and the rear glass sure looks
pretty but you'll end up covering it
with a protector to ensure it doesn't
fill up with scratch marks from normal
use meanwhile TouchWiz is something that
makes me want to go back to stock
Android hence still I prefer the 6p in
many ways give yourself some time to get
used to the UI and you may end up
finding a beneficial though luckily due
to the versatility of Android you can
certainly install third-party launchers
icon packs and other elements to give
the s7 a different personality
if TouchWiz simply isn't your thing well
that pretty much concludes my review of
the Samsung Galaxy s7 definitely let me
know about your thoughts in the comment
section down below about this particular
phone and is a wart signing a two-year
contract with your local carrier I'd
love to hear your thoughts I'm a bar
with hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
