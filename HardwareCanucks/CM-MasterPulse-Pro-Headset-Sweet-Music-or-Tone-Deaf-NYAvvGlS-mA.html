coming out with new gaming headsets but
we have some companies who are focusing
on updating their existing lineup with
new technologies and a cool new features
coolermaster has a pretty long history
in this segment with their cyrus and
series lineups but now they've launched
a new gaming headset and this is what it
looks like it's called the master pulse
Pro and it retails for about a hundred
dollars at that price Kula master may
have a tough time competing in the
gaming headset category since companies
like Kingston and their HyperX cloud to
headset and Corsairs well respected void
seem to have this corner of the market
locked up so does schoolmaster have what
it takes to compete in the big leagues
their old cyrus lineup certainly proved
that that's possible but right now
they're just way too many choices so the
company has to do something to stand out
we'll find out how the new master pulse
Pro did but before that quick message
from our sponsor the new NZXT s340 elite
what makes it so elite we've got a
gorgeous tempered glass panel extra VR
ports improved tail management and an
awesome magnetic buck the name is
fitting elite features at a good price
s340 elite check it out in description
below alongside the master pulse per
coulomb Master has also launched the
less expensive master pulse gaming
headset that retails for $70 and it
features two channels compared to the
added virtual 7.1 surround feature found
on the pro model now before I go on I
have to mention that the virtual 7.1
sound stage on headphones is very much a
hit or miss some companies do it quite
well while others have problems
delivering proper immersion personally I
prefer a great dual channel headset over
a mediocre 7.1 setup and luckily cool
master has given a way to disable these
surround sound profile will you prefer
I'd love to hear in the comments down
below the build quality of the master
pulse pro headset is rock-solid it's
constructed with an aluminum frame so
you don't have to worry about accidental
drops damaging anything on the downside
this adds weight to the headpiece and I
didn't enjoy wearing them for a longer
period of time plus the metal frame
observes and then transmits sound when
it gets in contact with anything I take
very good care of my headphones so a
hard plastic material would have been
sufficient choice but others may not
feel this
the other disappointing factor wearing
these was the strong clamping force
exhibited by the frame this is not
something you'd want to wear for a
longer period of time since I
experienced head fatigue after less than
an hour and that just isn't good but
once again your experience may differ
depending on the size of your head I'd
recommend you try this out at a local
store before putting out $100 the ear
cups are made out of leather like
material that's soft to the touch and
they have plenty of cushioning to
prevent your ears from making contact
with the drivers I would say it has a
little bit more stiffness compared to
the signature memory foam found on
Kingston HyperX headsets but that didn't
bother me at all my ears had some
difficulty breathing through so make
sure to vent them at times but overall
they do a pretty good job providing a
seal around your ears the cooler master
logos on both your cuffs are LED lit and
they feature RGB lighting this can be
controlled by the inline or more control
box that I'll get to in a moment
the illumination isn't overly bright but
actually dialing in the color to match
other peripherals is quite a challenge
without any accompanying software the
headband is self adjustable which is a
smart choice considering you don't have
to worry about steel sliders that you
manually adjust to fit the headset on
your head it also has appropriate
padding which is nice and supple but
like I said earlier if only the clamping
force was minimal I would have enjoyed
wearing these for a longer time the
built-in microphone is integrated into
the left ear cup rather than being a
dedicated boom mic setup it's a unique
style compared to competition but it is
certainly not something you'd want to
use on a regular basis while gaming as
you can hear I sound a bit farther away
from the mic and it picks up background
noise which isn't good especially when
you're gaming on a mechanical keyboard
as you can see I'm typing and talking at
the same time so you can definitely hear
it I would use this for casual Skype
calls but certainly not gaming
especially if you rely on a mic for team
communications or streaming but let us
know about this implementation in the
comments down below this is a USB
powered gaming headset so if you're
thinking about plugging this into your
console controller you'd be out of luck
I'm still not convinced about this USB
type approach for gaming headsets since
it is a multi-platform compatible
however USB interface passes a clean 7.1
digital signal to the headset and that
should complement and
expand the sound quality of these plus
without the power offered through the
USB interface hula master couldn't have
added RGB lighting the flat cable is a
nice feature so you can confidently say
goodbye to tangles it is non braided but
comes in soft touch rubber material
which does a very good job preventing
brushes against anything the two meter
length could be limiting depending on
how you decide to route it to your PC so
be mindful of that now onto the inline
remote control box you'll find the
volume control buttons and the listening
mode button on one side mic on/off
switch and 7.1 surround sound switch on
the other the LED control button is
located at the top and this unit can
also act as a short clip to be honest
with you I had a tough time
understanding the logic behind the
actual design of this inline remote
control its buttons are only located
around the unit and I wasn't able to
find the right button to adjust a
certain setting in the middle of a
gameplay session for example if you want
to mute the mic you might accidentally
toggle the 7.1 surround feature and vice
versa we've only buttons don't have a
satisfying tactile feedback and feels a
bit cheap which is not acceptable
considering the price the listening mode
button is a confusing feature added to
these headphones
according to cool master there are three
presets music movie and gaming plus the
ability to turn off the EQ the problem
is that there isn't any drivers software
so notifications when you switch modes
are non-existent the led does shift
colors which is even more confusing
because kula master hasn't labeled them
on their official website or manual
luckily I was able to get in touch with
one of their reps and they said that the
wet LED indicates an increase in bass
blue indicates treble and purple
increases treble once again this is
really a frustrating process but I've
been told that they're working on a
driver software that will be rolled out
in the future that's a good thing since
I feel like the master pulse Pro was
designed to be used alongside software
and without it this headset just feels a
bit incomplete compared to some of the
competition so how do they sound
remember that the delivery and the
quality of the sound is subjective but
in my opinion I think the master pulse
Pro really lacks in this area given my
experience and it's $100 price point I
usually do my sound test listening to
some tunes from different genres for a
week to break in any headphones but
moment I started playing music I was
surprised and not in a good way the
sound stage doesn't have any detail in
the trebles and it's highly emphasized
in the mid portion regardless of which
preset you use this didn't change even
after a full week of testing and
happened in both the 2.1 and 7.1 modes
the lack of bass is also noticeable but
the master pulse Pro has a feature
called bass effects basically when you
remove these side panels that are
magnetically attached to the ear cups it
enhances the low frequencies and it
improves the bass response by a bit I
did this and set the listening mode to
the right led the bass kicks in a little
further but that didn't help much since
the bass went from minimal to
excessively booming
if you're planning to use this for
content consumption you'll be
disappointed but I'm hoping Coolermaster
comes out with a software that includes
it will equaliser and that should help
out a lot gaming on the other hand is a
hit or miss experience with these I
spend the majority of my time playing
battlefield one and the extended bass
with bass effects certainly helps with
gunshots but overall I feel like the
whole soundstage was going through some
sort of compression again both the
stereo and surround modes had this issue
the soundstage tended to be muffled at
times with a real lack of detail and
very little distinction between
different audio tones the surin mode did
provide adequate directionality but it
actually muddled the sounds even further
one thing is certain the master pulse
Pro didn't improve my opinion on virtual
7.1 headsets
so this is what you can take away from
this video the master pulse pearl is a
disappointment in my opinion the metal
construction is great but it absorbs
sound when it gets in contact with
anything and the clamping force is a
little too excessive for me the leather
like material on the ear cups is
comfortable but I find that it's a
little too stiff and I had to adequately
vent my ears every now and then we here
at Harbor contacts are known for calling
things the way we see them and in this
case I highly suggest you spend your
hundred dollars for headphones elsewhere
Kingston Corsair Logitech and many
others have great alternatives and if
you don't absolutely feel the need for
virtual 7.1 you can get an amazing
stereo headset for this kind of money
I feel like this headset was designed to
go hand-in-hand with a software suite
due to lack of any on-screen control for
equalizer settings the integrated LEDs
the surround sound stage or other
features the master pulse Pro suffers if
Google master ever does release a way to
better control these headphones they may
deserve another look in the end testing
peripherals all comes down to personal
opinion and because of that I highly
recommend that if you get a chance to
try these out certainly do so and make a
decision by then I'm ebrill with
hurricane Alex thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
