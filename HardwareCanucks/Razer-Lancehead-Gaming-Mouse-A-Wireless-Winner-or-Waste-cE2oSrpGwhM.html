create a wireless set of gaming
peripherals for MySpace and giving the
new Razer lancehead Wireless a shot
it's definitely got big shoes to fill at
$139 because the rival 310 and the G Pro
which are my current two favorite mice
are half the price and more so let's see
if this laser mouse stands a chance
right after this Wow is this yours
it sure is but how huuu huuu
it pays off to stay loyal
NZXT hue plus now available in black or
white lighting up my air RGB fans to
complement the crack and cooler all
inside the beautiful
Mantha ITX NZXT bring all those colorful
dreams together test your own
imagination links for parts in the
description below so design wise I think
Razer have done a good job here giving
us this gunmetal gray type of top
surface although it is a bit slippery
the side rubber grips have that linear
continuty from the front grills and they
even managed to sneak in some glossy
plastic bits at the back really not a
fan of the glossy plastic however it
looks fantastic on video and photos so
again they're pushing their marketing
agenda on to you but in reality they do
can't get covered in little smudges and
stuff by the surface is so little it's
kind of not significant the illumination
portions look fantastic with nice
diffusion good color vibrancy excellent
for product marketing again but terrible
for battery life and so in five hours I
lost 25% of the battery that's
ridiculous
that's what light use doing some chrome
browsing and some video editing in the
mouse kind of staying idle in between
however when I jumped into a competitive
match for 45 minutes of constant use I
lost 5% of the battery so the battery
life is actually comparable to that of
the g4 3 Wireless with the lights on so
you both get about two to three days of
charge but if you turn off the
illumination you get about a week's
worth of charge now good thing the
receiver brick is low profile and can't
be hidden on your desk somewhere and the
cable can be plugged in into the mouse
when you need to charge up I do like the
USB dongle it's very small and can be
stored away on the mouse itself when you
need to travel the mouse shuts off
during the night or you can also
manually switch that off with the button
underneath and if the battery is below
15% or a threshold we get a blinking red
LED on the scroll wheel now the body
shaped to the most part is good but
there are some quirks
sofirst ambidextrous form is appreciated
for left hand users but the front
section flares out on both sides making
for an uncomfortable grip on the right
side where my ring and pinky fingers are
so I wish the section was a bit slimmer
and it immediately feels off when
compared to something more comfortable
like the rival 310 also the top of the
thumb section where the browser buttons
are are not angled
so overtime my thumb eventually sits on
the back browser button instead of it
being underneath it and for smaller
hands palm grip will be okay but the
lion's head favors finger grip more with
its flatter top surface the buttons are
all good nice separation between the
primary left and right clicks with good
location for the DPI shift and a
comfortable feedback on the browser
buttons as well and the scroll wheel is
textured wood like middle click and easy
to feel scroll steps and so if you can
get behind the price point of the land
said you're okay with the shape and
you're okay with charging this thing
every two to three days you might
actually be disappointed in a sense of
performance because it is still laser
despite very high quality optical
sensors available on other Wireless
iterations like the g4 3 or the G 900
not exactly sure what Razer is thinking
because the wired version of this mouse
has a optical sensor but the wireless
comes with laser only now the issue with
the lancet for me is not the latency
everything feels ok there but the
liftoff distance that despite
calibration and Razer synapse software
crashed on me twice in the three times
that I've tried to calibrate for the
surface so that's a bit ridiculous and
despite the calibration the mouse cursor
moves way too much when you lift off the
mouse and when it comes down to be
considered acceptable for such a premium
product air or any competitor of gaming
I've also experienced some sensor
freezes where the mouse clicks will be
registered but the mouse movement is not
registering at all so I'm stuck with a
dead mouse after three seconds once I
start to move the mouse there is a bit
of motion going on and eventually the
sensor starts to pick up and everything
goes back to normal so I figured out it
was the crash during the surface
calibration that caused this because
after recalibrating my surface I've had
no sensor stuttering issues after that
and third despite playing on the same
dpi level as my rival or the G pro I
cannot control my flakes or the super
fast
in correction it still feels like
there's some form of acceleration and
for a gaming mouse that is the worst
thing if you already have your wrist
memory and how much you need to flick
and how much you need to maneuver in
order to aim control so yeah I am not
comfortable using this even though I've
been trying to you know game with this
for like a week
and usually I'm getting comfortable and
get to know the mouse in one or two days
but I'm still most learning exactly
where to position you know where to aim
with this thing and that's not a good
thing and so combine that with a jerky
liftoff movement it's just not a mouse
for competitive shooters at all even
when it's connected with a wire the
laser sensor here is far inferior to
what is available in the market for much
lower price points and even if Wireless
is your priority I would still recommend
going for like g43 Wireless it has a
much better shape and a fantastic sensor
or the G 900 which has a bit of an odd
shape for me but still I would recommend
the g4 3 over any Wireless iterations
that is available market right now and
so that means that the razor lens head
will not be in my wireless arsenal that
I'm trying to build always stay charged
with linky power up power banks Houston
gorgeous aluminum enclosure with dual
USB and type-c port with support for a
quick charge 3.0 to get your device's
recharged fast available up to twenty
thousand one hundred million power
capacities check them out in the
description below and so that's it for
my review of the Razer Lance had
Wireless I am disappointed they decided
to stick with the laser sensor and here
instead of growing something more
superior that still is compatible
Wireless but make sure to check out
those other videos that are more
relevant for this wireless gaming arena
so thanks so much for watching I'm going
to meet RIT with our architects and
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
