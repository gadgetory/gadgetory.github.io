great technology selection and service
hello everyone i'm dimitri with hardware
canucks and gtc is not only about
visiting seminars and go to talks to
hear how GPUs are used in this world to
progress science and to move our
understanding of multiple plethora of
things but they're also about showing
off really awesome technologies that are
sort of available for us to interact
with as well on the show floor so here
we do a quick rundown of some of the
coolest cars that we saw here at gtc
2015 and San Jose and so the first car
that is in your face is the renewable
coupe we spoke with them about what the
car represents what it means for
direction of future automobile industry
and how drive CX or drive px is use and
how the NVIDIA Tegra x1 the latest tegra
chip is being utilized inside this car
in the background we have our first
product or hrenovo coupe it's a
all-electric american sports car it has
over 500 horsepower thousand foot-pounds
of torque i can go 0 to 60 in under 3.4
seconds our focus is a company is really
around bringing the electric drivetrain
to the performance world and we're
we're really excited we think this is
the future of performance car itself has
over 80 processor is about a thousand
sensors all of that data is being
live-streamed up to the cloud we we have
over-the-air updates to come back down
again we really think the future of the
car is basically a data center on wheels
so we've architected the system kind of
around a platform that thinks in those
terms it's really changing the way that
cars are being built and you're seeing a
lot of companies that are starting to
adopt that philosophy more specifically
we're here at the gtc the GPU technology
conference with the invitation from
nvidia they're one of our partners we
started working with them a few months
ago right now we're running drive CX on
the center in each cluster and then on
the infotainment center console we're
actually using their latest x1 chip
which isn't available yet on the public
and the public market has over a
teraflop of processing power one of the
great things about the platform that
Nvidia is providing is it really is a
full platform it starts with the
hardware layer moves up into the
software stack and it really enables
companies like ours to actually innovate
and bring world-class graphics in a
world-class experience to our customer
and we think that technology should
include the
the human machine interface and so
that's something where the partnership
with Vidya really enables us to bring
their technology to the road a lot
faster than the larger audience can do
you know where art design cycles are
measured in months where you know the
large audience or they're measured in
years or you know close two decades so
we're excited about being part of part
of the story unfortunately I did not get
to go inside the renova coop and sit
inside of it but they open the door for
me spike to take some pictures and
videos of it but it looks gorgeous as
you can see from the footage but I also
got to do something really fun and get
inside the BMW i3 and let your car that
that was my first time driving to let
your car and whoa what a difference
first of all one things that I noticed
is when you release the gas pedal or the
accelerator pedal it because there's no
longer gas in there the car starts to
slow down like almost something start to
break but there's no power going into it
so that was one of the first things that
I realized that you really have to keep
your foot on the pedal in order to
actually accelerate into something and
on the show floor we also got to see the
Nvidia drive px system sort of blown up
it was just installed inside a simple
frame of vehicle where the cameras were
operational you could actually see
yourself in the cameras and all that the
entire system video will be incorporated
into the car for safer driving to
knowing your surroundings and be future
integrated with augmented reality and
augmented assistance for driving
realizing how much space you have in
front of you behind you on the sides so
you don't crash or there's some type of
sensors that would assist for breaking
or automatic braking in the future in
case there is a collision that is
expected and lastly there was a
Lamborghini around was beautiful red I'm
not sure exactly what it was doing there
but it was powered by Nvidia beautiful
car then there was an Audi which was
as well couldn't get it tight
unfortunately and lastly the BMW which
was gorgeous I mean that car just so
futuristic I really want to give it a
spin now now that I've been inside the
i3 and the future driving really looks
promising I really can't wait to see
exactly how far we advance in a year
from now in the gtc 2016 so thank you so
much for watching our GCC coverage we
hope you enjoyed it definitely had a
blast trying out and speaking with all
the guys about these cars and what
exactly they represent for the future of
driving because it definitely looks
promising so thanks much for watching
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
