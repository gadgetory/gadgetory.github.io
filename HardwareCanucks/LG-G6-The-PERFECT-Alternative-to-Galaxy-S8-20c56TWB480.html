you know for a fact that smartphones
have been receiving beautiful designs
that just grab your attention right away
this year has been a great start for
smartphones and LG but the bullet a
little earlier than expected by
launching the g6 the successor to the
not so well appraised g5 and they've
strike back big-time now I'm pretty
aware of the competition right now
because the Samsung Galaxy s8 has been
receiving a lot of fame for its design
in just the way how it looks
plus it has its own exclusive features
that are samsung focused and as much as
I would love to get my hands on one for
the time being I've been using the g6 so
I'm just going to talk about my
experience for the past few weeks and so
here's my full review but before that a
quick message from our sponsor
you
you
it's time to show off your elites I
wouldn't make be okay so let's just get
a few things clarified before I proceed
to the review I've been using the Nexus
6p for the past few years now and I've
never felt the need for an upgrade it
has a beautiful q HD AMOLED screen
excellent build and design along with a
fantastic camera it gets me through the
day just fine and I've always been a fan
of the cleaner user experience with
stock Android it has received numerous
updates over time and currently it's
rocking androids latest 7.1.1 OS but
oddly enough the g6 hasn't passed 7.0 I
mean really a two-year old phone versus
a two month old phone anyways I swapped
the sim from the six speed to the g6
booted it up and spent about 30 minutes
downloading the apps and setting up to
fit my style the first thing I noticed
right away was the size of the g6
comparing them side by side you can see
that the g6 has a much smaller footprint
than the 6p yet it boasts the exact same
5.7 inch display that's crazy and look
at those bezels it almost stands across
the entire phone and I love it the top
and bottom chin are symmetrical and
check out these curved corners on that
screen the attention to detail is just
stunning and that goes for the overall
build quality as well it's made out of
metal and glass and structurally this
thing is legit I'm actually more
comfortable using this phone without a
case than what I would do with the 6p so
you see guys when you pick this up
you'll feel premium quality all over the
body and to me that's always a plus
but it does come with its own caveats
the rear side of the phone is covered in
Gorilla Glass 5 which looks great
especially with the brushed metal
texture hidden underneath although this
glass picks up smudges and grease easily
which makes the phone uncomfort into
hold at times a quick fix to this would
obviously be applying a skin of some
sort on the back of this phone but I
wouldn't hear your thoughts about this
do you prefer a glass back on a flagship
smartphone compared to something like a
matte black finish let us know the
comments down below the g6 comes with an
IP 68 water and dust resistant rating so
that should prevent damage from
accidental spills
I respect elegy for including this
feature because competitors have already
adapted this
since last year and I think it's safe to
say that it is an expectation to see
this implemented on every flagship
device from now on oh and for those
wondering the g6 comes with a headphone
jack
sadly the North American models don't
come with the high performance quad
32-bit DAC found on the b20 but hey at
least it included a headphone jack
it's actually really good in fact it's
miles better than the terrible one found
on the 6p the g6 can drive my HD 5
minutes really well and I had my zone at
moments so I'll just leave it at that
along with the nano SIM card slot LG has
also included a micro SD card slot that
can be expanded up to 2 terabytes hold
on 2 terabytes really can you find a
card that exists with that capacity if
you do it's probably gonna cost you a
fortune but I'm glad LG has provided us
with that storage expansion because once
again North American models come with 32
gigabytes of on-board storage and I've
already eaten up more than half the
capacity over the course of two weeks
it's something to keep in mind
especially if you plan on using this
phone for taking a lot of pictures or 4k
video I took a while to get used to the
button layout from the g6 the volume
rockers are located at the top left side
of the body whereas my Nexus 6p had all
the buttons on the right side which
organ amah Clee is the best cypher
button placements to reach with your
thumb in my opinion but thanks to the
smaller size of the g6 activating any
buttons on the left was simple with my
index finger the power button is located
at the back which also acts as a
fingerprint reader and it's pretty fast
and unlocking the device you can also
double tap to wake up the screen if
you're using the phone laid flat on a
desk and there's no camera bumps
whatsoever so you can comfortably use
the device without experiencing
unnecessary movement finally let's talk
about that display I am still blown away
by the fact that they were able to cram
a 5.7 inch screen in such a compact form
factor remember it boasts a 28 80 by
1440 resolution and if you were to do
the math that equates to an 18 by 9 or 2
by 1 aspect ratio so here's what you
need to know you're getting a slightly
taller screen that gives you a lot more
vertical real estate for multitasking if
you use that feature on the downside
you'll experience these black bars
watching native 16 by 9 content
honestly it's not a big deal for me
personally
I would have preferred an AMOLED or OLED
panel because with that you'd be getting
a lot more deeper blacks than what you'd
be normally noticing with an IPS LCD
screen that being said this is not a bad
display I really enjoyed my time
watching content and just using the
phone on a regular basis I'll admit it
took me a few days to get used to these
slightly toned-down colors compared to
the AMOLED screen on the 6p and a good
example of that would be this picture I
tweeted out just a few days into testing
at first I thought that the colors were
a bit washed out but a couple days later
I noticed that they were just fine it's
interesting how we percept colors
differently especially when you switch
screens and if you're watching this
video on an AMOLED display it might look
a lot more saturated when compared
against an IPS LCD panel some other key
features about this display is that it
supports the Dolby vision standard that
means you're getting better dynamic
range brightness contrast so consuming
content was a pleasant experience the
colors look great but it all comes down
to content availability the saturation
level obviously does not stand up
against an AMOLED display but that's
subjective what do you guys think AMOLED
or IPs let us know in the comments down
below it's always hard to find a smart
phone these days with front-facing
speakers and the LG G six follows the
same trend now there's a single 1.2
driver at the bottom that's decent but
not mind-blowing plus you can easily
mute it with your fingers when you're
using the phone in landscape mode and
look compromises have to be made for
integrating this large display and I
understand that but if you care about
front-facing speakers you should
probably look elsewhere the software
experience out of the box was not the
best that I come across on an Android
phone let me get this straight the g6
comes with Android 7.0 and on top of
that LG has applied their own skin which
in my eyes still needs improvement
everything from the built-in keyboard to
LG's proprietary apps takes up
unnecessary space maybe I'm just being
too silly but I wanted to replicate a
similar and middlemost experience from
my 6 feet so here's what I did
install nova launcher and Google
keyboard scale the display all the way
down to its native resolution enabled
the developer settings and reduce the
animation scales to 0.5 X and man
bell stampy right away LG has a theme
strobe built-in I took advantage of the
dark theme and it looks pretty awesome
with my setup that's the beauty with
Android the user has full control of the
software experience customization is
endless and thankfully the phone was
fast even though it uses a slightly
outdated Snapdragon 820 one chip I
honestly don't care about high-end specs
at this point because as long as the
phone keeps up well with my tasks I'm
happy this brings me to the next best
thing about the LG G 6 the battery life
look I'm a light user during weekdays
because I spend most of my time in the
studio editing scripting and filming
products so casual usage gets me
somewhere around 50 to 60% for the next
day now I did spend a few days using the
phone immensely catching up on a few TV
shows on Netflix scripting a few reviews
checking mail you name it and
surprisingly the phone got me well over
6 hours of screen on time
remember usage can vary from one person
to the other
but the g6 does a pretty good job
holding up to that task even if you were
to run out of juice this phone supports
quick charge 3 bino and charges via taxi
I applied to this phone with 10% left
and once again thanks to quick charge
this thing topped out at 50% in just 13
minutes that should get you through the
day but don't forget this phone also
supports wireless charging so there's
that convenience so the last thing to
cover here are the dual 13 megapixel
cameras located at the back of the phone
one of them is used for taking poachers
both in daylight and low-light due to
its F 1.8 aperture the other one
features a hundred 25 degree wide angle
lens and F 2.4 that means you can fit a
lot more subjects in the shop without
having to back yourself to readjust
everything this is a really unique
feature about the G 6 and I sure had a
lot of fun testing both cameras before I
get into the results I want to quickly
mention LG's default crop factor out of
the box the G 6 has been set to take
pictures at 8 point 7 megapixels this
was done to take advantage of the 18 by
9 display but that crops a sensor and
you lose a lot more detail with photos
as you see I went back to the settings
and enable the 4 by 3 option which takes
advantage of the full 13 megapixels
sensor and pictures I'm about to show
you here were taken with that setting so
let's start with the primary camera the
pictures look really good to be honest
dynamic range is excellent
especially if you enable the HDR option
and there were zero shutter lag when
snapping these what's also interesting
about the camera app is you have full
manual control if you want to play
around with the white balance shutter
speed ISO and even options for manual
focus with peaking seriously guys
this takes mobile photography to the
next level Albion when you zoom in a
little bit you'll notice that the
details are softer but if you're sharing
pictures on social media this should be
more than sufficient let's take a look
at some samples
it's time to take illumination seriously
with vengeance RGB ddr4 memory by
Corsair with incredibly bright LEDs and
uniform color spread add a touch of
classic color that is fully software
controllable and compatible with a wide
variety of intel and AMD platforms more
info in the description below so my
final verdict about the LG G 6 is that I
loved using it for the past few weeks
everything from the build quality to the
design to the gorgeous 5.7 inch display
to the camera or cameras if I were to be
more technical where awesome you really
need to play around with the settings to
get the best possible experience I did
it and the difference was night and day
and I still enjoy using it on a regular
basis the battery life is amazing in
fact it's probably one of the reasons
why I'm switching over from a nexus 6p
to the LG G 6 because I was averaging
about three hours on the 6p and the g6
gets me well over 6 hours so that's
double the time and so that's actually a
plus for me and while I'm aware the
camera needs a lot of improvement I'm
pretty sure that LG can fix that with a
software update and the last thing to
discuss here is the price because the g6
starts at $650 and goes all the way up
depending on what carrier you are at in
the United States I think for the price
you are getting a pretty decent package
in fact I would wholeheartedly recommend
this phone just because of the display
the battery life and the design of the
build quality it just is a premium
device and I'm sure there are
alternatives out there like the 1 plus
3t that costs a lot less than the g6 but
you also have higher priced phones like
the iPhone 7 or a galaxy s 8 those are
really expensive phones and they feature
great designs but I guess it all comes
down to user expense so I'm going to
leave it right there and I want to know
your thoughts about the LG G 6 what do
you guys think about this phone the
design the build quality to display
leave a comment down below and let also
let me know what the camera samples
looked like and I guess that's pretty
much it if you're interested in any
alternatives plus if you're looking
forward to that comparison between the
galaxy estate in this phone also make
sure to leave a comment down below and
your card connects thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you then
