hammer away at daily if you're in the
market for new gaming keyboard or
mechanical keyboard perhaps I would
recommend you try a new switch from what
you're normally used to because that is
the only factor that is currently
evolving and the never-ending race of
finding the best gaming keyboard dot
tech domains have recently crossed
100,000 registrations used by all types
of brands startups and YouTube
influencers and now you can get your own

k70 RGB rapid-fire brings a fantastic
new switch the Cherry MX speed that
quickly became my go-to keyboard for my
own hammering and that is editing and
script writing and of course gaming but
man why do these keyboards have to be so
expensive running from $170 to 130 with
tkl and non RGB versions available now
aside from the new switches nothing has
changed with the k70 Corsairs formulas
remain exactly the same with an aluminum
frame media controls and at the top
right corner with a volume wheel and the
windows lock button beside a three step
brightness button and a very nice
feeling wrist rest that expands the
profile of the keyboard but not by much
and comfort wise it is very satisfying
the extra wast key caps are textured and
so is the space bar and I also
appreciate the Corsair logo on the
Escape key at the back is a USB
pass-through which is highly appreciated
beside it as a polling rate switch and
at the very bottom we have height
adjustment at the front and the back of
the keyboard so this is all familiar the
only thing that's changed is the font on
the keys compared to the original k70
it's a little bit too wide for my taste
but I think that's on purpose to let
more light through the key cap if
there's going to be one complaint here
from me that would be the cable I
dislike how thick it is especially since
its position is slightly off-center on
the left side and so trying to hide it
or rout it cleanly in your setup is
quite challenging but it comes with two
USB ports and they are easily
distinguishable when they plugged in
behind their computer so now that we
have all that out of the way let's focus
our attention on the new MX speed
switches the RGB variant comes in clear
housing as with all MX RGB switches
vibrancy and brightness is on point
color accuracy is among the best but
unfortunately as with all other RGB
keyboards that I've tried white
elimination is subpar compare this to
the white mode with the Razer chrome ite
or the Logitech G 810 and they all
exhibit either a pinkish hue or
something blue in there when next to the
g6 10 which is actually has only white
illumination you can see the K 70 here
is a touch on the pink side plus there
are some green reflections bouncing off
the keys themselves effects wise we have
plenty everything from rainbow to spiral
to color shift to rain effects anything
it want is here with smooth uniform
transitions so now that quick overview
is over how are the switches are they
any good you might be asking and the
answer is damn yes so the new MX speed
is a light linear switch so there is no
tactile bump and it also requires only
45 grams to actuate instead of the key
traveling two millimeters for the
actuation to register as with MX Reds
switch actuation happens at one point
two millimeters thus reducing the total
distance traveled and this is awesome
for two reasons one is once you're fully
comfortable with the switch and how it
behaves you don't have to bottom out the
key because you can almost lightly tap
on the keys for them to actuate because
the distance is so low for them to
travel this is awesome for typing the
best keyboard for typing in my opinion
as of now you know if you prefer the
linear actuation and for gaming stuff I
noticed that my hand after I csgo match
wasn't as tired because I didn't have to
apply as much pressure for the key to
actuate and number two even if you
bottomed out it takes less time and
distance for the key to rebounds so that
you can start to actuate the same switch
faster I noticed this immediately with
the spacebar I can continuously tap it
much faster than
any of my other keyboards and this is
also very helpful with csgo by skipping
the reload animation which felt really
amazing and many users on previous MX
switches would apply rubber ring dampers
on the stem to reduce total travel
distance when you bottomed out and I
think that's one of the reasons why the
MX speed will be an extremely popular
gaming switch because I've noticed a
serious improvement in my keyboard
action that doesn't require me to press
as hard and even if I bottomed out the
key I can perform consecutive actions
quicker and this is what the switches
sound like and after I did the audio
test I realized that the switches are
actually quiet loud much louder than MX
Reds and that could be because the
switch itself it's outside of the
housing like with the rest of the
keyboards but anyway if you love linear
switches you will definitely love the
new MX speed and last thing to cover is
the software which could be a little bit
more intuitive but you really get a hang
of it you can remap and assign macros to
any key which is super awesome
so creating macro commands for in-game
or you know writing entire line through
a single click of a button under the
lighting tab we have effects and perky
illumination with brightness control and
I've created a few modes for my own use
with different lighting on each mode so
gaming editing and default and lastly in
the performance tab you select what you
want disabled when the lock is on and I
never thought that this day would come
but I am going to be retiring my Nova
touch TTL with hybrid topper capacitive
switches I love this keyboard but I love
MX speed more it's literally a game
changer I love the short actuation and
combine this with a full package that
the K 70 rapid-fire offers this is a
damn good
product and I concludes this review
thank you so much for watching we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
