possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX silverstone has always
surprised us with something new every
CES like this year they had a case ready
for the new Intel mini STX standard
which has the 5 by 5 inches and totally
tiny all the Knux are quite interesting
but the new STX form factor could really
entice fun DIY projects and silverstone
has got you covered
also remember that headphone stand
competition which was held by Linus well
the second spot is what silverstone has
decided to mass-produce and it's awesome
it's full aluminium it's wall mountable
and strikes the perfect balance of
design and functionality and also on
display we got to see their new budget
mid-tower part of their redline series
that to me is sort of a response to the
NZXT s340 and the new fan tech speed 400
cases on the inside we have the bottom
chamber which is totally sealed off and
this is the feature that users have been
really loving so much and we hope that
silverstone modifies it a little bit so
you can populate a radiator through the
floor in case you need that extra high
clearance as you can see the dual 140
members are fans that are included in
our red LED are still really tight with
the top 5 in the quarter in its drive
bay and the bottom chamber floor at the
back they've spread plenty of cable tie
points all around the large CPU cutout
and that's awesome to see and plus
they've placed two SSD brackets on the
side that I feel might be a little bit
challenging to keep clean as all the
cables as over the other cables will be
concentrated around this area because
this is the main entrance point into the
interior from the back chamber we
further have a duo three and a half inch
drive bracket at the front which is a
good location with an 80 moment of fan
stashed away to help with driving some
of the air in this chamber and overall
the interior feels budget there are no
rubber grommets anywhere the metal has
been thinned out to keep the cost low
and we are yet to see what the side
panel will look like and what it would
feel like but they are targeting that
$69 price point and I personally cannot
wait to bill
inside the final retail case the are lo5
or the red line is 0-5 moving on to the
power supply Department Silverstone
keeps pushing forward with some awesome
improvements let's kick things off with
the new 650 watt sfx form factor power
supply that features an 80 plus gold
rating and a larger 92 millimeter fan
which leads to quieter operation
compared to a previous model with an 80
millimeter fan Silverstone still
dominates the SFX arena as this would be
an excellent choice for a mini ITX
enthusiast PC without compromising on
performance another awesome product that
they launched is the new 850 watt
Strider stamped with the 80 plus
platinum rating this unit features a
hundred and forty millimeter fan and the
best part is that it shares the same
form factor as the 750 watt power supply
being only 150 millimetres in length so
being able to squeeze all that power to
an even smaller form factor is awesome
news plus you still get the fully
modular design and best-in-class power
efficiency they also announced the
revised and final version of the
insanely powerful 1500 watt 80 +
platinum rated PSU that measures at 180
millimeters in length which is
ridiculous for so much power and it will
be set to be on retail at the end of q1
seeing the physical size reduction of
power supplies in each category is
awesome without losing efficiency and
maintaining all the same features as
before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
