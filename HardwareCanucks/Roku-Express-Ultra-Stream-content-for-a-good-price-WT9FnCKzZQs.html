streaming player from Roku for folks who
just want occasionally stream content on
their 1080p TVs now this is also a new
streaming player called the Roku ultra
this is priced at $130 and it delivers
4k content supports HDR and has a ton of
other features that we'll talk about in
a bit with hundred dollars separating
these two players we're about to see if
the $30 Express is a great value where
they're spending more money on the Ultra
is a good investment or if you should be
looking somewhere else altogether
different Toshiba now offering ocz
products that are awesome and affordable
like the RD 400 TR 150 and vt1 80 that
are backed by advanced warranty program
now stronger than ever
under Toshiba so let's look at the Roku
Express first since it's quite basic and
meant to be a step up from the typical
slow basic interface that you get with
many Smart TVs these days within the box
you get the streaming player itself
which has a compact form factor a remote
a power adapter for the player a short
HDMI cable and a micro USB cable to
power the player Roku is targeting the
Express as a simple all-in-one streaming
solution that's affordable and easy to
use
and I agree with them the Isetta process
was just as simple as plugging in the
HDMI and USB cable to your TV mind you
if your TV lacks a standalone USB port
this is where the included power adapter
comes into play if you happen to own an
older TV that doesn't accept HDMI Roku
happily sells the Express plus for
$40.00 that works with either HDMI or
composite after going through the setup
process of connecting the device to your
Wi-Fi network and creating a Roku
account you'll be directed straight to
the home screen where Roku has
pre-installed apps like YouTube Netflix
Spotify and Google Play movies if you
want to expand the channel selection you
can browse through the channel store to
find your interests Roku says that
there's access to more than 2,500 free
or paid streaming channels here in
Canada including a hundred thousand
movies and TV episodes there's a much
larger selection of options for people
who live south of the border with in the
user interface there's also a convenient
search bar where you can easily look for
movies actors TV shows you name
and it works out pretty well if you have
a Netflix subscription and if the movie
you're looking for is available on that
platform you have the option to be
directed to the channel and your movie
starts playing right away the network
card inside the player only detects 2.4
gigahertz fans so that may or may not
affect the streaming performance I
didn't experience buffer delays or
playback lag when watching movies but it
is something to be aware of the
performance is decent and it is to be
expected given the price of the player
channel load times are quite slow and
navigating through the UI is a bit
clunky especially if you are entering
characters on the search bar which
brings me to my next point
the remote it's a simple layout with a
back and home button at the top
navigating buttons are right below
followed by previous and store buttons
that allows you to rate and delete a
certain channel play pause skip and
backward buttons are located right
beneath
you'll also find quick access buttons to
Netflix Spotify and Google Play movies
and TED Talks the lack of volume control
buttons is disappointing and you'll also
have to make sure to point the remote
directly to the player for the best
control experience considering the small
form factor of the Express and the price
tag on top of that these are some of the
quirks that you have to work with you
can use your phone to control the
Express - all you have to do is download
the Roku app that's available for both
Android and iOS if your player is
connected to the same Wi-Fi network as
your phone the app will automatically
detect the player and your sent I'll be
honest with you the only time I use my
phone is when I'm searching for movies
or TV shows because you can use your
phone's keyboard to perform the search
which is a lot faster than punching
characters with the standard remote
control there's also an exclusive
feature called private listening which
allows you to plug earbuds or headphones
into your mobile device and listen
privately to the audio rather than your
sir on speakers and it worked great you
can also share photos music and videos
from your phone to the TV it's not the
best experience when compared against
Google's chromecast which allows you to
screen share your phone to the TV along
with continuous app support that keeps
coming into the ecosystem but for
streaming content in general I think
you'll be fine using the Express if you
want the absolute best experience from a
roku device you might want to check out
the new ultra but before getting too far
into this thing let's do an unboxing to
see what we get first up we have the
unit itself and after
giving off the plastic goodness I'm
gonna let it aside and move on to the
next part accessories you get a remote
controller a pair of headphones along
with complementing your tips two
batteries to power the remote and the
power adapter for the player I'm
disappointed in the fact that they
didn't include an HDMI cable like they
did would be much less expensive Express
I mean really the ultra is Roku's
flagship streaming player and the specs
back that up it features a quad core
processor to process UHD content at 60
Hertz dual band wireless connectivity a
dedicated Ethernet port a micro SD card
slot for storage expansion an optical
audio out for Sun bars and receivers and
a USB port that allows you to play back
local content from an external hard
drive or flash drive plus it natively
supports h.264 and 265 codecs which is a
nice touch the real difference between
the Express and the ultra is the
performance and that's the first thing I
noticed when playing around with the
ultra navigating through the UI is super
smooth movies and TV shows start playing
instantly thanks to the dual band chip
inside the player what you're getting
here is a responsive system and that is
to be expected given the hundred and
thirty dollar price point a few other
features you get is a voice search
assistant that can be used to search for
actors movies and TV shows but it
doesn't work on YouTube plus it's not as
smart as Google now on Android TV the
included remote control does come with
waling controls and there is a dedicated
headphone jack that enables the private
listening feature I mentioned before
once you plug in any pair of headphones
you'll also find dedicated gaming
buttons but it's not going to be as
close to gaming on an actual controller
speaking of games don't expect a vast
selection since the roku ecosystem can
draw upon the huge collection found in
Google and Apple app stores there are a
few classics like snake and some others
but gaming platform this is not it it's
likely functionality was added as an
afterthought if you happen to misplace a
controller don't get worried all you
have to do is press this button on the
player and the arak will start beeping
right away which is awesome like the
Express the ultra can be controlled
using your phone but do note that you
lose the gaming buttons along with quick
access buttons to Netflix Spotify Google
Play Movies and TED Talks this was my
first experience testing out two new
Roku streaming players and
I've enjoyed watching content on both of
them but I just can't see myself
comparing this to my shield TV that ones
Android which is a lot faster and
includes exclusive features that PC
enthusiasts can take advantage of I'll
admit the shoe costs $200 for the
console itself and when you add things
like the remote and upright stand it can
easily hit $300 I think it wouldn't be
fair to compare the shield to the ultra
because they're both targeted towards
two different audiences
luckily the shield happens to provide
these same streaming services that Roku
offers the competition is stiff within
the market and Roku is striving to
compete directly against alternatives
like Apple TV Amazons fire TV and others
what I can tell you about Roku's ultra
is that it's a fantastic streaming
device especially if you only 4k TV
however in Canada the lack of support
for Hulu HBO now Amazon video and a few
other streaming channels could be
disappointing but I hope Roku can
include those in a future update as for
the Roku Express it's ridiculously good
for the price if you ignore the
not-so-great performance compared to the
ultra sure you'll miss the storage
expansion a USB port for local playback
voice assistant and few other key
features but I think you'll be just fine
for some Netflix and chill sessions so
those have been my thoughts about the
new Roku Express and the Roku ultra
streaming players first of all what are
your thoughts about these new devices
and are they worth picking for the price
also which alternatives should be
looking at in the future let us know in
the comments down below
I mean burn with hurricane axe thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
