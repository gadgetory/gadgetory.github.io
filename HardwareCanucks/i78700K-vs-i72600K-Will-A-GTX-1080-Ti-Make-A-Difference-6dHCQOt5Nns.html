ago we did post a video taking a closer
look at the performance differences
between Intel's new newest populate I
787 under K versus a six year old Sandy
Bridge i7 2670 hour right over here was
well-received within the community it
also sparked some interesting critique
regarding our testing methodology you
see I decided to use a gtx 1070 because
it was one of the best cards currently
available if you were looking for a good
blend of price to performance I was also
an awesome fit for anyone who was
researching a simple GPU drop-in upgrade
on their existing Sandy Bridge systems
or someone who's just looking to build
an entirely new coffee lake desktop you
see the problem with the gtx 1070 is
that it isn't the most powerful graphics
card around and some folks thought it
may have been bottlenecking the 87 decay
results that's a bit of a problem since
the 87 owner K and E 2600 K ended up
showing very similar results in our
gaming tests I even said that if a
lower-cost upgrade is necessary your
Sandy Bridge system is better off with a
gtx 1070 rather than a complete system
upgrade everyone at hurricane x heard
that critique and we reacted the result
this the Asus GTX 1080i Strix OC with
today's GPU premiums taking into account
it costs almost $800 but it also happens
to be one of the best graphics cards
around so will disallow coffee Lake to
really stretch its legs let's find out
after this message from our sponsor so
it was kind of love at first sight you
know there's really nothing like this
exterior I love the metallic color the
tinted glass panel the RGB fans at the
front it's basically a see-through case
and who doesn't love that your graphics
card can go vertical the top is radiator
friendly and the right side is so unique
when exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
aged 500 key
master check it out inscription below so
I guess the reasoning behind this move
to a gtx 980ti for testing is pretty
straightforward let's assume for a
moment that someone who had paid big
bucks for an i7 2670 a SUP grade that
will bring them back to the forefront of
modern gaming systems in that case a gtx
1070 wouldn't be the best of the best
like the gtx 680 when it was launched
that distinction falls to the nvidia gtx
1080 TI and that would of course be
paired with the i7 87 okay but before
again to the benchmarks let's go over
the system specs again in case you
didn't watch that last video you should
be aware that again multi-core
enhancement was turned off and all the
other options were left to their default
configuration other than memory speeds
let's start with a full batch of 1080p
benchmarks while the exact same
benchmarks showed the system neck to
neck with a gtx 1070 the higher end and
much more expensive gtx 980ti somewhat
eliminates the GPU bottleneck that means
the I 787 decay pulls out ahead in
almost every single test at 1080p
sometimes by a massive amount another
interesting thing that came up was
performance beyond averages based on
99th percentile results it looks like
the Sandy Bridge system just can't
deliver as consistently smooth gameplay
as coffee lake this proves that you
can't always rely on average frame rates
to determine overall performance with
all that being said at 1080p the 2600 K
does provide very good performance when
paired with the slightly pre overclocked
gtx 980ti but I have to ask this
question how many folks will want to
spend over $700 on a graphics card
upgrade and limit their new system to
such a low resolution well that's what
the next batch of results will address
moving on to 1440p puts additional
stress upon the graphics card and I
think the gap between coffee-like and
Sandy Bridge should narrow someone but
did that actually happen we'll find out
it looks like my thought process was
pretty much spot-on
with a few minor exceptions Lee 2600 K
and 87 in a cave once again runs neck to
neck when the stress is put on the
graphics card expect these differences
to become even narrower as resolution
and detail levels increase at 34 40 by
1440 or 4
as for those exceptions to the rule well
they come from the usual culprits those
being 99% I'll frame rates in dx11
applications and there's Grand Theft
Auto a truly odd performer that seems to
have been updated to predominantly favor
Intel's newest architecture adding a bit
of overclocking to these processors
actually allows the i7 2600k
to offer a bit more 99% top performance
in dx11 but it doesn't actually add that
much in dx12 this is proof that
processor is indeed the bottleneck
rather than anything else in the system
remember we were able to overclock the
i7 87 under K to five point one four
five gigahertz on all cores with a
memory speed of about thirty six hundred
megahertz while the i7 2600k hitting
almost 4.9 gigahertz with a memory speed
of 23 hundred megahertz so there you
guys have it and I know this one was a
bit of a short one but the results
really do speak for themselves
if they're currently rocking a Sandy
Bridge i7 2616 hundred dollars on an
eighty seven hundred K ddr4 memory a new
motherboard and a gtx 980ti and there
are certainly some advantages you will
get a fluid gaming experience even since
at 2560 by 1440 the 2700 K struggled to
keep up its 99 percentile frame rates
close to the 87 under came just be aware
that as resolutions increase the gap
will become less and less evident
another thing that should be taken into
account is that as GPU capabilities
increased with next-generation cards
from AMD or Nvidia it looks like coffee
lake is well-positioned to pull even
further ahead so for now while a gtx
980ti or gtx 1070 would be a perfect and
solid upgrade for a 2600 cane that CPU
could become more of a bottleneck with
faster cards even though the results
here point or it's a bit different
outcome than in our original video the
conclusion is pretty much the same even
in 2017 the i7 2670 has to offer however
there are some limitations to its
performance while I don't think many
people will be using a GTX 1080 ti2 game
at a resolution of 1080p those
benchmarks did show that the 80 so no
decay does have a significant advantage
at times so what do you think of these
results guys do they change your opinion
as to how the
processors stack up with one another let
us know in the comments down below if
anything you're amazing responses to
these old versus new technology videos
will continue to inspire us to make even
more of them so stay tuned
