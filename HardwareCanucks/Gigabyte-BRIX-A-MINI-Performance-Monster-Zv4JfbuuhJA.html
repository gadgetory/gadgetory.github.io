X and you may recall a review of the
asrock d-box s a compact basic
bare-bones PC that featured intel's
ultra-low voltage sound generation Core
i5 processor if you missed out on a
video we will leave a link down below
for you to check it out today we're
taking a look at get another compact PC
but this time it's from gigabyte is what
it looks like in fact we have two of
these in the studio one of them
featuring a skylake processor and the
other one being kb lake in our original
cable lake review Intel's newest
architecture didn't provide any massive
benefits over skylake and a desktop
environment but we mentioned it could
have a significant impact upon the
mobile and ultra small form-factor
spaces but does it let's find out but
first a message from our sponsor
you can only rely on the pros do the job
with every keystroke satisfying like the
millions before
quality fuel every team regardless of
good faith hula master master keys bro
make a clicking make a good okay just
before I proceed with specs I want to
clear something off my shoulders this is
a bare-bones kit which means you have to
populate your own choice from memory
hard drive and the operating system the
other components like the CPU
motherboard cooler and the networking
card are already installed within the
chassis also most Brooks units aren't as
feature-rich as VV bucks s a good
example of that would be the lack of a
dedicated remote with all the basic
controls you need like volume adjust
play pause skip tracks and navigating
buttons something that does come with
the B box ass both bricks units here at
the table are powered by Core i7
processors the only difference between
the two is their microarchitecture on
one hand we have a unit with a skylight
core i7 6500 you CPU clocked at 2.5
gigahertz that can turbo up to three
point one gigahertz and the other
featuring a cable a core i7 7500 you
clocked at 2.7 gigahertz that can turbo
up to 3.5 gigahertz the rest of the
specs are exactly the same this includes
the cache bus speed and even the in
company integrated graphics subsystems
on both ships are caught similarly at
this point you may be wondering whether
or not cabling is going to bring
anything to be small pcs and the first
hint behind the answer is the
significantly higher clock speeds that
the newer processor can achieve another
thing I need to mention is the price
even though there are several Brix
models with different specifications
this one with the i7 7500 you processor
goes for about $500 once you add in
storage memory and the operating system
it could one easily near a thousand
dollars that's the price of an entry
level gaming PC but I guess this systems
compactness sells taking a look at the
physical aspects of both these models
they are mostly the same except for a
few changes the build quality between
the two are similar and the brushed
aluminum chassis looks and feels durable
with the move over to Kaiba lake the
footprint hasn't changed whatsoever what
has changed from last year's model is
the i/o situation the front panel on the
cable 8 unit features USB 3.1 type C and
Taipei ports and a headphone splash mic
combo jack
whereas the sky league unit has two USB
3.0 ports and a dedicated headphone /
mic jacks the rear i/o has also been
revised the cable unit comes with a
Canton lock standard power input HDMI
2.0 mini DisplayPort Gigabit LAN and two
USB 3.0 ports the Scala connect shares
the same i/o except they have added a
USB type on one type C port and shifted
the two USB 3.0 ports on the white side
of the chassis
you'll also notice an SD card reader on
the Skellig unit but unfortunately
they've alienated that on the new
revision both of these also have an
integrated into a Wi-Fi card so you
won't have to worry about running a
network cable or buying a wireless
adapter now considering the form factor
of these species you can easily mount
them behind a monitor gigabyte provides
appropriate base the mounting brackets
that support both 75 and 100 millimeter
configurations which is awesome opening
up the Brix is fairly a simple process
once you remove the four screws holding
the back plate you can easily get access
to the RAM slots and there's a single m
dot two slot that supports the two two
eight zero configuration do not that the
cable a grain operates at full PCI
speeds whereas the skylight model limits
itself to theta now if you want to
install a traditional two-and-a-half
inch hard drive or SSD gigabyte has pre
mounted the hard drive bracket onto the
backplane so it's just a matter of
sliding the drive inside and tightening
it up with the included screws and that
was what we opted for before moving on
to testing I found something odd with
the new bricks equipped with the Kiwi
Lake processor out of the box so the
unit didn't recognize our SATA drive but
after rebooting into the BIOS and
enabling legacy support we were up and
running in no time considering these
units are meant for first-time users
this is simply unacceptable but we're
told gigabyte is looking into the
problem and will likely issue an update
for our test procedure we use Corsairs
value select 16 gigabytes odium ddr4 kit
plus and 20 133 megahertz and their to
40 gigabytes force le two and a half
inch SSD for the operating system
otherwise both systems are exactly the
same so the top of the benchmarks and
see what kind of performance cable-like
brings to the table
compared to skylake our first round of
basic synthetic tests shows the cabling
model dishes out roughly 90
percent more performance compared to
skylake programs like Cinebench r15 in
the multi-core test takes advantage of
these 7500 you really well the OpenGL
test doesn't really show a major
difference between the two in terms of
frame rates but that was expected PC
mark and the rest of the test favored
the cable aches and fascinate you it's
really interesting to see how the
increase in CPU clock speeds along with
some minor architecture updates can
result in such a gap between the two
generations the same story applies for
our real-world tests while both these
CPUs share the same microarchitecture
Intel has optimized its speed chip
technology so it can now reduce response
times from performance requested by
intense applications like GIMP luxe mark
handbrake Wenhua R and so on we also
push the integrated graphics on both
models and all I can say is that the
cabling performs quite well in its
low-voltage form it really is a
welcoming upgrade from its predecessor
but with that being said I would not
recommend gaming on the brakes because
it's not meant for that task and this
brings us to our last test power
consumption while this might seem like a
surprise lower energy needs is something
that you should expect from a refresh
line of processors Intel has done a
terrific job balancing performance and
the power efficiency of these new mobile
cable HCP use and they should translate
well into notebooks as well ultimately
that's what we're trying to achieve with
every generation oh hey there ncx comm
is Canada's leading a tailor for
anything your mind desires
just keep within those categories which
are plenty and be attempted by the
weekly deals visit ncx dot-com for all
them sweet deals apart from the benefit
of the new and updated processors the
gigabyte Brix is an interesting solution
and I can see its appeal for people who
are searching for a very basic PC
personally I find it a bit too expensive
especially since after you add in the
memory the hard drive on the operating
system its price can get near some very
thin and light notebooks however as a
compact PC for a home environment this
thing can do its job really well while
the benefits of KB Lake are pretty
apparent in an apple
- apples performance comparison what do
you guys think about the bricks would
you consider buying one of these pcs to
use as a media server or something else
let us know in the comments down below
i'm ebar with hurricane x thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
