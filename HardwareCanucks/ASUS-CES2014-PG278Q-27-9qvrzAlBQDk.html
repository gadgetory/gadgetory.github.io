is brought to you by and see IX
technology connected hey guys so now
we're going to take a look at the brand
new ROG 27 inch monitor from acs now one
of the key huge things about this is
I've already told you it's g-sync so
it's gonna be retailing for 799 but one
of the really cool things about this
panels they didn't skimp out on any type
of thing at all whatsoever I mean it's
got a really thin bezel fully height
adjustable you have tilt it swivels but
one of the really cool thing about this
panel that I absolutely love and I think
it's incredibly innovative is the actual
menu you can control it you know left
right up and down through this little
joystick which is really really really
cool and it's a really great touch I
mean beyond the fact that it is a g-sync
monitor I mean that's one of the cool
things that we come to expect from asus
and there ROG line now I already told
you guys multiple multiple times this
technology is life-changing if you're a
gamer this is the panel that you want to
buy it is incredibly crisp incredibly
fast and there is no lag no stutter
there's no tearing it's absolutely
beautiful alright so we are here the CES
2014 with asus press conference one of
the very unique products that india now
it's aside from the amazing that monitor
that matt just showed you guys was this
Asus Transformer book due at TD 300 so
this is the world's first four and one
which means it's it can be act as a
laptop as a desktop as a tablet both the
OS for windows and Android so this is a
dual OS system there's a physical button
to change between systems so right now
we are in Windows pressing the android /
windows button will get us into the
Android operating system and the reason
why you want to do that is because this
is a foreign one so you can actually
just disagreeing like so this is a 13.3
inch display this is a full HD
resolution we're with the lower
resolution panels available so this is
an IPS panel as you can see the viewing
angles are pretty nice so all the way
around they do have a TN panel with a
very poor viewing angles and pricing
would be
99 for full HD and for 90 95 99 for TN
panel lower resolution display coming
around to sort of the the belly laptop
so this is a plastic cover we have a
power button over here along with the
volume rocker I kind of locate it in the
corner and they do protrude so that
they'll be very easy sort of to find
exactly where they are we also have dual
speakers so these are stereo speakers
they're kind of very discreet almost
almost invisible but we did hear demo
and they sound pretty loud at the bottom
we have the connection jack for your
power a headphone jack and low inserts
for the docking station and we also have
a windows button so once we are and
actually let's let's say in Windows
let's go back and get inside windows so
attaching this to the docking station
docking station will act both as a
keyboard the trackpad of course this is
a touchscreen display so you can use
that just as a touchscreen but as you
can see we're in Android ecosystem with
a mouse which is pretty cool this is
something that if you want to have a
more precise navigation that's oh that's
also available so the interesting things
about the docking station is that this
is a dual storage system so they have an
SSD inside the tablet and the hard drive
inside the docking station so you have a
bit of flexibility with that closing the
TD 300 it is 1.9 kilograms inside here
we have an ethernet port USB 3 HDMI and
your power nothing on here aside from
events for the actual notebook for the
tablet I mean USB 2 and a headphone jack
and at the back we have we also have a
micro SD card slot actually for the
tablet so a little bit of flexibility
there in terms of what you can do with
this asus transformer the duet TD 300 a
very unique and innovative products from
a soon so i definitely see a lot of
functionality with this type of four and
one where you can dis attach the actual
tablet and go ahead and do your work
this way so in terms of specifications
we have an eye
3 and i5 and i7 systems you'll have
multiple hard drive storage available
inside the action docking station in its
like the tablet itself it features the
actual built-in battery is inside the
tablet it's not in a docking station we
are told that with the Android you'll
get about six to seven hours 3d gaming
online while in Windows will get about
four to five hours of operation so it's
pretty acceptable for a product of this
caliber at this price again 599 and up
depending on your configuration so this
has been the duet TD 300 thanks guys for
watching and make sure to subscribe for
