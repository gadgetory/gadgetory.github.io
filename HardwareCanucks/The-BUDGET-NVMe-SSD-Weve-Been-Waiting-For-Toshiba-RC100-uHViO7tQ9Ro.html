showing off what was likely one of the
most exciting SSDs we've seen in a long
time remember one of the major
complaints about SSDs and particularly
nvme based drives is that they're
terribly expensive and that was held
back by their acceptance into the market
okay so the natural the last two years
has also contributed to increasing costs
but that's another conversation for
another time one of the main issues with
today's SSDs is that drives our books
ended into two extreme ends of
performance there's the SATA based
drives that have acceptable read and
write speeds while the other end holds
extra high performance and me me
products finding something in the middle
ground for an affordable price is
extremely challenging but what if I told
you that Toshiba has come up with an
nvme drive that offers performance
levels that blow sada out of the water
and they're also aiming to offer it for
SATA level pricing now what if I also
told you that the way it's being built
means it could be immune to the massive
pricing in fluctuations we've seen over
the last twenty four months well it's
time to stand up and take notice because
this is the new RC 100 but before I get
to that I want to give a huge shout out
to fantex Corsair and colormaster for
sponsoring our CES 2018 coverage it may
not mean much to look at but the RC 100
may change the SSD space in a pretty big
way when it launches a bit later this
year not only does it use as an
ultra-compact
m2 twenty to forty two form factor but
toshiba has managed to pack capacities
of 120 240 and for 80 gigabytes into
that small form factor and the price the
aim is to offer it for 50 cents per
gigabyte or less and for that price it
will likely deliver about double the
theoretical speeds of the fastest SATA
base SSD that's simply amazing so how
did Toshiba accomplish this by packing
their 64 layer 3d by CS flash memory and
controller into a tiny unified package
there aren't any individual NAND modules
and instead of DRAM for caching purposes
they're using a unique host memory
buffer technology that ensures the drive
remains fast over time all of that is
crammed into a chip that's almost the
size of a fingernail or a water bottle
cap even the power consumption is
drastically lower than other separate
NAND plus controller setups due to the
unique design because of performance
metrics that are bit lower than other
high-end
me drives heat production is reduced as
well also don't forget that it will be
covered with Toshiba's excellent three
year warranty
something that has been held over from
the OCZ days the number of use cases for
the RC 100 is almost infinite because it
can be easily adapted to anything from
high-end gaming PCs to the smallest
thinnest laptops I can actually see it
being very popular as a way to get fast
storage into both Verizon and coffee
lake systems or add in as a quick
drop-in upgrade for notebooks with an
open nvme slot the other item Toshiba
showed was the XS 700 portable SSD it
seems like everyone is coming out with
one of these I have to say I don't think
this one will be much different though
pricing is supposed to be very
aggressive basically it uses a durable
soft touch metal frame that fits
perfectly in the palm of your hand along
with a USB 3.1 gen2 interface in order
to keep costs down while also offering
great performance the internal SSD runs
on a SATA interface so despite the gen 2
connector speeds will be up to five
thirty megabytes per second and 480
megabytes per second for writes
supposedly it can also withstand a two
meter drop onto concrete surfaces as
well so that's pretty awesome so that
wraps up our time with Toshiba and I
really hope you guys are excited just as
I am about the RC 100 it really could be
a game-changer in a market that has been
waiting for a long time for some
affordable excitement I mean but with
harbor connects thank you so much for
watching stay subscribe for more CES
coverage and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
