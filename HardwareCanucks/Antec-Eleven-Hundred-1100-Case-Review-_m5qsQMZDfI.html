work next review but they were taking a
look at antics new flagship in their
gaming series introducing the 1100
mid-tower now we've noticed a trend for
most case manufacturers who release a
chassis classified as a mid tower but in
reality the sizing is close to a food
tower and the 1100 is no exception and
fairly wide and tall case that could be
in the full Tower family
the case rings in at $130 this is sort
of a blend between antics 908 1200
chassis both of which are widely popular
due to their enthusiast friendly options
so let's find out if this 1100 brings
anything new to the market and how
competitive it really is the front panel
features you audio to regular USB ports
and 2 USB 3 ports along with your power
and reset buttons at the top
however the placement of these buttons
may cause issues when placed in more
confined areas within a desk the USB 3
ports connect through an internal 20-pin
connector and unfortunately an tank does
not provide USB 3 to USB 2 adapter
something we feel should be included if
the case is USB 3 ready leaving the
front USB ports unused if you do not own
a compatible motherboard moving on the
front panel has 3 v in the quarter inch
drive bays all the dust filters along
with the removable dual dust filter for
the optional 120 Milner France for the
front now again something we feel has
become a standard for in the enclosure
market are the included front intake
fans which are missing from this 1100
it's always nice to showcase the
internal components while utilizing the
extra cooling from the side panel and
that's exactly what an Tek went for
being able to mount to 120 millimeter
fans to cool your graphics card while
not interfering with the CPU heatsink at
the back end that concludes a fan
controller being able to connect three
fans with low medium and high speeds
then the exhaust fan io area and nine
ventilated PCI slots water cooling holes
and a bottom mounted power supply with a
removable dust filter that you can
easily access from the side and no
longer have to reach from the back the
case is also elevated by about an inch
from the
ground to provide the air flow for your
power supply the other side panel is not
flat and that gives extra room for cable
management at the back and also leaves
enough room to mount an optional 120mm
fan on the top panel a 200 millimeter
blue LED fan is included but
unfortunately no mounting options for
anything smaller so right off the bat no
native support for dual rod for internal
water cooling this chassis does have
support for extra-large ATX motherboards
so this means an oversized CPU backplate
opening and the rubber grommets around
the motherboard tray for routing in
cables and the hard drive gauge along
with the two list mounting and mechanism
for your optical drives the mounting for
the 3.5 inch drives is simple just
attach the two brackets to the drive and
slide it into the cage the case also has
support for two 2.5 inch drives but a
more convenient mounting system for us
as these in any chassis would be to use
a backward compatible drive bay that
fits both 3.5 and 2.5 inch drives this
means the user can be flexible with
their storage needs and is not limited
by dedicated drive bays unfortunately
not the case with this 1100 moving on
the hard drive cage can't support two
120 millimeter fans to provide
additional airflow for the internals now
a really neat mounting system is in
place for those fans using no screws but
clips that hold the fence dirty to the
cage a really convenient mounting method
to avoid any hassle during assembly now
an tech did focused on making cables
routing as easy as possible including
quality rubber grommets all around the
motherboard tray with cable tie mounting
options and large cutouts at the top for
routing your CPU connection and all of
this with 36 millimeters of spacing
between the motherboard tray and the
side
now this is plenty of room for a
powerful build that not only will clean
up nicely but also grease to organize
now finally putting our system into the
1100 as you can see all the components
fit like they should with ton of room to
work with and to no surprise cable
clutter is non evident thanks for all
the room available for cable management
graphics cards in length of 13 inches
can't fit into the case and that is with
the fan installed onto the hard drive
cage that's excellent to utilize the
additional cooling while not sacrificing
on the GPU compatibility and finally the
oversized CPU backplate opening allows
the access to your CPU cooler if you
need it without taking out the entire
motherboard overall the antique 1100 is
a decent chassis for enthusiasts that
doesn't want us with its aesthetic looks
but instead provides a good balance
between simplicity and aggressiveness
having lots of cooling options with
great cable management with 36
millimeters of spacing to work with and
support for long graphics cards is
becoming a must for all chassis that
wants to stay competitive on a downside
only two fans are included and for the
price of $130 maybe the front fans
should have been included as well while
the case is USB 3 ready and tech does
not provide the adapter for those who do
not own a compatible motherboard and
since the top the case only supports 200
millimeter fan no native internal water
cooling options for such a large case so
with the introduction of this new
flagship in their gaming series and tech
managed to deliver a functional and
practical chassis for gamers that does
carry some flaws with it but although it
is a feature packed chassis with ton of
room on the inside which makes it a
pleasure to work with thank you guys for
watching and we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
