great technology selection and service
high quality sound is a trend which has
only been on the rise lately with the
audio enthusiast community growing
rapidly however the cost associated with
better audio fidelity is a hard sell to
many people and as such inexpensive
headphones have a strong place in the
audio market this is the market Edifier
is trying to cater to with the h8 40s
priced at $59.99 you could be forgiven
for not being familiar with Edifier as
they don't have much of a presence in
the US market however they're the
dominant speaker and headphone
manufacturer in China so they don't like
experience so first up is the build of
the headphones Edifier has opted for a
lightweight design with the headphones
weighing in at 250 with an adjustable
headband with a metal band for better
durability and an over ear design it
doesn't feel like a premium build by any
means but it's not flimsy
I don't feel worried about it breaking
although the non removable dual cables
for the 3.5 milimeter connection does
worry me a little as it does seem a bit
prone to damage also the non removable
cable is 2 meters in length which can be
annoyingly long for travel and it suits
more a stationary listening environment
because of this however for $60 the
build quality is pretty much where I'd
expected to be and I don't have any
serious complaints now at this price I
wasn't expecting much in terms of
comfort but I was pleasantly surprised
multiplied the ear pads aren't as
cushioning as the velour on my k7 xx's
they are soft and fit around the ears
well the clamping force keeps them on my
head without causing much fatigue
they're light and comfortable enough
that these would be good for extended
use
although the pleather can have some
issues with breathing in hotter
environments these headphones also
styled in a fashion which lends itself
towards travel headphones with the small
footprint and overall design reminding
me of both Bieber's quiet comfort 25 s
and the ath ac9 travel headphones
these seem like they're aimed at those
who want an ovary a headphone that is
small and light for travel now because
of this though I have a couple of gripes
firstly these don't include a carrying
case of any sorts which seems like
something that would make sense to
include while the ear cups do swivel
they don't fold up which would have made
heaps of sense for compact travel and
finally they don't have any accessories
included at all and I think it would
have made sense to have an airplane
adapter included none of these are
deal-breakers however but even at this
price I would have liked to see a little
more in terms of accessories and
features now in the end this is all
irrelevant if the sound isn't up to par
so let's get into that because they're
marketed for their noise isolation
that's up first now to be clear noise
isolation is not cancellation it's
simply the closed back nature of the
headphones preventing incoming noise and
it isn't actively canceling any noise
like hire and travel headphones the seal
is not bad for a closed pair of
headphones and there isn't any noise
leak but I wouldn't say they block out
much noise if you've got some quiet
background noise you probably won't be
able to hear that but in loud areas like
on public transport or on an aeroplane
you'll still get a lot of background
noise and these don't do anything
special in terms of noise isolation as
for the sound itself I was pretty
impressed that what the 40 millimeter
drivers put out especially for the price
they have 3 20 Hertz to 20000 kilohertz
response frequency and a 32 erm
impedance which means these can easily
be driven by a phone like most
headphones at this price it has a
v-shaped sound signature with recessed
mids but the low-end wasn't too muddy
unheard decent extension and the highs
were clear if I a little bit harsh at
times for genre is like electronic these
headphones are pretty good with enough
punch to deliver satisfactory results in
more classical music you'll notice the
lack of clarity and there isn't much
instrument separation and the high
strings especially lack definition and
they just don't sound that great
the soundstage is pretty narrow and
stereo imaging isn't great but at $60
that's possible if you're not doing
super critical listening or any studio
work with these they're probably sound
just fine they have a fairly pleasing
sound and while they're not as detailed
as higher-end headphones they offer a
pretty good sound at the price so to sum
up the Edifier h84 TS offer a pretty
well-rounded package they're built
fairly well are comfortable and portable
and they sound pretty good for the price
and if I certainly didn't try to
reinvent the wheel with these headphones
and the h8 4 news are simply another
decent offering at this price so thanks
