teamed up with us at harbor Canucks to
give you a great opportunity to win some
brand new headphones these are the AKG q
701 headset that Dmitri just finished
reviewing and they are fantastic

that he liked them a little bit too much
but with that being said they are a
fantastic set of cans and here is what
you have to do to enter in the
description below you're going to see a
link that directs you to the master off
