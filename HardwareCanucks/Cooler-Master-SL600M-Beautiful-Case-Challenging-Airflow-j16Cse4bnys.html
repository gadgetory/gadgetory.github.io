sometimes that's what's burning them a
couple of weeks ago but have no fear the
SL 600 M is here good people so I'm
actually quite excited about the CL 600
M
despite the weird naming scheme because
this is finally something totally fresh
from coolermaster and this is not an
upgraded iteration of what they
previously launched this is like a
totally new direction for them that
ripped the new Animax lick Fusion is
their first addressable RGB all-in-one
cooler with a standard 240 ml rad and
absolutely beautiful RGB ring
illumination on the fence and the pump
to highlight that unique flow indicator
through the transparent top check out
the lake fusion down below
alright so the SL 600 M from color
master to me is a really interesting
release because it's almost like a new
direction from cool master they clearly
have a new designer who was like enough
with this RGB stuff let's stick to
something a little bit more mature and I
appreciate that because like from a
design perspective this is a gorgeous
case that kind of stands out from the
rest of the master case lineup and
stands out from the rest of the cases on
the market right now
you know there's beautiful very tall
aluminum piece in the front and the top
this beautiful new mesh material that
looks absolutely gorgeous for the top
and then you are your they have their
with a new motion sensor so as you hover
your hand around it will light up those
USB ports which by the way has a USB
type-c gen 2 port so overall it's like a
really nice looking package but the
downfall is the price point so here I
understand they're trying something new
in terms of design and also the interior
features but at 200 dollars you have to
ask yourself who is your target audience
and I know they're pushing their whole
marketing thing towards work and play so
this could be a gaming system and could
very well fit inside
an office environment or something that
isn't gaming oriented but at $200 you're
competing with the likes of the evolved
eggs from fantex provided you can
actually get one since they're all sold
out
you know the defined as to just came out
from practical design and that is $50
cheaper yet you know functionally it
seems to offer a bit more even and so
the $200 price point I feel like is the
downfall of the SL 600 M and even if you
take a look at cool masters owned cases
like the H 500 M which is also 200 all
enclosure it has more fans that are RGB
more glass panels more features like all
types of tooling that is required so I
don't understand why this case is so
expensive I do appreciate the new
direction with the aluminum pieces it's
absolutely gorgeous
however the aluminum is so thin you know
once you tap on it and you can hear the
plastic that is underneath it you know
you tap on the Evolve X it sounds
metallic here
it sounds plastic now having said that I
feel like Coolermaster has done a good
job in terms of combination of plastic
steel and aluminum pieces so that the
thing looks amazing but when it comes to
like feeling the case it doesn't feel as
premium for the price point for the side
panels we have nice captive thumb screws
at the back and both side panels utilize
the hinge approach that allows the panel
to almost like you know hang off the
frame but here with the glass panel
because it's so heavy the actual metal
joint or the piece that is attached to
the glass is glued on and that glue has
started to come off so when I was
removing the panel I heard the crackling
noise of the glue peeling off and that
is not a good thing on a 200-dollar case
now it doesn't happen with the other
panel because it's steel so it's much
lighter versus this giant glass panel
now coolermaster have confirmed they
have fixed this issue for mass
production on the factory level and now
the glass side panel can withstand 20
kilograms of tension for that metal
hinge and the glue so that's nice the
bottom is covered in the large dust
filter removal from the back and as you
can see it is foldable and that is to
allow you to remove the filter even if
you don't have that much space behind
the case which I appreciate the one
thing I don't like about the frame is
that you cannot pick it up by the
only by the sides because that front
facade is so magnificent and tall but
not exactly functional it just looks
pretty of course all the aluminum edges
are refined so you're not going to cut
yourself they're super smooth and I do
appreciate the outline of the
Coolermaster logo at the front it's
subtle and the branding is not being you
know it's not screaming at you and I
appreciate that
and the only coolermaster text we see is
on the side inside the power supply
shroud which looks nice and elegant I
like it now one of the most interesting
things about this enclosure is
coolermaster decision to remove any rear
exhaust fan as you can see we have nine
PCI slots plus two vertical and an
absolutely solid panel where you'd
normally find a rear exhaust fan and
that is because as we enter inside you
can see the power supply shroud area has
been totally relocated from the bottom
traditional space to the side beside the
motherboard there for clearing up all
that space underneath and this is where
we have to included two hundred
millimeter fans and cooler monsters
trying to create this chimney effect by
having airflow january at the bottom
which is why the case is so tall you can
totally fit like my entire fist
underneath there which is good so
there's enough spacing there for those
fans to intake air and they push
everything through to the top and the
top has no fans included but with this
nice little bracket you can install up
to a 360 rad and dual 200 millimeter
fans I do like that the top panel is
also spaced out to allow for airflow to
exit freely and you can also install
fans above the frame which is awesome
the top plate can also be removed
completely it is two lists and it can
also be slightly raised to allow for
that additional gap of airflow if you do
have fans that are above the frame which
i think is helpful and since we don't
have the traditional hard drive cage and
the actual power supply shower at the
bottom storage has been kind of moved
around everywhere so we have two SSD
slots on the power supply shroud on the
side behind the case we have two more
SSD caddies in their conventional spots
and then we have two of these
interesting drive brackets that can be
used for SSD mounting or hard drive
mounting or any of your water cooling
components one is located on the rear
fan slaw
where that usually is found and another
is located on the power supply shroud
furthermore we have two more additional
Drive brackets behind the front panel
that there's not easy to access by the
way but there's easy to route because
the power supply is right there and it's
interesting to see these drive brackets
are mounted on a fan bracket so they're
clearly recycling this frame but of
course you cannot mount any fans there
because that entire front panel is
completely closed the case supports a
ATX motherboards but only up to 272
millimeters because anything above that
and with will totally cover your rubber
grommets however you can use the
additional rubber grommet beside the
power supply shroud to route let's say a
24-pin cable or satellite manner so you
have a little bit of options but cable
management for anything other than ATX
motherboards will be a challenge and
that is of course because the power
supply shroud basically is located on
the side of the motherboard and we have
that rail system and I find that entire
like repositioning of the power supply
on to that area pretty refreshing and
like working with it it's not like
frustrating you just have to remove the
first piece and then we have the rail
system which is finally coming into
effect kind of like being useful where
verses in the past that's only been used
for hard drives and like water cooling
components but now you can finally use
it to mount power supplies which is
pretty awesome and depending on the
power supply length you can reposition
the actual main mount higher or lower
also depending if you're mounting a 360
rad up top or not and then we have the
additional second piece that basically
collects all the cables and prevents
them from going into you know the rest
of the bottom of the case and I find
that whole thing works really well you
just mount the power supply mount the
second shroud kind of to hide all the
cables and you also have the ability to
mount it on the rail system depending on
you know how tight you on the K must to
be or slightly loose as for the bottom
fan bracket / grill so that no cables
get through and make contact with those
fan blades we have two 200 millimeter
fans which are not RGB and they spin at
maximum 800 rpm you can replace that
with a
to a 360 rad so that's good if you're
looking for water cooling and I find
that whole airflow section at the bottom
at the top is actually pretty good
because the power supply shroud is
totally out of the way the motherboard
is pretty high up so you have plenty of
space there for push/pull thick
radiators no problem and to recap our
cooling options you can do a 360 up top
360 at the bottom duo to 100mm weather
fans at the bottom and the top and dual
want 40 mils at the top and the bottom
and then we have to talk about this
whole chimney effect or having that
fresh air delivery from the bottom
passing through your GPU onto your CPU
cooler that has to be mounted facing up
and that is one kind of concern for me
because in my previous experience with
certain AMD motherboards you're not able
to have the flexibility of mounting the
cooler in either horizontal or vertical
orientation so you have to take that
into account if the if your motherboard
supports it and if the cooler supports
it as well and the second thing I was
thinking is that yes hot air rises and
we have all that fresh air from the
bottom but it is passing through the GPU
first so any air that gets to the CPU
cooler will already be hotter based on
the GPU temperatures I also would love
to see a compatibility list from cooler
master to let users know of what
motherboards work and what coolers work
so that you know you're not necessarily
thinking oh this is gonna be great for
my system and then only realize that
either your mount or the CPU cooler does
not support vertical orientation that
would really suck
luckily from my Knock to iu 12s cooler I
have no issues rotating that to be
facing up but for my RT X xx atti
I did have to remove the additional
bracket that is on the power supply
shroud because it was slightly pushing
down on the GPU and maximum of GPU
clearance until the power supply shroud
is three hundred and eighteen
millimeters so I think it's exactly the
length of this GPU because it's very
tight it's not making contact with the
shroud but it is very close the one
thing you can do is remove the secondary
shroud from the power supply to reveal
all your cables if you need that
additional space but yeah otherwise you
have 318 millimeters as for cable
management absolutely no issues here
rubber grommets and all the appropriate
patience and I do like that secondary
shroud at the bottom that is attached to
the fan bracket that allows you to pass
all the cables for the bottom on the
motherboard cleanly without them
actually being revealed underneath the
motherboard awesome
now the GPU can be mounted in multiple
locations we have our standard a
horizontal one that probably is not the
best for the CPU temperature but the GPU
definitely gets all that fresh air then
you can relocate the GPU to the vertical
two slots which are closer to the side
panel window so probably not ideal
because the GPU gets kind of hot there
but more fresh air gets delivered to the
CPU because the GPU is not blocking that
and then we can rotate the main PCI
bracket window is what they call it so
that we can have all our primary PCI
slots in vertical orientation instead of
horizontal and the advantage of that is
having multiple GPUs in horizontal
orientation therefore potentially giving
you better GPU temperatures because of
all that additional fresh air from the
bottom and it's not going to one them is
not going to be blocking the other if
they are positioned horizontally and the
interesting thing about mounting the
GPUs in vertical position is that
there's nothing holding the GPU at the
bottom so the actual riser cable just
attaches to the bottom of the GPU and
into your motherboard it's not actually
being supported at the bottom and
actually makes sense because that way it
frees up all that room at the bottom for
potential radiators and we have plenty
of room there for you know radiator and
push-pull setup and I understand why
they did it but you also have to be very
careful not to ship the system like that
because the GPU otherwise is just being
held in by those PCI slots and for the
$200 price point the master accessory
riser cable is not included so you have
to go out on your way by the accessory
separately so you can take advantage of
the whole point of this enclosure of
having the GPU mounted vertically for
that chimney effect so that the air can
actually get the CPU cooler why not
include it you're already paying $200
and so here's my temperature chart with
the default orientation when the GPU is
horizontal this is when it's the coolest
of course all that fresh air is being
delivered right there while the CPU
suffers with much hotter temperatures
the GPU vertical with near
glass gets slightly harder but more air
gets the CPU and GPU in the middle we
definitely get better GPU temperatures
and the same CPU temperatures as when
the GPU is in near the glass simply
because the same amount of air gets the
CPU cooler but when we look at
temperatures across the defined s2 and
the C 700 M sure the GPU is the coolest
out of the the three cases but the CPU
temperatures suffer so much simply
because we don't have that additional
fresh intake towards the CPU cooler
because it's just getting the warm air
from the GPU and that of course is a big
negative I also want to mention that
going with RGB in here then really makes
sense because it doesn't really suit the
taste of the enclosure on the exterior
and the interior so I populated the Lea
nice trimmer cable inside and yeah it
looks fine by itself unlike a gaming
case but in here doesn't really good
look that well and also let's say
mounting the inner max TB RGB fans which
look fantastic elsewhere but here I
mounted them at the bottom and they're
not exactly visible and so this case if
you're trying to go with lighting
approach is good to light up the
interior with illumination instead of
other RGB components and so to conclude
I want to say that you know I'm happy to
see clear masters try to think outside
the box in terms of design elements the
absolutely nailed it here and I
understand why they cannot have an
entire motherboard being rotated because
that would make the case much longer
because that's where the power supply
shroud is and they'd have to kind of
redesign that entire structure and so I
understand all these limitations and
also appreciate the new modular approach
for the pci window bracket but it only
benefits the GPU and not the cpu and for
the next iteration of this case because
you know how Coolermaster does it launch
feedback release revised updated chassis
with all the things fixed basically but
here I would love to see the rear fan
mount opened up as an optional cooling
mount so that maybe you can close it or
open and depending if you want to your
CPU cooler chimney of
effect or standard horizontal and I
would love to hear what you think about
this whole thing of moving the entire
power supply shroud section to the front
of the case where normally you would
have some form of airflow or hard drive
gauges and stuff but now it's it's the
power supply that's that's where it sits
and having all that space at the bottom
for airflow in the top as well and the
back completely closed for you know for
air pressure purposes and also noise
purposes alright guys that is it for me
