define there five from fractal design
link in the description for pricing and
availability hello everyone I'm Dmitry
with hardrick onyx and the titan x is
without a doubt the GPU that's driving
proper 4k gaming into reality after the
launch of the GTX 980 we knew that full
Maxwell potential was still to be
realized at $9.99 the Titan X is aimed
at enthusiast gamers offering fully
unlocked GM 200 core and then videos
once again with a tagline of the world's
fastest GPU aimed to introduce a new
performance King into the current market
equation and it would be really
interesting to see how aim D will
respond to compete directly with the
Titan X loaded with 3072 CUDA cores 96
Aero peace 192 texture units 12
gigabytes of vram on a 384 bit memory
bus with 1,000 megahertz base clock and
1075 may Hertz boost and 7000 10
megahertz effective on the memory with
the controlled TDP of 250 watts for this
powerhouse so the efficiency of max will
architecture really shines through every
release so the 12 gigabytes of vram is
really targeted to eliminate any memory
capacity and bandwidth limitations and
not so much for current gaming titles
but we suspect for near future VR
applications and unlike other Titans the
Titan X does not offer full speed double
precision performance so it's actually
right in line with gaming oriented cards
like the GTX 980 but for developers the
grave double precision be prepared to
pay for the Quadro of equivalent card
the reference blower style cooler has
not changed as
from the new black color scheme that
looks awesome with tightened silver text
at the front of the card and illuminated
GeForce GTX at the top
I just wish a backplate was included
like on the GTX 980 because that would
turn the Titan X into one of the
best-looking reference GPUs on the
market but with the black PCB exposed
you can see all the 12v Ram modules to
SLI fingers because running the Titan X
in SLI would be totally boss for power
requirements you'd need six plus eight
pin PCI Express and for display
connectivity we have a single HDMI 2.0 a
single DVI and three DisplayPort outputs
an identical configuration found on the
gtx 980 and starting with some 1440p
benchmarks the type next is the
performance King for single GPU gaming
staying well above gtx 980 and right
below the r9 295x2 and even in some
titles beating the 295x2 moving on to
USD resolutions and all those extra cuda
cores and v RM certainly comes into play
delivering impressive minimum frame
rates and totally playable average frame
rates as well at these high settings and
of course the full 12 gigabytes of
memory is far from utilized since most
games don't require anything above 4
gigabytes power consumption for the
technics is beyond impressive actually
consuming less watts at blown than in
our 9 290x delivering quieter operation
that load then the 290 X as well and
staying at consistent 81 degrees Celsius
at constant load overclocking potential
is there expect about a 10% boost on the
core and 15% on the memory that account
to for about 4 to 5 extra frames on
average now give an invidious current
efficiency lead they are able to charge
wherever they want to the Titan X as
competition from AMD is not yet caught
up and you can take up the 295x2 for
around six ninety nine but crossfire
profiles and radio and Driver updates
are
behind with terrible performance at high
resolution as you saw in our benchmarks
and here is an overview of performance
difference between all the current
high-end GPUs and the techniques and the
results speak for themselves it is an
impressive performer it's expensive but
Titan X is still damn good now for me as
a video editor I also wanted to compare
the type next to my gtx 980 with Adobe
CC applications that utilize CUDA
acceleration now to my disappointing
surprise the type next finish the
premiere render only 44 seconds faster
than the GTX 980 which is nothing really
on a total 30-minute render so an
upgrade to a Titan X for your Adobe
needs is right now irrelevant as it
cannot take advantage of all the
available DRM nor the CUDA force so that
