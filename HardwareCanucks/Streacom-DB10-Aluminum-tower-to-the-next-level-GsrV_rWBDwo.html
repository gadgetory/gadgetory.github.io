you by fantex nvidia corsair and CI x
silverstone and in win make sure to
support them for helping us bring this
great content to you
on top of taipei 101 we met up with
streak on the company behind the f12 see
that was just announced and we really
can't wait to review this bad boy this
is what they're all about
gorgeous aluminum case designs that
tries to merge modern and elegant frames
with a functional interior however in
the suite they were showcasing a new
project they're working on the db10
elegantly imprinted on the back of the
case and the entire construction is four
millimeter aluminum handling this case
felt amazing this is that next-level
build the symmetrical design allows the
case to be elevated off the ground for
both the power supply and the fan to
take in fresh air with the top curved
panel also spaced out with identical
handles at the as at the bottom to allow
exhaust to properly exit and becomes
easier to handle the db10 if you like
horizontal orientation is possible
thanks to the symmetry Auto given the
height of the frame you'd most likely
keep this standing upright checking out
the back the power supply is installed
at the bottom the motherboard is rotated
with the GPU closer to the top fan area
with total of seven PCI slots looking
inside it's an unusually narrow frame
obviously with the height advantage and
the first question I asked was how do
you actually deal with all the cable
management as there is no room behind
the motherboard tray the back panel is
your motherboard tray so for now this is
a work in progress and your suggestions
are always welcome but what I suggested
is to have some type of low profile
pre-made channels in the panel already
to help you attach the exiting cables
from the power supply to the side and
further distribute those cables around
the motherboard following the actual
motherboard tray now I was most
impressed with street comps innovative
mounting method inside the frame so
instead of using traditional cages for
things everything is mounted on these
aluminum strips and rails built into the
case so here's a stack of hard drives
that are held in using pressure with
these lip clips that pin the brackets on
one side and the bracket is inserted
onto these little rails inside
case on the other side they have
incredibly secure hold
reduce total material use and the
brackets themselves a very diverse so
here's how the three and a half inch
drives are attached and there's room in
between them to breathe
here's another stack of drives SSDs this
time on the same bracket and also
there's a reservoir bracket right beside
there and the bottom fan in the front
the power supply is also installed the
same way allowing you to be really
modular in the way you set up your build
and I think that's incredibly innovative
and such a simple system with just
brackets and the proper rail system
built into the case the db10 will launch
below 300 dollars and I think they're
not really trying to target the
enthusiast crowd per se but instead that
niche crowd that appreciates the amazing
craftsmanship of this case plus the joy
of building inside something like this
we would love to hear your input on this
modular idea how would you set up a
system inside the DB 10 and give us a
like if you'd want us to review the case
once it's released so thank you for
watching our Coptics coverage make sure
to check out the rest of it and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
