the C 700 M now the previous cosmos case
was a bit of a disappointment to me you
can check out why right over here so I'm
hoping Coolermaster has done their
homework and refining this thing so it's
actually competitive let's see if they
did right after this the new Toshiba XS
700 external SSD comes in this beautiful
and minimalistic design its ultra
portable form factor is perfect for
creative professionals on the go and
with blazing-fast USB 3 gen 2 transfer
speeds and Toshiba's excellent 3-year
warranty
reliability shouldn't be a concern check
out the X's 700 from Toshiba down below
alright so I don't really want to start
off with a price point because the new
cosmos C 700 M retails for 439 dollars
that is a significant price increase
versus the previous cosmos the C 700 P
which ran for $299 still an expensive
price point but you know now we're
moving at this above $400 territory and
that makes me nervous and this could be
because the new tariffs between US and
China cases are on the list materials
like aluminum and steel are on the list
and so that could be the reflection of
the price points that is you know passed
on to the consumer by the way Steve from
gamers Nexus made an excellent video
about tariffs so go ahead and check it
out to familiarize yourself with what's
going to be happening with pricing for
computer components in the future but
back to the C 700 M let's begin with
build quality and appearance it is still
that similar sophisticated and clearly a
cosmos design you know we have those
think aluminum handles and feet that
elevate the chassis and beautifully
reflect the built-in illumination while
the top handles are super convenient to
carry the case that is super heavy by
the way at 24 kilograms so that thing is
definitely a workout and it's so heavy
because of the steel frame the giant
glass panel and the aluminum handles so
I actually don't mind all the plastic
paneling on the exterior to reduce the
weight like the magnetic piece at the
back plus the gray coating on the
plastic looks gorgeous the brushed
aluminum front and top sections look
very nice without leaving your finger
plus I love the new honeycomb
ventilation pattern up top with the
built-in dust filter but this pattern is
not found anywhere else on the case and
I find that cohesion element could be
slightly improved now to me this cosmos
case feels slightly smaller despite
being the same size as the previous C
700p but they've cleverly slimmed down
on that front panel to make the entire
frame appear thinner and just for
comparison here's the evolved X that
from the front looks much wider the
curved glass panel is totally new it is
now much lighter in color so you can
actually see inside the case and without
that green cast as we saw with the 700p
both panels are removable and swappable
since the case supports an inverted
motherboard layout and one of the panels
is just steel because the yields on the
curved panels are so low and so
expensive plus you don't really see that
side so it makes sense to include only
one TG and one regular VI yo is totally
loaded with 4 USB 3 ports a type C gen
to power reset buttons a 3-speed fan
controller and the PWM mode for your
motherboard plus an RGB cycle button for
that built-in illumination the fan
controller is at the back occupying one
of the SSD caddies with six fans
supported which is nice plus all the RGB
cables are connected to this hub but the
worst part is that molex connections for
power instead of SATA and I feel like
Coolermaster is still deciding on what
type of hub to create because they were
always changing and they're never
cleaned up properly and the case is not
actually built to hide the hub properly
also we have this there's no RGB
extension so you can add more strips to
it and that is powered to be esada while
the main hub is powered to be a molex
and I'm gonna give the Evolve X just an
example because that is the only case
that has done this right with a discrete
fan hub in an appropriate location that
isn't in the middle of the motherboard
tray the lighting now features
addressable RGB strips that span the
entire perimeter of the case except in
the back I think it looks gorgeous with
10 strips that are not crazy like with a
C 700 P so the ambient light spill is
minimal you can connect them to a
standard 5 volt addressable header on
your motherboard to have all that RGB
sync and aside from cables running
everywhere from the hub the actual
quality of the light is fantastic the
front panel opens up for additional
airflow and
access to five and a quarter inch drive
base with a wireless six prong lighting
connector there are two five in the
quarter and drive base but by default
only one Bay is included you can expand
that via the additional included little
accessories but then you kind of lose
out on compatibility for 360 or larger
radiators so out of the box we have
three 140 millimeter fans and these are
cooler masters default fans that come
with all cases regardless of price point
and your spending or $400 on enclosure
you'd expect to have some more premium
fans and while I get that their target
audience is most likely going to
populate their own radiator and fans and
all the cooling customization
they just feel cheap in something like
this you know potentially just don't
include fans at all and give us a
slightly lower price point the top panel
is magnetic and here we have the same
friend bracket as in the front removable
with two screws that can house triple
120 or 140 mm fans with their respective
radiators and that's what you'd expect
from such a large enclosure and when you
remove the OD D tray you came out a 420
rad at the front and the top with
maximum thickness clearance of 70
millimeters up top and 55 millimeters
with the upper PSU shroud panel in place
now the interiors where things get fun
because the EM in the model name stands
for maker and I feel this model delivers
first dust filter spends the entire
bottom section easy removal from the
front the power supply shroud is now
totally new with many more features
versus the ugly and dysfunctional
two-piece design we saw on the C 700 P
so first it is now in two pieces so you
can easily remove the top section from
the side this is especially useful when
doing cable management or installing the
power supply or better yet when
installing anything onto the shroud
itself like repositioning this angled
GPU bracket mounting an SSD plate or
installing fans in the bottom chamber my
only complaint is the bare steel that is
not coated and leaves finger marks just
like on brushed aluminum for internal
storage we have four of these caddies
good for HDD and SSD s-- that are on
this modular rail system and have some
height flexibility while the SSD mounts
are to lists using this longer pegs that
insert into these plates a convenient
system that also
covers up the cable area behind the
rails that is also compatible with the
reservoir mounting and so this is where
the C 700 M deserves it's maker
distinction because Dean's higher frame
is completely modular with a pretty
intuitive disassembly to the screws are
all the same and there are no
hard-to-reach spots when you have to
remove something the power supply shroud
is removed with seven screws and it
needs to be supported on all three sides
because of the optional GPU mount and
because you can invert the Malabo tray
it can also be installed in the upper
position alongside the PSU bracket and
this means the motherboard tray is fully
removable with only two screws that's
pretty convenient allowing you to
undertake any mods to the frame and of
course comfortable hardware installation
- now it looks like cool master is
moving into the right direction for
cable management although I don't really
like this panel here with individually
channeled front choke cables so it's not
a thick messy bunch but nicely handled
out of the box cable management that is
until we see the bottom with all the fan
and RGB cables just killing the whole
organization vibe with the system
assembled that additional cover helps
although this is the side that's not
really visible anyway and it's clear
that you have to put in some patience
and work into cable management to make
it all look pretty and you know
satisfying because otherwise the back
section is just completely open for you
there's not that many tools for cable
management aside from having those IO
cables pre routed for you now here's the
default orientation and build it's a
spacious design so any standard non
water-cooled system will look empty and
this is where the GPU bracket comes in
handy so for example I have this massive
r-tx 20 80 TI duke from MSI that
perfectly occupies all that empty room
below the motherboard and get this the
GPU bracket can be angled mostly for
better visuals and potentially for
better temperatures or variations of
them depending on your configuration the
downside is the IO is routing any video
cables to the GPU is challenging because
it's not aligned properly with the rear
PCI slots and if you're feeling
experimental the GPU bracket can be
installed vertically on the rail system
again with high flexibility for yet
another interesting orientation and the
things you have to consider here is the
riser cable which is included
and how you route it for a clean look
plus temperatures and routing video
cables that far into the case I will
explore temperatures in just a little
bit but first I wanted to check out the
chimney layout with the IO facing up the
stain geing the dynamic once again for
airflow and exhaust after doing it once
it's actually a pretty simple procedure
that only requires you to swap out the
rear panel for this other ventilation
panel which is also included and now we
have a totally new look and feel blower
style GPUs are most likely preferred in
this orientation but that the rear
section is completely open now for GPU
intake although there is no dust filter
even with my mass of 2080 TI the upper
shroud fits in place just fine with 12.5
inches available for GPUs lastly access
to motherboards IO is limited and you
must pass cables through this grommet at
the top that the semi covered by the
motherboards tray plus there's an
additional support beam that interferes
with IO cables so I removed it although
there is no mention of it in the user's
manual which by the way is a
disappointing effort for the price you
pay and also the top fan mounts for
exhaust will limit your access to the AO
so you'll have to think of something
else here and only the eight pin CPU
cable felt a bit out of place for
routing as everything else felt right in
place and finally for my temperature
analysis here are my four configurations
they revealed that the default
orientation is best for both the CPU and
the GPU with slightly hotter CPU temps
in all other configurations alright I
know it's been a lengthy one but I want
to conclude by saying this is my
favorite cosmos case yet it meets the
maker expectations quite well with
various motherboard layouts and much
improved power supply shroud and the
angle GPU bracket is guaranteed to
entice experimentation which is why I'm
giving the C 700 M the damn good
innovate
I know the price is quite heavy
especially compared to last year's
cosmos so $2.99 and I'm surprised they
have not put in a second ITX system out
in here somewhere especially in the
chimney layout because there's
definitely room for it and also improve
the backside for a little bit easier
cable management so you don't have to
necessarily fight the case so much when
you're spending so much on it the new
mark to coarser strafe and k70 keyboards
are fully loaded with custom
illumination convenient media buttons
USB pass-through extra set of key camps
and economic wrist rest for each
keyboard so you can type or game
comfortably with a variety of MX
switches available so you can check out
which keyboard suits you best in the
description below alright guys let me
know what you think of the new cosmos
see 700m make sure to check out this
other island content let's have the
conversation about how and why or why
not this thing might be competitive in
the market space today make sure to
