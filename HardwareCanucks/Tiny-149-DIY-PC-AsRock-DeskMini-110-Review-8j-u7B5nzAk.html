with Hardware Canucks and the footprint
of PC hardware has been shrinking with
desktop hardware and laptop form factors
and the rise of small form-factor pcs
the time when your average consumer
needs a massive PC for basic tasks is
coming to an end with the rise of ultra
small form-factor pcs becoming ever more
present these days you can build an
amazing gaming rig in an ITX chassis but
what happens if you don't need all of
that gaming horsepower and instead you
just want something that will perform
well under basic tasks the z9 neo buys
all moan brings all the right features
on a budget with a large windowed side
panel 5 included fans and the excellent
interior layout with super simple cable
management get it now link in the
description below that's the situation I
found myself in not too long ago I
already have my main gaming PC to handle
video production and heavy gaming
workloads but I was looking for a small
form-factor PC to do basic tasks when my
main PC was occupied with rendering and
to act as a media PC I wanted it to be
small discreet and quiet so it wouldn't
distract when watching films YouTube or
just Netflix I also wanted to build it
myself since ultra often off-the-shelf
options come loaded with bloatware and
unnecessary add-ons this is where as
rocks desk mini 110 steps into the
equation it's a tiny bare-bones PC which
not only accepts 2.5 inch drives but is
also compatible with almost the full
range of desktop Intel skylake 11:51
processes this is looking to be the
perfect platform upon which I could
build a respectable low-cost computer
the desk mini is considered a bare-bones
unit which means out of the box or
you'll be getting is the chassis
motherboard and power supply however
since the chassis is built directly
around its components it's extremely
compact and can fit into its
surroundings quite well key items asrock
hasn't included are the RAM storage and
CPU but I wanted to control these specs
myself so that's perfectly fine with me
more importantly the desk mini 110s
price of 140 dollars
fits perfectly into my budget especially
when you consider individually
purchasing a Mini ITX case motherboard
and power supply would come to much more
than that
this thing's most notable competitor is
likely Intel's newest Knox
range in price from $290 for one with a
mobile a 360 100 year to 500 $90 for the
high-end skull canyon version with its
i7 6700 HQ processor and iris pro
graphics while those units do come with
processors and integrated Wi-Fi a
stock's price still seems extremely
competitive considering you could equip
the desk Mini with a desktop class a 360
100 and it would still cost less than
Intel's own offerings so that's what I
did
the hardware in this book was chosen to
be cost-effective while still being
powerful enough to do some light photo
editing or some very light gaming as
well I chose the Intel skylake a 360 100
processor as it's quite affordable at
around 120 dollars while still providing
a good amount of processing horsepower
it's integrated HD 530 graphics engine
won't allow for much more than some
light gaming but it's actually clocked
at a higher speed than the one on
Intel's more expensive eye 5 6400 I
could have went with something more
powerful though since as rocks mini STX
board may only measure 5 inches by 5
inches but it will accept any 65 watt
TDP skylake chip that means an Intel i7
6700 could have been added to really
make this PC a processing Beast I also
needed some notebook size so dim memory
an g.skill kindly provided there Ripjaws
ddr4 21 33 megahertz 16 gigabyte kit at
only $60 it provides great value with
plenty of capacity for running multiple
tasks and at the cost it just wouldn't
make sense to go with less one thing to
keep in mind since this is a h1 10
motherboard the maximum supported memory
speed is 21 33 megahertz lastly for
storage I wanted to keep it simple but
fast
so I decided on an OC ZTR 150 SSD with
240 gigabytes of storage since most of
the larger files we kept on the main PC
I felt this drive was a good compromise
between price and capacity since it cost
only $65 it'll allow for plenty of
important files to be stored while
having the speed and the reliability
perform well day to day alternatively
there's an m3 slot for additional
storage as well as another 2.5 inch
drive bay for a second SSD or HDD if you
so desire one thing to note however is
the m2 slot doesn't support the sava
standard so PCI SSDs will have to be
used there's another m0
as well but that's meant to be used for
either as rocks optional Wi-Fi module or
an additional mq based add-in card of
your choosing so we've looked at the
hardware now let's look at the build
itself the exterior is pretty simple
it's a black aluminium build with a
plastic front shell as mentioned it's
very small at 6.1 inches in length and
width and 3.1 inches deep there's
nothing too exceptional on the exterior
except for a large amount of ventilation
with large grilles on the top and on the
side which I wish would have had dust
filters the front has your power button
this nice layered texture which allows
for more ventilation and the i/o it's
actually slightly interesting ire as
there's the usual headphone and mic
jacks although I wish they were labeled
and the USB 3 port but also a USB type-c
port it's a nice inclusion to keep the
eye irrelevant in the future however I
do shows a USB 3.1 port not just a type
C now let's build the machine this is
hands down the easiest build I've ever
done installation is super simple and
there's even step-by-step instructions
to help you along the way once you've
removed the four back screws which
unfortunately are not thumb screws you
simply slide out the motherboard tray
from the case from here it's just a
matter of slotting in the CPU installing
its cooler
installing the memory and then flipping
it over and putting in the SSD I had a
little bit of trouble with the metal
tabs blocking the SSD but once I had
screwed that in I just used as rocks
proprietary SATA cable and it was hooked
up just connect the front i/o and slide
the system back in and you're good to go
you could assemble this in under 15
minutes with ease it's great for first
time builders and they really aren't any
difficult steps in the building process
now that it's assembled just choose your
orientation either vertical or
horizontal stick on the four rubber feet
and connect the included power brick
either VGA HDMI or DisplayPort cables
Ethernet and your keyboard and mouse
using either the rear two USB ports or
the front ones the case also has a base
amount meaning you can mount on the back
of a compatible monitor if you so desire
instead of having it on your desk
performance on this little machine is
hard to quantify since it really comes
down to your choice of components how
the system performs will depend on what
hardware you choose to use but I'll run
a couple of benchmarks to show what kind
of performance you can expect from this
$400 build in Cinebench is CPU benchmark
we've got a score of around 375
I've pretty close in line without socks
graphic they are advertising in
comparison with the Intel nook in 3d
marks guy driver we got an overall score
of three thousand six hundred and fifty
two with a graphic score of three
thousand four hundred and forty and a
physics score of five thousand five
hundred and seventy one as for gaming
don't expect anything great but some
basic titles won't cause any problems
when played at 1080p in terms of thermal
performance this build does pretty well
considering there's no active cooling
other than the CPU fan in a cool room
when running the 3d mark stress test for
10 minutes D CPU peaked at around high
60s very much in the safe range while
CPU fan was still on a low rpm if it
does get hot though the CPU fan can ramp
up a bit and get a bit loud and because
of the small form factor there are very
few options for aftermarket coolers and
that's my main gripe with this little
system there's just not a whole lot of
customization due to the very nature of
it you're probably stuck with limited
cooling options and you can't install
any PCI devices in here however I don't
think that will be an issue for most
people looking into this market and the
desk mini does a lot right it's one of
the most powerful and simple small
form-factor pcs and its support for
desktop CPUs means it can have the right
options for almost anyone
it fits my needs perfectly and it might
do the same for you so thank you for
