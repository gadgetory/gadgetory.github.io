been riddled with compromises and even
with mini ITX systems for the living
room there still been one constant issue
the lack of accompanying peripherals
controllers have their place but for
many users the keyboard and mouse is not
only a signature of PC gaming but also
very necessary for many games
unfortunately actually using them when
on the couch or in a chair is next to
impossible until now the z9 neo by
Zalman brings all the right features on
a budget with a large windowed side
panel 5 included fans and the excellent
interior layout with super simple cable
management get it now link in the
description below course has been
building up their premium living room
experience as of late first up was the
Mini ITX PC titled bulldog which
combines performance alongside looks
that blend right into a home theater
environment and now the accompanying
keyboard and mouse combo fittingly
titled
the lap dog as its name suggests the lap
dog is meant to allow you to game
comfortably from your lap with a
keyboard and mouse the lap dog is
available either as a bare-bones kit or
bundled with the compatible K 65 or K 70
keyboards course as aim with this system
is to provide a premium and polished
unit even if it doesn't have the
innovative features like wireless
functionality right from the exterior
finished courses commitment to quality
is evident and the build is excellent
although it is to be expected
considering this is coming in at a
retail price of a hundred and twenty
dollars for the bare-bones unit it's not
an insignificant price but it's also not
without justification you've got three
main sections the top pieces are all a
great-looking brushed aluminum finish
which gives the laptop a premium feel
and it blends beautifully with the
finish of the K 17 which I'm using or
alternatively DK 65 these are the only
keyboards officially compatible the lap
dog so you'll have to shell out the cash
for those you can use any USB mouse
however and as you can see I've been
testing this out with corsair saber RGB
and using corsair software i can sync
the lighting between the keyboard and
the mouse examining the build once more
when you remove the top covers you have
the main plastic frame and while there's
a little bit of flex its impressively
built especially since adding the
keyboard and outer frame adds rigidity
the main frame has three sections why
cut out for the keyboard a long strip
along the top for cable routing and the
USB hub for the keyboard and the mouse
on the hub is a strange 16 pin port
which Corsair is saying is reserved for
future use the last consideration is
that you have to leave the keyboard USB
passed through unplugged as there are
only two USB ports on the internal hub
and the keyboards pass-through is also
blocked inside the lap dog it would have
made sense to keep this pass-through
active and accessible so you wouldn't
have to remove the mouse pad to swap
mice on the exterior we have two
external USB ports so that you can
charge your phone or plug in another
peripheral we also have USB 3 input to
power the keyboard and mouse and an AC
adapter which powers the two other
external USB ports I would have liked to
see an audio pass-through here so that
you could plug a headset directly into
the lap dog there are also these
reflective surfaces with the Corsair
logo which look fantastic
until you touch them and they suck up
your finger prints the last section is
the cushion which attaches using six
magnets on the bottom of the main unit I
did find the adhesive holding the
magnets in place wasn't strong enough
and they started to stick onto the
bottom instead of holding in place when
they did hold in place they allowed for
easy detachment of the two sections on
the top of the cushion there's a cutout
for the included small tool for removing
all of the lapdogs screws as well as a
little cutout to store some on the
bottom is a relatively thin but very
cushioned and comfortable memory foam
this foam is curved to fit more
naturally to your lap and while it means
it won't sit flat on a table due to the
removable nature you can simply take it
off when using the lap dog on a flat
surface it's a comfortable cushion and I
have no real complaints about it now
before we get into the experience of
using it we need to take another look at
the price the 120 dollar price tag isn't
low and when you consider that you have
to spend another 150 on the keyboard
you're looking at upwards of two hundred
and seventy dollars for this set
assuming you already have a mouse
however just because something is
expensive doesn't mean it's necessarily
unreasonable and I think that's the case
for the lab dog you firstly have to look
at what you're paying for for the 120
dollars you're paying for that plastic
frame and aluminium shell and mousepad
the USB 3 powered hub and the 5 mini USB
3 cable as well as bundled power to top
this off you've got the magnetic farm
cushion on the bottom when you factor in
the costs with the R&amp;amp;D and the polish of
the experience you
can start to see whether price is coming
from and for what you get it starts to
make more sense that doesn't necessarily
mean it's the right product though while
it's understandable why it cost so much
it's also overkill for many people while
aluminium top plates are nice and the
extra USB ports are great for many
people they would have preferred
knocking off some of that price it's a
premium product so understandably it
does come with that premium price but
enough about the price is the experience
good enough to even justify what it's
aiming for so let's go about setting
this thing up the first step is to
remove both the top cover the cover
plate for the case 65 and the mousepad
you then slip the k70 in and plug it in
along with your mouse of choice you can
tie down the cables in the true cable
loops using the included zip ties I
prefer for Corsair to include reusable
velcro wraps instead as it expects many
people will be taking the board and the
mouse in and out you can then grab out
the included 5 meter cable for
connecting the laptop to the PC and
connect it to a USB port on the PC as
well as the AC power
it's then just a matter of reassembling
the lap dog and playing some games with
it the experience using the lap dog can
be summed up pretty simply you don't
notice it and that's the goal of a
product like this I can game away
without having to think about how the
keyboard or the mouse is sitting and it
just doesn't get in the way of fluid
gameplay I didn't realize how much fun
it could be to just relax on a couch and
play some step 5 or shadow of mordor for
hours on end it really brings a new
experience to gaming and I've gotta say
I really enjoyed it for me the
experience of on the couch gaming is
awesome and the lap dog allows for that
to happen seamlessly without making
compromises on my peripherals when
paired up with a mini ITX gaming ring
steams big picture mode or in videos
game stream it can be superlative
however that's not to say that the lap
dog is the perfect product and everyone
should go out and buy it right now there
are certainly some things to take note
of first up is the mousepad
this is mixed bag for me since courser
is opted for a medium sized hard pad
surface on one hand it's very solid and
easy to clean which is awesome and
tracking is great however the surface
itself is quite fast compared to a cloth
pad and your mouse will glide at a
quicker pace so it'll be some time
required to get used to playing on the
lap dog because the surface encourages
quicker mouse movements I found that
when I didn't have my hand placed on the
mouse
would simply slide off unless it hit
either the side or bottom barriers while
I wouldn't say I'm more competitive
shooter like csgo is really suited for
the living room if you're playing with a
medium or high sensitivity the lap dog
will do fine as you can use your mouse
of choice the only thing to note is that
if you're a low sensitivity gamer the
mouse pads physical area might be a
little small and because it's much
faster than a regular cloth pad you may
have to tweak your sensitivity the other
issue regarding the mouse is the cutouts
where the cable exit the cable runs
directly out without any rubber grommets
which means it can rub against the
sharpish edge of the mousepad I really
would have liked to see a smaller hole
with some sort of rubber grommet for the
cable exit the last complaints is
regarding to the keyboards ergonomics
usually when a keyboard is being used at
the desk you either rest your wrists on
a included keyboard wrist rest or on the
desk if not both however there isn't any
wrist support on the lap dog making it
feel strange and a little unnatural to
use it first I adjusted overtime but I
think it would have been cool to see
part of the top cable management portion
be moved to the bottom and that space
allocated as a wrist rest simply put
your wrists get bent at a slightly
unnatural angle due to the positioning
of your arms relative to the keyboard
the one other big thing would have been
Wireless now this isn't a small task by
any means as evidenced by the continual
critique levelled at most wireless
peripherals but that would have really
made the lapdogs standout wireless tech
has been making big leaps as of late and
companies like Logitech of showing
minimal lag is possible with products
like the G 900 Gaming Mouse hopefully at
some point course that makes attempts at
a wireless laptop or even an upgrade kit
for the current one maybe using that
lonely 16 pin connection only time will
tell and that brings us to the
conclusion this is a pretty simple one
as the lap dog does almost everything
right it's not perfect but for a first
generation product it's damn close and
you have to applaud Corsair for seeing
an uncoded for market and providing such
a great product it has its minor flaws
and the keyboards are exclusive to
Corsair but providing you can get past
that and you can splash the cash it's
really hard to not recommend the Corsair
lap dog so thank you for watching
