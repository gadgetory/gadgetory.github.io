fantastic day let's see if it gets any
better after all this rising 5
information and about the share it's so
refreshing to finally have non Intel CPU
options on the market and Amy's really
pushing hard towards them providing a
diverse price range for the CPUs and
with the release of these new skills
this is risin 5 explained horizon 5 fits
in the middle between the not gets
released risin 3 that's going to come
out in second half 2017 and the pretty
exciting multi workload focused arising
7 with entry price below 300 as this is
a preferred spot for the mainstream
consumer just like we're driving 7005 is
equipped with AMD sensor my making it a
smart core for boosting clocks when you
need it with precision boost and XO far
then down stalking is when you don't
need the power and all right in five
CPUs have the multiplier unlocked so
everyone can play the silicon
overclocking a lottery also let's not
get ahead of ourselves overclocking on
the horizon seven CPU so far has been a
bit of a challenge although we did get
the 1800 X 2 stable for from the one
gigahertz and nice overclock on the
memory to 3200 megahertz but with the
toasty haha 77 degrees Celsius on the
core so that's quite alarming but we'll
see where the rise of 5 takes us and we
would not able to make these 70 100x be
on or near heard so back to rise and 5
there will be two tiers of rising 5 CPUs
6 quart sauce rescues and 4 for 8 thread
models are all things to scalable than
core design starting with the
entry-level or core 8 thread CPU we have
the risin 5 1400 with 3 point 2 to 3
point 4 gigahertz and then the flagship
four core part is the 1500 X with about
a 10% faster base log and 9% faster boot
clocks moving up the core ladder are the
6 cores 12 threads models so the horizon
5 1600 with 3.2 to 3.6 gigahertz being
the entry level 6 courtship with the
1600 X being the flagship Verizon 550
you with 3 point 6 to 4 gigahertz and so
if we take a look at the entire rising 5
stacks the 3 lower models are 65 watt
TDP same as the rising 7
1,700 while the flagship six core model
is at 95 walk amy has also shared an
interesting tidbit of information for
the 50 100 X in particular with the XS
par value of 200 megahertz Headroom so
it will boost up to 3 ports 9 gigahertz
while the XFL values for the rest of the
SKUs will be on still unknown and will
be a surprise the only performance
Caeser comes with the Cinebench NT
benchmark comparing the flagship 1600 X
with the i-5 7600 K which is a $240
parts quad-core no hyper threading and
the only logical conclusion to why this
slide is included is to obviously
highlight aim these competitive
advantage in terms of price so rising 5
processors range between $169 to $249
competing between the I 3s and the I
sides of this world and is the
satisfying a pretty competitive price
tag while still distancing the flagship
16 100x away from the entry-level $369 8
core Rison 7 1700s April 11th is the
global launch date and Amy really wants
to push the rises by cpus with the be
350 motherboards so really satisfying
and saturating that mainstream market
for a good price to performance ratio
however it's still distancing itself
from the X 370 platform which is the
enthusiast platform because the to be
350 motherboards will not support
multi-gpu configurations and there's
also some other limitations within the
i/o such as less USB and less data
connection and with all that said the
unlocks multiplier is probably the most
interesting aspect of these rising sides
to use simply because you might have the
potential to increase the performance of
the lower to your SKUs by overclocking
them to match the performance of their
highest tier brothers that's exactly
what we saw with the r7 1700's and the
1700 X being overclocked to 4 gigahertz
and basically matching the performance
of the 1800 X while being significantly
lower in price bring them to a much
better value versus the eking out index
and let's hope that trend continues with
the rising 550 use whether it's a 1400
or clocking that too
performance on the 1500 X and the six
core models for the 1600s being
overclocked to 1600 X performance wise
let's just hope there's enough
overclocking Headroom between these
rising five CPUs and remember that the
Zen core is scalable so the six core
model is an eight core part with two
quarts disabled but how does that impact
overclocking behavior we shall see
enough for real and the last point to
cover are the new rate cords that come
with the rise of five stack so you'll
get the 65 watt spell cooler with e
1400s a slightly larger 95 watt he
thinks the spire with a 1500 X and the
r5 1600 and interestingly no release
cooler will be included with the 1600 X
because apparently AMD wants you to have
your own proper cooling solution with
your flagship purchase also rising 5
Hula's are not lit you'll have to step
up your game to rise in 7 to get that
RGB circled and that is all the news
surrounding Verizon 5 what are your
expectations and predictions for these
needs TP use leave them in the comments
down below
April 11th is a global launch date so
make sure to stay around for our full
reviews we'll see what CPUs we get first
but I'm going to be non-recognized
thanks so much for watching we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
