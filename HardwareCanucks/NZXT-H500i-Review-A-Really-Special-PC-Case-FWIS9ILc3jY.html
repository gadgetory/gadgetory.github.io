back after complex water show make sure
to check out our playlist I'll copy this
here but it's always great to come back
with something excellent waiting for you
at home
so the eight trip hundred is a very
exciting lineup because it's supposed to
replace the s340 which is n sixties one
of the most popular enclosures and
actually in the top ten on Amazon - now
that is a beauty man they're really
making appeal difficult so I'm
personally super excited about the a 500
series because it is very well priced it
is meant to be competitive it is
replacing the s340 elite with the
current generation of like n sixties
design language you know this one's
construction now you can definitely tell
this part of their H series and I'm
excited to see where they can take it so
let's see if this thing is any good
readiness it's always a pleasure
upgrading or adding new hardware to your
system especially when it comes to
storage like this new OC ZTR 200 drive
from Toshiba it's a great value SSD
offers a nice boost in performance for
boot times file transfers and just
general system and work operation with
cutting-edge 3d flash memory and ultra
reliable controller with built-in power
management consider the upgrade today
with TR 200 it's available in different
capacities check it out below alright so
the H rep hundred comes in two variants
the $69 basic version and the age of 100
I which includes the Smart Hub at $99
now I have the H of hundred I that
includes the smart hub for the fan
control there's also the built-in RGB
strip up top and behind the cable cover
but the bare-bones $69 kit is just a
frame with the two fans and I am totally
ok with that because you could
potentially spend the $30 on a set of
fans for the front if you are Airport
and the HR founders now completes the
entire h-series lineup so you now have
the H 204 ITX H 404 micro ITX
the H 500 as your ATX mid tower and the
H 700
our now the exterior format is familiar
this is unmistakeably in NZXT enclosure
with those hard metal corners there's a
discreet logo the front that shows up
only at certain light angles nice touch
and it almost looks like this
encapsulated frame without any
ventilation on the left side or the
front only at the top with that exhaust
fan and the right side panel that is
your intake area now NZXT has assured us
that they've done their own airflow
testing to make sure that this design is
not a choking hazard and in my own
temperature testing the cpu ran only two
degrees hotter versus what I got with
the age of hundred P mesh and this is
with only the 140 millimeter intake
added for the front so temperatures are
totally fine as long as you add some
form of front intake the power supply
shroud is part of the frame this kind
becoming the trend for like budget
enclosures with a shorter glass window
it is secured with a single thumb screw
in the back plus two pegs up top holding
it in place any bottom lip with these
plastic support pieces to actually catch
the panel the end result is a glass
piece that is flush against the frame
without any thumb screw sticking out on
the visible side the rear side panel has
captive thumb screws a dust filter for
that ventilation strip and the
convenient mount so you press the side
panel in against any cables also the top
and the front are one sheet of metal
that allows NZXT to save a lot on
tooling costs and channel that
additional funds for the interior that
has been refined and so overall it's a
simple design that is cost effective and
should exceed your expectations of build
quality for this price and that's a very
important thing seeing that it's
replacing the s340 elite the i/o is
basic with purple USB 3 ports there are
seven plus two vertical PCI slots two
120mm fans included for exhaust the top
one is covered with a not so accessible
dust filter and the power supply area is
dust protected
size-wise it's pretty compact about the
same height as the mesh fic but slightly
longer and I guess it's just a matter of
personal taste whether you like this non
complicated design but the question is
is it Fred approved so let's go inside
first you notice the interior is
separated by that cable cover that is
there instead of the rubber grommets it
is now a slightly thinner and fits the
interior proportion
the to SSD caddy sit on this perforated
floor so you can maneuver them around a
little bit and both can be relocated
behind the mobile tray boss the
perforation is good for airflow if the
power supply is facing up the front
fender acket is good for 280 million
radiators and is attached via thumb
screws and the idea here is to have the
fans spaced out enough from the front
panel which is why there's so much space
here now because of how the cable cover
is shaped you have 60 millimetres of
spacing available which is your standard
radiator Plus fans and that's it you
have like maybe five millimeters of
extra clearance in there left over but
not push-pull unless you remove the
cable cover you could also install a 120
rad at the back nothing at the top only
the exhaust fan because there's simply
not enough height clearance above the
motherboards for radiator to fit there
but at the back and for the front is
your work link compatibility in the
bottom chamber we have a drive cage but
notice there are no drive caddies which
means you must remove the whole thing in
order to secure your three and a half
inch storage not that convenient but for
cable management NZXT has the right idea
with plastic channels for smaller cables
and this main cable exit behind the
cable cover with a few of these velcro
straps now I absolutely love this front
panel connector makes installation so
much easier and to get the GPU mounted
you must first remove the vertical slot
that sits on this convenient bracket and
well here's my basic system finished a
pleasant experience all around with
pre-installed motherboard standoffs
large cutouts above and below the
motherboard and good spacing for that
cable cover so it doesn't press on the
24 pin too much the illumination is
quite nice sliding up the hardware from
above and behind the cable cover with an
even spread throughout the interior so
no matter the color or effect the entire
interior is fully illuminated and you
control all that through camp software
now because the top LEDs are bare and
not diffused you get this nasty
reflection on the glass from each of the
LEDs and this is visible at eye level so
I would recommend placing some former
piece of diffusion paper on there to
avoid reflections and also another
lighting aspect that I don't like is the
spill from the power button it's a minor
thing but it illuminates only one of the
you
B ports and not the other attention to
detail ha and as for cleaning up the
cables you use the velcro straps for the
thick 24 pin cable and route the rest
through other channels quick and easy no
complaints here and so for the 69 bucks
for the frame for the Aged 500 without
the hub and without the LED strip it is
a knockout it is competing directly
against a newbie 350 X both of which are
fantastic options within that price
territory but this one gives you a
little bit more character and elegance
and definitely deserves the harbor
canucks and damn good award and for the
$30.00 premium you are getting the fan
controller and LED strips so it's
cheaper to go that route instead of
buying them individually so if you are
after the bling and potentially adding
more fans and having all that control
through cam software be my guest
the $30 premium isn't that much but the
$70 price point is a fantastic baseline
alright so that's it let me know what
you think of this replacement for the
s340 you know I think they're
modernizing it so that it kind of
matches to the rest of their each series
lineup that makes sense and yeah I'm
excited to see if there's gonna be like
an H 709 a sage 700 already exist maybe
an 800 huh alright guys so I'm Dimitri
