great technology selections and service
so whenever building assists them either
for gaming or for editing have you ever
wondered how much system memory or RAM
you actually need for a specific build
well there's a bit of misconceptions
surrounding system memory and that we
assume the basics of more RAM means
better performance across the board and
what is the optimal capacity to be
actually utilized with certain tasks for
example most gaming machines come with
eight gigabytes of RAM that is plenty
enough as games require more processing
power from the CPU and the GPU instead
of RAM and in our tests with watchdogs
that there is a graphically intensive
game only six gigabytes in total was
utilized during game time so we would
suggest to stick to eight gigabytes if
your sole purpose is gaming and invest
into other resources for the machine
instead of more RAM now for this test
we'll be using our super project
workstation that we built for uber
recently make sure to check out our
build log if you're interested in the
detailed overview of the parts and from
memory we are utilizing Corsair
Vengeance quad channel 64 byte kit at
1866 megahertz so first let's start with
some generic benchmarks like Geekbench
and it's clear that Ram doesn't have
much impact on the scores
same story with noah bench where you
only gain four percent higher score with
a 64 gigabyte versus the 16 gigabyte the
lowest capacity specific Ram benchmarks
like memory mark tests reveal
interesting scaling result we're
doubling the memory from 16 to 32
gigabytes increases the score by a
factor of one point eight so almost
linear scaling here while increasing Ram
capacity by a factor of four from 16 to
64 gigabytes increases the score by a
factor of three point four so we can see
that Ram scaling is not linear when we
reach into the higher capacities in this
benchmark ram for editing on the other
hand is a completely different story
where programs like Adobe Premiere and
After Effects can utilize most of the
available Ram
or much faster render time as the goal
here is to reduce render times
especially in after-effects an
application that can eat your memory
without a problem showed impressive
results with doubling the capacity from
16 to 32 gigabytes reduced our render
times by a factor of 1.4 while
quadrupling the ram to 64 gigabytes
reduce the render times by a factor of
3.1 an interesting results to show that
64 gigabytes scaled better and our
render times in after-effects then the
32 gigabytes did
moving on to premier again it's all
about reducing our render times doubling
the capacity to 32 gigabytes
we saved 44 seconds on our video render
so that's a 13% improvement
doubling the ram capacity further to 64
gigabytes saved as almost 2 minutes with
a 32 percent reduction in render times
from our control point of 16 gigabytes
so there are obvious benefits of having
more RAM for video editing but of course
the question of price comes into play
and whether or not the time saved is
worth that much as that is one expensive
kit but still looking at our performance
numbers the 64 gigabyte kit comes out to
be a better value upgrade over the 32
gigabytes kit as performance scaling was
actually better with higher capacity at
64 gigabytes both for premiere and After
Effects and so we hope this video was
helpful to establish how much RAM you
should buy for your specific build and
let us know how much memory your machine
has with a comment below and do you ever
fully utilize it during game time or
editing so as always thanks for watching
