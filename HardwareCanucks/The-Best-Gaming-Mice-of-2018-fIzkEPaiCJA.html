day to practice and I just woke up like
10 minutes ago so don't don't expect
miracles this is the first time I've let
out the game oh okay so we're both fresh
it's not running on this board I see you
file panic again good game so as the
year comes to a close you my friend have
come to the right place to see which
gaming mice deserve our recommendation
and these have gone through insane
flicks unintentional range moments but
best of all delivers that satisfying
feeling of being number one on the
scoreboard
gonna get a kill now I trust my aim you
should probably - but you know what's
better for you are two opinions so in
this video you have a special FPS guest
die from rocket jump ninja whom I
consider an expert in gaming mice
because of this
so yeah he's really good and you should
take his recommendations for real let's
begin right after this what would you
like
so I'm looking for a gaming headset with
a bit of everything but not overkill
something that folds on your neck sure
how about the light frame without
excessive clamping force yes yes you
have to be air cushions with proper
internal padding excellent I will take
the cable and the microphone are
removable
fine fine this is the one multi-platform
compatibility with virtual surround
sound dongle avail can I just take one
and the sound quality you'll be
satisfied with so the new coolermaster
MH 751 and 75 to are here to make your
gaming experience
alright so my first recommendation goes
to my favorite Mouse of all the
SteelSeries rival 310 it is over a year
old but this is my favorite wired mouse
to date with their light non braided
cable bungee is always recommended
though an incredible sensor of course
fantastic button layout and field
especially that low profile fin to
change the CPI and they've made this
button larger on the rival 600 series I
don't really like that the side grips
have enough friction and most
importantly it's only 88 grams with the
most comfortable shape for my hand size
and the flick on top is the price you
can pick this up for around 55 bucks to
6 dollars and it is an absolute steal if
you want to improve your aim and stick
around with something for a while the
rival 310 is highly recommended and you
can check out full reviews of all the
mice we were talking about today in
description below plus pricing and
availability my second Mouse of choice
is the latest from Logitech the G pro
Wireless this is the mouse if you want
to cut the cord for your serious gaming
needs we've got the latest and greatest
sensor in there that the super power
efficient yet delivers outstanding
performance we no longer have to be
skeptical of using you know Wireless in
a professional setting and best of all
it is super light at only 80 grams and
for wireless mouse that is incredible
the gaming experience with this thing is
you know very satisfying the scroll
wheel is nice primer clicks so nice you
can store away the USB receiver inside
the mouse and the battery for me lasts
for about a week so I never have to
worry I find the ambidextrous shaped
comfy for my hybrid grip plus you can
add or swap side browser buttons for
left or right hand use and the only
caveat is the price since this is the
best wireless mouse that I've used to
date but not to worry my third Mouser
termination for 2018 goes out to the
large degree or five that is also
wireless and basically has the same
performance as the G Pro Wireless
selector you know older sensor with a
smaller shape that for my hand is
slightly better and the clutter on top
is the price at around fifty bucks
basically it has the same shape as the
original G pro wired mouse that I love
it is a bit heavier toe at ninety five
grams because of the double-a battery
but weight can be reduced if using a
lithium battery so just keep that in
mind and because there are no lights
it will last for over 200 hours of
continuous operation so battery life is
excellent and the USB receiver can also
be stashed away inside the body and for
real this feels like using a wired mouse
without any performance compromises but
of course it is Wireless but now let's
hear what zai has to say all great
choices I could probably say the same
but for the sake of variety I'm going to
say three different ones first the final
mass air 58 it's not available right now
but I want to point out why it's so
popular the shape is amazing it has a
top optical sensor and they've managed
to get a large Mouse down to about 58
grams a normal Mouse this size would be
about a hundred grams some people do
like the extra weight in their mice but
a lot of competitive players are finding
they can aim much better with lighter
mice so the oh-58 is extremely popular
which is waiting on stock and for other
mice to get even lighter next is my new
personal favorite the Zoe S series which
should be available in December 2018
stay tuned for updates it's a mouse
worth keeping an eye on I was using the
FK 2 for years and the S 2 is similar
but a bit shorter and a bit taller
really good changes to the point I can
feel more confident aiming and I already
am near my best with the FK 2 so that's
saying something
and the third the Logitech G 4:03 still
one of my favourites and still the top
Mouse even two years after its release
I'm sure everyone already knows about
that one though all three mice basically
have the same top optical sensor it's
just a matter of personal preference if
you ever watch my channel I recommend
finding a mouse 60% of your hand
measurements small mice seem easier to
aim would go too small and you might get
cramps in your hand have to find the
balance so any one of these mice could
be the topic for you and I have to give
a shout-out to the Rossum mumble
Wireless 2018
this one surprised me I really wasn't
expecting you to be so good but at about
105 grams it's not too heavy and the
shape is one of the best for hands of
eight inches by four inches and the
wireless performance is like wired
speaking of wireless I really have to
talk up your picks the Logitech G Pro
Wireless is the number one Mouse on my
list at the moment and the Logitech G 35
is my number 6 they are absolutely
amazing mice highly recommended but it
really depends on your hand size and
what you want so even though the GPO
Wireless is my number one I use some
mouse listed at number three if the GPO
Wallace was my recommended size I would
use that with that question there really
asks so many good choices at the moment
even the rival 310 is one of my
favorites you just have to find what's
right for you come on where's the peak
what Oh cuz you are protected yeah and
vulnerability so I really want that
final Mouse now thanks I but my audible
recommendation goes out to the slightly
older Zoe fk1
it is still in my drawer for a reason
because it fits my grip so well and I
love the driverless cycle between the
four dpi levels at the bottom approach
and I feel like my aim is perfect every
time I use it and it sells for around 60
bucks and it is definitely worth it and
so to recap here is a full list of
gaming mice we recommend with excellent
wired and wireless options in there plus
attractive price points for many they'll
all be linked description below so check
him out and I really want to thank die
