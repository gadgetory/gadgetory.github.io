today we're taking a look at the rather
unusual case from an tech as most case
manufacturers shift focus toward space
efficiency antic is taking the opposite
route with this 1900 altra gaming tower
and the our pricing is in a very high
bracket of $250 now from the looks of it
and the sheer size it appears to compete
against the 900 d and the like so let's
find out whether it stands a chance
within the current market scene the 1900
cams in two flavors the red and the
green and this splash of color is spread
from the front mesh to the rear PCI
brackets and the rubber grommets on the
drive caddies inside I'm not
particularly fond of the exterior
plastic let's just say it doesn't
complement the price the larger
rectangular window reveals all the
essential internals and the case does
stand on large rubber feet that are
adhesive and not screwed in again these
small details that don't exactly
compliment the price the front panel has
three optical bays including six USB
ports four which are USB 3 so that's
excellent to see we also have audio
jacks and PR buttons now be aware that
the front panel is screwed in so taking
those off we get access to three 120
millimeter intake fans there are no
other fan mounting options here now
first of all all the connections are
attached to the panel itself so removing
it during a fully build system may be
challenging if you tightly secure all
the cables second the intake strips are
quite small and the fans included are
not high static pressure fans so the
fault cooling may come as a
disappointment each fan is also covered
in individual dust filter and has a load
and high-speed adjustment that you will
need to access from the inside and
coming around to the back we have two
power supply mounting locations 9 PCI
brackets so e ATX motherboards are
supported exhaust fan and the fan
controller so that's really good to see
but that would make for some
uncomfortable routing as the molex and
the hub are located right there at the
top in the corner of the case the entik
has always been great for providing
enough ventilation where needed so
that's exactly what we see here now
removal power supply and us total is
included at the very bottom of the case
but no option to mount it at the above
position which i think is an oversight
the top of the case has somewhat elation
and removing the panel you can see how
unfitting the price is for all the
plastic that you get but that's not
really the issue here as the 1900 is
placed and the ultimate gaming tower
category and we only have dual 120
millimeter top pan placement no larger
fans supported and as you can see a
third one 20 millimeter fan would have
fit perfectly and there's absolutely no
excuse for not having a triple pen slot
at the top considering the gigantic size
each fan is also covered with dust
filter but because it is attached with
two screws and two pegs on each side you
can't use these for the radiator so
really poor design choices all around
alright maybe getting inside the case
might change our mind about this gaming
oriented chassis now the reason for its
resemblance to the 900 d is the bottom
chamber the bottom doors are covered
with noise absorbing foam as the chamber
is primarily designed for storage and
the door uses this push to release
mechanism instead of thumb screws so on
our sample when a doors locked fine and
the release system reset itself however
the other door wouldn't stay closed as
the mechanism was great through stiff
and it would give out so a slight bump
to the case and the door would just fly
open and that's totally unacceptable for
the price I'm also surprised to not see
any radiator options integrated into the
bottom chamber why in the world with a
gaming oriented case have that much
storage potential maybe if you're
considering a server build that would be
useful there is plenty of clearance for
long power supplies but absolutely no
flexibility for example if you mount
your power supply in the above position
this space is left underutilized you
cannot move any of their hard drive
cages for additional storage there are
no additional fan mounts for extra
cooling and overall a total loss of
potential the top chamber has almost an
identical layout to the antic p2 80 so
if you'd like to see the resemblance
check out now review the hard drive cage
is non removable so that's very limiting
in many ways for example it would have
been nice to remove it to mount a 240
million radiator at the front
but the frame is riveted so it's not
removable it does support two 120mm fans
that are attached with clips so that's
very appreciated but the hard drive
gauge is non removable which makes no
sense with the addition of this extra
storage chamber at the bottom but it
seems antic didn't even bother with
modifying the design for the better for
example the two SSD slots are kind of
pointless considering the drive caddies
are backwards compatible but to make
things even worse the SSDs stick out at
the front meaning there's a large gap at
the rear for all your SATA cables so
routing isn't made easy another
disappointing aspect of antics lack of
quality control was with the
installation of three and a half inch
drives the screws provided are slightly
too long allowing quite a bit of play
between the drive and the caddy luckily
there are rubber grommets but even the
basics like Drive mounting screws should
not be overlooked the rest of the
internals look pretty good with over 13
inches of clearance for your GPU we have
large rubber grommets and a few large
cable ties at the back for all your
cable needs complemented by an ample
space for routing if you use the very
bottom power supply location there are a
couple of large cable cutouts available
at the back of the case and an extra one
on the floor above and once finished
with the assembly I realized there are
no cable cutouts underneath our ATX
motherboard so routing isn't as clean as
it could have been plus there's so much
wasted potential given the size of the
internals and the bottom chamber is
pretty much left underutilized unless
you plan to run a server of some kind
now on a better note there is over three
inches of clearance until our memory
modules so push-pull is an option but
again only for a dual 120 millimeter
radiator and installed a surprise it
cleans up well at the back too now
regardless of the positives like the
insane storage potential and pretty
seamless cable work the 1900 is a total
flaw for a gaming category first
incredibly disappointing build quality
from the plastics used to the bottom
door latches then there's the lack of
proper airflow for such a large case
along with extremely limiting water
cooling options the drive change is non
modular there's no flexibility for the
bottom chamber the poorly designed
SD slots and screws for mounting drives
are too long the placement of the rear
fan hump is uncomfortable and at this
price point it doesn't really show that
antic has put much thought into the 1900
let alone places than the gaming
category it's just disappointing that
the company is not listening to users
feedback as you really wanted this to be
a success and antic really should
reanalyze the design hopefully with
improvements across the board but we
sure want to hear your opinion on what
would make this a true competitor within
the ultimate gaming category so leave
