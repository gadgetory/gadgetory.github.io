connects and it's almost time for AMD's
Radeon 7 GP to launch on February the
7th but we decided to take a little bit
of a closer look a few weeks before the
actual review goes live since there are
tons of things to go over now even after
the announcement of this GPU at CES
there was still a lot of questions on
how do you position the waiting on 7 GPU
and you know what the final specs are so
I'm gonna put out every bit of validated
information that we have from AMD in
preparation for the final reveal
that's going to take place in February
even after the announcement at CES no
one seems to be really excited about
this card but you never know
you know things may turn around the
things may turn the other way around as
we're going through the testing
procedure but anyways let's get into it
but first a quick message from our
sponsor the new master liquid ml AI a
liquid coolers from Coolermaster come in
both 120 and 240 millimeter variants now
with addressable RGB LEDs both the fans
and the pump that can be controlled via
this hub with options to adjust the
lighting effects and speed along with
the ability to control them through the
respective motherboard software check
out the ML 120 and ML 240 ra iOS down
below ok so here's the thing even though
we did have some hands-on time with the
waiting on 7 at CES it turns out as
usual Andy's trying to melt the coverage
of this card for all it's worth now we
are aware that the launch date is set
for February the 7th but it turns out or
interestingly enough there is a separate
unboxing embargo for this GPU I think we
need to make it evident here that the
unboxing embargo is between the date
this video goes live and the launch this
is not the unboxing video by the way
but anyways back to the subject at hand
the Radeon 7g PU and more importantly
the 790 metres second-generation Vega
architecture behind it while a lot of
people were looking for Navi to hit the
scenes and say yes it looks like there
were other plans
instead of using a brand new
architecture to test their 790 meter
process E&amp;amp;D decided to bring Vega back
like a zombie further refine it and heat
it up with a massive 16 gigabytes of HBM
to memory I know that might be a
disappointing for some of you guys but I
think it's a smart move rather than
risking issues by trying to combine a
next-generation design with a pretty
much untested manufacturing process the
problem is this also highlights how far
aimed he's behind on their GPU roadmap
you see in 2016 Navi was on track for a
2018 launch but obviously that didn't
happen since last year passed by pretty
quickly actually
back then the move to 7 animator Vega
wasn't even on the radar now things in
the Radeon timeline have become a lot
less clear between 2017 and 2020 I'm not
going to talk about rumours here but it
looks like the way on sound card is
simply a placeholder for AMD to stay a
bit relevant in the GP market by
becoming part of the news cycle at least
until na'vi or their next generation
architecture is ready sometime the older
vega 64 GPU actually represented the
architectures highest in configuration
with 64 compute units and 4096 cores as
you can see the core was also pretty big
which made it really expensive to
produce not only that but the 8 gigabyte
of HBM to memory was cutting edge back
then and added a lot to the overall cost
so the move to 790 meters has allowed
Andy to minimize their core size from
around 500 square millimetres to just a
tad over 300 square millimetres which is
pretty impressive HP m2 has also become
less expensive so AMD took this
opportunity to double it to 16 gigabytes
the cool thing is the smaller diarrhoea
also includes a double sized memory bus
so the total number of transistors has
actually increased from 12.5 billion to
13.2 billion now this all sounds really
interesting but there have been some
cuts instead of featuring the Vegas 64
full amount of computing units Andy has
removed four of them that means the
Radeon seven will have less coarse
texture units and other on-die hardware
we're not quite sure if these units have
simply been disabled or aren't present
at all the answer to that will have to
wait for the final review video so stay
tuned for that now this brings me to the
reading on 7 specs now some of these are
educated guesses since we don't think
AMD made any changes to the overall
layout of their compute units but right
now
it looks like it will have around 38 40
stream processors 240 texture units and
64 our Opie's that will operate through
a 4096 bit HBM to interface with a
massive bandwidth of about a terabyte
per second due to the 1k or its memory
clocks the basin maximum frequencies on
this card are actually pretty close to
what the rare Vega 64 liquid-cooled
versions head but it looks like the
seventh animated process will allow for
pretty high speeds so what does that
mean for performance well according to
some very carefully selected benchmarks
from AMD even though the Radeon seven
has less cores in the Vega 64 it can
actually outperform that card that
points to there being some additional
enhancements built into the revised Vega
core other than just high clock speeds
and more memory but outside of these
very basic numbers Andy told us to
expect frame rates of this new card to
typically hit between 15 to 25% better
than the original Vega GPU a few games
will feature performance above and below
those points too now all of that sounds
impressive on paper but let's quickly
recall where that places the Radeon
sound based on our our TX 2080
benchmarks across 13 games the Arctic's
2080 averaged about 30 percent faster
than the vega 64 at both 1440p and 4k
which means the way and some will likely
end up being behind the 2080
or basically tied up with the GTX 1080i
of course a lot of this will be
dependent on whether a game was produced
in partnership with AMD or Nvidia but
let's not get into that right now one of
the main problems with this is pricing
because when Andy showed this slide at
CES every lifestreams comments exploded
it seemed like Andy created a gtx 980ti
competitor that's almost two years late
and costs as much as money even if
Andy's promise of 25% improvement over
Vegas 64 is true that card was launched
at just five hundred dollars back in
August of 2017 as a matter of fact
that's only 15 to 20 dollars less than
some custom r-tx 2080 cards okay so we
do have tons of issues with our TX
features not being available but it's
ray tracing D LSS and adaptive shading
are all feature boxes that NVIDIA has
but aim D doesn't so other than the
possibility the Radeon seven has some
in performance at Amy's keeping behind
closed doors how could they justify a
$700 price point
well it seems like the updated Vega
architecture has received some very
serious enhancements to improve content
creation performance this is a pretty
big deal since it could make the Radeon
seven eight perfect dual-use TP for
gamers who also need work space
acceleration like we've been seeing in
the past in programs like premiere of
v-ray and blender and ease OpenCL has a
long way to go before its performance is
anywhere near Nvidia's CUDA acceleration
but it looks like that might be changing
at least that's what I hope
Ami's also including three free games
with this card so you get Devil May Cry
5 at the division 2 and Resident Evil 2
but the value of those will be entirely
dependent on whether or not you are
planning to buy those in the first place
we also can't forget that Nvidia is
currently offering buyers of their
Arctic's 2080 free copies of anthem and
battlefield 5 the be quiet dark based
Pro 900 and revision 2 is here with the
modern IO for your type C accessories
and Qi charging gadgets the new hub is
good for 8 fans and RGB strips plus
steam terior is incredibly modular for
airflow water cooling invert systems and
now with the power supply shroud check
out the v2 down below so overall the
reading of 7 looks like a pretty cool
card with a triple fan cooler that's
topped with a solar Stroud the side is a
glowing Radeon logo as well as a small
red square with an R right in the middle
even though it's using a 7 nanometre
manufacturing process don't expect a
lower power consumption which should be
obvious from the - 8 pin PCI power
connectors actually the board's power is
still listed at about 300 watts so a
stock way on seven will consume as much
as a Vega 64 or quite a bit more than an
RT X 2080 the backplate is also pretty
impressive but that's pretty much a
standard on every higher in graphics
card these days one thing I do need to
mention is that board partners won't be
launching custom designs but right away
and none of them could confirm whether
or not it would even happen from
everything we've been hearing the
reading on 7 will be in pretty short
supply alright guys so this is one to
wrap things up since something has to be
saved for the actual review but right
now the rating 7 looks like an
interesting GPU even though
it's price might seem a little bit too
high all we need right now is the
official benchmarks so definitely is
tune in for that on the 7th of February
if I were you I'd actually you know add
a notification or a reminder to my phone
will probably write it down somewhere so
you don't actually miss that but is this
graphics card something that you'll
likely buy or will everyone keep waiting
to see how a meeting video will fight it
out in the mainstream market later this
year let us know in the comments down
