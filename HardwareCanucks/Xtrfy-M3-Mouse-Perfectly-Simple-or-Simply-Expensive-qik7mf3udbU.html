can all agree in the fact that the most
important peripheral for gaming is a
mouse it plays a huge role directing
your aim selection speed and even
navigating through Windows of course
factors like the type of sensor or
dynamics buttons tracking and more are
all important aspects of designing a
gaming mouse however there are a lot of
individual opinions likes and dislikes
which make it almost impossible to find
a one-size-fits-all solution today we'll
be taking a look at a product that has
been developed by extra-fine in
partnership with a popular eSports
pioneer Emile Kristensen otherwise known
as hidden and this is it
the m3 now Emile is a very successful
counter-strike clar so when designing a
mouse like this he definitely should
have thought about the factors that I
mentioned earlier so will the m3 be the
ultimate gaming mouse for FPS shooters
we'll find out after a quick message
from our sponsor creativity is fueled by
the best instruments it doesn't always
come easy and in the process you often
realize how important quality is the RT
400 by OCC gives you quality and speed
with M de tu interface the schieben and
flash and a PCI bracket making it
possible to focus on what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty the m3 is priced at 80 euros
which might raise a lot of questions for
our North American viewers regarding
availability unfortunately this mouse is
only available in European markets but
that's necessarily not a bad thing first
of all there been enough busts about the
m3 that some North American gamers have
actually imported it from overseas also
SteelSeries offers they're very similar
rival 300 for $60 that mouse features
the exact same Pixar 32 it's an optical
sensor found on the m3 on top of that
you get more or less the same ergonomic
shape and RGB elimination so what's so
special about the m3 to be honest I'm
actually not quite sure about the answer
to that question so let's analyze it
from top to bottom to see if the price
point is justifiable the build quality
is great the body is mostly covered in
this soft touch rubber surface and it's
one of my favorite features of a gaming
mouse in fact my daily driver at the my
onyx AVR 7000 sports a similar build to
the m3 just be mindful that it will wear
out over time picking up oil stains
ergonomically the mouse suited me really
well I have large hands and my palm
wrapped around the body comfortably I
can see even people with smaller hands
appreciating the shape by the lack of
sight grips for your thumb and pinky
fingers could be a deal-breaker but I
was totally fine without them it's
really geared towards either a palm or
claw type grip and unfortunately it
isn't ambidextrous so left hand users
need not apply the bottom comes well
equipped with the appropriate Teflon
pads and they did a great job planning
on my aluminum mouse pad which is what I
use for testing gaming mice the cable is
braided and it's also really flexible
but I'm not really a fan of their design
a much cleaner and stealthy approach
would have been appreciated but on the
positive side it can easily be
differentiated from cables plugged in
behind your PC Plus this is highly
personal and I'm sure some gamers would
love the look the m3 comes with a total
of 5 buttons this includes the primary
left and right clicks the forward and
backward buttons on the left side of the
mouse and the scroll wheel button it's a
pretty basic offering but that's perfect
for people who don't need a ton of macro
controls the primary buttons exhibit
great tactile feedback but I just wish
that they could have been a little
faster when compared it to my a V or
7000 this could be due to these slightly
and longer travel distance it takes to
actuate but it doesn't require a lot of
force another concern I had about the m3
was the Ford browser button it's placed
a little too close to the front and I
found it to be a challenge reaching for
it this could be a major problem
especially for users with smaller hands
the scroll button doesn't require a lot
of pressure to press and the scroll
steps are nicely defined at the bottom
we find two buttons want to change the
polling rate which is best to leave at
1000 Hertz and the other to change your
CPI or counts per inch that cycles
through five different levels with 400
800 1600 3200 and four thousand dpi
those settings are color-coordinated for
easier distinction but the lack of a
driver software to tune more precise
sensitivities is disappointing the same
goes for tweaking the liftoff distance
there's no way to reduce that and with
the sensor picking up movement beyond
two millimeters away from the surface at
this price point I expect a peripheral
to include dedicated driver software to
complement the user experience but sadly
extra five fails to succeed here let's
talk about the Pixar 3310 optical sensor
over the course of my testing the
tracking performance was good and I do
prefer optical sensors for both editing
and gaming jumping into battlefield one
I was able to aim and target the subject
pretty well but the process of firing
gunshots felt a lot slower than what I
would get with the AV or 7000 once again
this could be due to these slightly
longer travel distance it takes to
actuate the primary buttons but to give
you more insight on how it performs in
counter-strike I'll hand it off to
Dmitri where he put it up against the
rival 300 and Logitech's G piroso Dmitri
take it away
alright so throughout my time with the
mouse it performed well without any
strange behavior or strange artifacts
with doing flicks and doing aim
correction and doing spray control
everything worked well and the thing is
the 3310 sensor here is predictable you
it's found among my favorite mice like
the SteelSeries rival 300 M on your X
caster the Zoe FK won all which from
perform practically identical so it
really comes down to personal preference
in terms of the shape and the weight the
weight here is like in the middle it's
not the heavy weight it's not a light
weight I prefer my set 90s and below but
this one's at the hundred and four grams
so using it after a few days really just
get adjusted to it and I can perform
flicks spray control
aim correction without any issues on the
m3
the lighting is pretty straightforward
on the m3 there are three individual
zones to showcase the yellow lighting
which ties in with extra files color
scheme this includes the ambient strip
wrapped around at the front the subtle
lighting on the scroll wheel and the
extra file oh go along with Hayden's
autograph and lit at the back this is a
branded Mouse developed by ninjas in
pyjamas so for you diehard fans of the
team this could be a good collection do
note that there's no RGB lining and
there's absolutely no way to turn off
lighting which sucks and this is why
they should have included a dedicated
drivers software in the first place so
is the extra 5 m3 optical Gaming Mouse a
good contender for competitive FPS
gameplay not for me personally because I
think the SteelSeries rival 300 offers a
lot of features for a lot less you know
it comes with things like RGB lighting
dedicated drivers software a much
simpler design that I prefer and
different color options that you can get
to pick from there are other mice that
compete well too many of which costs
less that being said I'm not completely
bashing the m3 it's a good Mouse with
solid build quality that has a very good
ergonomic design similar to the rival
300 and the Pixar 3310 optical sensor
performed great for my tests however to
me at least the drawbacks here outweigh
the benefits
the m3 has an overly high price there is
a lack of availability in the North
American market and the exclusion of a
dedicated driver software is totally
unacceptable for gaming mouse at this
price point from a personal standpoint
these slower switches were also a
turn-off since I'm used to much quicker
response times so I would skip this and
look at much cheaper options that would
offer a lot more features but if you're
real big fans of ninjas in pyjamas then
this could be worth taking a look
provided you're aware of the drawbacks I
mentioned earlier so what do you guys
think of the extra Phi m3 optical gaming
mouse are there any alternatives like
these SteelSeries rival 300 that you
might be interested in let us know in
the comments down below I'm a bar with
hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one
