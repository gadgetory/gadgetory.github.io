nice to stay in so let the gaming
wireless headset battle begin
hello good people I'm Dimitri and if
you've been considering getting a
wireless headset you have come to the
right place
because behind me I have razor large
deck SteelSeries Corsair and HyperX so
let's see which one is best right after
this it's always a pleasure upgrading or
adding new hardware to your system
especially when it comes to storage like
this new OC ZTR 200 drive from Toshiba
it's a great value SSD offers a nice
boost in performance for boot times file
transfers and just general system and
work operation with cutting-edge 3d
flash memory and ultra reliable
controller with built-in power
management consider the upgrade today
with TR 200 it's available in different
capacities check it out below this work
see no wires it's amazing oh alright
guys so let's begin this one's gonna be
one epic roundup if you want to check
out individual views of the headsets
that we have done reviews of they'll be
linked in the description and also
that's where you'll find links to
purchase any of these bad boys and to
smooth out your viewing experience the
timecode for this video will be pinned
in the comments so let's go alright so
let's start with the price under $100 we
only have two pairs the corsair void Pro
Wireless RGB and the large stick g5 33
stepping up under $200 we've got the
SteelSeries Octus 7 the logitech g930 3
the Razer men-of-war from 2016 and the
new HyperX cloud flight is up here too
at $159 and if you've got really big
bucks to spend the Razer Thrasher
ultimate will shred your wallet for sure
but not as much as the SteelSeries
arctas Pro Wireless with that a little
bit of an insane $329 price now before
we dive right in leave your predictions
on let's say who will win the headset
roundup in the comments below and then
come back to it after you've seen the
conclusion now I normally don't talk
about packaging but of course the
colt will appreciate the recognition
plus they're the only ones to have
plastic covered the velvet material
I do like Corsairs approach to
simplified packaging and HyperX flight
with all the cables right at the surface
whereas a steel series buries all their
accessories and tiny boxes and logitech
is the only one to have their headset
wrapped now the number of accessories
kind of follows the price point they all
charge via micro USB cable which is
included with each headset along with
some derivative of a USB dongle so
either a thumb stick style or the
extension style so you can expand your
reach or close the distance between the
headset now the Thresher ultimate comes
with a hub since it's a ps4 Edition so
that's where you plug in the optical
cable and charge the headset through the
hub as well a plastic headphone stem is
included with some clothes resemblance
to this Imperial shuttle from Star Wars
not sure if that's intentional or not
while the most expensive pair the arc
test Pro Wireless has all the cables and
double the batteries and the control hub
that's also your receiver and a charging
dock for the removable batteries so if
you want a simplified wireless setup or
are traveling want to minimize cable
work all the pair's with the simple USB
dongle would obviously be more
convenient so like the void Pro the
HyperX cloud flight both large tech
pairs and the Razer Manowar that has a
tiny receiver actually built-in into the
ear cup while on the logitech g930 3 we
actually have a specific compartment
inside the ear cup to store the receiver
but for those that do not have any
compartments you can simply tuck it away
inside the ear cup like this to safely
keep the receiver with the headset now
build quality varies between these
headsets significantly and it doesn't
necessarily follow the price point
either the most robust pair is the still
series arctas pro also being the most
expensive with the quality metal
headband aluminum hinges and everything
just feels awesome the only problem is
you cannot expand them because they rely
on this self adjusting fabric piece and
the same goes with the arc 2 7 but these
have plastic hinges which are a little
bit more loose and weirdly following
after that would be the coarser void pro
which happens to be also the cheapest
pair they are nicely balanced weight
wise metal hinges are not to lose
and they feel like they can withstand
some unnecessary force like if they drop
from a table or you know if you flip
them across the room the microphone toh
feels cheap you know the actual arm
might lose resistance over time so
that's the only negative I do like the
lightweight nature of the HyperX flight
the hinges feel fine but you have to be
very careful with an all-plastic body
and that seems to be the compromise for
these because they're super lightweight
so that's a positive and they kind of
feel like that bose noise-canceling
headphones too but when I'm stretching
out them on the sides the plastic
stretches too so just have to be careful
and be cautious of their built quality
the logitech g930 3 comes next with the
robust plastic body that does not creak
all over the place the hinges are not
too loose and the extension mechanism
stays in place - they're a little bit
deceiving with this metallic surface but
it does play on your perception of it
feeling like a high quality build the
Razer Thresher ultimate is quiet light
thanks to the thin metal headband and
plastic everything else the hinges worry
me a little bit but they shouldn't have
any issues with supporting the full
weight of the headset the only thing
that bothers me with the Thresher are
the hinges and their corners are super
sharp so if they're around your neck
they could cut you Northcutt true but
scratch you and the same thing if like
you put your finger there while you're
taking them off it's not a pleasant
experience unfortunately the worst build
quality goes to the Razer men-of-war
they are bulky plasticy hinges are super
loose and actually have a history of the
middle headband piece breaking because
it's not well attached and also the
large stick g5 33 they just feel super
cheap and the hinges have absolutely no
control so the ear cups just wobble all
the time and this headset has glossy
sides if you like that dirty look and
the only quality element is the
expansion mechanism what this is going
on right now
now before we completely give up on
headsets that have really subpar build
quality I want to say that throughout my
testing with these there is a balance
between you know build quality sound
quality comfort value features and so
it's kind of like a mixed bag there is
no perfect headset in ass lineup and
that's a bit unfortunate but just keep
that in mind for later in the video
and so now
let's move on to comfort majority of
these are awesome lightweight so you can
wear them for hours until the battery
dies and to no significant clamping
force for any of these so my favorite
would be the HyperX cloud flight with
fantastic ear cup isolation extra
interior padding and they also expand
for larger heads no problem and fold on
your neck in this nice low profile both
logitech pairs have large and deep
cushions awesome fit over all the g9 33
has smooth air padding all around while
the newer g5 33 has this harsh bathing
suit material that are super and
pleasant on your skin both of them fold
in your neck which are a little bit
chunky on your ear cups but not
uncomfortable seriously so this is the
533 hear how the sounds I could shower
with this you know substitute my
spongebob sponge sponge versus the 933
you may not hear the difference but I
definitely feel difference
the 933 is much smoother the 533 is way
harsh like sandpaper on your skin which
is super unpleasant by the way when it's
right by your ears
now the void Pro has angular cushions so
the cover my ears very well with nice
pressure distribution to they fold in
this non choking slim profile on your
neck the round cushions on the Thresher
ultimate are fine they are large and
will cover your entire ear clamping
force is pretty weak to avoid pressure
buildup but heat concentration is
present and despite being the largest
headset in this round up default on my
neck just fine without any mobility
issues the men-of-war headset has the
same round ear cup design but a tighter
fit and less comfortable headband with
more pressure from the top and because
they fold on this angle keeping them on
your neck is really uncomfortable now
the artist Pro Wireless comes with
deeper cushions and slightly expanded
headband versus the arctas 7 but since
they're not really size adjustable it
won't be comfortable for larger heads
and both of them like to choke you when
placed around your neck
the arced is 7 more so because of the
tighter headband and so the 3 oddballs
would be the 2 SteelSeries headsets and
the razor Man O'War something because
the razor one has problems with the
headband
and it's not really comfortable when
they're on your neck while the
SteelSeries is perfectly fine for
smaller heads you know they're okay for
me as well but I wish I had a little bit
more expansion at the bottom so that I
could bring them down a little bit more
if I'm wearing hat or something like
that but because they choke you when
they're around your neck you know if you
wear them around your neck and since
they're wireless - it's kind of like a
perfect thing to leave them on your body
when even if you're not listening to
something there's a little bit
unfortunate with the SteelSeries artists
Pro and the artists Evan the HyperX
flight oh man what a comfortable design
for on your neck just lovely
moving on to features each headset has a
power button and mic mute switch and the
volume wheel and only the razor pairs
the avoid Pro and the artists Pro have
precise steps for volume all other have
terrible control the G 933 has three G
keys for macros like changing your EQ
settings lighting or whatever else and
both SteelSeries pairs include a
headphone share port which is quite
unique the arctas 7 has a dial for chat
mix to balance voice versus in-game
volume while the artists pro is the only
headset with dual wireless connectivity
with bluetooth support so letting you
connect this to your notebook or your
smartphone without the need for a USB
dongle now the hub with the Thresher
ultimate is bare-bones in terms of
control just the power button in the
front and the Dolby surround sound that
I don't understand why it's hidden in
the corner while the hub on the wireless
pro lets you control your EQ mic side
tone chetniks
basically it's a driver free experience
that is appreciated and you have all
this control even if you connect it to a
ps4
alright so microphone test time so what
you're hearing now is that from the
artist Pro Wireless being the most
expensive one how do you think that one
sounds now it's clean
there's no noise when they stop speaking
but the thing is it just sounds like
there's way too much compression going
on as it tries to cancel out whatever is
in the background so next up is the
cloud flight I think this one has really
aggressive noise compression tries to
just like really mute the background and
that causes the voice to be muffled not
the best sounding microphone in this
collection and just like lacks
definition and it's not as sharp as the
other pair that you just heard what
you're hearing now is that from the
large tech genus
this is the oldest headset in this
collection and I think it sounds the
worst as well it just doesn't have much
background compression or any focal
compression it just like it picks up way
too much ambient stuff and doesn't help
to isolate just the voice and the voice
doesn't sound that great either so um
what are you gonna do luckily the new g5
33 definitely sounds much better it
still exhibits a lot of background like
noise and hiss despite the trying to
cancel that out but the actual vocal
range is much improved versus the older
g9 33 the Corsair void Pro is next so
this one has really aggressive noise
compression and tries to like really
cancel out anything so you will have
these spikes in terms of volume in terms
of your speech so if you're not speaking
loud enough it will just completely cut
that out so it's not as powerful because
it has that really aggressive noise
cancellation the next one is the razor
Man O'War which is also one of the
oldest ones in the surround of and it
also sounds pretty bad you can see it's
very Bumi it doesn't have clarity in the
voice and it does have really good like
noise compression in terms of the
background stuff but yeah it just in
terms of the vocal pickup it's not
pleasant
unfortunately the updated razor had said
does not have any improvements in the
microphone quality it still sounds very
booming there is a you know aggressive
background compression too but the vocal
definition just completely is lacking in
comparison to everything else in this
roundup and finally the SteelSeries
arctor 7 it's weird because they all
sound the same in terms of how much
compression there is for the vocals not
just for the background and there's
trying to compensate for that you know
I'm guessing for like the keyboard
switches and typing stuff but it really
destroys the any vocal definition and
range that you might expect from an
actually decent microphone like the
microphone on the son Heiser game one
it's been my go-to headset for games
because the microphone is just so good
lots of body to the sound there's no
that nasally compression that we hear on
all other gaming headsets not just on
this wireless stuff that we're testing
today but yeah this has been my
definition of like a reference quality
microphone on the gaming pair so let me
know if you agree so based on that mic
test which one sounded best to you I
think the worst one would be the G 933
which is also the oldest one the Razr
pairs have that nice lower end boost
which is booming well the rest of them
can sound the same they all will kind of
have this nasally compression going on
in the background so I'm not exactly
sure which one wins so you let me know
okay so in terms of sound performance
they all deliver really powerful output
in terms of volume so that's not really
an issue but they do have pretty
different sound characteristics so if
you're looking for the best surround
sound experience hands down either of
the large stick pairs both create this
large soundstage experience without
compromising important details with
incredible imaging I like feeling the
audio cam like in front of you and not
just in your headset and even in stereo
mode you get amazing definition powerful
bass control treble on both and it's
really unfortunate that the 5:33 is so
flimsy because the sound and surround
sound is just fantastic and adds extra
points to this headset overall the next
in the chain would be the HyperX cloud
flight with a lot of definition precise
bass heads and smooth treble and
definitely one of the best within this
roundup the Corsair voice Pro Wireless
are satisfactory with balanced output
it's more closed off compared to the
HyperX for example but with good detail
presentation and bass that's there
without overstepping its boundaries now
the sound signatures between the
SteelSeries headset is completely
different they both have awesome detail
and really tight bass but the artists
Evan I prefer more because on the arctas
Pro while is the sound stage is slightly
expanded and the treble is brighter
which I prefer less and this the artists
Evan is like overall a more fun
signature for me both music and games
and lastly that two razor pairs are the
most powerful out of the bunch at 60%
volume I was totally comfortable in
terms of power output now the razor
thresher has super harsh travel beyond
60% volume to the point of me needing to
like lower it in order to hear anything
and regardless of this upper boost it
lacks mid-range definition and bass has
left the building - in comparison to
everything else that's on the list while
the men of war has a smoother treble and
a more pleasant sound signature in
comparison to the thresher but both
these would be fantastic for FPS where
you can hear
every little detail and you don't care
about the rest of the spectrum range you
know where you want just the really
sharpness to hear everything so perhaps
for competitive stuff that would be fine
but I'm guessing everyone who's be
spending money on the wireless gaming
headset doesn't want to be just
listening to FPS stuff but you want an
all-around sound signature that would be
compatible for both music movies and
games and I would say the razer stuff
isn't ready to par for that in terms of
the wireless signal all of these in my
space are perfectly fine i am able to
walk around the space go six meters away
with a few walls in between without
losing a signal and without hearing any
quality loss in audio so in terms of
battery life I think the SteelSeries
arctas pro takes the win easily because
of these interchangeable batteries
because one of them is constantly
charging inside the doc so you just
simply swap them out when one dies and
you never have to plug it in to charge
the headset versus all others need to be
plugged in for charging whereas the
large tech stuff I really appreciate the
battery percentage indicator in the
software so you know exactly how much
juice you have left and you have to plug
them in versus the rest of them in like
the Corsair but the Corsair stuff would
give you low medium or high in terms of
battery life whereas the razor thresher
has no software so you cannot even check
the battery life everything else can
last two days and then you have to be
recharging and so depending on how much
you use I think I would go for about
maybe 10 hours of listening a day for
most of these no problem and I would
have to recharge it a little bit on the
third day so that gives you a little bit
of an indication on how often you need
to recharge so maximum I would say 2-3
days unlike good heavy use with any of
these but still the artists Pro because
that removable battery easily wins the
battery test alright people it is
conclusion time and I will give you a
few of my favorites first the HyperX
cloud flights so they're super
comfortable I can wear them for hours
they have amazing isolation and sound
quality is incredible
they are driverless so you don't have to
think around stuff it just it is what it
is but it is a
pensive at the hundred sixty bucks so it
slightly cheaper options where the
cheapest option in this roundup would be
the corsair void pro at $80 i'm overall
impressed with this the only crappy
thing is the boom arm for the microphone
it feels kind of flimsy and cheap but in
terms of comfort sound quality range and
battery life really good stuff as long
as it turned off the RGB you'll be fine
the game for at least two days but my
surprising pick would be the oldest out
of this bunch logitech g930 3 not
exactly sure why large tech went ahead
to replace the really good material that
they've had there with something that is
from a bathing suit on the newer models
but here the sound quality is incredible
for Wireless and like really powerful
not punchy but like really tight bass
really good detail you know treble not
too harsh the microphone quality on here
is actually the worst out of the bunch
but as long as my teammates can
understand me I'm fine and this is the
only headset ever which I've actually
enjoyed surround sound with but it's
awesome and this would be like a really
good dedicated gaming headset I
definitely want to give SteelSeries a
shout out with the artists Evan I think
this is the better headset versus the
artist Pro Wireless and if you guys want
to see a complete head to head let me
know in the comments below but this one
sounds better to me and I don't really
care so much about the the really big
hub there with the interchangeable
batteries so to me this would be a
better value and it's significantly
cheaper the only thing is still series
have updated the padding and the actual
headband on the pro to be a little bit
more comfortable versus the artists 7
now in terms of the razor stuff it's
good to see they've changed the design
of the thresher to be a little bit more
distant from the Man O'War so it's more
durable but in terms of sound quality I
feel like they went a little bit too
much on the brightness like it's a
really sharp headset so if you're into
that definitely check them out in terms
of the fit it's one of the better in
this collection and the man-of-war
surprisingly still sounds pretty good
for being a 2016 release it's only the
the frame itself is really bad and you
can
up online as to why the top headband
just keeps breaking because the design
is not exactly the best but the raiser
section here you know if you want to
maintain loyal then the Razer thresher
would be my recommendation alright guys
so that is it for this epic roundup let
me know which one of these you would
pick if you are on the market for a
wireless gaming headset in the comments
below as always make sure to subscribe
and follow us on social media check out
this other relevant content and also
don't forget to let me know which one of
these sounded the best in the microphone
quality because to me the kind of all
sounded a little bit the same with one
of them a little bit poor I can't think
with so many headsets on me guys I'm
Dimitri thanks so much for watching
we'll see you in the next video this
