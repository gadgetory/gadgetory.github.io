all right what's up guys ever hear with
hurricane axe and prebuilt gaming
systems are shrinking in size yet they
post enough horsepower to drive modern
titles at 1080p and 1440p the technology
is there and we've seen them implemented
in systems like the Corsair one the ACS
g20 I and a few more but one of the
concerns that I have with these type of
systems is that there are a few factors
that are generally ignored and one of
them is obviously power efficiency
thermal management and acoustic
performance it's hard for me to
recommend system that check marks those
criterias so that's why you know I'm a
little bit neutral on pre-built systems
at this point I've seen a few good ones
out there the Corsair one was
ridiculously amazing the msi trident
which surprised me in a lot of ways but
you may recall the review of the
gigabyte gaming GT it wasn't quite up to
my standards it looked very ugly and it
sounded like a jet fan while gaming well
today I have something for you and it's
another gaming system from gigabyte I
want to see it right here this is the
Brix vr gaming so yeah let's take a
closer look at it right after a message
from our sponsor it's time to try
something new with the key 900m
mechanical keyboard by Zalman with Cale
brown switches on board macro recordings
and absolutely gorgeous
RGB illumination with the white frame
even your dog will go nuts check it out
in the description below
alright before I proceed to the bread
and butter of this gaming PC I wanted to
quickly point out that gigabytes bricks
line up normally consists of bare-bones
kids meaning the end user would have to
populate their own choice for memory
hard drive and the operating system the
gigabyte bricks vr gaming that were
checking out today is no exception to
that in my case that involved a few
teardown procedures to get hold of the
dual sodium ddr4 Ram slots which weirdly
enough claims to support up to 64
gigabytes in total on their website but
I find that hard to believe since there
are only 32 gigabyte dual module kits
available in the market at the moment
the two and a half inch charger bracket
was easy to access I mounted my TL 100
240 gigabyte
see from OCC and just like that I was up
and ready to play some games
not really you see for some reason
gigabyte has still not figured out a way
to enable legacy support out of the box
in fact we've experienced similar issues
with their smaller Brix units so sadly
the old-school bios didn't explicitly
display that option so I reached out to
their technical team or gigabyte and
learned that I had to enable the boot
options within the CSM configuration for
legacy I'm a disappointed gigabyte I
mean honestly this is targeted towards
first-time users so you know they might
not experience or they might not have
access to the level of technical
assistance that I do so you know it is
something that has to be addressed in
the first place
at least on their website the rest of
the specs includes a quad core mobile
core i7 7700 HQ CPU a gtx 1060 and dual
band until wireless AC there are two
MDOT two slots with one supporting
Intel's opt-in technology and the other
being PCIe that's directly linked to the
CPU so you could take advantage of nvme
SSDs in the future
now price-wise you're looking at around
1200 dollars for the bare-bones kit but
when you factor in components like the
RAM the hard drive and the operating
system you could run anywhere between
$39 to 1500 dollars in total for a fully
functional bricks vr gaming PC let's
switch gears and talk about the physical
aspect of the bricks we are it's tiny
and cute coming in at just over two and
a half liters in volume for comparison
here's a shot of it sitting next to a
fully fledged GPU my DSLR camera and a
ketchup bottle it's that tiny guys and
as a matter of fact this can serve as an
excellent option for a powerful htpc the
design is simple and stealth looking
plus I like the slight change of orange
accents at the top right underneath
you'll find subtle LED lighting which
hasn't received the RGB treatment but I
like the neutral white color scheme the
chassis is made out of brushed aluminum
which sadly is a fingerprint magnet so
be mindful of that if you're looking for
something that can easily blend in with
your living room set up the brick's VR
would be an excellent option for that it
doesn't look too aggressive
from my perspective but you might not
feel the same way so let us know your
thoughts about the design in the
and stand below the i/o is fairly
limited when compared to a full-size
desktop PC or even some pre-built cases
that I've encountered in the past as you
can see there is standard DCN Gigabit
Ethernet Kensington jack 3 USB 3.0 ports
a single USB 3.1 type AM type-c ports
dedicated headphone and mic jacks and
antenna mounts for the Wi-Fi card which
are included in terms of display outputs
there are a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports and a
pair of mini DisplayPort 1.3 ports both
of which support up to 4k at 60 Hertz
now let's talk about performance and
honestly I'm not expecting higher frame
rates at 4k or even 1440p because
remember the GTX 1060 is the hallmark
for 1080p gaming and you know one of the
things that you also have to consider is
that the bricks VR sports a mobile 7700
HQ CPUs so that could potentially be a
bottleneck to unleash the GPUs to
performance regardless of that how did
it do well starting with Cinebench r15
running the CPU test the bricks we are
scores 20 percent less than the g-20 CI
that sports a 7700 desktop grade CPU
this was expected since the 7700 HQ
processor features less cache and lower
base lose clock speeds switching to
OpenGL and we see the same story with
the bricks VR it trails behind the g-20
CI by a significant margin and that's
once again do the lower clock
frequencies on the mobile CPU remember
this should translate well into gaming
as modern titles love higher clock
speeds I also performed our standard
Premiere Pro render test exporting a
one-minute 4k h.264 video and the bricks
VR completed that task in just under
three minutes which is respectable so it
might be an excellent option for light
content creation here are the results
for the 3d mark 5 strike and time spy
tests this gives us a rough idea as to
how well the gtx 1060 when combined with
a 7700 HQ cpu performs with respect to
the gtx 1070 and 1080 now the other
systems that you're seeing here are
rocking desktop great CPUs so that's
another factor that needs to be taken
into account all right
game time that'll be one dish down frame
rates in the mid 40s which shouldn't be
a surprise as I'm pushing this at Ultra
settings at 1440p and this GPU is not
meant for that
if you tone things down to 1080p at high
settings you'll definitely be able to
pass the 60 happiest mark over watch at
1440p set to epic was a pretty playable
experience I was able to achieve just a
tad above 60 frames per second if you're
looking for more you can certainly tone
it down to high settings and not worry
about changing resolutions I had a
similar experience with doom at 1440p
set to ultra the GPU was hovering around
these 60 frames per second mark a few
things to consider here is that this
title is graphically intensive unlike
overwatch but the CPU is a huge
bottleneck in this situation Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon didn't go that well
on the Brix VR it averaged around 37
frames per second at 1440p sector very
high this is yet another demanding title
and it required a lot of GPU horsepower
along with a capable CPU if you don't
mind switching to 1080p at medium
settings they should grant you some more
room for a smoother gameplay if you're
planning to might intend to compute
tasks on the Brix we are you might be in
for disappointment
I ran our standard Ida 64 stress test
and the CPU got all the way up to 95 Â°c
during load and it did throttle so be
mindful of that
remember there's only one single intake
fan located at the bottom to draw cool
air to the components and unfortunately
it didn't do a good job keeping things
under control now realistically if
you're strictly gaming you won't
experience throttling since those
applications are not CPU hungry the GPU
on the other hand got toasty at around
84 C which isn't too bad but if I were
you I would refrain placing the bricks
we are in compact spaces where airflow
is restricted the system was also not
quiet during my benchmarking session the
fan did wrap-up all the way up to 2700
rpm sadly during idle scenarios the
system was fairly audible so from an
acoustic standpoint the Brix VR gets at
5 out of 10 beating here's how it sounds
so my concluding talks on the Brix vr
gaming PC from gigabyte is that it's an
interesting addition to gigabytes Brix
lineup for one very compact so you can
easily blend it in within an HTTP see
setup so if you're looking for something
that's just a little bit more powerful
for your living room then this might be
an excellent option
I wouldn't recommend 4k gaming or 1440p
gaming on it because you definitely not
going to have the highest frame rates
but if you're strictly gaming at 1080p
this will be an excellent companion for
your TV or for your 1080p TV in your
living room
however from a price to performance
perspective I would skip this and
probably pick the msi trident 3 arctic
that i reviewed about a month ago it's
the same price but it comes with a
desktop grade CPU and a gtx 970 and it
has willget performance plus it's really
quite under idle and load scenarios so
that's it for me on the gigabyte Brix vr
gaming pc this surely has its ups and
downs for one it's compact it's
beautiful and all but you know there are
a few compromises that you'll need to
make not one of that is obviously
thermal management and of course CPU and
GPU temperatures and performance this
would definitely complement my living
room I'm definitely going to hook this
up to my HDTV I know I'm still using an
HDTV but yeah let me know what you guys
think about this game you please see in
the comments down below what do you guys
think of the design its performance with
respect to the other gaming pcs that I
tested I mean but with hurricane axe
