the crew and we are right now going to
visit Silverstone and usually they've
had the worst lighting for the entire Cs
show forever so we're gonna take bets to
see if they have actually improved their
lighting by maybe including some soft
boxes or something so let's see here oh
my god the orange you see this orange
it's like foreshadowing what we're about
to witness alright Eva what do you think
they'll have good lighting or no no
Michael and I think they will have soft
boxes i won all right let's check out
what silver still has to offer but first
huge thanks to fantex Thermaltake Razer
MSI and Corsair for making this trip
possible and while the guys are shooting
the mini case the ITX the LDO 3 which
has been redesigned based on from last
time you saw it at Computex now it
slightly bigger so there's more spacing
between the GPU and a tempered glass
side panel but we want to hear your
opinion because their spacing is there
would you prefer a mesh panel or a
temporal glass panel with the tempered
glass panel you can still support like
you know our TX 20 70 or 200 watt GPUs
without adding any additional mesh in
there so there's no throttling or would
you prefer to go the performance route
straight away having a mesh side panel
on the GPU side so there is no
compromise let us know in the comments
side panel solution is made easy with
pegs that you push them in so it's a
convenient to us assembly and that's
where the interior it is an ITX layout
with SFX or SFX l power supply that is
supported that goes right below the
motherboard so there's a bit of dead
space in there but it allows for nice
airflow channel from bottom to the top
so you can install a fan in the bottom
you have a nice air cooler and have an
exhaust fan on top with a GPU on the
side so blower style is sort of
recommended for this channel airflow but
regular you know triple slot fan design
is also not a problem
there is an optional 80 moment of fan
mount up top so it can suck in all the
dead air that the circling around the
GPU but of course it is optional
you populated if you need extra cooling
so yes we were able to set up the
lighting to reveal this case the Raven
prototype now it's exciting because the
last Ravens case that the Silverstone
launched was in 2014 so quite a while
back it's not as ancient as that CPU
cooler inside though however we'll give
them a pass because it's H Harbor
connects and I mean but this is the
Raven prototype and it's cool because
they're trying to modernize the frame
and modernize the features on the
interior to kind of match what the users
currently are asking for now in terms of
design that has that iconic Raven look
it's unmistakably a Silverstone rvz
enclosure but now they've made sure to
add some tempered glass elements before
it was all acrylic they are still not
finalized about the you know the
ventilation patterns are stuff but I
really like this kind of combination
between steel I'm really hoping that
they might change up the plastic
configuration so it doesn't look so
plastic II for example but one really
cool element about the front is because
of the interior layout they want to make
the front semi-transparent so you can
actually see your graphics cards which
is cool I appreciate that so everything
is revealed here and at the front we
don't normally see that and it would be
a cool unique element for the Raven
prototype alright so let's go inside and
the interior is actually quite
interesting and it's not final yet but
we'd love to hear your feedback so you
know let's get the air flow straight out
of the way which is what the Raven
series of cases have been known for two
massive 180 millimeter air penetrated
fans these have been updated so they
consume 60% of power of the original so
they're more efficient and they run at
higher rpm at 1500 rpm and they're they
just move massive air columns and that
is the perfect thing for the current
market I feel like people are
gravitating towards air cooling and this
is a really good opportunity for
Silverstone to like really latch onto
that target demographic because of CPU
towers are getting so good you don't
necessarily need to go towards an
all-in-one do it to get good performance
and GPU cooling is going to be you know
more important than ever with the latest
in the hottest graphics cards on the
market as you can see we have two
graphics cards installed right now it's
a
fool ATX layout you could install EI TX
because we have a little bit of spacing
in the bottom looks like GPU clearance
will not be an issue and you could
install it say some water cooling in the
bottom but that would be defeating the
purpose of what the Raven series is
known for now of course you can see
everything on the side the motherboard
has been expanded this is not
particularly something that I like
because I feel like this is kind of a
lot of negative space that could be just
minimized so you can have this beautiful
air column and that is what the case is
known for but the power supply has been
relocated to over here originally it was
somewhere in the front section so I'm
hoping they can rotate it and just
minimize the spacing but with this
configuration we have this rear fan
installation and side installation so
you could do you know a 240 rad on the
back or the side so that is kind of a
thing if you want to go with air cooling
and do custom loops and stuff but also
maybe they could install some hard drive
installation in this negative space but
let us know what you think about the
length of this enclosure I think
personally it's a bit too long for my
taste
I'd prefer something a little bit more
compact but people were complaining that
the RBZ of 4 was too compact so where is
that middle ground and because of this
whole 90 degree rotation for the
motherboard all of your i/o connections
for the GPU for the motherboard are
facing up and therefore have to be
routed through the top panel so I'm
hoping the top panel design is good it
you know it matches to what the Ravens
here is known for some angular panels
that is also modern but that also means
that you have to take into account how
you route all the stuff through the back
and given the massive length of the
enclosure I'm hoping that will not be an
issue and behind the motherboard tray
this is where the magic happens so right
now they are still unsure whether to
include a full tempered glass side panel
here to reveal all your motherboard area
but a good thing is they are modernizing
the you know cable management sections
so they will include low panels here and
there to hide all your cables which is
awesome I'm really excited to see what
their implementation of that will be but
maybe they'll include like a tempered
glass window over here which would be
again great and here plenty of space for
all your
cables dual SSD caddies and of course
these are also compatible with three and
a half inch drives so storage is not its
strong suit but the whole thing about
the Raven Series has always been airflow
and I think they're delivering on that
promise
exactly with this raven prototype now
the thing is that price so right now
there may be thinking around $200 so let
us know what you think about that maybe
by the time it rolls out it will be
competitive in this in a sense for
airflow maybe giving us the best cooling
performance for the CPU and the GPU
which will be its strong suit but then
yeah 200 bucks is still a lot of money
especially when there are a lot of good
options for that money alright guys so
that is the Raven prototype you know a
fun fact that my first ever review and
Haruka Knox was a raven silverstone rv0
3 so it brings back good memories and
its really good to see silverstone
upgrading their internal layout cable
management while still sticking to that
core formula with those air penetrators
and keeping up with that 90-degree
airflow column so yeah let us know what
you think about the raven prototype
thanks much for watching and we'll see
you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
