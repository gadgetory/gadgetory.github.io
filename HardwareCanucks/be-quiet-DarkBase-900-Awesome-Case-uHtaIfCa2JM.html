conducts right now we're be quiet booth
and they have a very interesting case a
new direction for be quiet I'm very
excited check it out let's talk about
that now
hardrock Canucks is at another fantastic
Computex show all thanks to Nvidia
fantex and cix and MSI so the new series
is the dark bass series I say it's a new
direction for be quiet because in the
past when the silent bass series it
seems like they were recycling a frame
that from already existing one but this
time it's a completely new direction
with a very unique interior layout the
exterior layout all feels like part of
the be quiet family which is awesome but
on the interior it's taking a modular
approach with the motherboard tray that
can be removed and rotated entirely so
you can have your system either on your
left or the right side with a more like
a standard layout or a rotated
motherboard layout the same thing can be
done with a hard drive cage it's all
removable with thumb screws and can be
installed on a different side of the
frame the drive cage comes with seven
caddies that you can move around so
that's awesome little modular aspects
there the support 3 in half and two and
a half inch drives it has full ATX
support we have fan filters to the front
at the bottom the top and plenty of
airflow as well for air flow we have
triple 140 and 120 mils at the front and
the top so you have plenty of water
cooling support the case is very large
so you can I would say it would be
targeted for water cooling and the fact
that you can rotate the motherboard
depending on the configuration that you
want to do I would say not so much for
the rotation on the motherboard itself
but if you want your system to be
showcased on the left or the right this
is awesome the side panels will be
coming in acrylic and tempered glass and
the the other side panel there because
they are reversible you'll be able to
switch them around you don't have to be
locked to certain configuration the dark
base 900 is a more of a premium line so
you're expecting to be 200 plus US
dollars for the MSRP and because this is
dark base 900 full Tower very large we
are expecting them to shrink down to
sound base let's say 600 or smaller for
micro ATX or maybe ITX in the future and
this is a very lovely modular approach
that we haven't seen in the past
especially with the motherboard tray I
like it so guys that concludes the story
of the overview of the new dark base 900
from be quiet do you like it I do can't
wait
get my hands on it and build a rotation
system and see how it stacks up for the
assembly process because for now the
actual frame looks actually pretty
awesome I'm a Dimitri with Huracan arcs
thanks so much for watching and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
