great technology selection and service
fitness trackers are they a temporary
fad or are they here to stay for active
individuals there's plenty of value in
monitoring your daily steps and
controlling the intensity of a workout
based on your heart rate it is an
enticing gadget but one that seems to do
only a few things right so let's see if
the new adidas miCoach fit smart is
worth a buy distinct sells for $150
which four step counter and a heart rate
sensor seems to be quite expensive but
adidas is selling us an entire fitness
ecosystem which you have to take into
the equation with the complimenting app
and a few other perks then the fit smart
may actually be a smart buy for
motivated individuals for starters the
design is simple albeit a little bulky
compared to something like the Fitbit
there are two colors available matte
black and this cloudy white it's super
light at 50 grams it's sweat proof and
water resistance the whole unit is
crafted in a soft touch of silicone
strap that's comfortable on the skin
without concentrating the heat there's a
17 by 11 LED grid matrix display built
into the strap with two main physical
navigation buttons on the right and a
main button below the display after a
few weeks of testing the black version
I noticed the whole unit started to lose
its visual appeal the strap attracts a
lot of dust and the outer coating starts
to wear off
which is disappointing considering the
target use of this device although we
are happy to say that clasp has
maintained a strong hold and has never
let us down the matrix display has an
excellent brightness range for
visibility outdoors but unfortunately
there are no sensors to detect hand
gestures to view the time so it's always
off until you press the main button
which cycles between the time the number
of steps taken number of calories burned
distance you want and finally it goes
back to the time now when you press
either of these site navigating buttons
when you're in the time phase you can
activate certain modes like run gym
heart rate monitoring pairing the fit
smart with your smart phone and check
the battery status for example when I
activate run mode the heart rate sensor
detects your heart rate when you start
running it takes a few minutes to get a
solid reading but when it does you have
to press the main button to cycle
through the time of your workout session
along with a real-time heart rate
reading the number of calories burned
the distance you traveled and even see
your pace and speed in this case miles
per hour you can end this session by
navigating to it and pressing the main
button which is the same procedure
inside the gym mode that offers a
countdown session between sets and
allows more convenient way to time your
workouts the heart rate sensor is
located beneath the display which powers
a few unique features that the fitness
individuals might find really helpful
first the LED strip on the left side is
color-coded based on your heart rate or
the intensity of your workout for
example if you want to achieve specific
steps calories burned heart rate target
or distance traveled you can create
those goals through the Fed smart app
and the unit will vibrate and display a
trophy upon achieving that goal to
remind you to step it up if you're
lagging behind it's one of those little
motivational features that will keep you
going the companion app adidas
recommends to use is train and run it's
available on iOS Android and Windows
Phone devices as long as it has
Bluetooth 4.0 I had some issues pairing
my Nexus 6p that required me to enable
location services on the phone to get it
up and running but recently a firmware
update addressed this issue which is
cool
once it's paired the fit smart will keep
in sync with the app transmitting over
the details of your progress and
receiving the details of any set
workouts that you want to do the app
greets you with the activity tab that
displays your current status until you
reach your goal when you tap on the
screen you can view the vee data and
compare how well you did through the
week you can also share your progress
and set your goals for steps calories
and distance and if you make any changes
to the goal it syncs automatically with
the fit smart the device section lets
you change the settings on your device
in this case we have the fit smart and
there are a few tutorials to help you
get started if you're new to this
ecosystem there's also a personal audio
coaching plan built inside the app if
you're interested in guidance and
overall the app is simple to use and I
appreciate that the built-in memory
inside the fits mark and store data of
up to ten workouts and if you're not
synced all of them an alert pop-up on
the display will let you know to sync
the device I was pleasantly satisfied
with a battery life it got me through
out the week with extensive views and it
charges we are the two pinpoints that
docks into the charging station which is
powered by USB I would recommend the
fixed Mart if you're training outdoors
since the device can properly track your
progress like steps calories and the
distance traveled and a real-time heart
rate monitor on your wrist is a pretty
nice feature it was an interesting
experience for me testing the fit smart
from adidas not only this lets you view
the time but it does a really good job
of guiding you through certain training
sessions with that unique colored LED
strip and quite an intuitive app we
found the step counter to be accurate
the heart rate sensor to work and the
fit to it is an expensive fitness gadget
but one that motivates you to set goals
and make sure you follow them well that
concludes our review of the adidas fit
smart let us know your thoughts on
whether a fitness activity tracker would
