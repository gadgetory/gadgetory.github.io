great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Huracan
oxen I've been waiting to do our
skylight system for way too long now
particularly because I wasn't sure which
case I'd want to use and also what our
upcoming changes in the workflow for our
video production I decided it was now
the time to do the skylight system
primarily as an editing PC so without
any further ado let's outline the parts
for our $3500 skylight system now with
every new build my two favorite parts is
first the blown out view of all the
parts that are individually aligned and
will be going inside the PC there's just
something awesome about that view and
also obviously the finished product but
more on that later
and so the core of this machine is the
gigabyte z170 XP sli motherboard it's a
very basic board with a dark color
scheme that works perfectly well here
there's triple PCI Express lanes that
are 3.0 the four Ram slots are occupied
by 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory from
Corsair these are low profile vengeance
modules and they're awesome for least
interference it offer incredible speeds
of 3200 megahertz
the board is equipped with amp audio
with cool orange strip which actually
might be an inspiration for the final
color choice of our skylight system for
the processor we're using the i7 6700 K
that I planned to overclock to at least
4.8 gigahertz because for rendering I
need to sort of compensate for the lost
two cores from my previous 3930k chip so
we'll see how that plays out but have no
fear check out how we've utilized the
parts for my previous
x79 system with a there's gonna be like
in description below and it's going to
be a complimentary workstation PC for my
new skylake system for cooling the CPU
I'm sticking with the kraken X 61 from
NZXT s by far my favorite CPU all-in-one
cooler it's quiet its powerful and
offers manual support through the desk
app plus it has RGB lighting that just
complements the entire build very well
for graphics I'm pretty much maxed out
here with two-way SLI on gtx 980ti
reference cards that will help in the
rendering department quite well with
CUDA support through the Adobe CC
application and also eat through any
game that I throw at it now for storage
we're really going full out with the
skylight system utilizing only
solid-state drives for this machine and
we're doing this because we'll have a
dedicated Nass with mechanical storage
outside of the case for backup and stuff
and the reasoning behind this is because
mechanical storage is not only loud and
hot but my previous x79 workstation
machine had six mechanical drives in
there and I think it's about time we
change that so OCC hooked us up with
triple vector 180 SSDs at 480 gigabytes
each that gives me enough space for any
ongoing projects that I'm working on and
the operating system plus the main Adobe
products will be installed onto the 400
gigabyte Intel 750 PCI Express nvme SSD
am particularly excited to this
combination because I will raid the SATA
drives and the speed of the intial drive
is already insanely fast so I shouldn't
need to wait on any loading anywhere to
color the interior of the build we have
the hue plus from NZXT that allows full
RGB selection from the desktop app and I
like that and one just to make sure that
this is the best PC that I've ever built
and to power everything we have an 850
watt power supply from be quiet as my
priorities aside from performance is
silence for this skylake machine and the
silent wings fan integrated here will
definitely do the trick and the final
piece is the case and we've chosen the
new fan Tex evolved ATX in silver now we
have reviewed this case originally in
white but the paint job covered all the
aluminum so what fantex has done now is
given us a beautiful sandblasted silver
aluminum exterior that looks absolutely
fantastic the whole build of this
enclosure is extremely solid and
actually for anyone interested in a new
ATX enclosure perhaps you're thinking of
an upgrade I would highly recommend the
new evolved ATX and so I initially build
a partial system to make sure everything
loads and there are no problems with
booting installed windows onto the intel
SSD and found a nice little tidy spot
for the hue plus right beside the power
supply that still grants me access to it
if needed without interfering with any
other component in the system then I
went ahead and populated the second
980ti after making sure the drivers were
installed as I did not want to
experience any issues with Windows 10
and really just wanted to jump straight
into benchmarking and editing on this PC
right away one of the OCC SSDs went on
to the front and I might need to figure
out a way to reroute the cables the
other way facing to the front of the
computer and this way my SSD is in the
correct orientation plus it would give
me a chance to hide these ketchup and
mustard cables and that is my only
current critique of this build so far
the ugly cables on this awesome power
supply just feel out of place and once
the color theme is decided I'm
definitely going to be getting proper
sleep extensions and the other two S's
these are on the back these are two
drives that will be set up in raid zero
and I'm going to seriously need to do
some work on cable management but that
will come in the later video but that
wraps up this part of the skylight
system upgrade make sure to be
subscribed to be notified when part two
comes out we'll be taking a look at the
finished interior of this system I'm
going to be making sure that it's the
sexiest system that I've ever built
we'll be taking a look at the benchmarks
and of course encoding scores just to
see if I am satisfied with the 6700 K to
be used as a main editing chip aside
from my secondary 3930k system that I'll
be using to complement rendering but if
you have any feedback on what I should
change or what I should do with the
system make sure to leave them in
comments down below I'm Dimitri with
Huracan arcs thank you guys so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
