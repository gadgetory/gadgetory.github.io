I'm here at aim the extravaganza here in
Markham this is the second event here in
this location this is their HQ
headquarters with their radio on gaming
series looks like we have a nice crowd
piling up as you can see it's turning
out to be quite successful there's a lot
of gamers here over organized by
overclock.net so a lot of gamers become
here to game for many many hours they'll
a lot a lot of partners as well they're
showcasing their newest latest
workstation cards from AMD which is
pretty cool but one thing that we
definitely noticed is this line event
has actually improved in terms of people
building their own pcs from last year so
we were here sorry not last year but two
years ago when this event was held here
and a lot of gamers that come here
actually have their own custom build
rigs a lot of work willing stuff that
the guy actually goes into them and many
many really awesome rigs now I think the
majority of cases that actually featured
here the land party would be from
Corsair coolermaster the NZXT phantom
line is very popular here today but one
thing we saw a bunch of into primo cases
which is pretty cool and switch 810
which seems to be very very popular but
let's go inside check out talk to some
of the AMD guys talk to some of the
overclock.net guys and some of the
partners that are actually here so guys
let's go and check out aimed
extravaganza we here at the 2014
extravaganza at AMD's headquarters at
home of AMD Radeon technology we're
having a great community event today
we've got some fantastic partners Tomic
community members here I think we've
seen over 700 people so far today
expecting quite a few more as a day
rolls on but we've opened our doors
today to really invite the gaming
community from the local area to come on
in get to know us a little bit better
and show off some of the great
partnerships we have throughout the
industry hi my name is mario and i'm
here at the AMD Radeon X travel ins and
there's about a hundred and fifty gamers
actually more but that's that's the
approximate number we've sold out it is
a land people bring in their computers
they're competing in tournaments in
three supper games League of Legends
dota 2 and counter-strike go we have the
matches streamed live
on twitchtv we have casters running
through it the big organizing force
behind this is overclock.net and it's
it's a community that's actually
celebrating its 10th anniversary very
shortly they've been hosting these types
of lands for a little over five years
and this may be I think the second time
at this venue it's really actually
fantastic time to get together if you're
into hardware at all there's just so
much going on you really get a chance to
to meet with other people the same set
show off your rigs we've had people just
going around literally just who's got
the worst video card and we just have
almost Santa Claus walking around that
video cards horrible here's a brand-new
one we're upgrading people we're giving
out raffles we're giving out prizes
getting a chance people to talk about
how they've worked their wigs how they
got their cooling all of that is here I
mean the event itself organized by
overclock.net and AMD is the the huge
sponsor with their ad online but there's
a lot of partners that are here there's
a whole spectator section and I've seen
I can just as I look away from the
camera I can see literally hundreds of
people and thousands that have cycled
through the event and there's a lot of
partner booths that are set up people
giving out free gifts and raffles and
all the rest of that it's a great chance
to kind of see what's out there and get
involved in maybe pick up some free swag
these type of events from overclock.net
odd they're their annual check out the
website check out was going to be coming
up next I don't have anything do now
specifically but this type of event is
going to happen again next year for sure
you can get a chance to buy yourself a
ticket or just come down as a spectator
and it's a fantastic show it's really
worth coming down for all right so the
event is starting to wind down all the
partners are almost about to leave
there's still a lot of public here and
they are getting all this swag but on
this side of the the event all the
hardcore gamers are still here they're
playing all the tournaments and since
we're not part of the tournament we're
actually gonna head out but this has
been a really fantastic time to spend
around with AMD Radeon team or the
public meeting the fans we actually met
quite a bit of fans and speak with all
the gamers and both their systems is
pretty cool as well hope you guys
enjoyed this coverage of AMD
extravaganza here in markham ontario
