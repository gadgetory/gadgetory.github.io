great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry and welcome back
to another Harbach next review
so Logitech is going through a bit of
rebranding at the moment with the
reintroduction of the G Series
peripherals it's not anything innovative
from Logitech but they're mainly giving
their products a facelift with some
aggressive marketing now we're going to
take a look at their latest gaming
headsets one which is the surround sound
and the other is just stereo so in this
video I'll be comparing both headsets so
let's dive right in the two products
you're looking at are the G 430 surround
sound headset and the g2 30 which is
stereo there's a $30 difference which
isn't much considering in theory you are
supposed to get more superior audio
gaming experience with the surround
sound specs wise the G 430 is equipped
with 40 millimeter drivers would stand
in frequency range with adequate
sensitivity of 90 DB and impedance of 32
ohms the stereo headphone the G 230 is
equipped with the same specs now here's
a bit of misleading packaging as the G
430 is an identical headset to the 230
but with a different color scheme the
surround sound actually comes through an
included USB sound card but I was
surprised not to find this bit of very
important information on packaging
except a very small subscript at the
bottom under the context of the box so
aesthetically this certainly looks like
a Logitech headset very much like the G
35 or the g930 it has a slight
renovation now with different ear cups
and no longer the rubberized coating on
the plastic
honestly the headset does not feel
sturdy and the ear cups on the 430 for
example were a lot more loose than on
the 230 even though it's the same
construction I wasn't comfortable
holding the headset by one ear cup as I
felt like it would snap at the rotating
joints they do fold however at 90
degrees inwards and have some slow-mo
the other way as well but this basically
allows the headset to remain on your
body very comfortably if you need to
take them off your head this is a very
needed feature for a gaming headset and
I'm happy of the execution the
microphone is flexible by they've
disabled the mute function when it's in
the upright position but we do have
Kable control so that's really not an
issue and this is a noise cancelling mic
so it does have the low frequency
roll-off which you can hear with
isolating levels and i am recording this
with the USB dongle and while it sounds
acceptable for gaming the roll-off is
quite annoying also when using the USB
sound card the mic input passes through
the headset meaning you can hear what
you're saying now I like this feature so
you can hear your voice level during
gaming but there's no option to disable
it unless you mute the mic the headset
connects through a standard 3.5
millimeter headphone and mic jack and
has a two point three meter braided
cable comfort wise these are height
adjustable they are plenty deep ear cups
so your ears don't make any contact with
the frame and the headband is very
comparable to memory foam and the light
body really makes wearing these for long
gaming sessions a complete breeze also
the questions allow your ears to breathe
which is so needed on any type of
headset especially for long gaming
sessions but my main complaint here is
the materials feels a little harsh kind
of like the inside of your bathing suit
and I think this was a poor choice from
Logitech I mean just take a listen in
this comparison to appropriate your
cushions versus the G 230
now luckily they are removable and I
wish lodge that would release optional
software ear cushions so your ears don't
hate you now given these are the same
headset with a difference in the
concealed USB dongle for the G 430 I
went ahead with audio testing using my
own sound card and of course the
included one so the only quality for the
headset in stereo mode is very much
impressive for the price I honestly was
not expecting these things to deliver
but the 40mm drivers are quite good with
a more forward base and recessed trouble
but still very predominant and not drown
down mid-tones which is a very good
audio signature for gaming which
emphasize on explosions and gunfire why
all the chatter is present but not
dominating the base here is a tab to
high but impressively deep and non
distortive also because the highs are
slightly recessed the headset isn't as
crisp as what I'm used to but still very
enjoyable for music playback when it
came to gaming I jumped around csgo
played some crisis and bf3 and the warm
audio signature delivered to my
expectations for appropriate detail of
footsteps and overhead bullets while
blowing off parts of a house with very
controlled and slightly rumbling bass
was satisfying soundstage was alright
for a closed headphone but the ear
cushions do allow slight audio leaks so
gaming at 100 percent volume won't wake
up your neighbours but it might irritate
your girlfriend just a little so put it
on the G 430 with the bundled USB card I
was utterly disappointed as it lacks
amplification as I wanted to crank up
the volume and all of a sudden the audio
became very muddy and lost clarity plus
very noticeable but quiet hiss was
coming from the USB card turning on the
virtual surround sound in the software
it does help with improved soundstage
that slightly improves directionality
but the bottom line is the included USB
card is very poor and does not do
justice to the 40-minute drivers now I
gotta give it to Logitech for their G
software which is very intuitive and
allows customization of bass and treble
and turn on the virtual surround sound
and of course adjust the level of each
of the virtual channels but really
there's no reason to spend $30.00 on the
G 430 for the USB bundle as a very
affordable and powerful sound cards
exist which are with highly
and also we can't avoid a big elephant
in the room with one-sided audio issues
and Google Chrome using any USB headset
from Logitech because the latest flash
is incompatible and causes bass and
channel issues I'm doing a very quick
google search and you will stumble upon
many user issues without appropriate
response from Logitech so we are going
to conclude with our usual pros and cons
list and what the headset is quite light
and allows your ears to breathe we have
on cable volume and mic mute controls
swivel ear pads that allow the headset
rest comfortably on your neck and a very
pleasant audio signature given you run
them through a decent sound card however
I'm not a fan of the build quality they
just don't have that sturdy feel the ear
cushions while allow your ears to
breathe a very harsh and I don't think
having this washable material is in any
way practical and lastly the surround
sound USB is completely not worth it
while simulating a more open audio
environment with added virtual channels
quality is much degraded with poor
amplification and hiss so really my main
audio complaint here is the sound card
as the headset itself has potential for
both music and gaming as long as you're
driving them with a proper sound card
and also don't forget the misleading
packaging on the G 430 they really
should include the picture or some
indication that the surround sound is
simulated through a USB dongle and not
through the headset itself so why do you
guys think logically committed this
information from packaging we'd like to
hear your opinions as always thanks for
watching leave comments down below and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
