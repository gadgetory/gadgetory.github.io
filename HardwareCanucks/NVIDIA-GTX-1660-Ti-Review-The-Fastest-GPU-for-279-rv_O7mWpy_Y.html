major launch in the graphics card realm
it seems like the last few months have
been filled with these I mean honestly
guys it started with the arc TX a series
back in October and then it later on
continued with a Indies launch of the
arcs 590 and then the Iranian seven and
now it's invidious turn again but in a
very different way that people are
expecting so these are examples of the
gtx 1616 TI yep gtx 1000 series is
making a comeback and I'm super stoked
about that
now what exactly it's a gtx 1660 TI well
I'm gonna make this explanation as
simple as possible before getting into
the performance results in short what
NVIDIA has done is taking the touring
architecture from the RT X cards and cut
out both the tensor and RT partitions
what we're left with is what's called a
tu 1 1 6 which is GPU core without any
r-tx features so forget about running
things like DL SS or ray-tracing
however it uses the brand new touring
architecture with a 12 nanometer
manufacturing process so shady
performance is loads better than a gtx
1060 for example the cool thing here is
that along with the turing architecture
enhancements the gtx 1660 TI also gets
its enhanced n VNC encoder and NV dec
decoder capabilities that's a pretty big
deal for streamers the reason for the
lack of r-tx features on the 16 60 TI
brings us back to what Dimitri said when
he was testing out battlefield 5 right
now ray tracing and other AI operations
take a ton of resources even with the
tensor and RT course helping out and
that means lower end graphics cards
would be able to offer a good gameplay
experience and guess what that'll cause
some of invidious key technologies to be
only available for people who are
willing to spend a big chunk of money on
these expensive RTX GPUs and I wonder
how that'll affect RTS game development
probably not that well now for my specs
and pricing standpoint the GTX 1660 Ti
sits right in between the GTX 1066
gigabyte and the RT X 2060 it'll start
up $280 and as 1536 CUDA cores and 6
gigabytes of 12 gigabits per sec
GDD our sex memory operating over 192
bit memory bus it'll start at $280 which
happens to be $30 more than what this
1060 launched but it's $70 less than the
lowest-priced r-tx 2060s
do note that nvidia won't have a
Founders Edition on this one though as
for clock speeds the reference boards
will have a booth speed of 17 70
megahertz the EVGA gtx 660ti XE Black
Edition that I have over here hits those
reference speeds and also invidious 280
L our starting price we actually saw its
boost frequency hit 18 80 megahertz
pretty regularly though the MSI gaming X
version is a different beast on the
other hand it comes pre overclocked and
with a pretty hefty 310 price tag but
it's levelled out around 1950 megahertz
in most games so expect a few FPS
improvement the problem might be its
price since $310 puts msi really close
to lower priced RT x 2060 cards but
don't forget the 2060s boot speeds are
only around 1700 megahertz so it'll be
interesting to see how closely MSI 1660
I can get speaking of the msi card I
actually like its looks a lot more than
EVGA s honestly I don't know what EVGA
was even thinking with this triple of
slot design the gtx 660ti is supposed to
be an efficient card which would make it
perfect for ITX cases and while most of
those can handle a card as long as the
gaming X the triple slot ebj monster
could face some serious mounting and
ventilation issues I also like the
stealth black and grey finish on the MSI
card and the best part is that it comes
with a backplate that looks absolutely
gorgeous and you know this would fit in
perfectly for a completely stealth
lookin build that doesn't really you
know pop out that well and I appreciate
that
now the ironic thing here is that when
testing both of these cards they both
hit a constant temperature of 64 C under
load but the single EVGA fan needed to
spin at faster speeds and that resulted
in louder acoustic performance while
it's trying to push enough air through
the ultra thick heatsink now jumping
into power consumption before the rest
of the benchmarks these cards are really
efficient even though they operate at
higher speeds and have a lot more course
than the GTX 1060 alright guys so it's
time for the rest of benchmark results
I'm going to use the same over
7900 X test system as usual and if any
of these pass by too quickly feel free
to pause as you can see the gtx 660ti is
a pretty interesting card especially
against the RX 590 remember even though
that you can find at rx 594 around $260
it was launched only a few months ago
for $280 right now it looks like the
$280 EVGA card is a much better value
overall than what AMD is offering most
of the time it actually hangs right in
with a bag of 56 against the Nvidia
cards the gtx 660ti looks pretty good
too it's easily 25 to 40 percent faster
than the GTX 1060 but make sure you keep
in mind that the card starts at $200 so
if you're looking to save a few bucks
that could be a good route to actually
if you want to draw a parallel the dt x
1660 TI performs a lot like a slightly
overclocked - gtx 1070 but it does fall
behind a bit at 1440p due to its smaller
memory footprint the most interesting
thing here about these results is how
closely the pre overclocked MSI gaming X
gets to the RT X 2060 founders Edition
especially when you've lower 1% of frame
rates are compared sure there are times
when the Arctic's 2060 is able to pull
way ahead and the 16 60 TI doesn't
really have any Arctic's features the
only problem with the gaming X is its
price it only offers 3 to 5% more
performance than EVGA card but it costs
$30 more personally I don't think that's
worth it but I don't really like the
EVGA design either I'd rather find a 16
60 TI that goes for round 2 earned $80
and offers a cleaner double slot cooler

below well guys that about wraps things
up and I have to say that the gtx 660ti
is a pretty exciting card provided you
can find one at $280 but it also raises
a huge number of questions
Nvidia has been beating their r-tx jump
for months now so to suddenly see a card
without it feels a bit weird not only
that but based on what we've been told
RTX features won't be available on any
card that they launch for under $300 so
that's basically a huge percentage of
their customers that won't be running a
compatible GPU now since ray tracing and
some AI is just a lot harder to run
I completely understand why Nvidia is
doing this but convincing developers to
build r-tx enable games might have just
become a lot harder but ignoring RT acts
and taking the gtx 660ti for what it is
i'm pretty impressed with a bit of
overclocking you can get very close to
RT x 2060 performance for about $70 less
sure the 2060 does provide a bit more
consistent performance across every
title especially at 1440p but it's now
become really hard to recommend the gtx
660ti is just hard to beat and it
actually makes the arcs 590 completely
overpriced now just watch out for the
MSI gaming X because it is very
expensive
and for what you're getting the gain is
just very minimal so that pretty much
wraps up the gtx 660ti performance
review I hope you guys enjoyed this one
let me know what you guys think about
the performance results and whether or
not if you would be considering or
recommending a card like the 1660 TI to
a friend of yours who's looking to hire
in a build system within a particular
budget considering that it costs or it
starts at two hundred eighty eighty
dollars two hundred eighty dollars yeah
