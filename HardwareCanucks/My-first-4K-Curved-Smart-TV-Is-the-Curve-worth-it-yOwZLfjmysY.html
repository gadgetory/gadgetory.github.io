great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dmitry with Huracan
axe and I gotta admit that I'm a little
late into this whole uhd or consumer 4k
game primarily because content is still
lagging behind to support these high
resolutions how our Netflix now start to
stream in 4k and our own shift towards
4k videos lets me admire the true nature
of 1 to 1 pixel playback so TV that
we've got here is a samsung this is
serious 8 model number you 155 you H
8700 this is a 55 inch class Smart TV
that's curved with native resolution of
3840 by 2160 so UHD and technically not
4k with 1080p 3d support and this is
exactly where high resolution is needed
because online content is slowly
starting to catch up to our UHD needs
but hook this up to an HTTP C and put
driving content in your own hands but
before getting to the HT PC side of
things let's do a physical tour now it's
really impressive how far we've come
with the growth of these units in size
while making sure they still look
gorgeous the chrome metallic exterior
shell adds a bit of elegance the
incredibly tiny bezels the sides and the
top are 11 millimeters in width that's
insane Jack that's thinner than my
desktop monitor for cereal the white and
just as gorgeous bass support follows
the concave nature of the panel with the
aluminum and plastic build that extends
all the way to the back and is super
easy to attach plus has built-in cable
management whoo
lastly I was very happy to find no
gigantic branding anywhere on the TV
aside from the really small Samsung text
at the bottom right above the power LED
that I must say is right in line with
the whole gorgeous team VI o area the
back is plenty fruitful with three USB
ports that can be used to run media off
a USB stick plug in your peripherals so
keyboard a mouse and also manually
upgrade the firmware
moving down we have one connect port for
optional Samsung one connect box for UHD
content digital audio output for your
speaker system a total of four H
my connections and antenna in at the
bottom further in there's your component
and AV in one a V and two right beside
it and Ethernet port auto Wi-Fi is built
in IR out for extending or expanding
devices for the Smart Remote a
three-and-a-half millimeter audio output
and finally the X link used by TV
specialists to get inside the TV for
maintenance multiple vents at the back
allow for cooling and here you also
notice that TV is wall mountable thus
the location of all the ports on side
the power plug is on the left side with
a joystick like control and on switch on
the right the speakers are at the bottom
with excellent stereo projection for a
small sized room moving a music playback
proved satisfactory the Smart TV comes
with a smart remote this economically
pleasing and compact device has a mic
for voice commands capacitive
recognition for Mouse like navigation on
screen that works wonderful plus all the
needed controls to interact with all the
smart features of the TV and now to
address the elephant in the room does
the curve actually make sense here my
thoughts on why it does and will touch
up on why it doesn't in just a moment
so first aesthetically the curve adds
that beautiful cosmetic element that for
even larger TVs would look stellar
second the curve somewhat helps to
smooth out reflections the way light
bounces out of a concave surface tends
to stretch out the light this is great
for reflections of objects in the
distance however put on a bright shirt
stay six feet away and that could make
for some hilarious looking but annoying
distractions also one test that I did is
to see how the coating would interact
with bright sources of light like an
iPhone flashlight that created
unbearable crosshair like reflections
while doing the same test on my desktop
monitor really smoothed out the harsh
light third for dead on center viewing
you get to experience just marginally
more immersive display because of the
way the sides stretch out for this
bowtie effect and the visual viewing
experience for this 55 inch form factor
is outstanding although at this size the
curve is really not necessary and now on
to why the curve might not make sense to
you well first the price be prepared to
pay
Premium over the flat non curved
variation of exact same model second
viewing location is important as
off-center and angled viewing
orientation squishes the image on the
side closest to you while the farthest
corner curves to reveal the extra image
overall you get some Distortion and this
is especially visible with vertical
lines on the screen with regards to
color contrast and image quality there
are many configurable parameters to suit
your needs along with dynamic contrast
UHD dimming and RGB flexibility to fine
tune color accuracy white balance can be
calibrated in two or ten sections on the
screen
I found the contrast really striking in
the colors to pop with decent panel
uniformity without noticeable brightness
or temperature variance throughout the
panel also there's about three ways to
adjust the blacks alone so you can
really fine-tune if you want the deepest
blacks you can get for some reason the
gaming mode was buried under general
settings but that greatly reduces input
lag and I use the TV for shield gaming
in console mode so I can play some
casual Android gaming and the 1080p
image coming from the shield was up
scaled without artifacts also with the
recent announcement of the new Nvidia
shield Android console
capable of driving UHD resolution so
this will become an appropriate platform
to accompany your 4k TV I also hooked up
my recently built HTPC inside this
beautiful end case m1 chassis make sure
to check out our view of it with the GTX
970 to power some fun titles at 4k and
you can see the amount of detail there
is on screen that's absolutely
incredible trying to really looks
gorgeous although the major deal-breaker
here was running the native resolution
of 3840 by 2160 is the 30 Hertz maximum
on the smart TV watching content is fine
because movies are running at 24 frames
anyway but this is not your
multi-purpose UHD experience I ended up
running 1080p on the HTPC to get that
fluid 60 Hertz and with that said the
experience from the Smart TV itself was
just alright entering the Smart Hub lets
you play some extremely boring in
limited games the app selection is
limited but with YouTube Netflix Skype
VEVO Twitter and Facebook you can get
started plus many on-demand movie apps
although none with 4k delivery I really
enjoy the UHD YouTube experience
browsing is still a bit Clumber some
unless you connect the keyboard but the
image is gorgeous and fluid and also
Netflix in 4k was pretty amazing as long
as your network supports it this is
media consumption done right how are the
lack of a 60 Hertz at 3840 by 2160
really killed it for me as otherwise
it's an outstanding panel to connect to
your consoles as it would be upscaling
that 1080p image as long as game mode is
enabled input lag should not be a
concern now I was disappointed with a
Smart Hub sort of the laggy performance
the limited selection of apps the remote
is great so you can navigate that easily
but also then find any inclusion of any
4k content to showcase the beauty of
this resolution aside from the UHD zoo
that looped a few pictures which was
yeah the speaker's to me were impressive
although my living room is very tiny so
the projection is fine however many
users have expressed their discontent
with weak audio projection for larger
environments and lastly the curve and is
it worth it well despite all the
immersive marketing I would have to say
stick to a flat panel in this size I'll
save you some cash and really the only
advantage of the curve I found are
distorted reflections of distant light
sources but let us know what you think
of the curve and if you are rocking a
similar setup or a 4k TV that you use
with your HTPC and other consoles
perhaps share your setup and how you use
this ability on a daily basis so this
has been my first you HD or 4k TV
experience I'm really looking forward to
trying out the curved desktop monitors
specifically 21 by 9 to boost that
productivity and gain the extra real
estate for when I do my edits so if you
have any suggestions for a panel like
that leave them down in a comment below
but that concludes this video we hope
you enjoyed I thank you so much for
watching
