happy oh yeah nice alright people so
this is the new NZXT H 700 I and 60
doesn't release that many cases and they
go through a bit of revisions on their
previous cases in terms of color
selection like the hyper beast series or
the other eSports related stuff but this
my friends I'm very excited about this
one yeah so the H 700 I is first of its
kind smart case and that it will reduce
the speed of the fans in order to
control the noise level of the case
itself making your system so we haven't
seen anything on that on the case
integration in the past and I'm
wondering if it will stick
Wow
huh but is it fried approved let's check
it out right after this the Graham
spectrum keyboard by Tesoro comes with a
new mechanical agile switch with low
profile key caps with super fast
response and shorter actuation distance
plus all the customization included with
RGB lighting and macros for a premium
user as usual as with any tempo glass
side panel the first thing comes the
peel satisfying what else is satisfying
are the looks I think this one the
best-looking in 60 cases has put out in
the while they managed to make this boxy
frame look truly unique with angular
ventilation around the perimeter and the
glass panel that does not protrude
outside in the frame for the price of a
hundred and ninety-nine dollars you do
get that premium looking case that feels
the part with an all-metal exterior and
this is not your average interior layout
that improves on their previous designs
with regards to cable management and
water cooling and I'm really excited to
see what people can do with the age 709
and they're also many versions available
to like micro ATX and the Mini ITX form
factors so the size options cover the
full spectrum the gloss panel mount is
standard for thumb screws let's see what
happens once all of them are removed is
the panel gonna fly out or it's just
gonna okay so yeah it has a nice bottom
lip on which the glass panel sits so a
little bit of safety always appreciated
I really like how this rear panel opens
with a simple push of a pin on the rear
and it pops out like that you just have
to be careful to actually catch the
panel otherwise they'll just simply call
out and I would say this is one of the
few cases that has attention to detail
to back up its high price like the
purple USB 3.0 ports although it's sad
not to see type C port it's a 20-17
released after all there is a mini
pocket the rear of the chassis as well
that can be used to wind up cables and
it's awesome to see a functional
miniature version of the puck inside the
NZXT chassis I do like the circular mesh
on the exterior to mix up the shape
texture and finally we have seriously
the best cable management work out of
the fact
that I appreciate plus the integration
of multiple channeling routes to get
those smaller cables organized and there
are four fans included in the system
already with a control hub that requires
power so it's really nice surprise to
avoid frustration once you begin the
assembly because everything is pre
routed for you already and the only
thing I'm disappointed to not see are
any cable tie hoops on this rear side of
the white bracket I know it's meant to
be for reservoir but it'd be nice to
route my 24 pin cable and have it
secured anywhere along the height of
this white bracket so it doesn't move
around when you know it's exiting on to
the other side on there's also built in
case lighting in the proper top position
to avoid the harshness of those LEDs
plus an additional four pin extension
that you can connect your own lighting
to and we'd also talked about attention
to detail look at the bottom fan and
look at the sticker and so the
orientation does not match the other two
fans come on in txt now the one thing I
don't understand is why the NZXT puck is
not included with the H 700 I it's
included on the s3 for the elite and the
surface material over here because it's
all-metal accommodates the puck
perfectly so you can hang your
headphones and I do this on my case all
the time so the puck would have been a
perfect default edition with H 700 I now
with the case being fully closed at the
front and the top I think many are
concerned about the airflow given how
the age of 40 didn't do that great with
cooling so the front panel is pretty
thin and has over an inch of clearance
from the fans so they won't be choking
up the dust filter is also part of the
equation it's magnetic and easily
removable and there are three 120mm fans
that are high airflow type and not the
high-pressure type and the same thing
can be found in the rear but this one is
140 millimeter we have maximum of 70
millimetres of clearance from the fans
to the white bracket or about 65
millimetres to the hard drive cage but
that is on Rails and can be moved
without causing power supply issues and
also I don't know why we have such a
large range in terms of where you can
position the hard drive away from the
front panel because you know positioning
it just maybe one centimeter away from
its default position would make all the
clearance for the front
and because you can't mount anything
beyond the frame itself so I don't know
why you'd want to position the hard
drive all the way closer to the power
supply area but I'm guessing the option
is there the top fan bracket is finally
standalone so you can remove it and
install fans or radiators outside of the
frame and then simply lower that from
the top my 280 millimeter EK radiator
fits no problem and you can go up to 360
rad in here as well do note that fans
can be installed above this frame but I
wouldn't recommend it because there's no
air with a top panel installed I really
do appreciate this innovative new way of
mounting SSD hardware so this simple
bracket that does not require any screws
and because of this perforation on the
power supply shroud you can literally
mount this bracket anywhere you want so
if you want a little bit closer to or
like you know closer to this cutout that
has a possiblity my friend simply push
on the slope pin and pop them out and
then reposition boom the same applies to
the side one is you can see the little
mounting holes over here the only thing
is that there's no direct cutout right
beside it so you have to mount things
behind this white bracket now the one
thing I'm actually concerned about is
this bracket and say you mount a 360
radiator in the front which you can do
there's plenty of room but what if your
tubing is coming out from the top and
you know we have this big thick white
piece over here so will it complicate
things for what our coolers if you are
doing anything at the front I mean you
can't possibly get the tubing's from the
bottom unless you're doing hard tubing
and doing like 90 degree bends all over
the place but you know I understand that
this is spaced out to allow a 360
radiator or something mounted to be at
the top but I'm wondering if this will
be complicating things for the front
instead so based off my initial
impressions I think the H 700 I will be
in popular case not among just water
cooling enthusiasts but somebody who
wants that very nice and simple boxy
look with this modernization that is
attached to it and I'm glad that NZXT is
go
to that direction and has continued to
go the directions to their entire case
portfolio has that nice cohesion factor
something that not many case
manufacturers do these days all right so
I think NZXT have done a really good job
with the h7 100 I introducing some
innovative features like the perforation
on the power supply shroud to maneuver
your SSD caddy and the integration of
those chemo management have plastic
channels on the rear to really just help
you out so that you get in you route all
your cables nothing is poking out and
it's all there to help you with the
assembly process so the next thing for
me would be to populate a system in here
and play around with that whole smart
functionality of the cam software
controlling the fans situation and based
on temperatures and noise levels of
course so stay tuned for that video
until then let me know what you think of
the H 700 I in the comments below make
