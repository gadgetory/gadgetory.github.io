knocks welcome to another installment of
behind the scenes so how we shoot our
videos behind me I'm filming the street
on f12 C computer case it's a beautiful
aluminum chassis and today's episode is
all about lighting and what you can do
with lighting and other lighting
emitting objects to you make your scene
make your atmosphere but more pleasing
if it's more warm a bit more welcoming
if that's the type of look you're going
for so as usual I am filming with five
light sources now notice I have three
lights I my orange light to add a bit of
edge light that there's a different
color temperature than my softboxes that
their daylight bulbs one is shooting
right into the ceiling but then I have
this other life that shines directly on
the objects that I'm filming which adds
that extra edge light from this side so
I have this blue light and this orange
life from both sides creating this
really cool warm atmosphere my third
light sorry my fourth light is the
outside of course I'm using ambient
lighting here so that fills in the room
as well and my monitor don't
underestimate that using creativity to
add color and atmosphere to your scene
for example so this is the picture that
I use because it has beautiful warm
light when it's out of focus it creates
this beautiful type of atmosphere so you
can see in the background of this
particular shot without the monitor
would just be completely black and I
position the camera and the object so
that I have a bit of extra ambience you
know if there was nothing behind the
object it would be boring these are the
five elements that I definitely
recommend having sort of an ambient
light that is delivered by the softbox
by the outside light and the two extra
lights
such as the simple IKEA lamp and
obviously a different softbox that
shines directly on the object creates a
really unique looking scene that isn't
anything super special but it makes this
shot a lot more interesting than
if the monitor or any of the other
lighting elements weren't there and so
here's a tip for how I usually film I
usually try to film in their linear
format what that means is I try to
capture shots as they happen and not
later going back them because sometimes
you can forget that unless you're taking
notes and saying okay these are the
shots that I still have to take so me
filming it in your linear format means
while I'm opening up the case I'm
opening up I'll reposition the camera I
think another angle I get all the micro
shots while I do the procedure of
actually going inside an object for
example Shasti like this one and this
helps me to edit easier later on because
when I do storyboarding inside premiere
I know that everything is pretty much
after another all the shots were already
pretty much aligned in form of how they
should go obviously I do b-roll and
extra footage and extra things that I
would fit in and fill in the gaps later
but if you do shoot a nonlinear format
it helps a lot with the processing work
and so I would definitely recommend try
and please plan ahead and seeing the
Edit inside your head and how you format
everything and how you position
everything doesn't make job easier
post-processing
and also while
all right so here's another tip for
using lighting to your advantage so
right now I have my light turned off and
let the camera focus so you can see with
exactly what type of shot I'm trying to
capture tsuki I'm trying to just show
that this is the little nut that gets
screwed on over here but it's a very
cold shot and I'm trying to go for kind
of warm effect so notice what happens
when I turn my my side light on so this
is kind of shooting onto the side not
directly onto the object but you can
already tell there's some extra elements
that have appeared inside the shot and I
will overlay them inside the video so
you can see but we have this tiny bit
out of focus elements appeared in the
bottom that create this really warm nice
effect where notice what happens when I
turn my keep my side light off so it's a
very cold and very warm shot with these
unique out-of-focus elements all right
one of the critical tips that I can give
you for setting up your shot in terms of
lighting is exposure exposure is an
extremely critical element and making
sure that your filming style is unique
it stands out because I see so many
youtubers overexposed as in the
highlights are completely blown out and
usually on the edges of things that
where the object is blown out it makes
it look you know a little bit not pro
and so if you want your footage to stand
out make sure to not over expose the
highlights don't blow them out and
instead use lighting in your advantage
use different angles to make sure that
for example if you window all in one
corner and that's completely blown out
you can reposition the camera so that
the window is not visible and therefore
everything is exposed in your scene
correctly so make sure to don't over
expose for the highlights don't
completely expose for the shadows
because sometimes shadows don't have to
be in full detail you know you can have
completely black shadows you can crush
them later but highlights are very
difficult to correct for unless you're
shooting raw
so highlights don't over expose and one
tip I could give you move on to the
camera are zebras if your camera support
zebras make sure to enable them in my
case I enabled the zebra to stay on for
90% of overexposed elements so here I
can bring down my X my ISO but as you
can see there's still some zebras going
on so I can bring up my aperture just
tiny bit so that I can still so I don't
get those overexposed elements around
the object as otherwise that would not
be fine as color correcting for all of
exposed elements is very difficult now
since this episode is mainly about
lighting let me show you the settings
that I used on my camera now if you want
to find out more about my camera gear
and my entire setup make sure to check
out the previous video so I'm shooting
the gh4 but right now check out the
settings so I'm shooting at 1.8 majority
of the time which gives me the
best-looking bokeh so out of the focus
elements end up the field without it
being in - out of focus or too creamy
sometimes I stop it down - all the way
to one point - because the speed booster
or actually sometimes I just shoot at
2.8 and my aperture and then my shutter
speed is always at 1-over 80th which
means that any time there's motion and
the scene so if I'm doing pants or
anything like that
the this is allows me to make sure that
everything in the shop remains sharp so
I keep it 1 1 / EDF for 1 over 100
if the shop is stationary and if I need
that extra stop of light if I don't want
to change my aperture and my ISO always
remains that one at 200 ISO just because
the gh4 is not that great in low light
and me stopping it all the way - you
know something higher it basically never
goes above 800 and that becomes really
really noisy especially at 4k so I keep
it at 200 and I use my aperture and my
shutter speed to adjust based on a
lighting scenario and because I have the
lighting in my studio I don't really
need to pump the ISO higher and
some you know in a specific special
environment or so but this is it
aperture @f 1.8 and char speed and one
over eighty s one of the things about
the viewing cases still is that I have a
reference system that I put it inside
all cases that is pretty much an
identical system but that means I have
to disassemble it from the previous case
review
but this particular example I have only
one softbox firing off on this type of
corner not really directing directly out
the object which is this case here but
slightly off it's so that I get this
sort of edge light then you can actually
see it here and it's a good
representation of what the gh4 will
finally show like and I don't have the
shots on screen so you can see what I'm
talking about in terms of separating the
object that is lit up by a different
type of source of light in terms of
color temperature and my ambien orange
light that is precious positioned right
behind there so thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this behind
the scenes episode on lighting a little
tips and tricks on how I know in
particular example setting up lighting
for this object behind me but these
techniques apply to pretty much anything
in terms of trying to separate your
object from the background using
multiple sources of light using anything
that is in your possession to help you
achieve a little bit different look so
using your monitor for example pulling
up some colorful image on there and when
it's out of focus it looks beautiful
having different sources of light in
terms of color temperature and obviously
if you can't control the intensity of
the light and all these elements that
would add to you having the ability to
control the entire scene to your liking
perfectly but it is in my case as it
turns out dark right now I was able to
populate the background with beautiful
orange warm lighting and I have having
the softbox to give the object the edge
lights to sort of finish my shot and
finish off with this curfew so if you
