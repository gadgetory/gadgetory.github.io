great technology selection and service
virtual reality is slowly starting to
infiltrate the mainstream market and we
now can enjoy really good VR experiences
on mobile and that's really exciting yep
VR headsets are popping up everywhere to
tease us of what is the potential for
virtual reality on mobile with some
really good applications for both
education and entertainment but the main
question I ask are we ready for virtual
reality on mobile and to help answer
that question noon VR sent us their
headset so we can experience the
direction of smartphone virtual reality
and I gotta say that it is a promising
path but not without its challenges so
what this headset does is focus your
eyes on a smartphone with the use of
lenses because it's just so close to
your eyes your eyes cannot naturally
focus this close and any VR app on the
phone will display both left and right
frames side by side and use the
gyroscope inside your smartphone to
control the head movement now one of the
major appeals of the new VR headset is
smartphone compatibility as it will
support any iOS or Android smartphone
between 4.7 inches to 5.7 inches behind
the protective cover we find a flexible
band that firmly holds the smartphone to
the body and installing the u1 plus -
you can see the small clips on either
side that will prevent the phone from
sliding out furthermore these rotation
clips at the bottom help to determine
the right fit for your smartphone and
overall the mounting system is great but
with the protective cover on you have no
access to any of the buttons or ports
and that's unfortunate the design here
is basic with a glossy protective cover
and white frame for the main body
there's nothing particularly exciting
about the design and it would definitely
need further revisions for a slimmer and
lighter structure what we need to see
from a VR headset like this is module
design that allows compact form factors
you can easily take this on the road
with you as otherwise in this state it
is bulky and not travel friendly also
general improvement in the comfort
department is needed highly needed as
the
surrounding the frame just doesn't hold
up for comfortable long-term use
despite the light frame design of just
230 grams for the headset itself and
when on the main point of weakness is
around the nose area not only do we have
smaller padding here but the cutout on
the frame is just too small and causes
pressure to accumulate on my nose which
was such a disappointment because
rearranging the fit to get rid of the
pressure on the nose created all types
of different uncomfortable pressure
points around the face so a new frame
design is needed for this to welcome the
mainstream user now comfort level aside
there is plenty of ventilation all
around to get rid of any heat
concentration which is great but the
cutouts inside actually introduce a bit
of light leak which in bright
environments can be distracting I'm
happy to report the lenses are sharp
with wide viewing angles but keep in
mind due to internal frame size
limitations the Noon VR headset is not
compatible with glasses the focus dial
is available at the top to nail sharp
image quality and throughout my few
weeks of testing I've never experienced
any eye fatigue my only concern with the
lenses is dust buildup that even after
unboxing and cleaning the lenses myself
I can still see dust particles inside
the lens this doesn't affect image
quality yet but I am worried about dust
buildup in the long term so now onto the
experience with the accompanying new and
VR app that is a good platform with
great VR navigation controls like
tapping once to Center the image or
double tapping to access the menu and
various image options plus also ability
to control the volume but the
availability of content is lacking and
all the recommended demos through the
app are user created and it's just so
disappointing not to have an awesome VR
demo out of the box but luckily I've
gone through pretty much all the VR apps
from the Play Store and there are some
amazing experiences available through
the vers app that has fantastic VR
creations with outstanding quality and
also some other apps that
like you experience rollercoaster and
the simple zombie or starship shooters
now quality of the VR image is
determined by a smartphone as I've said
before the lenses are excellent but on
my 1080p oneplus 2 pixels are visible
and there is latency in motion but for a
slight movement it's okay and those few
demos that I've tried
I always contempt with the resolution
and also keep in mind to have your phone
scratch free at the front as otherwise
it will be visible those scratches
because the lenses focused your eyes on
the screen which is literally less than
an inch from your face and so to come
back to the question if we are ready for
mobile VR and I would say that the
mainstream demos are certainly appealing
but quality VR content is just so
limited to a few select demos that this
initial $90 investment into the noon VR
headset may not pay off in the one to
two hours of VR playback so the headset
needs to be modular to become travel
friendly and the mainframe design should
be reconsidered for this to be an
appealing product for the mainstream so
now if you've experienced virtual
reality through your phone make sure to
leave your thoughts and experiences down
in the comment section below I'd love to
read them and I would love to for you
guys to share all that is available all
the knowledge so for anybody who's
willing to pick up a VR headset that
they can go in ahead and find that
killer app so they could know what VR at
the moment on the mobile is like I'm
