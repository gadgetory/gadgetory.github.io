great technology selection and service
welcome to the part 2 of our skylake
editing PC build if you want to get
caught up part 1 is linked in the
description below and in the I but in
this episode we'll be taking a look at
the fully finished system I'll give you
the rendering match marks compared to my
6 core workstation machine and also show
you how this beast of a machine handles
gaming but first comes the case the fan
Tech's evolved ATX delivers a fantastic
building experience once again and the
fact that the entire exterior are strong
aluminum panels just adds so much
premium to the build and while the
illuminated strip in the front is not
RGB you can replace the bulb with
different included colors but I'm
sticking with this ambient white which
I'm happy with the side panel is
slightly tinted but with the lighting
installed inside it will highlight the
hardware beautifully which is all
cleaned up and yes in the future I will
be adding cable mount sleeved cables in
orange and black to complement my final
color theme which is not purple by the
way although it does look really unique
with the combination of green and
aluminum but instead I will be lighting
the interior with dark orange to
complement the illuminated audio strip
on the motherboard the hue plus lighting
is placed right beside the power supply
which is not visible through the window
and the ambient glow is firing down so
it's not creating any unwanted lights
I've connected both strips one running
along the back and top sides which are
highlights the fan and the GPUs while
another one running at the bottom in
front of the case highlighting the SSD
and illuminating the rest of the
hardware from the front and because the
radiator fans are in white they kind of
pick up the illuminated color which
looks really awesome and I would stick
to purple as it does look very unique
with the silver exterior but
it's just a little bit too harsh from my
setup so this warm orange lighting is
what will remain for the future but
enough about the lights cable management
is next so my idea here is to make sure
that I know what cable is what and give
me access to any of the cables at
whatever time when needed so it's just
good enough so it's not a rat nest and
given plenty of space in front of the
power supply and on the side of the
power supply the side panel closes just
fine without any force hardware
configuration is next and my 6700 K is
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz now I did
want to push it to 4.8 but because it's
right next to me I needed to preserve
some of the silence and the 4.6 acre
Hertz mark is that nice balance for
performance temperatures which by the
way idle around 30 degrees Celsius and
low 60s at full load while keeping the
Machine pretty quiet
the RAM is clocked at 3200 megahertz
which is pretty insane but I'm not
exactly sure what benefit of faster Ram
is on render times the front vector 180
SSD is my cache drive delivering very
nice speeds while the two more on the
back I set up in raid 0 and this is the
primary drives to host all the footage
and projects files would double the
speed for read and writes the Intel 750
SSD is my system drive that houses my
games and Adobe applications with insane
read and write performance and I'm happy
that all my mechanical storage is out of
my workflow the graphics cards are
actually very quiet being referenced and
blower style design but at 120 Hertz for
my dual monitor setup the idle
temperatures are not ideal with 68
degrees Celsius for the top card and 45
degrees Celsius for the bottom card so
now in terms of rendering performance
utilizing Adobe Media encoder for a
five-minute 4k video file it took 7
minutes and 30 seconds on the skylake
machine versus 8 minutes and 10 seconds
on the 6 core machine with a 3930k
clocked at 4.2 gigahertz and doubled in
memory capacity so I was surprised to
see a faster render output with this new
machine next running Cinebench
gave us a score of 974 on the skylake
system versus 983 on the x79 workstation
so performance wise I actually have not
lost a significant amount of performance
moving to a fork or chip versus a
6-quart chip now gaming is a total
breeze with dual 980ti cards and they
well overclocked CPU giving me
outstanding numbers on any game and the
highest settings and lastly you just
gotta have a case companion I've chosen
this nice little plant to put on top of
the case which complements the whole sky
like video have very well so I hope you
guys enjoy this very fun project I'm
surprised at how well this 4 core
machine handles video editing which is
nicely complemented by fast storage and
plenty of graphics force power now I
will be doing more extensive testing on
whether SLI is actually needed for adobe
applications and testing out cuda versus
open CL acceleration inside Adobe Media
encoder so stay tuned for that video I'm
Dimitri with Harbor Canucks make sure to
go skylake on that like button and we
have a very cool AMD system coming to
your sub box very soon so make sure to
subscribe and we'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
