the most popular MMO mics on the market
these days and for good reason it has an
abundance of programmable buttons a high
level of customization a great sensor
and it's well-designed shape makes it a
very competitive Mouse for its segment
back when evil reviewed the original
scimitar RGB in early 2016 he had
largely positive conclusions about it
for MMO gamers with the main gripe being
the closely packed side buttons which
took some getting used to
now a little over a year later Corsair
is refreshing the Scimitar RGB with a
scimitar pro on the exterior it looks
identical but it had some changes under
the hood is that enough to keep it
relevant in 2017 or has Corsair played
things a little bit too safe let's find
out but first a message from a sponsor
the z9 neo buys almond brings all the
right features on a budget with a large
window type panel 5 included fans and
the excellent interior layout with super
simple cable management get us now link
in the description below the Scimitar
pro hasn't changed much although some
may argue that's a good thing it keeps
the same familiar shape making for a
fairly large Mouse which features a
massive 12 button grid on the side and a
rubber grip dressed on the right for
support you've got the true satisfying
primary clicks and an excellent scroll
wheel although none of this is a
surprise coming from Corsair the price
unfortunately is not the same you can
pick up the Scimitar RGB for 60 USD
however the Scimitar pro is going to
come in closer to $80 on release and
that price hike may be hard to justify
for many the big draw of the scimitar is
the macro pad on the mouth of side
featuring 12 mechanical buttons as with
the scimitar RGB the side buttons can be
moved horizontally with a hex screw at
the bottom to allow the fine-tuning to
your hand
the second and fourth row are textured
for easy distinction and each key is
fully programmable through a cue
software now this all sounds great and
we'll dive into the use case of its
mouth later but what has changed between
the Scimitar RGB and a scimitar Pro in
short a sensor upgrade the Scimitar
already had the esteemed a vulgar 80s 13
eighty-eight the sensor used in the
Sabre RGB and the Death Adder but the
crow use the pmw 3367 a variant of the
33 sixty one of the best sensors on the
market it's an upgrade but considering
how the 39 88 is already a very good
sensor in real-world result I can't feel
the difference between the 39 88 and the
30 360 sure having a high 16 K dpi and a
spiffy sensor might look good on paper
but in the real world it's a
disappointing upgrade for supposedly
professional Mouse especially when
you're paying a decent amount more for
it because it's not like the Scimitar
RGB was perfect and these problems still
carry over to the Scimitar pro it's
still a heavy Mouse at 147 grams pretty
much ruling out any hardcore FPS gamers
or those who prefer life and mice the
side buttons are still close together
and sometimes hard to distinguish and
really the lack of innovation and a mine
of refresh with a slightly higher price
tag is a bit disappointing for me
although the nature of the refresh might
be a letdown the mouse still is very
versatile for its intended market
courses q software is extremely powerful
with full customization for 4 zone RGB
lighting as well as for all the other
features you've come to expect from
Corsair software suite you have liftoff
adjustment surface calibration dpi
adjustment from 100 to 16,000 dpi in 1
dpi increments as well as the ability to
bind macros custom text media controls
and much more - all of the buttons on
the mouse the extra side buttons have
obvious use in MMOs where you need to
have many different abilities available
on a moment's notice so having large
amounts of macros are useful however for
people who don't play MMOs finding use
for these buttons is much harder in csgo
I found a couple of main uses the first
is switching weapons and selecting
grenades while it works
I found that keyboard vines are almost
always quicker fines for buying weapons
at the start of the rounds is also
another use but it's not time sensitive
enough that you can't use the keyboard I
think the most use these buttons would
get in CS is for spamming chat more
quickly than ever so if you're thinking
about this Mouse primarily for FPS
gaming don't
the high-waist and the keypad just
aren't worth it
however this is a very versatile Mouse
if you're doing 50% MMO gaming and 50%
FPS the sensor is excellent in both the
pro and the RGB variant and the shape is
still nice
so for casual csgo it's more than
satisfactory and when you jump into your
MMO games you have all those extra
buttons the verdict on the Scimitar pro
is this as they pro refresh it's a
disappointing upgrade with only a minor
sense of sidestep
however it is still a worthy all-rounder
Mouse
bringing the features for hardcore MMO
gamers as well as pretty much any other
genres like however unless you get a
great deal on the Scimitar Pro I would
say that just save your money and get
the almost identical scimitar RGB so
