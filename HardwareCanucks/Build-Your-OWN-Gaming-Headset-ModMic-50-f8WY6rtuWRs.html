for duty
hey brother just b300 microphone here
rattle down youtube mod my 4.0 here I'm
clearly disappear your microphone with
better flexibility what happened maybe
maybe he's using one of us okay I'm back
now with a little upgrade the mod mic
5.0 is here find out why I'm sticking
with this as my gaming setup right after
this cool master master keys keyboards
lineup is now available and three sizes
to fit within your space with large
medium and small boards with either
beautiful RGB or pure white LED
illumination a little something for
everyone
make it yours with the master keys Pro
by Cooler Master so what's up guys I'm
Dimitri the Harlequin accent the mod
likes 5.0 is going to be replacing the
4.0 for me now and I think I've
completed the ultimate gaming audio is
set up with the HD 800 s and the mod
Mike's 5.0 now so I'm getting fantastic
microphone quality and learn the best
audio quality of the market too but
first to recap and mod mike is a high
quality low profile microphone solution
that you can attach to your favorite
pair of headphones and this solution has
been very popular among users who don't
like the gaming headset direction where
let's say the microphone is
non-removable or the aesthetics simply
restrict the use of this pair outside of
the house and so the mod likes v sells
for $69 which for a standalone mic to
attach to your headphones may seem steep
where you can pick up a full head set
like the HyperX cloud around that same
price range and maybe a quality full
package for a little bit more like the
GSP 300 headset with a very good
microphone now in comparison to a $50
mod like 4.0 the price premium is
actually pretty fair because you get two
built-in mic capsules on the 5 unlike
where you have to choose between
omnidirectional or unidirectional mod
mic score for now so you get this easy
switch toggle on the on the microphone
capsule itself the wires have been
Kevlar reinforced so they're stronger
and more premium the boom pole is now
much stiffer and doesn't Bend as easily
so you can just bend it once and it will
not move from that position ever unless
you change it again
but the magnetic clasp is now what it is
backwards compatible but it's now with a
much stronger magnet
and that means that if you accidently
pull not cable the microphone will not
pop out or rotate something that
happened a lot more often on the weaker
magnet on a 4.0 but I have been really
on offense from switching from my trusty
Game one headset from Sennheiser I love
this implementation with single one
cable that runs from the headset in to
behind my computer so that I don't have
to worry about cable management whereas
with this implementation you know it's
not comfortable because I have to route
the HD 800 into the amp and then when I
was using the mod like 4.0 that was
routed obviously via separate cable into
the microphone jack on my motherboard so
the cable management situations wasn't
ideal which is why I kind of you know
say about 60% of time prefer something
of a gaming headset nature because I
don't have to deal with cable management
and this is where the FIFO no really
comes into the equation and they've
improved on many aspects pretty much
with every aspect of the microphone body
and the mod in the microphone name
actually makes sense now because you
have everything that's modular about the
microphone including the inline mute
controls the cable that you can remove
for a longer cable and so they've
removed the common point of failure from
the 4.0 which was the cable itself and
they've reinforced everything about the
5.0 so that this is the strongest
microphone they've ever produced and so
the QL management implementation here is
pretty awesome
with 10 cuts included so you can combine
the little clip with a slightly thicker
clip on the headphone plus we have a 2
meter braided cable wrap so you can
seamlessly combine the headphone and the
microphone cable into one and just keep
in mind it does add a little bit of
extra weight but the benefit of no
dangling wires is a major one for this
cleaner setup in the package we also get
a prep pad to clean the surface of the
headphone plus two magnetic base class
which i've applied to both my headphones
and can interchangeably use the
microphone on either of them and
everything fits into this a nice small
carry pouch what you've been hearing so
far now has been recorded with the 5.0
is going into the zoom h5 so this is the
best representation of the quality that
you will hear and while we're here I
will also switch to unidirectional Mike
from capsule because the extra price
premium that you get with this so not
only do you get improved everything
about the cabling situation but you also
get two microphone capsules so you can
have using unidirectional which is like
a noise cancelling capsule or an
omnidirectional which captures
everything around you it's a slightly
better quality alright so now we're a
unidirectional mode which means that
it's not picking up anything or not as
much from this side of the microphone
because the capsules there's two
capsules facing this way omnidirectional
captures everything here where you need
direction avoids this area of the
microphone that captures everything
that's just in front of your mouth it is
a bit quieter so that's something to
keep in mind because you might
potentially have to boost it in your
computer motherboard so that the
microphone isn't super quiet all right
we're back the omnidirectional so you
can hear the audio levels are much
louder but it's also a bit cleaner out
same not as nasally because the
omnidirectional thing there's a bit of
noise cancellation happening and I like
the omnidirectional better but keep in
mind it will be picking up a lot of
background noise so now I'd like for you
to listen to the comparison between the
modern i-5 and other headsets
microphones that I have in the studio I
think the more like five is by far the
cleanest most natural sounding would
nice pick up on the lower end as well so
right now I'm a unidirectional mode it's
not picking up as much of the background
noise but it's not as clear anymore the
base is kind of diminished and this is
the exact same sound as on the mod mic
four and this is right now the mod like
4.0 with the unidirectional capsule
applied it sounds identical to the
unidirectional capsule on the mountain
like five because they all use the
exactly the same microphone capsules
everything just on the mic on the mod
like five is just upgraded physically so
what you listening to now is the Game
one headset the microphone here is very
sensitive so I have to actually keep my
voice sort of leveled and not really
speak up because it will peak and what
I'm trying to do with this microphone
test is because I'm recording everything
into the zoom h5 I am NOT adjusting the
gain sensitivity on the microphone so
it's all levels equal
so you can hear on the differences
between house and set of each microphone
is and by far the least sensitive
microphone here in this collection would
be the GSP 300 but this one has a lot
more bass that's very Bumi I love this
microphone the game one had said it's a
$250 microphone but it sounds very
comparable to the $70 or the
omnidirectional capsule with just amount
of detail and clarity and the the
lower-end pick up on the voice is very
good on this pair and this is the last
microphone in this sample and collection
this is a GSP 300 it's a $100 headset so
there's a bit of a nice balance between
microphone quality and audio quality but
still it does not sound it doesn't even
approach the levels of the
omnidirectional microphone clarity and
pick up of the mod mic 5 or the mode mic
4.0 and so yeah you do pre a premium to
have the option to attach a low profile
microphone on to your favorite pair of
headphones and that is exactly where the
mode mic comes into play oh hey there NC
XCOM is Canada's leading etrailer for
anything your mind desires just keep
within those categories which are plenty
and be attempted by the weekly deals
visit ncx dot-com for all them sweet
deals so thank you so much for hearing
and watching this video let me know what
you think of the microphone quality much
since majority of this video has been
recorded with a 5.0 I will still be
keeping me 4.0 on this headphone because
I still need a microphone for this
particular environment and setting while
the HD 800 will be my premium most most
premium gaming setup ever Jesus HD 800
for gaming most people also going to be
probably wondering why I placed a magnet
on my HD 800 so close to the drivers I
hope that's not an issue actually if we
do have any audio engineers let me know
this is a bad idea
placing you know magnetized piece when
you clasp for the microphone because I
just don't want to ruin anything on this
pair so thanks for watching I'm
appreciated however canucks we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
