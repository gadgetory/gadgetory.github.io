never expect to be this blown away by a
really cool concept showcase at Razer no
no the crazy triple display laptop but
project Arianna that expands your visual
gameplay onto the wall and the
surroundings around that wall for an
insane atmosphere the show coverage is
possible thanks to Nvidia gigabyte
fantex and NCIX
so interestingly back in 2013 we saw
something similar from Microsoft with
their alumi room that went after the
exact same concept by projecting
gameplay outside of the monitor as a
concept project Arianna is more refined
especially with the integration of Razer
chroma that has a better illumination
consistency like the fully integrated
peripherals and of course philips hue
bulbs that work well with it basically
the projector has a fisheye lens and a
few other senses to detect the wall and
other objects around the wall and the
monitor too to properly structure the
projection around the gameplay so what
you get on the monitor is just standard
gameplay but the arianna projector
expands that field of view without
affecting the center portion for a
really awesome gaming projection and so
in theory all games with the field of
view adjustment should be compatible as
the arianna projection is a softer
overlay that covers a wider field of
view in-game resulting in the strangely
unique immersion that is an awesome
addition for the first-person shooters
for that extra layer of visuals and this
combined with all other chroma elements
and might be difficult to step away from
your gaming wall this Shadow Warrior 2
presentation was super awesome to see
something that might become more common
as a gaming accessories down the line
but you know what this is Razer so who
knows if this projector will actually
become a consumer product but we sure
hope to see it get finished so let us
know of gaming on the wall like this is
cool or is it too gimmicky for you but
seeing it in person in that dedicated
gaming room with all other lights was a
very exciting presentation of actually
good innovation for a gaming accessory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
