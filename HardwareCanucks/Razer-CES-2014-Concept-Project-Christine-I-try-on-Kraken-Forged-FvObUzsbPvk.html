brought to you by and say XCOM
technology connect guys this is the
Razer Kraken forged addition we
mentioned them in our dgs show in the
past and we were slightly critical about
what they were kind of going for because
razor was claiming these to be the best
build headphone in the world and based
on their previous accusations on their
previous crack and headphones naming
them are claiming they're the best but
the most comfortable gaming headset the
world was a bit of an overstatement and
I just want to check out and try them on
feel they can take a listen and get the
feel of quality and I have to say that
I'm impressed with that what has what
razor has gone here I mean this is it
truly sort of a masterpiece in terms of
engineering for build quality full metal
construction really excellent ear cups
very soft that also fold and a lot of
the time when you see a foldable
headphone or headset it the joint just
feel very cheaper very plastic it almost
feels like it's going to wear out in a
couple of months time so six months time
but I'm i have to say i have to take
what I take back in terms of what they
claim to be one of the best were built
headphones in the world because it could
potentially be that now that's a
different story when it comes to quality
of audio razor is still there there they
are evolving I have to give them that
but they are still emphasizing heavily
on the base there there
still emphasize too much on the base for
that basehead sure you hear the powerful
gunfire and explosions going to rumble
almost inside your head but it's all
about that right so about the mid the
mid-range the clarity the detail the
fidelity and so that's one of the things
that I would love to see raising improve
but it's getting us something this
that's this well-built is one step
closer to getting us that awesome audio
quality as gamers as myself would prefer
so this is the razer kraken fourth
edition like I said earlier razor I am
impressed hopefully we'll see some
improved tonal frequencies though ok
guys so listen up so guys thanks for
watching our CES coverage here and razor
booth and now it's gonna be something
very surprising everybody's been
covering it here comes project christine
okay guys so we are here at the razor
booth and probably one of the most
innovative things you hear on that CES
2014 is right behind me or onto the side
of me this is project christine from
razor they're really going towards the
new innovation the new evolution of how
the pc industry how modularity of the pc
components play in our everyday life
when we are looking at something like
this like a desktop so razor what
they've done is really pushed towards
that very innovative way to interact
with your components to be able to swap
out the hard drive to be able to swap
out your graphics card your power supply
and it is innovative in a way that all
these components are going to be water
cooled with mineral oil and that's one
of the best and most effective ways to
cool in that category now the innovative
things about this is obviously the
appeal of this razor machine this is
absolutely nothing like we've seen
before in the past the the concept of a
pc of a desktop is already a modular
system right you're able to go in and
you can be able to swap out the hard
drive able to swap out the graphics card
and anything else that is internally
that's inside of it that's capable
that's accessible to you and razor has
gone ahead and revamp the entire idea
into something more more more elegant
and including touchscreen including this
amazing awesome looks like magnesium
alloy body that's what it looks like to
me put could perhaps be aluminum of
course this is a prototype and there's
no more information that i can give you
because this is just a prototype they're
pushing towards that innovation they're
pushing towards that next idea of
modular pc and i have to say like it of
course we are critical and harbor
canucks based on razor because you know
they do claim their their products are
running the best in the world and of
course there is competition that could
be potentially considered better but i
have to you know take off my hat to a
razor because this project christine
hopefully in 2015 is going to be reality
for well for in production and for
available for us to purchase so guys
