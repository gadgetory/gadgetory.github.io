expanding their very popular half lineup
to welcome a new true mid-tower to the
family the half nine one two is an
enthusiast oriented case that is not
only smaller in stature but also in
price now with that said cooler master
has not stiffed on the development they
have taken some of the features that
make the rest of the series so great and
just put it into a smaller package with
a few tweaks the half nine one two will
debut for only $59.99 with the future
possibility for an advanced model for
consumers on a budget or those who just
want great performance in a reasonably
sized package this could be the case for
you
let's take a look quick glimpse at the
dimensions it is right in line with most
mid towers and it has full ATX support
it is the smallest of the half series of
cases the front panel keeps the same
industrial look is the half X and while
it's definitely not plain it isn't
really an invasive style either the
front i/o ports are very simple USB
audio and power and reset switches and
the 911 2 does have an optional three
and a half inch external drive bay with
proper cover a peek behind the front
panel and all of the intake areas are
fully covered with dust filters
including the drive bays users will be
able to install either 220 millimeter
fans or a single large 200 millimeter
fan at the front the top exhaust points
are much the same either a larger 200
millimeter fan or dual 120 millimeter
fans the case also has specific support
for mounting a 240 millimeter radiator
internally or externally on the side
panel we have the classic half style and
logo as well as a 120mm or 140mm fan
intake port that won't interfere with
any CPU cooler jumping to the back 120
millimeter exhaust fan io area three
tubing holes seven expansion card slots
plus one vertically positioned and a
bottom mounted power supply
and so we move into the interior down at
the bottom of the case there's a fan
filter underneath the power supply which
sits on rubber feet also Coolermaster
has included a specific 2.5 inch SSD Bay
that supports two drives and can
actually be removed if you want to
install a longer power supply there are
two three and a half inch drive bays at
the bottom and four more in the
removable rack removable you say yes the
middle section actually slides out which
you can then leave empty will reposition
the cage so your drives will sit
parallel with the case at the back the
120ml exhaust fan an appropriately large
CPU backplate opening should be good for
any motherboard and plenty of cable
management spacing all around the
outside of the motherboard tray there
are four five and a quarter inch drive
bays but only one has the tooless
adapter I knew kind of missed the
traditional Coolermaster button system
and I don't exactly know why they only
left one in behind you will see there is
plenty of room to work with
the drive bays have been pushed in and
the motherboard tray actually sits on
studs to push it away from the back
panel leaving about three quarters of an
inch to work with and so the best part
comes when we finally get to install our
system into the half nine one two most
cases in this category are pretty awful
there's very little room the layout is
basic and frustrating and the material
is so cheap and so flimsy that you often
come away with a few extra battle wounds
this case is a break from all of that
installation is easy there is a
surprisingly large amount of space
corners are rounded and overall
construction is very solid it just
really doesn't seem like something you
could ever get for $60 a quick glance at
the accessories the usual screws along
with an SSD bracket and drive bay
adapter also a change to hard drive
rails instead of the usual sleds now
you'd think with a smaller Tower there
would be some difficulty with larger
hardware but not a problem here a quick
test of the rather bulky cooler master
v6 GT CPU cooler proved there is plenty
of room for larger aftermarket heat
sinks as far as video cards go the case
supports everything including the
AMD Radeon 5970 though you will have to
lose the hard drive cage the 5870
however will fit with the cage installed
and that wraps it up the more I used the
half nine one two the more it became
apparent what a great deal coolermaster
is offering to consumers a lot of this
stuff may seem pretty basic for a case
but rarely do you see it at this price
and even then there is some a lot more
expensive that still don't get it like
the rest of the half family the 911 too
has great airflow potential with lots of
fan options and it cleans up nicely with
cabling it's even gonna work great if
you want to get serious with water
cooling you can fit pretty much any
hardware in here and the case itself
does look pretty good
but for some it just may not be your
style that's it that's the cooler master
half nine one two it is one damn good
value case thanks for watching this
