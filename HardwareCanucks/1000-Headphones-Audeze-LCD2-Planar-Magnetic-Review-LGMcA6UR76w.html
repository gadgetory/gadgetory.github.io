great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is dimitri with
hydro conducts and today we'll take a
look at the very unique headphone this
is definitely not for the mass market
and really targeted towards audio
enthusiasts who can appreciate the
attention to detail of the headphone and
also the different drivers used inside
the adazi LCD - revision - this is a
premium quality product and paying over
$1000 for headphone may seem absurd to
many but stay tuned to find out exactly
what you're getting and whether or not
the LCD 2 can deliver to that higher
than your mortgage convinced yourself
these are worth it type of investment so
let's get started our first thing to
cover is this outstanding carrying case
this is military-grade to withstand
impact damage corrosion with an
extremely durable shell it's waterproof
its gasketed airtight and a specialized
automatic valve is there also to
equalize the pressure if you change
altitudes it's built with confidence to
protect your investment because that's
what it is
the LCD tubes are well fitted inside
with padding all around and it's totally
inexperienced with opening the case from
the very beginning to reveal the
gorgeous looking headphone that you
can't wait to try out but let's be
patient and just observe the bamboo
composite finish on the outside combined
with aluminum pieces an incredibly soft
lambskin leather that gives off the
leather scent as soon as you open the
box these also come in rosewood and
micro suede combinations so there's some
flexibility for preference upon your
order adazi sure doesn't disappoint
though in the first impressions and it
seems like a lot of detail went into the
design of the headphone from the small
cutouts on the bamboo to allow air cup
swivel the subtle text on each ear cuff
displaying the model number and the
driver technology used inside the LCD -
because that's what they're showing off
here and the incredibly accurate and
laser-cut grille with an a integrated
for brand recognition and this just
screams quality with its retro yet
luxury
appeal the headphone is large and heavy
at almost 500 grams so this is not
intended for travel but instead you know
if you are sitting listening home
sessions that also may be a factor due
to its high price you don't want to be
taking these out on the subway for
example the cable connects on each side
that's labeled for left and right these
are mini XLR inputs and the cable is two
and a half meters long and soft with a
full-sized headphone jack and also
included is an adapter for three and a
half million outputs and also included
as a cleaning kit for the bamboo so you
can maintain your headphone and pristine
condition and you can also get leather
cleaning kit as well the headband is
also wide enough and it's padded with
the same soft lambskin leather with
several pockets and of course LCD to is
size adjustable with these yoke rods and
ear cups have plenty of articulation for
a perfect fit on every individual now
notice the cushions are angled and this
is done on purpose to recreate the
appropriate sounding position that of
what you would hear from a set of
speakers in front of you and putting
these on another point for sitting
headphones as there are over ear and
they are large they're very comfortable
tall wants appropriately put on and lots
of head movement and these things come
sliding down there you can see I
initially thought the weight might be a
problem as most of it is concentrated on
the ear cups but to my surprise the
combination of thick padding and a
really nice headband and just the right
amount of clamping force and that could
easily wear these for hours you
certainly know they're on your head
they're not seamless in any way I like
some of the Sun hyzer headphones but I
never experienced any 15 years nor
discomfort on top of the head also I'm
happy that the cable doesn't recreate
any handling noise so any bumps along
the cable are not audible something that
most headphones experience this being a
purely resistive headphone with 70 ohms
impedance the planar magnetic drivers
are regarded to deliver the most
accurate song and signature as the
unique form of the driver gets rid of
any unwanted vibrations at high
frequencies compared to the traditional
voice coil drivers found in dynamic
headphones and most of the plane the
magnetic diaphragm surface is used to
allow greater a cure
to the input signal and also low
distortion and now on to my listening
tests I use JD's labs Oh two plus Oh doc
and from Doc combo that immediately put
a smile on my face as the LCD to
particularly with the lambskin leather
produced an outstanding bass response
that's extremely tight and deep with the
opening sub bass and young and beautiful
sounding so dominant and so defined
something I haven't experienced yet
until the LCD 2 was the actual air
movement listening to angel as the base
extension throughout the song is very
impressive for an open-style design and
this is where the plane and magnetic
drivers show keys the potential in the
low end region songs like Back to Black
and bang bang have a new meaning to me
because of this I really love my
collection of progressive rock with time
the delivered incredible instrument
separation with such detailed mid-range
it was wonderful and where I prefer a
more brighter sound without energy and
pop the higher end region on the LCD too
was very well controlled without
distortion and in no way fatiguing after
hours of listening
my ears were not ringing and compared to
the HD 800 from Sennheiser there is less
siblings however found out to be
actually great fit for vocals but
without sounding too warm or too muddy
although I do prefer the more energetic
and brighter extension on the HD 800 for
some genres the female vocals in night
call had a lot more depth than the HD
650s that sounded thin in comparison and
the LCD twos fat response delivers to
that fool like sound with a great mid
bass that complements the entire
mid-range there is also a well-defined
soundstage that's not too wide where I
can feel the closeness of the vocals in
all my love and the size of the
recording space as well but it's not as
open as neither the HT 650s nor the HD
800 that deliver a more open sound stage
but I do find that this gives LCD to
character with unique sound signature as
the vocals are more up front and so my
entire experience with the adazi LCD 2
has been unique as I love the gorgeous
and
ocular design with what you would expect
for an over $1000 build quality there's
still some customization in terms of
micro suede or lambskin for your ear
cuffs and the headband and bamboo or
rosewood for the enclosure
they included military-grade carrying
case is a must to protect your
investment the plane and magnetic
drivers are really the stars of the show
here with very capable clean and tight
base extension incredible detail in the
mid range and they're really well tuned
high-end it's not as bright as I'd like
but nothing EQ can't solve so from a
sonic perspective the adazi lc2 are
really a masterpiece combined with great
comfort despite the heavy weight as a
thicker padding on the revision 2 sold
for those previous complaints now there
isn't much to complain here price is not
really gone if you do go into this price
bracket or this class of headphones as
you do get what you pay for and they
almost actually feel a little bit like a
closed headphone with a combination of
leather padding and not so large
soundstage that actually might be
exactly what you're looking for
so the adazi LC 2 is one fine and you'd
be happy to own one type of headphone
that deserves the Damned with the word
here at Harbour Canucks but we would
love to know what you think of this type
of investment is this type of class of
headphone for you leave a comment down
