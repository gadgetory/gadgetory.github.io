booth here at computex 2013 one of the
cool additions is the prodigy em now it
takes the same concept and it looks very
much like the prodigy because it
basically is it slightly larger version
and the M stands for micro ATX now we
know that the major issues with the
prodigy the original prodigy was that it
was only a mini ITX case so a lot of
people wanted that microwaves capability
and so that's exactly what we have here
this is the back let's start from the
front what's cool thing about this is
that it has a micro ATX support now the
motherboard is installed in the back
train instead of in its on its
horizontal position in terms of airflow
options included fans aren't known yet
but let's first take a lot of the
what-what thin options are available so
dual want 120mm fans for exhaust at the
top we have also a bottom intake fan can
support 182 30 or dual 120 millimetres
at the bottom so pretty good options for
airflow coming sort of going through the
entire case again we also have an
exhaust 120 a month 40 we have power
supply that attaches sitting like this
all the wires going out in the back
let's check out the back what we have
for cable management one cool thing is i
like is that there's plenty of space for
any of any of your cables so power
supply will be sticking out here all the
cables are going to be routed this way
the 8-pin cable will have to be routed
slightly tighter through some of these
holes because the motherboard is rotated
so your 8 pin is actually here at the
bottom as you can see like this so one
cool thing about this case is that your
graphics card is going to be positioned
at the top so you can utilize the
additional fans which i'll be at the top
to cool the graphics card pretty good at
the front we have mesh front cover so we
are not sure yet but there may be a fan
options available for the front and be
nice to have that sort of air flow as
well in there as well it has a built-in
dust filter same thing for the top which
is the top cover easily removable for to
clean all your fans and again keeping up
with the same design as the prodigy
has these same handles which are
flexible so a you know absorbs
vibrations and very sturdy looking case
from beat Phoenix now it comes to the
storage options we have three hard
drives that can be installed at the
bottom of the case so they're attached
actually instead of the fans here so you
are losing out on the bottom intake if
you are looking to put hard drives in
there but we can also install three SSDs
two of which will be installed on the
side panel which has been kept from the
original prodigy but also another one
can be installed in the back of the
motherboard right here also one more 3.5
inch drive can be installed this way so
with all your cabling sort of sticking
out here so overall pretty decent
storage options for the prodigy m and so
a last thing is the dust filter for the
for the bottom intake there we go it is
magnetic very nicely just attaches to
the bottom of course it will be rendered
useless if you are using the the bottom
space to store your hard drives now
let's go check out some of other things
that they introduce it here at computex
2013 so continuing with beat Phoenix
they've just announced these new
headphones / headset this is the flow so
beat Phoenix they actually very flexible
is impressive but beat Phoenix known as
the sort of the case manufacturer giving
us a lot of cases why did they choose
why did you guys decide to head into the
headset direction we've gotten a lot of
requests for headphones from because
we've done a lot of cases and now people
are saying oh you're pretty good for a
gaming company well we're not really a
gaming company but you know we can
actually start doing something for the
gaming community because you know
there's a lot of gaming headphones out
there and there needs to be a little bit
of difference
right so one thing they're very flexible
you have different color varieties so
you guys are known to that for prodigy a
lot of a lot of colors that's what
you're going for here the actual finish
on the plastic bits has the Big Finish
soft edge coating actually feels very
comfortable to the to the hand the
headset itself is very light now talk
about with the sound quality and sort of
what's the use right right so we work
with a sound vendor now a lot of
headphones they have very deep bass for
your games explosions gun sounds but
once you take it off and play music on
it it sounds very distorted and what we
approached with this is you can still
have a base from the games and you can
still listen to music with a natural
with a more natural sound call it right
it looks like you can also connect the
microphone over here because it's a
headset / headphone so this is a black
iphone mike but each color will have
their own color coordinated headphone
microphone okay this is like a boom mic
and you got lady gaga
of course this is your favorite color
right my favorite color you know you
should check out my facebook profile
picture yeah also the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack is actually removable
very cool thing I do like to see that
just in case because the cables do get
tend to wear out over time so a very
good thing to replace them yes and we've
got sound and motion that covered the
sound part now the motion part this part
actually connect to the back of your pc
and then we've got this part which sits
on your desk and whenever you need to
leave the house because you want to go
out and listen to your music you just
disconnect this and this stays on the
headphone and yeah very portable right
so what's the expected release price and
when there they'll be available in
canada we're still finalizing the price
and release date will be sometime in
August alright this has been Jackie Lee
from meet fittings new headset the flow
will be available in August August so
thanks guys for watching stay tuned for
more complex coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
