in terms of action items as a question
should be media have a response to
mantle and I think that's unequivocally
they should know it would be I think a
horrible mistake if some reason some how
the video got panicked by this it made
some lower level nvidia API you know you
already have very little level access
through the GPU extensions that nvidia
is always rolled out of anywhere else
give you as much performance as you want
to trade the inconvenience of doing a
video proprietary stuff now mantle is if
amy has talked many times and fast about
close to the metal type of architectures
and it only ever became interesting
because of their dual console if it was
just a way to do on the pc be a little
bit more I a lower level for them I
couldn't have cared less I the landscape
does matter that they have both the
major console wins with a similar
architecture we can get articles in all
of us will be making systems
architectural changes that neighbor
those I so I think it's not a stupid
thing for am need to be doing
there are some benefits that they can
breathe from it I could have
implications for steam box type things
there I but they're probably if
Microsoft and Sony both embraced it that
would be very very powerful for AMD but
it doesn't look like they're going to at
least Microsoft or though words that
they're having and show you though I I
mean if I was still doing all of them
you know all of the major technology
coding or I for next-gen game stuff I
probably would not be embracing mantle
right now but it would be there would be
days when it was extremely tempting you
know but what I would dispassionately
step back and look at it I probably
wouldn't come down to the side of
savings obviously others huh conclusions
sure there's something ideas in Maryland
we really like that idea of heaven low
level low overhead access to the GPU I
mean if you look back at what to vote
Direct X and OpenGL there's a lot of
overhead and there's a pis and the
multiple layers of them and the fact
that they date back to the old SGI nah
no partner rendering which is very very
different modern shader based
programming whether we have now you know
where you have potentially unified
memory and a lot of processing power
male 1 the GPU and lots of ways of
sharing data
beyond just calling the ton of API
functions for every little thing you
want to do so they're good ideas there i
hope that really helps the OpenGL
committee and Microsoft shape the future
api's I if you ask me what I want to
prefer to have a low-level API for
accessing the GPU the answer is yes but
five of them each for different hardware
architectures and vendor and operating
systems absolutely not that is the wrong
direction for the industry to go and to
have yet another AP on the pc and it's
no different than the standard pc Direct
X avion it's different than the OpenGL
OpenGL ES there's estan mac and android
and iOS and it's different than the
playstation 3 playstation 4 is little
more enduring api and it's different
than what Microsoft provides an Xbox I
don't think it's a good idea yeah so did
one piece things about it is and one of
the main reasons for doing is that it's
not the replacement this is not designed
that way at all and the idea is that we
can solve some of the motor problems
that we have been having all of us
performance consoles
a robust stable performance those are
things we can experiment and work but
not we do that bit easier here we do
that with geo lols of course this is
another avenue you can see it's also a
really interesting of this essentially
opening up something that we're quite
familiar with already we've been
spending bollocks in the past two years
Oregon next year also the architecture
so I think we intimately familiar with
me to put those architectures and it's a
good fit there just as still described
and I see even though we're not done
with our work with it and it's
definitely not not done yet either to be
to be shipped out I still see it as a
success even right now I should just
because of these conversations and the
amount of things that actually the
amount of developments in the mountain
after that both enthusiasm and even the
opposite the verses yes oh all of the
type of them and it's been a bit stale
and you could say in especially in the
pc graphics mark soft a switch focus for
quite some time over to you other things
which they probably really didn't need
to do but I think now going forward it's
a really exciting opportunity both on
the on the piece of space in the stuff
we're experimenting with mental and
we'll be learning on the consoles but
also mobile as we've discussed before
okay what should be the future graphics
pipeline sir it's a lot of movement in
all these things and this is just good
to have lots of different avenues to
experiment
and actually hopefully deliver a
concrete value in these things but
literally the most John and attended
video we do their own API and then into
the do na VI and then pop them with you
an API that's not teaching one be that
there would be a bad future that will be
very very a lot of work that you myself
and from us that it does play an
important part of albinism I hope mentor
will be quite influential in many
aspects also and what we do by naz is
specifically with with daily is is just
a start yeah I can i yeah you give you
stay aware we just read in his bed for
the marketing videos um what would you
say is the big question 20 thing is a
cost of like in man years or whatever a
plan mental support and healthy again
what do you think it's the automatic pc
that could you try to quantify that it's
in this 2015 we've been very busy just
to making sure our game works overall
and actually and shipping it
out when we're almost done with it so
it's too early to say we'll have a lot
more information in November
mid-november talk more about it and then
will be interesting to see and I think
it's important also to get one thing
that people Oh general people that about
developers can be difficult to
understand that because of all nights
this actually it's not like people okay
we solve this one with go home and game
well as well and ball next is like
whack-a-mole uu 561 and then you thought
that that was the thing he made us four
times faster and then the next wall
itself after of course the biggest issue
is that really you have to architect
your orange ski ovation to take
yep no need I just all of a sudden
really makes a dramatic difference on
Vegas because if you build a good game
in 88 guy even if you magically made all
that i will read vanish it doesn't think
that much of difference it's a
possibility of do I mean there's stuff
one GC ends that I you're excited about
some of the asynchronous pipeline cues
for different things it would be great
to make direct that right direct control
over but thats you got your design for
that really don't design yeah that the
new google be a gradual approach also of
sure we're doing well before it's not
like that before us is only dedicated
for a specific API it's a rich game
there you want to work with something
and deliberate concrete benefits and
then valuate and then go forward and see
where we are in the future we'll design
games based on many of the concepts that
we're proving out not earlier now if we
can do otherwise and i think that that's
especially gets changed for the entire
industry even though people sometimes do
get stocked up on unlike the double
roles including again oh the same
discussion as I had before okay its
mobile replace all the pc thats i'm not
saying that will replace all of the
Equality of that then complementary i'll
actually when you use that is
complementary learner in the individual
industry overall you want that
competitiveness not necessary if i have
25 different aprs but having movement
and i think that's really really i think
i appreciate about cape town
actually I can answer a couple questions
that they wouldn't have to pay us
anything to use it I've been fishing
these ideas for for many many years for
every single vendor at and it's actually
talking just about my own egoistic view
of solving my own specific problems is
that we see a lot of stalls we see a lot
of performance performance gone missing
in many areas I creation get that
performance we want to learn how to
program pain a machine on our lower
level it hasn't actually really really
good architecture for and for that and I
think that's something that will both
sort of rolled out going forward also
okay so it's good it is an R&amp;amp;D platform
for golfers experiment well you're
talking about the desired have front of
us practice or something like that Laura
only
more likely think it's also that if it
pushes microsoft and opengl falls to
improve their drivers by realizing that
hey you can actually achieve a lot more
response on pc with some more low-level
techniques i think it would only be bad
if the outcome of this is that not only
have to do is find vendors specificity
is adjudicated effort and also the
division for for mental well it can play
up anyways you don't really come to the
sacred for short and the division for
mental is that it well it can become a
maybe I also got something we're
completely open for something like
diesel also it's just that that's not
the right way to go out and initially
there are no abuse already bits Cronus
and with these P this is because try
something I wouldn't be a little
battling boy well actually I don't think
I don't forget sure you can make an API
that's completely down to the level sort
of what you like in this week we work to
do a superior than abstract level it was
good in specific without architecture
what do you say the way modern GPUs work
is quite different from from how thieves
or leave absolutely kill the sign was
wrong from the beginning during
extensions of missing viola and we can
access many things but there are
commonalities between all our matrix
like my this works out there's an
awesome thing that the videos morning on
the video that is really the future for
all peoples and if you ask the different
vendors even people in the madness
cracks on mobile space that do not have
it yet that is the future well now I'm
talking for all the love we are probably
not have been able it makes sense a
service your modern design important and
you see some some convergence towards
things that are general
design and then some people are some
designs we will come a little late for
that but when it's a great fit for porky
hardware and is great that for
developers then at last we might point
about a unified memory is absolutely
here we really need to get getting down
to do GPS are just peers on the same
februari well as the CPU and we really
need like a documented textured layouts
that's another thing that everything is
coming associés also even the GPU is a
combination of tons of different
processors a significant amount the
process you know if it's an interviewer
is named a GPU there's quite a lot of
quite independent engines there and
that's something that's hidden from us
now did you do is something that you
from the cpu prepare your commands you
just give it to them it has a driver
that tries to figure out which goes
where that's just generally good
designed to expose those things of
living like you're trying to do
something pinky like using the hardware
video to compression stuff or your
recoding there you have a mentor for a
new API to drive cavalry but you know
even things like computer technology
computers well one of the best in this
case is compute is for graphics which is
kind of yeah feels a little bit but but
it's not like you want to use opposed
tightly coupled with your visual
graphics and you want to use it
completely separately that the CPU dress
for for loneliness is done and you want
to have background tasks that have well
can have really high latency and run in
the background and just eat up whatever
vector units are a freedom continue
that's also general we can design
the position you space like getting up
these issues where one GPU task
scheduling and we have no concept
prioritization between GPU schemes where
you know we need to be able to specify
type slices in prior work yeah you know
it's doubtful you seem to be scheduled
report by metal resource and it will
likely take quite a lot of time until
you find the convergence to a definite
all there and but in the meantime it's
good to have a couple of models posing
ha grab from software sort of competing
or hard being tested there and see what
sort of unsolvable because I do seem to
booking quite interesting convergence</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
