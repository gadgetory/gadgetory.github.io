that we haven't put up any content
during Intel's copulating launch day and
that's because I was working on
something very interesting for you guys
so I won't be talking about the
technical specifications or the
technical details about Intel's newest
architecture since I've already covered
that in this video
instead I really want to cover what
people can expect when they decide to
upgrade to Intel's newest processor the
i7 8700 K this isn't gonna be the usual
Intel vs. AMD thing but rather in
comparison of an older system to a newer
one provided you want to stay within
Intel's platform so the only further ado
let's get into it
but first a quick message from our
sponsor the new NZXT air RGB fans can be
daisy chained together for awesome
lighting cohesion in your build with
vibrant and accurate color illumination
all easily controlled through the hue
plus via cam software full details in
the description below alright so let's
talk about the older system because our
editor Mike aka sky MTL has been teasing
it for about a week on Twitter this is
Intel's z68 platform that was launched
all the way back in January 2011 but
don't let its age of more than 6 years
fool you many people jumped on to Sandy
Bridge platform and they have skipped
Ivy Bridge has Wolff skylake and KB Lake
entirely because it really wasn't any
reason to one of the main reasons behind
Sandy bridges lasting popularity is this
processor the i7 2604 about 320 dollars
and was actually well priced compared to
some previous generation Lynnfield
processors this is why Coffee League
launch is such a big deal right now
after six years the evolved 40 nanometer
plus plus manufacturing process on these
new processors has allowed Intel to
finally move their I 7 Series away from
that quad core layout that's been with
us in Sandy Bridge was launched the I
787 under K uses six cores along with 12
threads and it costs $360 while that's a
good 40 dollars more than the i7 2670 20
and 2017 almost perfectly so in today's
dollars this coffee like CPU doesn't
technically cost more now with its high
speeds and more cores intel also claims
that there are notable performance
improvements over older processors but
that's also a matter of platform
improvements to z68 or other chipsets of
the Sandy Bridge generation are actually
considered very capable by today's
standards but there are some key
technologies which they are missing back
in 2011 features like USB 3.1 gen2
Thunderbolt MDOT to nvme wearing around
and even the current SATA 6 gigabits per
second interface was added to z68
through slow third party controllers the
same goes for PCI 3.0 which wasn't
natively supported by Sandy Bridge but
was tacked on to motherboards later on
even though motherboards like this Asus
z3 7ee Strix and gaming may not be all
that much different from z2 70 it does
have more connectivity options density
68 so you can consider that as a benefit
to looking at these newer components but
what I'm after here isn't to compare Z
370 and C 68 what I want to find out is
whether or not people with Sandy Bridge
processors should finally look into
upgrading basically the test setups will
consist of these Z 370 Strix and I 787
under K or the Asus PZ 68 V Pro and the
i7 2608 with those I'll be using a gtx
1070 16 gigabytes of memory all the
other components you see in this chart
there's also a completely fresh install
of Windows 10 and multi-core enhancement
was turned off the only major difference
will be the memory speeds with Sandy
Bridge operating at 1333 megahertz
while the coffee Lake system will be
operating at 26 66 megahertz those beads
were chosen since they represent the
upper range of Intel's stock
specifications don't worry though I'll
get into overclocking later on ok so now
on to benchmarks n I'm actually gonna
skip these synthetic tests and move on
to real-world testing and gaming
something else I should mention is that
there should be no doubt that the 87 ok
is gonna win and the question is whether
or not it wins by enough to make
upgrading worth a while let's start
things off with Adobe Premiere Pro since
it happens to be a program I use all the
time honestly a video editor would have
likely upgraded away from Sandy Bridge a
long long time ago and this is why
just remember the 26
keh operates at a maximum speed of 900
megahertz lower than the 87 okay and has
for less processing threats so of course
coffee lake will win in rendering tasks
the 87 enter K walks all over the 2600 K
and in a big way - it takes less than
half the amount of time to render the
same scene at stock settings like many
of the programs since GIMP is natively a
single-threaded program Coffee Lakes
additional threats and other
optimizations can't be put to full use
that means it still beats Sandy Bridge
by noticeable margin but nothing like
we've seen in previous multi-core tests
if you're someone done edits photos for
a living I'd still recommend you look
into an upgrade since this amount of
time being saved could lead to money
being saved on your end switching back
to a program that benefits from both
multi-core enhancements and over all
frequencies tells us the VI 780 senator
Kate jumps way out of a massive lead
again but honestly guys remember that
coffee Lake is being compared against a
processor that was launched six years
ago so the improvements were expected we
just wanted to properly put them into
context by now it should be pretty
obvious that coffee Lake will keep
winning rendering tests by a big margin
and that's what pov-ray shows I was
actually expecting winner results to be
a bit closer since its algorithms
typically benefit from faster platform
storage the lower memory latency and
high clock speeds however after I looked
a bit closer at the output it looks like
the i7 2670 the SSD from writing
information at its peak speeds the
processor became a bottleneck okay guys
so you probably didn't need any of those
last charts to tell you that coffee Lake
could beat Sandy Bridge without a
problem but for people who are rocking
the 2600 K and will care about saving
time with processor intensive tasks
could benefit from making a step up to
coffee like but what about gaming you
see with modern processors we've shown
that more cores don't necessarily lead
to higher frame rates in fact in most
cases the GPU becomes the bottleneck
long before the CPU does so what happens
when we throw a 6-0 processor into the
mix now to run these tests I'm gonna be
using this gigabyte gtx 1070 which
should give us a good balance of
performance for the price you pay just
to make things a bit more interesting
I'm also going to throw in a comparison
with one of the fastest graphics cards
available when the 2600 K was
the NVIDIA GTX 680 just remember that
the GTX 680 is technically compatible
with DX 12 but many of the api's primary
rendering optimizations just won't work
with the GPUs hardware that and its
smaller two gigabyte frame buffer cause
performance to suffer in a big way and I
know a lot of you guys came here for
this and let me tell you the results are
pretty eye-opening at slightly low
resolution of 1080p the results are
really interesting with the 2600 K being
only a few frames per second behind in
UI 787 and okay remember 1080p is
supposed to put more stress on the CPU
but it looks like the 2600 K is
completely able to hold its own for the
most part but there is a difference when
we look at the bottom 1% frame rates in
dx11 titles like call of duty Grand
Theft Auto and overwatch it looks like
the 87 in decay delivers a much smoother
gaming experience the DX 12 shows both
cards pretty much even though there
really isn't much to say about this
six-year-old setup of a 2600 K and a GTX
680 since just adding a gtx 1070 could
double or even triple your frame rates
okay let's move on to a bit more
demanding resolution of 1440 P now since
even more of the processing needs are
directed towards the graphics card both
the 2600 K and 87 and K end up running
neck-to-neck even though it's lower 1%
frame rates get closer but there are
still a very few dx11 games where the
8700 K provides a slight improvement in
overall smoothness but that smoothness
is subjective since it's doubtful that
many will see the on-screen difference
between these two processors meanwhile
the GTX 680 drops even further behind
since it's to be by frame buffer just
gets overwhelmed at this resolution but
not so fast here what about overclocking
remember these are two unlocked Intel
processors and actually the i7 2600k was
one of the best clocking processors
we've ever had here at harbor Canucks so
let's see what kind of additional
performance we can squeeze out of these
things let's start with how far they
overclocked with proper stability the i7
87 okay hits five point one four five
gigahertz with a memory speed of 3600
megahertz
while the 2600 K ended up getting all
the way to just over 4.8 gigahertz with
the memory running at just 20 300
megahertz the results are pretty good
for both processors in both Adobe
Premiere and handbrake the jump and
clunk
speeds results in much better
performance for the i7 2600k but it
still doesn't come anywhere closer to
beating a stock 87 okay
the 8700 K doesn't really extend its
lead by all that much in handbrake but
that extra clock speed works wonders in
premiere switching to gaming and the
results are pretty much the same as
before
since the graphics card ends up being in
bottleneck in all of the cases but what
you can see here is that the overclock
did improve the 2600 K is 99 percentile
frame rates in overwatch bringing its
overall performance closer to the 87 and
okay that's pretty impressive guys and
we only needed to upgrade the graphics
card just to be completely thorough I
also decided to test power consumption
and those results weren't really a
surprise either from a performance per
watt standpoint the coffee Lake
processor is miles ahead of the 2600 K
but the 87 order K does consume quite a
bit of power when it's overclocked just
remember that because I don't feel the
eighties sooner k delivers additional
performance to justify that 51 increase
well there you have it guys and I'm
gonna wrap this up quickly since the
results do speak for themselves now if
you're someone who's in much need of
faster encryption of faster rendering
for day-to-day professional tasks the 87
order K is an awesome upgrade provided
you can find one in stock and yes you
will need a new motherboard in memory
but those are good investments for the
time you'll save what really shocked all
of us here at Haruka Knox was just how
closely matched the 2600 K and 87 under
K we're in games especially in dx12 and
Vulcan applications meanwhile dx11
seemed to very slightly favored the
higher clock speeds of coffee lake but
is that minor difference worth the price
of a new system absolutely not
if the primary use of your system is
gaming you are much better off
maximizing your graphics card upgrade
even if your motherboard still has a
pcie 2.0 interface while the newer Z 370
platform does bring connectivity
benefits and potentially more processing
cores at least with games I tested
recommending it to a pure gaming upgrade
is extremely hard so what do you guys
think about this comparison
we're you surprised by the results and
are you planning on upgrading
