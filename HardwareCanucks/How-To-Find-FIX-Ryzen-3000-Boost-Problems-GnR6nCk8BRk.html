were launched a little while ago to be
more precise it was launched on the
exact same day as the rx 3700 series
GPUs and as most of you probably heard
or seen those graphics cars performed
spectacularly now if you caught our
latest Rison build video which you can
check out right over here you'd know
that we didn't publish our Rison 3000
series review and that's simply because
our x5 70 motherboards we're showing
some odd behaviors as many of you may or
may not have heard it's been discovered
that AMD actually sampled a lot of the
reviewers with motherboards that had
buggy bios's and they specifically had
to do with a geesa otherwise known as
AMD generic encapsulated software
architecture yes that really is a thing
it's basically it had an issue where it
wouldn't love the chips to boost
properly well it turns out that those
issues are also being encountered by
some of you guys who are running Xen 2
CPUs which is unfortunate so in this
video I'm gonna be showing how to check
to see if your Rison 3000 series
processor is boosting properly with a
few simple tools so that way you can at
least be sure that every last megahertz
that you paid for is actually there so
why don't we get into it but first I
also want to mention that timestamps
throughout this video will be linked in
the description down below but first a
quick word from our sponsor let me ask
you what is more satisfying than a good
peel whoo that hits the spot but you
gotta love easy to sync a RGB components
for a beautiful light show thermal takes
extensive support with 5-volt a RGB
motherboard sync gives you lighting
control of fans memory lighting kits all
the one coolers power supplies and more
by using the 5 volt header on your
motherboard
you can also daisy chain a bunch of
products to light from a single 5 volt
header or with their own controller for
individual customization but now with a
RGB sync it's all made incredibly easy
to match check it out below ok so let me
go over what exactly is happening with
these new processors since launch
basically many of them weren't hitting
their specified boost frequencies and
sometimes they were missing it by a big
amount - let's take me 3,700 acts as the
first example it has a max boost clock
of 4.4 gigahertz but in our case in
single threaded stressed
our 3700 ex would only boost to 4.37 5
gigahertz meanwhile the 3900 X we all
love so much is supposed to max out at
4.6 gigahertz but ours would only top
out a sad 4.5 gigahertz now neither of
these lower frequencies would cost
performance issues but neither of these
chips were performing at his fullest
capabilities some people were actually
reporting lower clock speeds than the
ones that I just showed anyways we
figured this out pretty early on to our
testing process but without a new
functional bios available at the time
there wasn't much that we could do well
even as you're watching this brand new
biases are being rolled out with the new
agiza one point zero point zero point
three a B which is supposed to fix these
core boosting issues now in the last few
days we've looked at four motherboards
including the ex-wife's any Tai Chi the
ORS X any master the Auris X 570 I Pro
Wi-Fi and the MSI X have 70 Meg ace and
with the latest biases they all work
well but while our problems have gone
away we've also heard from quite a few
actual consumers using both brand new XF
semi boards and older x4 70 X 370 be 450
B 352 supposedly their chips still
aren't boosting properly with the latest
BIOS fixes so let's get into how you can
test your system to ensure that the CPU
is running at its proper clock speed now
in order to do this we would require a
few programs including cinnamon jar 20
HW info and CPU Z actually I'll leave
the latest versions in the description
down below for your convenience I'd
still recommend downloading them just to
make sure that you have the latest
versions of all of these three programs
now to start off we're gonna make sure
that Windows is running the proper power
settings we are going to type in power
settings into the search bar then head
over to additional power settings and
then select the AMD rise in
high-performance power plan this just
makes sure that there are no aggressive
power saving settings that could
interfere with the processors ability to
boost by the way please make sure that
you're running Windows may update build
1903 and the very latest chips and
drivers off of Amy's website next up
open cinnamon jar 20 + HW info 64 select
the sensors only box when opening HW
info and then you can resize Cinebench
and have them side by side then what you
want to do is head over to H to the info
and go under the frequency section which
is under the CPU sub header so in my
case I'm using the 3900 X and you want
to keep an eye on CPU core ratios or
frequencies now if you're wondering HW
info gets this information directly from
the CPU in cinema char 20 run the single
core test now this one takes quite a
while which gives you plenty of time to
keep an eye on the CPU core issues and
if your rising chip is behaving properly
you should start seeing at least one
core running at 4400 megahertz for the
3700 X or 4,600 meters for the 3900 X or
any of these other speeds for the rest
of AMD's line up the highest frequency
will probably keep switching from core
to course since the intelligent sensors
in the processor are actually trying to
make sure the heat loads are balanced
and if you haven't seen any of those
cores hit those speeds in the current
column I'll check out the maximum column
to see if it may be happen too quickly
and you missed it if you still don't see
those proper-- core issues then there is
a problem now assuming that their CP
temperatures are not you know around the
90 degrees celsius mark that just
clearly means that your CPU is just not
boosting properly so what can you do to
fix this well if you're already using
the latest bios you can try clearing the
CMOS or just loading the optimized
defaults within the BIOS if none of that
works you're just gonna have to wait
until the motherboard manufacturer
releases a BIOS that fixes the problem
but guys unless you're overclocking you
don't want to mess around with any
frequency multiplier voltage and power
settings within the BIOS because if you
fill down with those settings it could
stop the processor from boosting
properly now while making sure that your
CPU cores are boosting properly there
are other three frequencies that you'll
want to keep an eye on for optimal
performance now to do this you're going
to need to have the Rison master
software and cpu-z memory tab open
side-by-side so this is the memory clock
frequency this is the Infinity fabric
frequency and this over here on cpu-z is
the memory controller frequency now most
people have made a mistake thinking then
this number was actually the Infinity
fabric but by default the memory clock
the Infinity fabric clock and the memory
controller clock are all fixed in a 1 to
1 to 1 ratio from DDR 421
three all the way up to ddr4 3,600 pass
ddr4 3,600 all of those three
frequencies are not synchronized and
have my friends that can cause some
serious performance penalties and this
is something that I'm gonna plan on
discussing in the overclocking video so
definitely stay tuned for that now if
you set your memory to ddr4 3600 the
memory clock should be 1800 megahertz
which is half the doubleday array and
the Infinity fabric should be 1800
megahertz and so is the memory
controller as well another example is if
you have your memory set to ddr4 3200
here the memory clock should be 1600
megahertz be infinity fabric should be
1600 Hertz and the memory controller
should also be set at 1600 megahertz now
any of those numbers don't match and if
you haven't changed anything the BIOS
except for the memory speed timings and
voltage then your motherboard isn't
behaving properly and it's certainly not
giving you the best possible performance
unlike the CP boost frequencies this one
can be fixed
both the Infinity fabric and memory
controller frequencies can be manually
adjustable in the BIOS but just a
reminder guys that if you're not
comfortable doing that expect to wait
for a new BIOS to fix the problem now
there is another problem that we found
and that's the ability for these
processors to down clock and idle
properly now if you don't mind losing a
little bit of performance and exchange
for you know lower power consumption you
can actually change the windows power
plan from rising high performance to
rising balanced since this will allow
the processor to down clock and run at
much lower voltages at least in theory
it should but like these other issues a
lot of people have actually been
reporting that their processors are
keeping unusually high core voltages and
they never actually go down when their
processor is just idling well it seems
like monitoring tools like HW info 64
and risin master or background apps like
Corsair IQ NZXT camp Razer synapse and
maybe even other random apps like steam
discord and OBS are fooling the rise in
2000 series CPUs you see the CPU thinks
that there's a system load so it's
staying in a continuous high boost and
core voltage state when those
applications are open even though the
programs aren't really doing anything so
right now running the latest version of
CPU Z with no other monitoring apps
or in the background seems to be the
best way to see if your processor is
idling properly if you see the core
voltage ever dip to sub one volt then
everything is working correctly and idle
is working now what if you're using the
right windows power plan and you only
have cpu-z open and you're still not
seeing those sub 1 volt core voltages
well let's assume that you're running
the latest Windows update as well as you
pulled you're running the latest AMD
chips and drivers as well there's one
possible fix what you can try is going
into the BIOS and changing the CPU
voltage from auto to normal and this
seems to resolve the issue for a lot of
people if that doesn't work for you well
I'm probably gonna repeat the same
statement that I probably did like 5
times of this video you just gonna have
to wait for your motherboard
manufacturer to roll out an updated BIOS
so that it can address all of these
issues so there you guys have it and I
do want mention something a lot of these
issues can be fixed with a BIOS update
and some of them seem to have been taken
care of already so that's nice I just
hope that this quick video helped in
case if you're rocking horizon 3000
series processor definitely stay tuned
for overclocking video if you have any
questions in terms of overclocking I'll
let us know in the comments down below
I'll definitely take a look and make
sure that we'll cover that in that video
so that's pretty much it guys thank you
