fun fact I have 16 cases in this
household that's a little bit insane and
I'm only excited about the handful of
those this is one of them it's the view
31 by thermaltake so it's already open
I'm guessing customs had something to do
with that see you finished with one case
you gotta do another this is probably
going to be the most satisfactory peel
of my entire case history let's set it
up
goodbye cheap case alright all the
lighting setup let's do the peel I think
I have to take off the panel first let's
feel the front so accessing the
internals and removing the side panel
requires a bit more work than usual so
we have six screws two thumb screws and
this little supporting piece that sits
in the corner just to prevent this bent
from you know receiving any damage or
something like that so now that that's
off let's finally do the main peel yep
so the side panel curves at the top and
that's acrylic because doing something
like that with glass would be very
expensive and inaccessible so I'm
actually kind of happy that we have an
acrylic version here and I'm really
hoping this experimentation kicks off a
new trend within the case industry
because right now all the boxes are
basically the same in terms of feature
set so going with something a bit like
more specialized like this forces you
into a particular mindset for what type
of build you want to do and I think that
is definitely needed in today's case
market so let's check out the view 37
right after this wondering how to fix a
boring fan check out halos RGB there are
super slim fan frames that light up your
blades of any shade come on 120 and 140
member sizes to fit any fan and a
control through your motherboard or your
fan text case available in beautiful
aluminum or simple plastic it's time to
Halos your build outline what matters
all right so this is the thermal take
view 37 it comes in two variants the RGB
Edition which is what I have here
cost $169 it comes with three 140mm
under RGB fans with a little hub for fan
control and lighting control and we also
have the standard edition which is a
hundred and nine dollars so it is
significantly cheaper and it only comes
with two 120 100 blue LED fans and the
rest of the frame is the same now the
most interesting part of the case as you
can see of course is that giant side
panel that spans all the way from the
left side to the top and so the view
name here is fitting revealing all of
your hardware not just from the side but
from the top view as well now the curve
looks nice there are no artifacts that I
can see and no clouding either where the
bend happens so their process of heating
and cooling as the panel is bent is
actually quite good but it is acrylic so
it's super easy to scratch and I was
still very careful and somehow already
have many scratches all over also it is
a complete dust magnet with even a tiny
bit of illumination from the inside you
can see the particle build-up the
blackout perimeter helps with handling
and the entire piece actually has better
rigidity than some of the older metal
panels now because the top of the case
is basically missing structural rigidity
is slightly compromised and there is
some flex in the frame not really an
issue but have your expectations in line
and I would love for this trend to
expand further into cases not just with
flat temper glass or acrylic panels but
a little bit more unique where the
actual you know transparent pieces
become part of the frame itself and with
the view 37 the interior presentation
becomes the biggest part of its identity
to make up for the fairly bland exterior
so here's the eye oh I like the symmetry
but they've removed the RGB button that
we saw at CES and instead we've get this
fan controller hub for the three fans
with which you control the speed the
lighting modes and we also have this PCI
bracket extension in case you cannot
access the internal hub so it's a nice
accessory but the connection cable plugs
at the top so you need to manage
additional cable work with this PCI
bracket now the cool thing about this
hub is that it's compatible with
multiple of motherboard vendors RGB
software so a SUSE MSI and gigabyte all
work with
Hubb so you don't necessarily need to
use it but all the additional cables are
included if you want to connect them
into your motherboard and it's also why
the RGB edition is more expensive
because the fans have a proprietary
connector so you need to plug them in
into the hub for operation so in total
we have three 140 mm fans to the front
one in the rear with really good
mounting options for more fans and the
front but despite all the airflow
complaints of last year the front panel
is basically a complete choking point
for the fans despite having some side
ventilation and you can see the panel is
not deep enough so this emphasis on
making it look cool kind of backfires as
the low temperatures severely suffer
making it seven degrees Celsius hotter
with the panel installed and I guess
they expect users to accept a hotter
system for a cleaner front panel now
since the top fan mount is missing here
the view 37 integrates an interior side
mount which definitely has to be
utilized otherwise airflow will be even
worse so you have to remove the drive
cage in order to fit the radiator for
that side mount which is not really an
issue since we have four there's no
brackets behind the motherboard tray
each can support doulas as these or a
single three and a half inch drive but
back to the side mount you can see it's
not even properly open for airflow and
these cutouts are here for your drives
originally so Thermaltake needs to open
it up a bit in the future revision and
so this is what it looks like from the
back it's a little bit hilarious how
much of the radiator is blocked by the
frame especially if you were to populate
let's say an SSD or a hard drive in this
one you know the top portion will be
completely blocked and I had to remove
the other drive caddy from here and they
have to keep the cables also clear from
this area so it's a little bit
challenging and definitely not optimal
for best airflow the side panel however
takes into account the exhaust so
ventilation is available that is covered
with a magnetic dust filter and the only
other filter here is at the bottom
spending the entire floor of the case
now I'm a bit surprised that no riser
cable is included even for the more
expensive RGB Edition given the vertical
GPU bracket is installed by default on
both cases and given its proximity to
the side panel expect some extra heat
unless you are were cooling
and last day four completely open
chassis the lack of a power supply
shroud means you need an extra care for
all your keyword work so the view 37 is
attracting a particular builder who can
admire his or her work only if they got
the skills all right so I'm starting
with kyo management and I am already
frustrated so the case is pretty large
and we have two rows of rubber grommets
one for micro-atx one for ATX but look
at this one two and three that's it
three cable tie points on such a large
enclosure how are you supposed to do
kale management you know like what I
just did here is actually putting these
like my own little plastic clips that
have a little adhesive bottom so that I
can put a cable tie point otherwise how
are you supposed to you know route these
cables this is just the front IO cables
by the way I haven't even started doing
any anything from the power supply but
we need at least six more you know not
just in the center but around here at
the bottom so that whatever you route to
cables you'll have options to actually
clean them too I will say that I
appreciate the really long fan cables
this way regardless of where you
positioned the hub which by the way has
a little adhesive that I will take off
there we go
so I actually attached myself to this
section because otherwise you cannot
even mount it anywhere else on the case
like it wouldn't fit here because the
the rubber grommets interferes so it's a
I don't know it's not the best design
and this is actually the only place
where you can actually place it without
it interfering with anything else
around it so the long fan cables are
appreciated because that way I can sort
of you know the hub can be in its own
place and the fan cable is not the
limitation for me to reach it and also
on topic of cable management I find it
absolutely hilarious and actually kind
of salting that Thermaltake only
includes what is this for cable ties
like what I have to you know go into my
own stash where I've used already at
least eight to just route the i/o cables
so this is absolutely ridiculous but to
put a positive spin so that I don't
completely hate my experience with it is
that you get to practice cable
management kind of like freestyling you
know as long as you have little clips
that adhesive things
and your own cable ties you know the
entire enclosure here area allows you to
channel certain cables and ways that you
otherwise would normally not being able
to do so let's resume the entire cable
management work and here's the finished
system I'm actually quite happy how it
turned out to spice it up a little bit I
used the cable mod extensions for the
eight pin CPU cable and the GPU cable
for those super clean curves and the
transparent combs nicely collect
individual wires and I've also installed
the on one tube wraps for some extra
texture otherwise the simple black
cables and tubing are a little boring
through the window and if you're
interested check out Q mod in the
description and I absolutely love the
look of the side radiator mount
especially you know if I had RGB fans in
there the system will totally shine but
I didn't because we already have two
front RGB fans and there's a bit of this
visual disconnect because they're not
the same size and not on the same plane
I do like my mixture of illumination for
hardware so the fans spill a little bit
of the lighting the RGB memory the the
cooler pump thingy and they also have
the RGB strip on the inside to give it a
little bit of extra ambience and to
highlight those components especially by
the radiator section now the hub for
lighting control is pretty good but I
wish it had more fan profiles because
right now we have the red one which is
the low profile and let's go into blue
it is significantly louder and it would
be nice to have something in-between
because that's the only way to control
the fans you know you cannot connect
them to anything else for fan control
and so having slow or super high aka
loud fan operation is not really ideal
so we have eleven and a half inches of
clearance for the GPU for 120 radiators
and about 11 inches for 140 ones and as
I've always said cases don't really need
to be this large so while I appreciate
thermaltake pushing these unique side
panels I would love a smaller version
with a shroud ventilated front panel and
a more friendly design for cable
management and I spent around three
hours building my system majority of the
time went into cable work and I was
honestly expecting it slightly smoother
assembly process and cable work because
of the target audience but like I said
earlier if you are looking for a
challenge to view 37 may fit that
purpose more Thermaltake really kind
needs to refine it a bit more and I'm
happy to see the progression from like
the view 27 and earlier models now we
have larger side panel for that visual
attraction and you can definitely build
a beautiful system inside here there's
plenty of room but you know I was hoping
for a little bit more refinement in
terms of the frame design for the
interior side radiator mount and the
front panel opening to be less
restrictive join the wireless club with
Corsairs new dark core Mouse play the
way you want with nine programmable
buttons aligned in the comfortable shape
and fantastic sensor you can trust and
crazy good Wireless performance plus qi
wireless charging built-in focus on the
game the dark core will do the rest all
right so that's all for me what are your
thoughts on the you 37 and do you agree
that this could be the next amazing
trend within the case industry to like
spice up the different visual aesthetics
of different frames so like you know
different shapes for side panels
different materials not just acrylic but
perhaps tempered glass and wood wood is
a different conversation for you know
it's eels and making sure there's
consistency but still I definitely want
to see a little bit more variety in
terms of how these cases are visually
delivered to the consumer visually
delivered what I am definitely happy to
see something different so let me know
