fantex schoolmaster and MSI Computex
Computex alright so system shutdown the
last thing to do is to turn off the
power supply because I'm away for a week
let's do that well you can't go to copy
text without a camera so I guess this is
it
see 100 powered by GeForce GTX there we
go and we're inside pay every single
time I arrive at 6 a.m.
these guys are closed ok so I have my
bag and I'm waiting for uber at number 4
and he says I'm here find me but he's
actually turning out to be in the
separate part of the airport
so we'll go find eber ok so this is the
right terminal oh I think it's am
somebody so that's cool Bieber how do
you feel pretty good right we were just
have really gone to the funny part here
messing security once again why your
account that you got narcs when I worked
for C's 5 G's 47 like pixelated lighter
and look at this guy
a listen temple he want me how will you
get under the type on its own
alright guys just to give you a little
bit of continuity we arrived to the
hotel so early we could not check in so
we met a couple people and went to the
Dragon Boat Festival which was quite
cool you know you I I really enjoyed it
so check it out
hey Bert it's 2:00 a.m. for you how do
you feel all right people we are now
finally inside of hotel this is quite
interesting because the first time in
four years we have a private bathroom so
that we don't have to be sort of
embarrassed in front of each other the
doors closed
there's no weird windows you know
peeking into the bathroom area you know
solid walls see blue that ever show us
the rest so we're here the bedroom
Dimitri I'm gonna sleep so good last
year deal with lost computer examined
has actually hosted their yeah I have
their big key here in the asking for
suggestions they had the the waterproof
keyboard here and we're just wondering
how they remove the bags you were how do
you feel right now but look at this
sunset so we're both retired right now
but Eva just requested I played the
weekend and our pump up music what do
you say it's a deeper you want some
weekend
anything it is 6:30 in the morning for
you when it's 6:30 p.m. here with
Toronto it's literally a 12 hour flop
all right first day of complex
international press conference are you
saying yeah go man let's go
you know what you're doing that you're
all in myself
the government
the mic on yes okay okay okay so
interestingly Coolermaster just won the
DNI award is a massive dick it's a it's
a really cool case that recovers upon
the channel in the past okay but guys in
temperatures can never get it before it
and to a master looking at you like one
example thank you
so what that whole portion is at
Computex in this first day for
international press conferences to give
us the glimpse for the D and I award and
the night stands for design and
innovative awards company is the tech
companies are recognized for their
products that are good and so it was
very good to see COO master mastercase
pro six to be part of the lineup it was
also very good RGB memory that was
showcased yeah new skill actually was
recognized by competition I guess they
won an award I think that's a really
unique product in my opinion because it
looks amazing it's the best aren't you
giving we put that in a case and then
very interesting a slab of case from
cryo rig I think actually recently
announced in order to be cooler that
looks pretty good and they they did a
collab with him to see for the color
coordination stuff so yeah yeah looks
really high but the case that we saw is
very sweet because it's an aluminum
shell with wooden feet and I would love
to see more of that to be actually
integrated because that looks very
unique to be let's take place underneath
your TV for a home theater PC and looks
like based on the structure of the back
area of the case you can tell that
standard ITX motherboard dual PCI slot
graphics card with a PCI riser extension
thing so you can round things that way
and I think in the specs power supply
and it's a it's a pretty chunky thing
but it looks amazing and you would look
amazing if you really want to clean
desktop setup as well because a lot of
people just want to clean space with
beautiful thin monitor wireless propose
imagine like that type of thing with a
monitor on top of it maybe that could be
like something that people are
interested by that you guys are
interested in on case let us know try to
get a sample for that there are some
weird USB devices that will recognize
like it's an actual USB stick and I
guess by design they will recognize that
I'm showing the footage on the screen
now and then finally there were a gaming
mouse so usually you know within these
innovative awards there are a few gaming
peripherals because things are sort of
organized by category button yeah in
game mouse that's fully interchangeable
I mean sure that concept is sweet and I
mean I haven't played with it yet but
just another day in the gaming else so

our personal log session with Dmitry and
Eber and we're really nice it's quite
