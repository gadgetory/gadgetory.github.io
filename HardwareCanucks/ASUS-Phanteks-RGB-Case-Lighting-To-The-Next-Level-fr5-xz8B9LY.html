great technology selection and service
we have officially reached a point where
RGB lighting is for your PC Cannes is
easily achievable and it's gonna get
even simpler as we move forward with the
time and you'll no longer be restricted
to specific Hardware lighting hubs like
the hue plus from NZXT be the nasim
product but I think with this sort of
introduction over time it might become
obsolete and that's because motherboard
manufacturers are finally getting the
hint that we need to see RGB lighting
incorporated on the inside of the case
not just on motherboard logos and our
peripherals but with the ability to
actually connect RGB LED strips to the
12-volt RGB headers that are directly on
the motherboard thus eliminating the
need for dedicating lighting hubs like
the hue plus and this is really awesome
because you effectively remove the hub
Hardware element which can minimize
cable clutter and just get rid of that
thing entire entirely out of your case
demonstration for this video is thanks
to fan text and asus but not limited to
because more motherboard manufacturers
will have the RGB headers further on and
compatible lighting strips can also be
acquired from cable mod and actually the
hue plus strips have what seems like the
same 4 pin connection but the strip
voltage is different so they don't work
unless n60 releases an adapter of some
sort and this whole compatibility
discussion is important because you have
to pay attention to what voltages are
your LED strips because the 12 volt RGB
headers will only support 12 volt RGB
LED strips for example I tried to plug
in the hue plus LED strips which are 5
volts and it destroyed them
so you have to use what is only
compatible 12 volt RGB on the 12 volt
RGB headers now the reason we're
focusing this demo with the fantex and
two Lux enclosure is because the case
already has built an exterior ambient
lighting where you can cycle the ten
different colors with a simple press of
a button it's only one of the few
enthusiast enclosures to feature this
type of lighting but now fantex is
getting ahead of the curve as a case
manufacturer and releasing an adapter
that allows you to connect case lighting
directly to the RGB header on the
motherboard and files grant you full
control through the asus or software now
the adapter is important because it
powers the LED strip with a 12-volt pin
and it matches the green red and blue
channels properly to the LED strips so
you can actually color match the LED
strip to the motherboard
if the motherboard has lighting
incorporated into it the adapter also
lets you connect additional lighting
strips so you can sort of daisy chain
your way around so not just on the
exterior lighting but also on the inside
that will all be synced up and the
antelope's is one of those unique
examples to adopt the RGB header and
Link it to the case lighting and any
extra strips that you might want to plug
into the adapter and it's also
compatible with a p400s enclosure and
the enthu mini XL which also has this
ambient exterior lighting now there are
super bright and vibrant and matches to
what you select on-screen through the
aura software but fantex we need to see
different types of strips we only have
one or two metre options which end up
being way too long and don't bend easily
inside the case due to the very thick
yet waterproof housing and they're also
not magnetic all the features that are
found on the hoopla strips which are
magnetic they are shorter and allow
daisy chaining that makes sense
inside the tight space like an enclosure
and they're also a lot thinner and so
the takeaway from this video is that RGB
headers on the motherboards are here it
will only be a matter of time until it
becomes the mainstream and you'll no
longer need proprietary lighting hubs
like the hue plus to light up the
interior of your case now if you own the
compatible motherboard and the
compatible fantex enclosure
fantex will send you the adapter for
free until March 1st or you can buy it
yourself which is only three dollars now
the ASUS Maximus 8 here alpha is an
awesome board because it shows the the
initial stages of the aura lighting
software which is still very basic but
gives you all the necessary controls of
your lighting strips because you have
two channels you can customize those
channels perfectly well despite having
only the RGB logo on the motherboard
which is looks kind of strange because
the rest our motherboard accents are in
red so the question is are you convinced
that this shift away from dedicated
lighting hubs towards something that's
actually built into the motherboard is a
good idea I definitely think so despite
me being sort of skeptical on the
software side of things because I love
the extra driver customization you get
with a hue plus you have all types of
effects but then I realized that you
have pretty much identical lighting
settings with the or lighting driving
software and you also have the two
channels which you could customize just
perfectly well just like you can on the
hue plus I think it definitely has the
potential to grow and become potentially
mainstream in like six months or so but
what do you think let us know in the
comments down below I'm doing three with
Howard Knox thanks so much for watching
everyone
and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
