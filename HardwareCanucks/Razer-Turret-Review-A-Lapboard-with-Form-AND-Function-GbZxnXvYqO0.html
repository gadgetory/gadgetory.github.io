get in the way limit the distance you
can be from the source device and
they're just generally a hassle so when
we can get rid of them it's a welcome
addition the positives of a wireless lap
board are clear you get greater freedom
of movement a cleaner aesthetic and
overall a nicer package however there
are definitely some downsides with form
often coming at the cost of function the
question for the razor turret is this
has it too heavily focused on making a
beautiful product rather than a
functional one we'll dive deeper after
this message from our sponsor the new
NZXT air RGB fans can be DZ Ching
together for awesome lighting cohesion
in your build with vibrant and accurate
color illumination all easily controlled
through the hue plus via cam software
for details in the description below I'm
going to start off with a word about
good design good design is not simply
having an aesthetically pleasing form or
having a great amount of functionality
or features good design is the seamless
integration of form and function when
the features of a product and its
physical construction complement each
other when the product can look and feel
great and serve the intended purpose
with excellence that's when you
recognize great design let's do a quick
refresher on lap boards if you're not
familiar these are simply designed to
make living room gaming a possibility
allowing you to use your keyboard and
mouse on the couch we've checked out two
other lap boards so far the corsair lap
dog which favors a bulky but
uncompromising design with a large k70
mechanical keyboard and a large
accompanying price tag the rocket sober
which takes some compromises but in all
the right places giving the most
well-rounded and probably the best lap
board on the market and now the turret
with the turret razer has obviously put
a lot of thought into the appearance and
feel of the product unfortunately I feel
like they've missed the mark when aiming
at the gaming lap for dorians instead
creating a product which will only
appeal to a small niche but before I get
too deep into that let's do an overview
of the turret we'll start with the
packaging as per usual Razer nails it
here it feels like you're buying into an
experience it's nicely presented with
the lap board Mouse dock cables and
documentation lay it out cleanly
unlike some of these lab boards Razer
includes both a mouse and keyboard
that's reflected in the 150 US dollar
price tag the lap board and mouse dock
smoothly in the charging cradle and I
have to commend Razer this design is
great as it solves two issues
simultaneously where to safely store the
lap board when not in use and a simple
method of charging when you pull out the
turret keyboard you have a compact
keyboard layout with chiclet style keys
the mouse pad is on a hinge which folds
out revealing a small surface where the
accompanying Mouse is intended to be
used this surface is also slightly
magnetized to prevent the mouse slipping
off which is an issue that has plagued
many other lap boards the turret small
form-factor is one of the main appeals
with bluetooth function or 2.4 gigahertz
Wi-Fi which means that you can use this
with almost any device and small enough
you can even take it in your backpack
but of course Razer is primarily
marketing this as a lap board intended
for gaming so that's where they really
need to hit the mark however really the
turret is doomed from the get-go here
thanks to the mouse the combination of a
small Mouse small mousepad and the
wireless design means there's really no
way this could be good for high
intensity gaming for any FPS titles
there's just simply not enough mouse
space latency becomes an issue due to
the long distance wireless connection
and the mouse is simply too small to be
comfortable for many gamers it'll do
okay for some basic titles like sieve
but even then the grip on the bottom of
the mouse makes small movements choppy
this 3,500 DPI Mouse really didn't
impress me much and since the mouse pad
is so small you're pretty much stuck
with this one it's really not a good
gaming experience especially compared to
lap boards like the rocket silver or the
corsair lap dog the wireless experience
with this mouse is also pretty choppy at
times using the 2.4 gigahertz band I
found that if I had the receiver plugged
directly into the PC I would get serious
interference and only by using the
included extender could I get a usable
result although even then you can feel
the delay when using the mouse in-game
so once you look past that's pretty face
it's obvious that the raise the turret
fails on its main promise of living room
gaming there is some upside though as
the turret isn't completely without
purpose if you're someone who really
cares about aesthetics and just
wants simple living room control for the
PC this is for you if you can justify
that price tag if you're someone who's
looking for a portable mouse and
keyboard combo that you can use with a
variety of devices ranging from PCs to
phones then this also may appeal to you
with the very small form factor and the
Bluetooth capability pairing is simple
and the users reliable with very good
battery life on both the keyboard and
the mouse this is certainly a device
without a proper market though there'll
be a select few who love it for what it
is and have a specific use case for it
however for the majority of people
spending one hundred and fifty dollars
to get a gaming laptop is going to be a
major disappointment razer has gone for
a sleek design but in the end they've
just come up with a slightly unusable
design for serious gaming compromising
key features and usability in the sake
of aesthetics instead of finding a way
to blend them together seamlessly
hopefully they can learn from their
mistakes and make a more successful
turret be - but in the meantime I
wouldn't recommend picking this one up
