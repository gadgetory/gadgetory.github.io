axe and last week we looked at the EVGA
gtx 1080 superclocked ACX 3.0 GPU and
after testing we concluded that it was
better than the gtx 1080 founders
Edition in every way it was faster ran
cooler and it actually cost less money
well today we're here taking a look at
our second custom GTX 1080 and this one
is from gigabyte specifically the g1
gaming video card ya cable mod
configurator allows you to select only
the cables you need with your choice of
mod flex leavin that is very flexible or
mod mesh that is more vibrant then you
choose your length and color combination
custom cables just got more custom with
the cable mod configurator the price
point is very much in line with the
competition out there coming at around
650 dollars but more importantly this
also happens to be the same price as
EVGA superclocked I mentioned earlier
specs wise what you're looking at is AGP
104 core that has some interesting clock
speeds since it actually comes with two
main performance modes if you install it
without gigabytes extreme engine
software it automatically defaults to
gaming mode and once it's sixteen ninety
five megahertz and eighteen thirty five
megahertz for the base and boost
frequencies respectively meanwhile the
software also includes an OC mode that
ups the performance to seventeen twenty
one megahertz base with a boost of up to
eighteen sixty megahertz
we've enabled OC and these settings will
be used for the tests there's also eight
gigabytes of gddr5 X memory and the rest
of the specs are pretty much neck to
neck compared to the founders Edition
and given the higher clock speeds we can
certainly expect a significant increase
in performance considering gigabytes
advanced to enforce 3x heatsink should
keep those frequencies consistent I
should also point out that there are a
lot more features packed into this card
like fully controllable RGB lighting a
custom PCB with upgraded components and
a bin core which is supposed to offer a
more overclocking Headroom these are
certainly ways to differentiate this
particular card from the super clock a
CX 3.0 since EB G's card didn't offer
any of those the g1 gaming's design is
understated when compared against some
other details too
cards on the market but I quite liked it
if you recall the previous gtx 980ti g1
gaming that included a minimalist black
and white shroud with an RGB lit wind
force logo on its side this 1080 version
utilizes a similar all-encompassing
predominantly black cover with a few red
highlights it is much less distinctive
than EVGA stern designs but I think it's
much more likely to fit a broader range
of bills the wind force 3x cooler has
historically been one of the best
regarded heat sinks around by utilizing
a large horizontally placed heatsink
which runs throughout the card gigabyte
has been able to effectively maximize
dissipation while also ensuring their
direct touch heat pipe base has enough
thermal mass above it to keep up with
its core output that base has been
revised this time around so its heat
pipes all make contact with the smaller
GP 104 core however there's one
sacrifice with this heatsink it's a bit
longer than the PCB and to be more
precise the card is 11 and a quarter
inches in length which realistically
shouldn't cause any installation
problems into most ATX and larger cases
but keep a note of this if you are
looking for a more compact chassis the
high performance fans are engineered to
maximize downwards airflow without
requiring fast rotational speeds and
they have a unique triangular edge and
thin strips at their midpoints and this
helps grant a 23% airflow increase over
traditional units gigabyte has also
replaced the wind force logo with their
own brand name there's a fan stop sign
which lights up to indicate that the
fans stop spinning in low load
situations the single 8 pin power input
is also located here the backplate is
clean and simple nothing too fancy when
compared to competing solutions from the
likes of ZOTAC and EVGA it gets a job
done and all the critical components
located on this side of the PCB should
also benefit from its additional heat
dissipation characteristics the i/o here
is based off the reference design you
get 3 DisplayPort 1.4 outputs a single
HDMI 2.0 port and one DVID connector
speaking about the software the extreme
engine app is a massive departure from
gigabytes OC gru
we've been seeing for the last few
generations
this one is sleek well-designed and
highly intuitive there's a section with
full control over a single backlit RGB
logo a dedicated fan profile area and a
user-friendly overclocking tab
unlike previous software's there's no
hidden settings or oddball toggle
switches everything is right there ready
to be used I actually appreciate its
functionality more than the new position
but it's missing Energy's
straightforward per point voltage
modifiers and instead uses a confusing
curve like approach which didn't seem to
have any discernible impact on
overclocking and let's talk temperatures
they're all identical between different
presets with all topping out at 70
degrees Celsius essentially all these
modes strive to attain Semmy see simply
by fluctuating fan speeds or frequency
output in the long term the temperatures
were a bit lower than the super clock AC
xscape I know there were no differences
between fan speeds on both the gaming
and eco modes with the only exception
that being eco tends to hold the fans
idle a bit longer OC mode on the other
hand sees its rotational speeds hitting
about 150 rpms higher than the other two
even though the new wind force 3x cooler
has three fans and a massive heatsink it
seems to be a bit inefficient when
compared directly against EVGA is
competing solution once again the
differences between gaming and eco modes
are non-existent with frequencies
hovering between the 1885 megahertz and
1873 megahertz mark the OSI mode does
exhibit a bit more fluctuation but it is
indeed consistently higher than the
other two settings though only about by
50 megahertz and to me this makes
gigabytes card a dual mode solution
rather than the triple modes their
extreme tuning utility would lead you to
believe
all right game time how well does this
card compare with the competition let's
find out
well I think we found one of the fastest
GTX 1080s for now as you can see the g1
tops our charts in every single title at
the highest setting in 1440p overtaking
the super clock a CX 2.0 but most
importantly destroying the founders
Edition the same story applies for 4k
with the g1 not letting anyone take its
place
you
on the acoustic side there's really
nothing to get excited about
especially when OC mode is activated the
EBG super continuity is quieter across
the board but we can't forget it also
features slightly higher temperatures
power consumption is respectable too but
that's expected with the pastels
architecture again you have to consider
the three fans and the upgraded PCB into
the equation nonetheless there's no need
for a beefy power supply we were
disappointed with overclocking the
maximum achievable overclock was twenty
fifty megahertz placing the g1 gaming
well behind the founders edition and the
super clock 1080 the core on this
particular sample seems to require more
voltage to run at higher clocks than
gigabytes utility can provide even with
an eight percent power limit increase
our sample feels like a plug-and-play
solution which doesn't need to be
overclocked to hit optimal performance
the dark bass 900 may be the most
innovative case of the year with a
built-in Qi charger interior lighting
tempered glass that can be installed on
either side and a fully modular interior
that can be inverted if you so desire be
quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below all right so
what's our final verdict on the GTX 1080
g1 from gigabyte it's an awesome card
loaded with great features like RGB
lighting upgraded PCI components and
some items that similarly price
competing solutions just don't offer the
addition of simple performance tuning
with just a click of a button is an
awesome feature especially for beginners
and performance was outstanding across
the board too even when compared to the
superclocked 1080 from EVGA
unfortunately running discarded default
settings it was just louder than the
EVGA card and we were not able to
achieve the greatest overclocking
results either
luckily overclocking will likely vary
from one sample to the next with some
being better than the others while those
somewhat higher fan speeds can be tamped
with a few inputs into gigabyte software
and with all that taken into account if
you are looking for a feature-rich
GTX tennety then the g1 gaming can be
considered a good value for the
performance it provides so what do you
guys think about gigabytes g1 GTX 1080
videocard would you pick this over EVGA
superclocked card let us know in the
comments down below I'm a bar with tower
connects thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
