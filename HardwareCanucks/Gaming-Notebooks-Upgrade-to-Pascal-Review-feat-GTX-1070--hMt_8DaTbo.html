hit 60fps at 4k with lots of eye candy
in the latest titles it still displays
one of the biggest generational leaves
and graphics performance we've seen in a
while but right now I can definitely
recommend it for someone who is into VR
but anyway clearly the 1080 is
absolutely awesome and we think it will
only be a matter of time until we see
Pascal architecture a GB one a force or
some derivative of that space yeah so
that wasn't long at all since the
initial launch of the Pascal GT X 1080
only three months later we now seeing
Pascal rolling out into the notebook
space no M after the GPU model name
these are fully enabled GTX 10-6 these
ten 70s and 10 80s inside a gaming
notebook the z9 neo-byzantine all the
right features on a budget with a large
window side panel five included fans and
the excellent interior layout with super
simple cable management get it now link
in the description below
so Nvidia invited us to London to check
out the rollout of Pascal notebooks and
this comes at a very good time with the
approaching back-to-school season having
the choice between the three Pascal
variants they essentially place the GTX
1060 for light and portable form factor
like the razor blade the GTX 1070 is
going to be placed and slightly thicker
foam factor to accommodate for cooling
and of course the GTX 1080 is going to
be in the largest of known books that
has the best cooling possible
performance wise we are told is going to
be within ten percent of baseline
desktop cars which is super impressive
and the specs slightly defer to reach
power targets so the amount of cooter
course on the GTX 1018 1060 remains the
same but with lower clocks for boost and
base while the GTX 1070 gets a coup
record bump with again lower clocks and
now with the specs out of the way I've
always wanted to see a higher refresh
rate panel on a notebook so in the past
I think we were kind of stuck when the
75 Hertz refresh rate but now with these
Pascal notebooks we're rolling out with
an epic 120 Hertz displays on notebooks
so that's awesome I prefer to play on a
high refresh rate over better settings
and I'm sure that many gamers will
welcome this feature as well and the
second change is added resolution now we
have proper negative 2560 by 1440 P
displays on a notebook which is awesome
because it fills that middle gap between
1080 and 4k that void has been filled so
now you have the option of either 120
Hertz on 1080 middle-ground of great
resolution for gaming of 1440p or a 4k
juicing this plane now given Pascal
architecture is much more power
efficient than the previous generation
Maxwell cards you now will be able to
overclock your GTX 1060 1070 and 1080
inside your notebook just as you would
or almost just as you would for a
desktop card we actually saw demo of the
GTX 980 being overclocked past 2
gigahertz and doom which is something
that I've done with my machine as well
here and the most impressive thing for
me was seeing temperatures below 80
degrees Celsius at load in a notebook
form factor something that I have not
been able to achieve
even with my desktop so overclocking is
coming much higher clock speeds for
notebook space than compared to the
previous generation of notebook GPUs and
this added performance bump for
notebooks is of course a big VR push
honestly it was quite refreshing to see
a small machine powering these demos
instead of the two-way SLI desktops that
we've seen in the past now I doubt the
our backpacks will hit it off but I
won't be surprised to see portable on
person contraptions with these notebooks
so we received the Asus G 75 2 V for the
gtx 1070 now for testing so starting off
with the 3d mark firestrike ultra the
overclocked results give us better
performance than the 9 ADM sli while on
the cpu front the 6820 HK is decently
fast but lags behind a desktop
counterpart jumping into some games and
everyone will be happy with such
performance on a notebook this 1070 is
significantly faster than a single 980
and is quite interesting to see the
performance difference between 1080p and
1440p
and finally battery life has seen an
improvement in like use with over three
hours while giving us an hour and a half
for gaming use which is not significant
bump over previous generations but still
it is improving and so taking all this
into account pascal for notebooks is
such fantastic news performance wise but
since they utilize the same course as
the desktop family which already is in
low stock we do have some concerns over
upcoming availability but we'll be
comparing the ten series GPUs for
notebooks versus desktop counterparts
trying to compare apples to apple sort
of in order to see what is the
performance difference and if it's such
a fantastic combination of having so
much power in such a thin form factor
but guys stay subscribe to see all those
results I'm Dimitri with Harbor Canucks
thanks so much for watching and we'll
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
