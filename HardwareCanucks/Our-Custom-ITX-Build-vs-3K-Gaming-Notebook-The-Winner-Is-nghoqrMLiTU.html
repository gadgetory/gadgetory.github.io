the asus rog g7 52 vs gaming laptop
which featured a quad-core skylake core
i7 6820 HK mobile cpu 64 gigabytes of
ddr4 ram clocked in at 2400 megahertz
a 512 gigabyte nvme SSD along with a one
terabyte hard drive and the star of the
show was the gtx 1070 eight gigabyte GPU
powering the 17 inch 1080p GC display
the cost of that machine was about three
thousand dollars and while many of you
appreciated the remarkable engineering
of packing so much power into a laptop
form factor most of you were reluctant
about that price tag many of you brought
the fact that you can build a much
powerful gaming PC for less than half
the cost of the gaming notebook which I
totally stand by but how much less
expensive could it be well we decided to
build a PC that almost matches the
performance of the ACS g7 52 gaming
notebook but we also decided to add a
twist
make it as compact as possible without
sacrificing pricing and let me tell you
that wasn't easy but before we move on
quick message from our sponsor the dark
bass 900 maybe the most innovative case
of the year with a built-in Qi charger
interior lighting tempered glass that
can be installed on either side and a
fully modular interior that can be
inverted if you so desire be quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below
as I said before we had three goals to
achieve with this gaming PC one it
should cost less than $1500 - it should
be a compact PC that can easily be
transported to LAN events and three it
should either match or I perform the GCM
52 in games one mention about this we
wanted to make this a gaming focused
system and that doesn't mean throwing
the highest end processor at it so with
the above-mentioned goals in mind this
is what we came up with the processor we
chose was the Intel Core i5 6500 skylake
quad core chip clocked at 3.2 gigahertz
it retails for about $200 which is $50
cheaper than the overclockable 6600 K
but we chose this because it has plenty
of horsepower for gaming now I also
understand that some of you will want
more powerful multitasking scenarios so
to cover those bases I also tested the
system with a core i7 6700 K quad core 8
threaded processor that should cover all
the bases but if you want to focus more
on gaming pay a lot of attention to the
results a bit later
since the expensive 6700 K really
doesn't yield you significantly higher
frame rates housing the chip will be the
azrog z170 M Mini ITX motherboard that
comes in at about $130 which is an
absolutely amazing deal it comes with a
built-in Wi-Fi module for SATA three
connectors a single PCI x16 slot for our
GPU and two RAM slots that support up to
32 gigabytes of ddr4 Ram speaking of RAM
we opted for g.skill ripjaws 5 series 16
gigabyte kit clocked at 2400 megahertz
and while it's a lot less than 64
gigabytes on the notebook there are a
few things to take into account here
first 64 gigabytes is just overkill for
gaming or almost every scenario we can
think of a while ago Dmitry did a video
comparing 8 16 and 32 gigabyte ram
capacities for gaming and video
production link will be in the
description his conclusion was that if
you're strictly gaming you're much
better off with either 8 or 16 gigabytes
and save the rest of the money for a
good GPU my last point is that since
this motherboard supports up to 32
gigabytes of RAM you can easily upgrade
to that capacity down the road there are
no restrictions whatsoever
cooling the CPU is our recently tested
Noctua NHL 9i and low profile cooler
what's great about this cooler is its
high clearance at just 37
milimeters not only does that make it
compatible with nearly every ITX case on
the market but the l 9i is more compact
and Intel's own stock cooler and it's
plenty enough to cool the core i5 6500
it only costs $50 which is a steal in my
opinion and it fits our budget perfectly
and on sale it can be found for just $35
let's talk storage we chose the OCZ TL
102 40 gigabyte SSD as our main boot
drive while it may not be anywhere near
as fast as the nvm en to drive on the
notebook it still provides excellent
performance and great longevity while
costing about 270 dollars that's what
the system is about combining
performance and value I did however
choose to expand the amount of game
storage versus the one terabyte drive on
the Asus notebook for that I grabbed a
Western Digital four terabyte hard drive
powering the whole system is the
silverstone SD 45 SF small form-factor
psu with an 80 plus bronze certification
and it retails for about sixty-five
dollars and now for the GPU we picked
the gigabyte gtx 1070 mini ITX OC
remember we wanted to compare the gsm 52
to an actual desktop featuring the same
GPU regardless of the processor ram
storage etc and while the notebook
version of the 1070 has more cuda cores
and texture units the cooling efficiency
in the g1 GPU should result in better
temperatures along with more consistent
clock speeds I'm really excited to see
how the benchmarks turn out the case of
choice is the silverstone SG 13 Mini ITX
enclosure this enclosure highlights the
strengthens of a compact ITX design plus
at $50 you just can't ask for more
there's plenty of room for proper
airflow although you won't find dust
filters which is a bummer and the
included hard drive bracket only
supports a single three and a half inch
hard drive or two two and a half inch
SSDs in my case I mounted these sideways
to fit the SSD and the four terabyte
drive which I think turned out pretty
great but just keep that in mind so now
that we've taken a closer look at the
parts list for the build along with the
operating system the total price rounds
out to about $1500 with taxes if you're
looking for an inexpensive gaming
monitor the AOC g20 460 PG 24-inch
g-sync display will be a perfect
fit it features a 1080p TN panel with a
refresh rate of 144 Hertz and when
paired with the cooler master master
keys like combo keyboard and mouse
you're looking at an entire killer
desktop setup for $2,000 without taking
any sales into mind so are you guys
ready for the benchmarks here you go
starting with some basic synthetic tests
the Mini ITX build with the 6700 K took
the lead in every situation while the g7
52 held second place and the i5 6500
taking the last spot this isn't a
surprise to me because the i7s are hyper
threaded and they feature more cash
compared to the 4 thread core i5 so if
you're into content creation or heavy
data processing that requires a faster
CPU you should probably avoid the core
i5 crystal this mark loved the nvme SSD
inside the g7 52 notebook whereas the
OCC TL 100 inside the Mini ITX build
dished out respectable numbers the
mechanical hard drive on the g7 52 was
also faster than the 4 terabyte drive
and this is due to their specs the
desktop driver was spinning at 5400 rpm
whereas the notebook driver was spinning
at 7200 rpm now on to gaming modern
titles at 1080p were performing
outstandingly well on the Mini ITX build
with the 6700 K even with dx12 enabled
what surprised me was how well the Asus
notebook kept up with the desktop the
difference was about one to two percent
between the two which isn't a big deal
in my opinion but check out the build
with the i5 6500 at a lower resolution
like 1080p it does trail behind the g7
52 by about 4 to 6 percent but in titles
like overwatch Call of Duty infinite
warfare it trades second place right
beneath the 67 under K variant do note
that the 1070 becomes the bottleneck in
mini games at 1080p so the extra money
spent on a faster processor may not make
much of difference switching to 4k
things start to shift around a little
bit the 6700 K variant of the Mini ITX
build and the Asus notebook play a cat
and mouse game fetching for the lead
whereas the i5 6500 variant takes last
place but the difference between each of
these systems is so minimal it won't
make a difference in gaming I'm actually
really surprised with how well the i5
6500 did and it goes to show that paying
hundreds more for a faster processor
mean
be money well spent in a gaming system
as for the graphics cards from our tests
the notebook 1070 ran at a consistently
lower speeds compared to the desktop
configuration and there were times where
the extra cuda cores and the texture
units likely played a significant role
in closing the gap between it and the
Mini ITX build but the desktop GPUs hire
clocks usually one out now let's take a
listen to how each system sounds
so at the end of the day I think we
achieved our goals that were mentioned
in the beginning of this video just to
reiterate we built a very portable PC
for less than $1500 or under eighteen
hundred dollars with the basic 24-inch
g-sync monitor it was also extremely
compact which means it can easily be
transported to LAN events and finally we
were able to match the performance of
the Aces g7 52 notebook by a slight
margin I'll be it the notebook still
performed better than the i-5 6500
variant by a slight amount but you have
to take into account that the notebook
is rocking an i7 processor with more
cores and faster cache that being said
if you're willing to spend an extra
hundred seventy dollars on the build
pick the 6700 K because it is a very
powerful chip for both gaming and video
production if you're into that at the
end of the day I find myself struggling
to find the benefits of a massive gaming
notebook over a compact ITX system for
most situations gaming notebooks can't
be easily upgraded but they cost a small
fortune and they're anything but light
and compact I'd hate to carry around the
Asus g7 52 in my backpack that's for
sure but just to give you a rough idea
of how much one costs we were able to
build a comparable IKEA system with a
monitor and still have enough money left
over to buy a fully equipped Dell XPS 13
slim and light notebook or any other
ultra book that would give you the best
of both worlds performance and
portability guys let us know your
thoughts about this mini ITX build + do
you see yourself using expensive gaming
notebook that would suit your situations
better also would you have used
different components for the build let
us know in the comments down below i'm
eber with hurricane axe thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
