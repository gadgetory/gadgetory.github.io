great technology selection and service
gaming mice can be extremely expensive
with some flagship mice ranging up to
nearly $60 but can you get a good gaming
mouse on the cheap we set off to find
out
welcome to the hardware Canucks roundup
of gaming mice under $25 this is the
first of a couple of mice roundups we're
going to be doing starting with the 25
and lower price point and then moving
upwards the winner of each price range
will move up to compete in the next tier
with individual winners for each price
range and finally we'll crown an overall
winner now we have to say that selecting
any type of peripheral boils down to
personal choice rather than one being
better than another for example someone
who holds their mouse in a palm grip
could absolutely hate mice that target
claw grippers and vice versa
in the best case scenario you'll be able
to get out to a store and try a few
options before making a decision with
that being said this roundup will focus
on a combination of simple repeatable
tests that replicate gaming situations
and my subjective opinion on each Mouse
let's get started with the competitors
as we're covering nine mice today we
have the Cougar 200m gigabyte m60 900
Thermaltake Talon blue a 0 X 0 1 &amp;amp; GM
4200 there's also Logitech G 100's
ghamdi SD meter Zalman m4 100 R and the
ROS will jet because there are so many
mice to examine it'll take some time so
here are the time codes on screen for
each placing to assess these will be
covering four main categories price
design building comfort features and
customization and finally sensor
performance so we'll start with Rosewall
jet available for $20 on Newegg the jet
has a primarily plastic build with a
soft touch finish on top which feels
okay and textured plastic on the sides
the builds nothing exceptional it
doesn't feel great and the materials are
cheaper than most of the other mice in
this roundup the mouse has some sensor
rattle its
really loud but if you shake the mouse
it is noticeable which is a shame one of
the advantages the mouse does have is an
eighth weight system for customization
which is really great to see given the
price point although even with all the
weights installed it still feels pretty
light while the jet doesn't have online
switches the primary left and right
clicks feel pretty good with fairly
responsive clicks the mouse wheel is
pretty unexceptional with decent scroll
steps but overall smoothness isn't very
good and the middle click is just a
little too tough to actuate for my
preference you also have the two side
browser buttons and on top is the DPI
toggle these can't be permanently
remapped since there's no accommodating
software but they can still be modified
in game provided button remapping is
supported you can toggle between 1600
and 2000 dpi but there isn't anything
lower which can be a deal-breaker for
FPS gamers I personally play at 400 dpi
in game so not being able to customize
this is frustrating on the bottom is our
optical sensor and we have a couple of
tests for it first up is the straight
line test to do this we open up
Photoshop and draw a straight line to
test if their mouse has prediction
naturally I can't draw a perfect line so
if the mouse isn't altering it we should
see Wiggles in this line looking at the
jet we see it does have some prediction
creating a pretty straight line this
isn't necessarily bad but we have to
keep it in mind it also doesn't have any
acceleration as far as I can tell
something that's great to see the last
test is how the mouse handles fast
movements especially flicks in game for
this I launch top csgo and it a quick
180 turn ideally it should track
smoothly the entire way but the jet
started very quickly losing the tracking
and not completing the turn this is a
big issue if you're an FPS gamer as I
found myself frustrated we're not being
able to turn quickly for the record this
stuttering plays many of the mice at the
lower end of the market so the jet isn't
unique in this respect next up is the
Zalman m41 0 R which is actually the
cheapest of the mice at only 13 dollars
the materials used here are actually
quite good the soft touch finish feels
comforting and the build is amazingly
decent quite the step up from the
Rosewall with no sensor at all
the omron switches feel pretty good and
the scroll wheel is decent but the
middle click still requires too much
force the shape of the mouse is also
quite weird
and I can't say I like it it's too flat
and it doesn't support your hand very
well with this weird Ridge at the back
being not particularly comfortable the
side buttons also bit too small and
their click profile isn't very
satisfying once again there's no
software which means you can tree bind
them permanently and the m-40 one are
only has dpi selections of 1000 1500
2000 2500 indicated by the LED color
these options are par for the course
with the included of Argo a 50/50 Center
but they aren't really optimal for FPS
gamers sensor performance isn't great
either
it does alright in straight line tests
with some prediction but once again it
falls apart in quick movements just like
the jet jittery performance when
performing flicks is once again a
deal-breaker for FPS gamers overall the
a 50/50 sensor isn't really optimal for
gaming and it's another mark off the
m-40 1r the gamma desde meter is up now
priced at $15 the build of the Demeter
is actually stepped down from the Zalman
having a soft plastic finish with some
slight texture on the side it has a very
heavy emphasis on plastic and this
results in pretty average build quality
with noticeable sensor rattle similar to
the Roseville jet the media is
ambidextrous with a single button on
each side of the mouse both the primary
mouse buttons and the scroll wheel are
what I would call average they're not
bad but unexceptional either in many
ways this is pretty much expected for
this price range but it would it be nice
to see something different where the
committee's does step up is in the
software with a large amount of
customization you've got both DPI
adjustment polling rates and key
assignment so you can reassign both the
primary and secondary buttons this is
awesome
you can store three profiles on the
mouse and toggle between them and
there's also mouse use stats the
software is pretty versatile and great
to see taking a look at the center and
first up is the straight line test there
isn't too much prediction and you can
choose to have acceleration enabled or
disabled which is cool however like the
rest of the mice so far flicking issues
plagued this sensor with fast movement
that drops out and struggles which is a
shame because otherwise Mouse would have
been one of the best in the price range
on that note we come to the next in our
list the gigabyte m60 900 which is
priced at $25 so it's on the high end of
this price range
but it's a bit of an interesting Mouse
if it wasn't marketed as a gaming
peripheral I would think this was a
Productivity focused Mouse build quality
is good it's fairly heavy on plastic but
it feels solid with absolutely no sensor
at all
the design of the mouse though is quite
unique where the focus on economics it's
a fairly large Mouse with large curves
to fit naturally to the hand I actually
found it quite comfortable and nice to
use for long periods of time the m60 900
has a four-way scroll wheel something
which isn't on any of the other mice the
wheels feel is better than expected with
smooth but controlled scrolling
meanwhile the left and right buttons are
average but they're actuate feel as
satisfying and controlled as some of the
other mice the m6 900 also has some
basic accommodating software and while
it looks a bit outdated it provides a
wide range of functions you can do a
basic button remapping and control DPI
with profile assignments there's nothing
crazy unique here but it covers all the
necessary bases now with the sensor it
doesn't show too much prediction but the
big issue for gaming with this mouse is
the acceleration right on gigabites
website they advertise 30g of added
acceleration acceleration means that you
can't predict exactly where your cursor
will go and for a gaming mouse this
alone should put you off however it does
hold up in the high speed movement test
and overall accuracy isn't too bad so if
you're looking for a productivity mouse
that does a bit of gaming and don't mind
some acceleration this might be a good
choice but otherwise you might want to
look at other options and the next
option at number 5 on our list is the
Cougar 200m it's available for seventeen
dollars and is notably built better than
the previous offerings the soft touch
finish is extremely durable and it's
probably one of my favorite out of all
of these mice the shape is
well-thought-out and will fit a large
number of hand sizes even the switch
actuation was on point with the
left-right and side buttons providing
just the right amount of feedback the
scroll wheel is also really nice it's
perfectly placed and scrolling is
satisfying and smooth and the actuation
force for the middle click is just right
it's a really impressive build for under
$20 and the only thing letting it down
is some moderate sensor at all the main
reason that this isn't higher on the
list is because of the sensor firstly
the minimum dpi is only 800 with 1600
and 2000 increments available as well
the lowest setting is better than some
of the other mice in this roundup but
there isn't any custom DPI or software
based key remapping which is a shame
onto sensor performance and the 200m
also has a lot of sensor prediction as
shown here
but luckily no acceleration
unfortunately it also has issues with
Flex and can't handle faster movements
which is super unfortunate and unwanted
in a gaming mouse the design of the 200m
is good but it's let down by the sensor
and the story is similar for the fourth
on our list the a 0 GM 2400 priced at
$16 this shares a lot of similarities
with the Cougar 200m it's built well
with a very nice soft touch finish and
solid material choices and it features
outstanding build quality at the price
it's also very comfortable fitting my
hand well with some of the best comfort
of any of these mice it does exhibit
some sensor rattle but it's not too bad
I'm not sure about the blue and black
core choice but otherwise it's fine
moving on to the buttons themselves the
scroll wheel takes too much force to
actuate for me but otherwise it's fairly
decent and the primary mouse buttons use
on one switches and provide very good
feedback the sensor only has limited
DPI's once again with 800 to 1200 1600
and 2400 dpi the GM 2400 does fine on
straight line tests and it doesn't have
any acceleration once again though the
issue arises with flicking with higher
acceleration scenarios having the same
issue as other mice dropping out and not
working at higher speeds this really is
the same story as the 200m as it has a
nice body and a very comfortable design
but the sensor just isn't quite up to
par taking in the spot at number 3 on
this list is the $20 Logitech G 100 s in
many ways it's the opposite to the last
two mice placing a good sensor and
simple design first the build is pretty
unexceptional it's primarily plastic and
honestly most of the other mice have a
more premium build although there is
very little sensor at all it's not bad
for comfort it's a little small for my
hands but the curve feels natural and
there isn't anything that sticks out
uncomfortably in many ways this is a
very neutral design that's meant to
appeal to as broad a market as possible
the primary clicks are alright but it's
not using Omron switches which results
in a slightly less pronounced feedback
and my unit even has a bit of squeak on
the right clip
the mousewheel feels okay but it's also
a bit cheap you don't have any side
buttons something which I think should
have been there as even on a gaming
mouse it's nice to have those buttons
for things like microphone push-to-talk
the build and feature set seems pretty
unimpressive so why is this in third
place in short the sensor firstly you
get dpi adjustment as well as some key
remapping with Logitech's intuitive
software allowing more customization
than the other mice the G 100's does
well in the range of tests with good
results on the straight line test no
acceleration and most importantly no
issues with flicking or high-speed
movements unlike almost all of them ice
below it you can accurately flick away
with the G 100's and this consistent
sensor performance alone scores at third
place if you're looking for build
features and a better all-around Mouse
this might not be for you but its
simplicity and core features gets it
third place the runner-up spot goes to
the a zero X zero one coming in at $25
and while it's right at our maximum
price point prices tend to fluctuate
it's still the most expensive Mouse here
though the ex-01 has similar design cues
as the G 100's and also the more
expensive SteelSeries sensei with a
rounded design there's an aluminium
style plastic finish on the top and text
rubber on the sides both of which
contribute to a high-end look and feel
which seems to work well you can still
feel some of the cheaper plastics used
but overall the build is pretty
satisfactory for the price and most
importantly you don't get any sensor
rattle in this mouse actually using the
ex-01 is interesting since it features
both positive and negative points
the primary clicks are pretty good but I
don't have the same level of actuation
as some of the other mice for me they're
just slightly true hard to press making
them not quite feel as responsive
scrolling is pretty good with good
scroll steps although middle clicking is
just a touch too tough again the side
buttons are well placed and clicky but
there isn't any software once again and
they can't be remapped natively like
other mice this lack of software means
you're stuck with the profiles and this
is one of the biggest downsides of this
mouse as 1250 dpi is the minimum with
2,000 2,750 and 3500 options available
if there was a 400 dpi option this would
have made this Mouse much more
compelling
FPS gamers but it is workable
nonetheless sensor performance is also
very good it does find in the straight
line test and no acceleration is present
and very importantly for FPS gamers
flicking is completely fluid you can
easily move this mouse quickly and
through my use I didn't find any
tracking issues with this sensor if
you're a fan of this mouth design and
can live with the higher dpi then this
will probably be the best mouse on the
list figure and it's deserving of second
place and finally taking the winning
spot is the Thermaltake talon blue
coming in at 20 dollars its prices in
the middle of the pack but it offers
quite a lot of value for that money you
can check out the full review here but
let's take a look at the build and
design first the soft touch finish is
well done although a little prone to
fingerprints and all the materials feel
quite well chosen it's a little bite but
overall feels well built and pretty
solid the shape is comfortable although
the edges are a little bit hard for me
and I prefer the more rounded and curved
design of the Cougar 200m and a 0gm
2,400 in terms of those all-important
buttons scrolling is smooth the middle
click is a little tough but still
acceptable meanwhile the side browser
buttons are nearly perfect and the
primary on run switches are very good
with excellent responsiveness you can
even remove the sides to reveal a
different material although with those
removed
I found the edges a little too sharp and
a bit uncomfortable so I kept them on
the build quality seems to be very good
well above its price point so father
doesn't seem to be any major flaws so
what about the features and the sensor
the talon blue once again doesn't have
any software and relies on profiles
luckily it has a better dpi range than
anything else here with a minimum of 500
DPI as well as 750 1500 2500 and 3000
dpi while specific software based
customization is the best this is about
as good as you'll get for on-board
profiles you can tree bind any buttons
on the mouse but that's not a
deal-breaker then we'll take lists the
sensor loud and proud on their website
as the talon uses in a Vargo 30-50
center which is Spector very well for
the price tracking has been great
prediction seems fine and there isn't
any acceleration it has a max speed of
3.4 meters a second at 500 DPI
meaning flicking comes naturally we've
know lots of tracking even at
much higher speeds this Center seems to
hold up really well and there's not much
to complain about at all the Thermaltake
Talon is the most complete package here
with great comfort design build and a
great sensor it seems to do everything
well with very few flaws though it would
be nice to have a software package so
let's sum all of this info up is it
possible to get a decent gaming mouse
for less than half the price of today's
marketed alternatives absolutely some of
the mice in this roundup blew my
expectations out of the water others
just don't make sense to purchase when
there are better options available the
main thing you need to know is that any
Mouse in the sub $25 price bracket will
sacrifice somewhere be it build quality
features sensor selection and
customizability or a combination of all
of these aspects don't expect miracles
by tempering expectations there are
certainly some standouts in this round
up the a0e x01 may have a different
design but it's sensor comfort features
and build quality make it a great choice
although keep in mind that minimum dpi
is 1250 meanwhile honorable mentions
also go to the gigabyte m60 900 for a
unique design and the Logitech G 100 s
for being a simple refined addition that
has access to an excellent software
suite but the winner without a doubt the
thermal take Talyn for about 20 bucks it
offers great build quality comfortable
design good customization and very
importantly a superb sensor it's an
all-round package without any major
flaws I'm taking it with me to the next
round to compete against mice in the $25
to $50 category so that concludes this
