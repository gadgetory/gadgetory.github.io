hmm decisions decisions which one would
you choose perhaps you're looking to
invest into new monitor experience
should you go ultra wide or a more
traditional UHD the Krakken x61 by NZXT
offers fantastic cooling with the 280 mm
a radiator with long slim tubing for
easier installation and high pressure
copper cold plate you can also customize
led through the cam software so get
crackin so me having no personal
experience on the UHD side of things
LG sent us their 27 UD eighty-eight it's
a 27-inch monitor and 3840 by 2160 of
resolution at 60 Hertz and it's loaded
with relevant features for professionals
like white color gamut 10 bit IPS panel
USB see support which is so cool factory
calibration with a nice handy report and
free sync support for just that extra
smoother gameplay and before we reflect
on the 21 by 9 vs. the UHD conversation
here's everything you need to know about
this new LG panel and also we have
reviewed the widescreen here so check it
out so first I love the consistency of
the design language between these two LG
monitors with a curved aluminum base
that supports the monitor nicely with
incredibly thin bezels there's a silver
plastic housing around the monitor with
an almost flush surface it's a gorgeous
looking display with impressive
sharpness now this being only 27 inches
we get fantastic pixel density that
shows no visible pixels anywhere and the
first thing that I wanted to explore was
native 4k content and yeah I was highly
impressed having this type of native 1
to 1 pixel readout for an editor like
myself is highly beneficial
there is no upscaling there's no down
scaling just native 4k footage playback
on the native 4k display now you don't
need to be an editor to appreciate all
the detail you get out of such a panel
and you only realize how much detail
there is by being super close to it and
having this native reference again maybe
one of the best reasons to choose you
itch
over a wide screen or an ultra wide
screen we have 110 millimeters of height
adjustment with portrait mode available
something ultra wide monitors do not
support plus 23 degrees of angle
adjustment the back is covered with
white plastic it helps to lighten the
monitor and it looks super clean too
with dual HDMI 2.0 dual USB 3 1
DisplayPort 1.2 a headphone jack plus
that one major selling point use bc that
supports 4k at 60 Hertz plus data
transfer and to power your source
notebook up to 60 watts so for example
if you plug in your macbook that has USB
C port it will charge the macbook while
also allowing you to transfer USB stuff
over the through the monitor and also
pass all that digital data to and one
meter USBC cable is included and this
minimalist direction
thanks to type C is so tempting it's now
just a matter of mobile devices
utilizing USB type-c more often a few
more cables are included like hdmi
displayport and a USB pass-through plus
all your power cables and now let's
shift focus towards the conversation to
compare the UHD vs. 21 by 9 and I gotta
admit that the user experience on both
these formats is completely different so
for comparison here's the LG 34 UC 98
it's a 34 inch monitor that is curved it
falls in the same technical realm as the
UHD monitor with the IPS 10 bit panel at
34 40 by 1440p resolution and despite
the smaller 27-inch panel having 33 more
pixels I would say productivity on the
ultra wide is better so having two
windows a side by side is more
comfortable video editors love the
horizontal real estate for the time line
and it just feels really good to shift
away from the conventional sixteen by
nine aspect and we almost have this
deceptive perception of having more
screen real estate on the ultra wide
versus the 4k screen where in reality
that's not really the case you have more
pixels on the 4k display but it feels
like you have more room to work with on
the ultra wide next is media consumption
and either of these have their strengths
and their compromises so thin content
looks amazing on the white screen
occupying full length of the panel but
all other content leaves black bars on
either side while you also run into
black bars above and below media on the
sixteen by nine aspect that isn't native
to that aspect so one awesome advantage
of most widescreen panels is the high
refresh rate due to lower resolution so
with the UC 98 it's going up to 75 Hertz
without sacrificing on the panel quality
it's still IPS it's still 10 bit while
the IPS UHD monitors are quite hard to
find with anything above 60 Hertz now
both of these actually support free sync
which is awesome the range on the UHD
panel is slightly better on the lower
end so it's going to 40 to 60 Hertz
which is fine for 4k it's a good low
minimum of 40 Hertz but only ultra wide
it's between 59 and 75 Hertz which means
your gaming experience at the lower
frame rates will suffer due to such high
minimum so this is a perfect transition
into gaming and 21 by 9 gaming is
absolutely unique don't be afraid by
some non supported resolution at 21 by 9
for certain games because that format is
becoming so popular that we'll
eventually have 21 by 9 support
resolution across the board and so it
feels amazing wide horizontal field of
view you see more I had a blast doing a
run-through with Tomb Raider and this
was actually beneficial and Victoire and
it's a hack and slash game where you see
more of the map and therefore you can
avoid going to certain directions
because of this top-down view and that
is based on my own experience with the
ultra wide panel as some strategy games
do not exactly utilize the widescreen
format so well so the menu and the UI do
not exactly crop to cooperate and this
is where UHD and having that extra
verticals of resolution is important for
software like AutoCAD and Sketchup since
gaining the extra vertical resolution is
more important than gaining that why
there is Liu
and we right now do not have a
widescreen monitor that is 2160 pixels
in the vertical resolution so UHD is
more optimal for those scenarios UHD on
the other hand looks incredibly sharp
provided you have the means to run in
this resolution but the real gaming
drawback for me is the refresh rate
having lived with dual 144 hertz
monitors 60 Hertz on a 4k display just
doesn't feel so great because everything
feels a little bit too slow
now most ultra wide monitors are curved
which is a positive it sort of wraps
around slightly around your vision for a
positive effect but also that skews all
your lines on the screen and why I
cannot use it for editing since I lose
reference to my line composition but the
curve is awesome for everything else
while UHD is fantastic for creative work
especially with compatible 10-bit
hardware so my MacBook Pro supports 10
bit output which means gradients and
color transitions are much smoother and
the same goes for the ultra wide
comparing backlight bleed between the
two panels you can see that the large
monitor has some more distinct brighter
spots while our UHD monitor also has
some corner bleed but it looks smoother
and so this battle between 21 by 9
versus UHD format is quite vague because
both these monitors serve their unique
purpose I for one absolutely love 21 by
9 for gaming you have a nice wide field
of view without compromising on the
quality and general productivity -
because I feel like I have more space on
the screen ultra wide this also made me
explore the depth of the internet for
Tru 21 by 9 media which has given me
goosebumps and that consumption and that
experience alone is totally worth it but
anything curved on the screen is a big
no for me especially for anything
creative because I need my lines to be
straight so that I have a good
perception of my composition and this is
where the UHD monitor is I would say
King with fantastic detail great
resolution even built-in aspect markers
to help in some cases while not super
ideal for gaming
because it's quite difficult to run in
this resolution and it's only 60 Hertz I
would choose high refresh rate over high
resolution any day and 99% of the media
that we consume is still presented in
the 16 by 9 aspect which means this UHD
format is a lot more enjoyable for most
media as I hate the black bars on left
and right on the ultra wide and so if I
was to choose one between these two
options I would definitely gravitate
more towards the ultra white since it
offers a bit more unique visual
interaction compared to the traditional
sixteen by nine monitor and also a very
important and for Windows users scaling
at 34 40 by 1440 resolution is so much
better compared to UHD resolution
whereas with UHD I have to scale
everything to 150% maybe 125 percent in
order to see everything clearly without
having to be super close to the screen
and everything being super tiny and in
this case you're kind of losing out on
the real estate just everything looks a
lot tiny a little bit sharper but when I
was running the MacBook Pro with both
monitors scaling was fantastic on both
monitors without any issues so if you
are a Mac user definitely the UHD is a
much better option because scaling is so
much better and that concludes this
video on dmitri with our canucks thanks
so much for watching which one would you
choose Ultra wide screen or UHD let us
know in the comments down below we'll
see you in the next video
