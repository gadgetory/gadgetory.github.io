delivery all right thanks
whoo all right good people so it is time
for the one plus six
hi I'm looking for a case well look no
further I got this beauty the age 700 i
buy NZXT with all steal premium frame
with a side of tempered glass -
beautifully showcase any cooling
adventure you might pursue and came a
management system that you wish you had
earlier all this lit up with integrated
RGB lighting and built-in fan control
the age 700 I this one's for you I'll
take it alright so the one plus six for
me has been sort of a mixed experience
from the beginning this is my first
notched phone I don't really like the
glass back the included screen protector
is super soft and I recommend removing
it for a far superior touch interface
and for the first week this thing was
super buggy so the fingerprint scanner
would just not work at all with me
pressing it multiple times
lots of app crashes the camera was super
slow and it's very odd for a phone
that's all about speed you know and
while it is priced competitively yet
still higher than the five T when that
was launched I was expecting a more
polished delivery luckily an OTA update
fixed pretty much everything because I
was getting ready to go back to my 5 T
but then it clicked that one plus 6 is
there to give users that fresh
perspective not just from the
traditional Android customization but
from the knotch perspective too by
enabling it or disabling it plus having
the option to enable gestures control
and remove the on-screen buttons which
are all great elements for that user
customization and if you're like me and
like to change up your wallpaper every
once in a while you know all these
additional customization controls are
like that additional backup of Arsenal
for you to play around with and you know
make you feel like you have a fresh
device in your hand now I've been using
the 5 T ever since launch and there are
a few build differences first one is the
glass pack which looks fantastic on
video those beautiful reflections really
help to sell you this like gorgeous and
premium device and it actually feels
great in the hand - as long as you cover
some of that glass back with finger oils
and after a full day of use it is an
unpleasant reminder to wash your hands
as often as possible and this is where
the previous aluminum body will actually
looks better after a full day of use by
the glass know
is grippier it also scratches easier so
only after three weeks of use the entire
left side is somehow covered in these
small visible scratches and the full
bottom two so a skin or a case is
definitely required just to avoid seeing
the smudges on the glass and preserve
the resell value in the six months time
when the eventual 60 comes out
seriously the six month cycle of new
devices from oneplus is awesome but how
would you feel if you you know picked up
the five T recently and the six comes
out which is you know in all aspects
better I do love the traditional
sandstone cover it feels great with the
cutouts around the buttons and the new
nylon case is more of a bumper and
provides a confident grip the alert
slider is now above the power button I
love this physical switch but they have
replaced the do not disturb function
with the vibration mode instead so all
incoming notifications will vibrate
instead of only the select favorites
like we had on a 5t but the Do Not
Disturb mode is still part of the quick
settings instead all buttons have
satisfying clicky registration but the
vibration motor still sucks it's audible
on a table but not in your pocket
the fingerprint sensor is less tactile
and easy to miss I like the harder edges
on the aluminum frame and we still have
the face unlock that super fast no doubt
and you can either unlock directly into
the home screen or allow you to view the
notifications but it is not secure and
will unlock with like a face print out
it does not recognize me with a hat and
it even unlocks at like extreme angles
like this where I would not be looking
at the camera and then would still
unlock the phone the camera bump is now
centered for that symmetry with sharper
housing and you get some wobble in the
surface but whatever and coal quality
and speakerphone are totally fine no
complaints here just don't cover the
single speaker at the bottom the
headphone jack is actually quite
powerful really good to drive headphones
and I don't mind the lack of wireless
charging because that charging is the
reason I actually disabled the battery
percentage I never worried about this
thing running out of juice because you
know you can plug this thing for 20
minutes get like 40 percent additional
battery life it's awesome
I only plug it in occasionally when that
was on really at the bottom and never
have to worry
battery life great the rest of the
changes appear at the front with rounder
screen edges very pixel to excel ish a
slightly smaller bottom chambers of the
5 T and that height extension around
knotch so you get a taller 1080p display
with 19 by 9 aspect ratio it's still a
pentile matrix but I'm not complaining
it's a good panel with D blacks and
color calibration available I keep mine
on the p3 profile for that slightly
natural saturation boost the clock is
now on the left side of the knotch and
I've actually gone to like the black
space despite how the proportions feel
off like that slight angle on the sides
that doesn't really match the curvature
of the corners but hiding the notch is
of course an option and one way to
revive the freshness of the device the
only complaint here though the top
curvature does not match the bottom
corners when the notch is hidden but I'm
really happy that we have per app
control of how the notch is used in full
screen mode so for example I don't mind
the not being there all the time except
for video playback because you know the
left side just looks terrible so I can
disable the knotch for example just for
YouTube and enjoy my full experience
there without the knotch
but exiting to any other app and the
knotch returns the execution here with
an arch is fantastic and takes into
account user preference the rest of the
software experience should be familiar
and smooth you can change the system
font color accent enable ambient wake to
glance at incoming notifications assign
all types of gestures like three-finger
screenshot that would have to wake or
lock and even enable navigation gestures
that work really well but are slightly
slower versus traditional buttons and
for a large phone like it it may be
uncomfortable to use i love the warmer
tones for reading mode and per app
activation or gaming mode that disables
notifications and overall the touch
interface feels great but there are
slowdowns when launching the camera from
the lockscreen
it just takes a you know second too long
to load for some reason and 4 out of the
5 times I hear the unlock sound effect
before the screen wakes up giving me the
perception of lag
now I found that if I disable the face
unlock I can get into the camera quicker
and unlocks my phone faster - it's like
almost instantaneous you don't have the
lag in the sound effect you no delay so
potentially disable the face unlock to
get a smoother experience now me
handling cameras all day I like with the
1 plus 6 captures it maintains the right
amount of contrast and color with good
dynamic range but keep away from harsh
light because it flares easily and can
ruin photos the portrait mode is
fantastic subject isolation is excellent
while keeping the same field of view and
I use this all the time for that fancy
camera look the selfie cam was decent
but it's not good for group shots as it
naturally blurs out the background so
I'm the only one in focus all the time
and we also now have this portrait mode
for selfie cam that over sharpen the
subject to emphasize what's in focus and
you also get that bokeh shape
customization with either larger circles
hearts or stars and it actually
remembers your settings so don't forget
to disable it as for video modes 4k 60
is here with stabilization focus in
detail that is awesome plus I love the
slow-motion then you can record for full
minutes and then cut out only what's
needed
the phone definitely gets soaked in the
mist it is water-resistant just don't
swim with it and so it's interesting how
the oneplus six has turned around on me
you know as with everything that's non
satisfactory you kind of adapt and with
this one I didn't really like it in the
beginning but then I put the case over
the glass I can figure the notch
accordingly the same both face unlock
and run it picks a launcher and you know
it's not that different from the five or
the five t1 plus is moving along with
the market trends with the notch in the
glass back but if you're potentially
thinking of upgrading from the five or
the five t potentially wait for the 60
because that may be a larger incremental
differences versus what you received
wouldn't want plus six this is a great
phone I will be upgrading from a five t
I like one pluses direction in terms of
cleanliness of the software with their
oxygen the West fast updates beautiful
hardware and I'm actually super excited
to see how they can improve on the next
generation and like how can they step up
their game with 60 but the guests will
have to wait and see all right guys I'm
