brought to you by and say XCOM
technology connected hey guys i'm
dimitri and this is matt and we are here
in vegas as you can see behind us a nice
beautiful bokeh with all these shining
lights my first time in vegas very
excited to see what CES has to bring to
2014 so mad what are some of the trends
that we are expected to see at CES 2014
you know one of the things that I'm
really excited for is I think this is
going to be the first year that we're
really going to see the polar if eration
of mobile tech or wearable tech so I
think we're to see a lot of like act of
wristbands we're gonna get a lot of
companies like I think LG's rumored to
be launching some sort of like a
SmartWatch that'll be sort of like a
sports utility but also have like the an
improvement on what the Samsung gear
should have been plus I want to be
surprised to see another samsung gear
hit the ground there's going to be quite
a bit of exciting news coming from
mobile displays as well as standard
displays so standard displays so for gay
we're done for I think that we're going
to be seeing a lot of more
consumer-grade AKA affordable 4k
displays 4k monitors now whether it be
like a brand new TV or a 20 inch LED
panel yeah 4k right now is a little bit
iffy in terms of refresh rate so there's
some cheaper or say let's a consumer
level 4k televisions available but
they're only a 30 Hertz which is you
know a lot of this would not be suitable
for gaming in any way for TV viewing
this would be might be okay but you know
if you into sports and viewing all that
it's not to that level also I think
we're seeing porque tu like you said to
be become more popular since 4k content
is now becoming more available so I
think Netflix starts to stream in 4k now
so there is now more content for 4k and
exactly like we said that year ago from
previous show that 4k is now emerging
into the market what else are we excited
answer another really cool thing coming
out is actually you know what here's
what i like to call it easy
there's some stuff coming out from AMD
and NVIDIA let's go and find out what
alright guys so now i'm here with sam
you guys probably remember him from
computex last year he was my co body /
cameraman / reporter so he is our
previous news editor for harbor Canucks
now he's move on to vr-zone so you last
time we saw him you were in Taipei and
you stayed in Taipei I didn't leave it
was so good I couldn't leave yeah well
looks like it's it is a lot of fun
anybody who's got a chance to visit so
aim d and video are here at CES we are
about to see something very major from
AMD this is their kaveri apu their
latest apu integrating HSA which is
heterogeneous system architecture so are
you excited about kaveri apu and what
are we to see this moving forward i'm
curious knock started the question is
will HSA bring gamers and most users a
noticeable increase in performance you
know am the estella money putting
together the HSA foundation and Game
people on board HSA the question is now
will that work so Kaveri has been
delayed at computex and say yes last
year they promised Kaveri be out in 2013
now we're at 2014 and it's don't look
very so this lights despite promises
from lisa stewart computex of a late
2013 launch will now be launched our
next month or in march and so nvidia is
launching logan or sort of we can be
seeing logan which is the Tegra 5 there
SOC is this going to be a response
towards Kaveri or is this something
different I would say no Tegra is more
designed for mobile applications so
smart phones and tablets there are some
OEMs like HP who want to create take or
power at all on PCs but the market does
not really have an appetite for that
with the tegra chip and up pc you cannot
run usual applications so you can run
windows or your favorite apps like with
the surface people got the surface
around windows but it wouldn't run the
rigor apps because it was arm-based
papers also arm-based and cameron x86
apps
now the question is you know why tabor
five Tegra 4 came out sat CS last year
but OEMs were not excitable that's I
mean I can name perhaps a handful
devices that use waiting for exactly
right none of these big devices you
gotta do take er tablets some stuff from
Toshiba and a sous but nothing really
groundbreaking aside from the shield
exactly right but the game is nvidia
thing so precisely yeah it's the
question is take or five what's the
point right why are they putting this
effort into launching the chip that
perhaps no one wants mm-hmm well thanks
your for your insights am exactly what
we are to seeing for the Nvidia and AMD
it's about to come and see yes very
excited to see so thanks Sam for joining
us here at haruka docks thank you all
right so guys we are super excited for
CES 2014 we visiting a ton of vendors
all really excited to see what they have
in stock on the shelves for 2014 so make
sure to subscribe and follow us on
Twitter and to see exactly where would
be perhaps meet us as well and we'll see
you guys on the show floor for the rest
of the CES 2014 coverage recording you

man's cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
