scale of having the ability to zone
people out so what happened all of these
are the Sennheiser momentum Indian
Wireless coupe review review
check this out the fans XP 400 s which
is one of the best mint hours on the
market got a sexy outrage now with a
tempered glass side panel with a
comfortable rubberized mount to show off
your gorgeous system with an RGB LED
strip included get your glass on with
the Fant XP 400 s plans not included so
wireless headphones sure are convenient
but you also have to pay for that
convenience because pretty much any
wireless quality pair is quite expensive
including this the sennheiser momentum
on-ear Wireless goes to $500 yes so
let's see if the momentum in your
wireless lives up to the momentum
reputation and don't judge me but also
let me know if you agree but don't these
look ridiculous when they're on you one
walk around is to wrap the cable on the
inside so that it doesn't spin out as
much see looks much better so
interestingly this pair sort of fills
that gap of being Wireless in the air
quality headphone without it being sort
of focused on the athletic aspect of
being waterproof and you use it to
exercise but this is more of an elegant
approach towards that lifestyle of
wireless audio but I still think it
looks ridiculous unless you route the
cable from the inside like I said
earlier now I really do appreciate this
entire approach for this very
comfortable very lightweight leather
body that goes around your neck so you
don't really feel it that's very smooth
leather and there's absolutely no
friction against your skin and it goes
very well with t-shirts as you can see
there's nothing overlapping it and just
sits on on my neck just fine however if
you go with a shirt as you can see it
looks a little bit more intrusive and
has to wrap around your collar and I
guess depending on the collar size you
might potentially be able to tuck it
underneath it but yes wear accordingly
based on your t-shirts shirts suits and
stuff I do appreciate this very flexible
yet constant neck band it feels like it
might take some abuse if you're not
carrying it inside the pouch which by
the way is included it's nice it's a
little bit on the larger size however it
is a very thin profile and it doesn't it
feels like you're presenting jewelry to
someone and I'm pretty sure that was the
hole and
and despite it being you know somewhat
functional and having a very nice
comfortable area at the back so you can
hold it while you present it to someone
jewelry anyone yeah and as part of
accessories mic USB cable is included
along with three extra silicon ear tips
so you can find your own size I do
appreciate the overall design aesthetic
of red stitching the leather the almost
velvety plastics with just some Heiser
text on one side some Heiser logo on the
other they are chrome and they reflect
at certain angles but they're not in any
way flashy and I do appreciate the non
tangle black and red cable but my
favorite part has to be the chrome
plated ear tips they look absolutely
fantastic again showing you a bit of
premium but without going in the already
flashy route now this is one your
nesting pairs of India wireless
headphones that you don't have to worry
about losing because they stay on your
neck now they're not going anywhere but
I wonder and maybe you are too as to why
this pair has to be sort of this large
why couldn't they make it smaller maybe
it's because they couldn't make the the
main plastic pieces any smaller for the
bluetooth module or the controller
module you know there's an NFC point
here the vibration motor there's a lot
of tech built into it but it's just to
be great if they were a little bit more
discreet especially with the neck band
you know it's comfortable this way but
it would be great if it was slightly bit
slimmer and maybe these plastic pieces
slightly reduced in size because you
know we have the air pods and they're
small and they're other you know
Wireless in ear headphones that are much
smaller and more compact this is okay
size wise but it's not exactly
competitive I would not recommend
exercising with them not because they're
heavy or anything they're super
lightweight you don't really feel them
but you know if you're doing something
more intensive it does move around the
base because it's very lightweight now
one really awesome thing about the
momentum in their Wireless is a built in
vibration motor I don't think it's on
the entire neck band I think it's just
built in into the left side and it
vibrates when you're receiving phone
calls it vibrates when your battery is
low so not only do you get audio cues
saying your battery's low but you also
get that little triple vibration
feedback knowing when to charge it and
that's pretty awesome because if the
headphones are like this on my body I'm
not exactly
since them and I was to receive a phone
call I would get that vibration
indication without having to hear it you
know if I'm on like stylus mode or
something so that's a pretty awesome
feature that you will not find on any
other wireless in your headphone when it
comes to the controls everything is on
the left side which is easily reachable
with your left or right hand so we have
a power button we have an LED indication
for Bluetooth connectivity there's a
microphone plus minus buttons along with
that central button so interestingly the
plus and minus are a little bit swapped
because you know when I'm reaching in to
let's say adjust the volume I'm assuming
that I'll be turning up the volume but
that plus button is all the way at the
back so intuitively I would think that
they would place the plus button at the
front because it's the easiest one to
reach and it's also you use them to
switch tracks so if you want to switch
track for words you'd have to reach all
the way back and press that button for
two seconds instead of pressing the
minus button which is at the very front
which is what I would initially want to
reach for if I want to switch tracks
forward it's a little bit unintuitive
but once you know where the buttons are
located it's fine these are bluetooth
4.1 with support for a Flex codec AAC
and SBC and it has an NFC chip on the
right side of the neck band so you
simply touch your phone and connect it
BAM no longer do you have to go into the
Bluetooth settings select your device
and stuff everything is automatic almost
just as simple as simply opening a box
so now I'll talk about my experience
with the audio and the first thing I
want to mention is the volume range is
excellent so there's a lot of power in
here I would was never able to listen to
even at like 90% volume I always had to
go below and there's very nice volume
intervals so you can dial in your
preferred volume no problem as for the
sound signature itself it follows in the
footsteps of the wired momentum in years
so it's a very bright extension a lot of
emphasis on the treble a lot of detail
and the sound signature and the bass is
so good but it's only so good if you get
the right gear tips and really kind of
put these into your ears very snug
otherwise if the silicone pads are a
little bit too large and they don't
create that seal you don't get isolation
and everything
sounds flat so make sure that you know
you can fine-tune the silicon ear tips
because the silicon ear tips here they
really make the sound signature because
when they're not completely snug it just
doesn't sound right now I do prefer this
brighter sound extension but in some
instances I actually had to turn the
volume down because the treble and the
high end became way too harsh and this
is listening music through Spotify
through extreme quality with music
downloaded on my smart phone now when
compared to the rh8 t10 eyes that cost
just as much as the Sunrisers the RHA is
delivered more muddy air base it wasn't
as pronounced and the detail just wasn't
there so it's a very smooth roll-off on
the higher end but the detail that the
decent hyzer stick up is just astounding
so if you prefer that that brighter
sound signature then definitely check
these out and the last thing i want to
mention is the Sennheiser cap tune app
it's a great idea because within it you
can change the EQ settings and just
basically play around with different you
know profiles for different sign Heiser
headphones
however the equalizer or the custom
equalizer settings are not global so
they don't translate over to your
streaming music or YouTube playback this
is only for your local media being
played back through captains so it's a
little bit pointless because you can do
the same thing on power amp which is a
much more powerful music player and last
thing I want to mention is there's no
way to know the battery life on Android
unless you would say turn on the
headphone and you hear the low battery
notification
however on iOS through Captain you have
the battery status bar which is
excellent I don't know why that's not
available on Android and as for the
battery life itself I got the volt
battery notification and the vibration
about after five days of casual
listening so that's while cooking while
shooting something while going to the
park and I would use these as I would
with a wired pair of headphones you know
of how much I would be listening to with
podcasts and music and etc so in that
sense it's pretty good and especially
with this being recharged in just an
hour and a half it's
great and so it's clear that the
wireless direction for headphones is the
way forward I mean you know Apple
already ditched the headphone jack let's
see who's going to be next and it's
great to see the momentum Wireless line
growing because these are actually
pretty decent with pleasing sound
signature if you're into the bright
extension with a lot of detail they have
good battery life
nice hidden controls and the C pairing
and they look pretty awesome too there
are some quirks though like having to
reroute the cable every time you put
them on so they don't look ridiculous
there is no battery life indicator for
Android and the plus and minus buttons
are swapped which is a little bit
inconvenient oh hey there ncx comm is
Canada's leading a tailor for anything
your mind desires just keep within those
categories which are plenty and get
tempted by the weekly deals visit mcx or
compare all them sweet deals it is
double the price over the momentum in
years
but the premium is of course expected
when you go wireless
thanks for watching we'll see you in the
next video the middle button also has
that little nipple</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
