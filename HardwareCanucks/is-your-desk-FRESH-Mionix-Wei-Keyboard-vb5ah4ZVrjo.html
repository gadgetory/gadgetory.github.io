moving boy going on brush step coming
right up
so this is an interesting approach for
my onyx to freshen up the deck I like it
let's check it out right after this the
NZXT Hugh plots lighting control hub is
now available in the white frame to
complement the white NZXT monta gates or
other white beam builds for best
Hardware color coordination with enough
extensions included and is used to
control the for very bright RGB LED
strips or the air RGB fans all through
the hue plus hub check it out in the
description below alright so this idea
of introducing color through your
peripherals to spice up your setup is
not exactly new we've seen many gaming
peripherals and standard keyboards and
mice come with different color options
but my onyx is approaching and from a
different perspective that all revolves
the one there one key launch product
their new keyboard the way the price
point is a little bit expensive at $159
there are many other minimalist options
available in the market right now but
they're targeting this for gamers and
also artists so they're kind of moving
themselves away from the whole game area
peels so there's a zero gaming
aesthetics on this keyboard it's very
minimal I love the gray accent on the
key caps on the body there's absolutely
no bulk surrounding the frame so it is
what it is they do not they would
include secondary characters on your
numbers row so you have to kind of
remember where the dollar sign is where
the plus sign equal sign all that stuff
is but I do appreciate the built-in
media controls right on the top right
corner along with the LED control which
is right beside their even their
branding is limited so there's a single
logo on the main front plate on the
bottom right and there's also a logo
surrounded by this yellow rubber on the
left side the keyboard cannot be raised
or angled so it is what it is there's
this single large piece of rubber at the
bottom so the keyboard has very good
stability alongside that my onyx logo
but I wish that we could have listed the
keyboard slightly because it is pretty
flat the keyboard feels solid there is
an aluminum plate in the top so despite
it being so thin
there is almost no flex and finally the
cable that is exiting the keyboard has
this bit of coil not exactly sure why
that is design-wise it looks kinda cool
but functionally it doesn't really work
because the coil is very tight so you
have to stretch it you have to somewhat
lock the cable somewhere in order to you
know what
the stretch otherwise it's kind of
pointless now this is a mechanical
keyboard and initially on their Amazon
page it said that it was a cherry
silence RGB red switch that can be
misleading because it's not the silent
switch it's an MX red switch so after
that after my conversation they did
clarify exactly what it is on the Amazon
page so there is no longer confusion
this is MX Reds and not the silent
switch now the software is pretty basic
so you can do color customization perky
or selecting multiple by holding ctrl
the effects are nice but quite limited
not as many as we see on like gaming
specific keyboards and Mac's the
customization is available to note all
the keys on the keyboard but majority of
them which is fine
so now let's talk about the accessory so
the pads and the key caps so the cool
thing about the key cap says they come
in three different colors and they
correspond to this sort of idea of you
know the yellow being fries the pink one
being the frosting for like donuts and
then the blue one minty ice cream sort
of so they're going for these theme
that's related to food and then there's
the gray one which is the shark fin
which is not lit exactly sustainable not
exactly politically correct for a
company to do but shark fin soup that's
where they're referring to is referred
to as like the luxury meal or like the
dish that they served in Asia for like
weddings and stuff of that so they're
targeting the Asian market alongside
having this you know their traditional
North American food items so that they
could spend maybe a larger target
audience so we have the pads which can
be used as your wrist rest or can
actually be used as a mousepad you know
if you like or if you can use it in that
format I mean it's very long doesn't
have much wiggle room for the width so
if you use a really high DPI Mouse
perhaps you can use it but it's not
exactly recommended it's mainly intended
to be used for your wrist rest to be
placed underneath the keyboard so the
pad is very thick it's very flexible
it's comfortable
very nice detailed print on here feels
kind of nice and silky smooth doesn't
produce any harsh sounded from the week
I've used it has produced a zero
irritation on my skin the only thing
though doesn't really smell that great
they smell very rubbery like
tires and I've had these for a week now
and they still smell but I'm told the
smell sort of gradually rolls away with
use and let's hope that is the case
price-wise they are $15 a piece which I
would say it's okay they do provide a
nice comfort and because the keyboard
because how flat it is you probably want
to position it further away from you so
you have more forearm space on the desk
and therefore this would complement the
keyword very well I do like the little
Easter eggs they planted on the graphics
on the pads so on the blue one we have a
shark fin that's been bitten on the
black one and the yellow one we have a
fry that's been dipped in ketchup
although it does look pink so I'm not
exactly sure what's happening there and
on the pink one we have a bitten
doughnut so now we'll talk about the key
caps which are $35 percent with three
colors available so if you were to go
for the whole suite over the pad the key
caps and the keyboard way you're looking
at 210 US dollars which is a little
steep but will give you that full unique
cohesion between your peripherals I am a
little bit disappointed with the key
caps because the edges are not exactly
refined you can find some rough plastic
on some key caps there's also this weird
black smudges and black particles that
are been scattered underneath the key
caps and I'm thinking that is because of
the included key cap pull er that is
inside the same bag and maybe during you
know during motion it kind of chips away
and like leaves residue all over it's
just not something you want to find on
the key cap because the color is vibrant
so anything that is foreign in color
really sticks out and it's just not
pleasant
they are MX stem compatible so you could
potentially use them on a different
keyboard of yours and they come in this
full set as you can select from and also
additional key caps are included in this
set in case you're using a different
layout keyboard for example there are
different sized space bars different
enter keys and different alts the extra
controls and all the keys that are
associated with those changes and I
appreciate all the color diversity so
you can customize different pads with
different key caps and really make your
setup unique now I wish there was a way
from a Onyx to include smaller selection
and smaller sets of the key caps so you
can customize your keyboard in something
like this
you know having different colors for
some of those accented key caps but
having the base in that standard gray
the one thing to keep in mind with the
key caps is the transparency because the
LED on the switch is at the top and
therefore it does not create that
uniform illumination on the key cap
itself it looks fine in daylight when
you don't see the illumination but
during darker conditions is just not
that pretty in terms of the color
matching between the past and the key
caps it's not 100% but it's pretty close
and it keeps within that same color
family so it's passable instead of the
yellow toe I would have loved to see
orange because orange with the teal blue
and that pink I think would have been a
better combination if you're trying to
combine all three then having yellow in
there so what do you guys think of this
whole concept of getting a fresh desk
with these different color paths of the
key caps the my Onyx weight keyboard is
okay it's got a nice basic format I
think it's still a little bit a little
bit on the expensive side to be
considered sort of competitive because
you can get very simple looking
keyboards that are not gray that in the
black format but still choose you know
one of the key caps for my onyx if you
want to go that route and customize them
with those different pants my main point
of feedback would be to increased
quality of those key caps because it's a
good product it would complement a high
quality product like the way but it just
doesn't fit in terms of having those
edges not refined and having these black
particles and having the transparency
being an issue when it's illuminated
from the bottom and I'm really excited
for this to be on the market because now
you can add a touch of color not through
just RGB illumination alone but through
these different peripherals like a mouse
pad or the key cap always they charged
with linking power up power banks how's
them gorgeous aluminum enclosure with
dual USB and type-c port with support
for quick charge 3.0 to get your
device's recharged fast available up to
twenty thousand one hundred million
power capacities check them out in
description below so guys are you
getting yourself freshdesk let me know
and also here to add one piece of food
item on this whole theme to the pad what
would it be let me know in the comment
down below thanks so much for watching
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
