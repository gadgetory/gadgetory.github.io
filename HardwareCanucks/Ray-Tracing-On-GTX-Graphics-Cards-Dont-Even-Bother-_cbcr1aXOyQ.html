works oh man how great would it be to
have RTX and DXR features on gtx
cards well it looks like with a simple
driver update it is now we're gonna turn
it on together and video RTX real
time ray tracing and so let's test the
gtx performance with ray tracing and DXR
features I have some GTX cards some
RTX cards my open bench is ready to go
let's begin
all right so what does it mean for
existing GTX users now that you can
enable ray tracing and experience those
visuals and a nice hit on performance -
just like the rest of the rtx owners
but I feel like this approach has
multi-layered consequence so it's better
for developers now that they can use gtx
hardware instead of rtx hardware and
experiment with ray tracing
implementation and the optimization for
gamers you can now just experience the
visuals so see what it's like to have
ray tracing in-game you know be a five
Metro Exodus and shadow of the Tomb
Raider and potentially will this nudge
you to get rtx hardware probably not
but we'll see and so I hope this will
open up a stream of games that have some
form of arty implementation either
shadows reflections ambient occlusion or
global illumination or any other
technique and so a ray tracing for the
gtx cards starts at gtx 1060 6gb version
goes all the way up to the turing
cards 1660 ti and so on my
table today i have a gtx 1060 GTX 1080
Titan XP rtx 2060 and the rtx 2080 Ti
to see how that entire stack of cards
performs so first of all as Jensen said
it just works outside of updating your
Nvidia drivers and making sure you're on
the latest Windows OS the 1809 you
don't have to tinker with anything
in-game you know all the RT and DXR are
features should be visible to you with
your gtx hardware now as I've said in my
previous analysis of bf5 and metro
Exodus rate racing has a massive
potential to improve your overall
immersion of the gameplay as long as the
environment fits the whole ray-tracing
you know delivery so as long as the
environment is a major part of your
observation and game you know
ray-tracing from my standpoint is
improved
now bf5 is not that with its fast paced
shooter mechanic in which you don't
really have time to stop and admire the
reflections on wet surfaces or other
reflective surfaces but with this update
you can with gtx graphics see those
reflections in action but only from like
a demo perspective as the FPS hit is
actually quite significant so what
you're watching now is running on the
gtx 1080 FTW by EVGA and 8700k
4.9 gigahertz and the game is running at
1080p resolution with medium quality
settings and since only the reflections
are ray-traced
the visual difference in like 95% of the
gameplay is not noticeable but at least
we hit over 60 FPS with DXR enabled I
won't recommend it since it doesn't
really benefit the overall gameplay
experience but Metro Exodus is another
story so with this game I feel they've
done a fantastic job with global
illumination to improve the overall game
world and since this is a story driven
game I would recommend replaying it with
rt enabled if you can now the
performance hit is massive however you
can see over a hundred FPS difference
with my GTX 1080 at 1080p resolution
with medium settings and high arty
preset so again this game becomes almost
like a demo of what's possible with
great racing like the darkness gradient
of the sewer entrance you know it's very
realistic versus it being totally
illuminated by conventional means when
the arty is off now the reason why we're
seeing such a significant hit on
performance with gtx cards is because
all the ray-tracing is rendered on
standard raster course instead of the
dedicated arty course on the rtx
graphics so of course that is inevitable
now in terms of sli performance with ray
tracing and gtx Hardware we were told
that at first it's not possible and then
that some games might implement it and
it's kind of game dependent so I would
say SLI would rate racing would gtx
hardware is kind of a write-off and so
here's the performance breakdown with my
five cards the interesting thing is that
my Titanic speed collector's edition
outperforms the RTX 2060 both and DXR
on and off which is quite
interesting to see but of course all
that changes when we move to Metro
Exodus so here we're using global
illumination for our ray-traced
technique and I think that is a lot more
intensive so not just reflections but
like all that light scattering around
surfaces and interacting with objects
and looks like a lot more computational
intensive for the RT cores or the
raster course in this example moving on
to the atomic hard demo at 1080p so this
one yeah it's a bit challenging
if you
are willing to sit through about 10 FPS
on average with a GTX 1060 just to see
some you know beautiful graphics running
at the really low framerate be my guest
and even with my 2080 ti it's still
quite difficult to run and the same
story continues with Port Royale
benchmark this one's running at 1440p so
we're stepping up the resolution but
again you know I mean those average
frame rates on the gtx hardware is kind
of laughable but it's also very low on
the rtx hardware so just shows how
demanding this you know ray trace
benchmark really is and so the takeaway
is that ray tracing works on gtx
hardware now no problems I haven't
experienced any crashes or any like
visual differences between rtx hardware
and gtx hardware so that's a good thing
it's almost like it's enticing gtx
owners to consider playing around with
rt features and DXR and certain games
and some demos to see what they're
missing out on but like we literally
have only three games with you know
these ray-traced techniques apply to
them so it's it's not worth it just yet
but it does give you a look glimpse or
like which direction we're heading in
and I'm hoping that we'll see more like
good implementation of ray tracing in
future titles not just reflections but
like global illumination and shadows so
that it like builds this visual beauty
into the game world that makes sense and
is not just there for a tech demo get a

drivers play around with it and let me
know what you think of it in the
comments below I'm a Dmitry thanks so
much for watching if you haven't checked
out my analysis of previous rtx
implementations make sure to do so and
yeah I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
