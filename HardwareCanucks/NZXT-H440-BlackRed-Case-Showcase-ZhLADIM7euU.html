networks ultimate power uncompromised
speed meet the Linksys wrt54g
of the very popular age for 40 from NC
XD the white and black version was
released earlier and we received so many
requests to showcase the different color
scheme of the aged 440 now before we
begin if you have not yet seen our
original review of the white h 440 make
sure to check that out if you're
interested
quickly to recap the age of 40 is
designed with silence in mind offering
pretty excellent water cooling options
and that's why the decision was to omit
the optical drive the chassis itself is
considered to be a mid tower and NZXT
has for the majority of its cases took
space efficiency seriously and the H 440
is no exception
the elegant and the very simple design
is what I think gravitated many builders
towards the chassis but it's also the
internal layout and the features that
make this one of the best in the class
now regarding the color they're still
going for the glossy and matte
combination with red glossy accents
spread on the sides the top and on the
inside as well with the main coating to
be this sort of charcoal gray
I think this matte black on the red
looks absolutely gorgeous and NZXT has
done an excellent job with uniformity of
the dark
there's no color variance and the same
dark tone continues inside as well with
a red plate on the power supply cover
the exterior plastics are fully red
covered with metal panels and that's why
the charcoal can maintain such a uniform
look now if you really dig the color
scheme and have appropriate matching
Hardware the black and the red aged 440
has some excellent sweet-looking
potential also notice the fans are
totally black unlike the white blades on
the white version contributing to this
whole stealth look although to be honest
the red fans might have looked pretty
sweet as well NZXT did not change the
color of the LED that illuminates the
logo on the power supply cover it's
still blue but I think bright white
might have looked better or
appropriate actually in this setting now
one downside this math nature of the
exterior are handling marks they are
clearly visible and will require some
maintenance if you want your case to
look exceptional every time you kind of
work with it overall though this NZXT h
440 looks like a very attractive case
and this new color scheme with matte
black or charcoal however you want to
call it and this glossy red accents but
what do you guys think of this color
combination and between this and the
white one which one will you choose and
why let us know in the comments below
again make sure to watch our full review
of the white H 440 if you have not yet
already done so thanks for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
