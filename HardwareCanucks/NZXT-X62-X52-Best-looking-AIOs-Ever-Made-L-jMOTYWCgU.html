good-looking CPU cooler I've got
something really cool for you come take
a look but first a message from our
sponsor the dark bass 900 may be the
most innovative case of the year with a
built-in Qi charger interior lighting
tempered glass that can be installed on
either side and a fully modular interior
that can be inverted if you so desire be
quiet stepping up their game check it
out in the description below and so what
we got today for you are the new liquid
all-in-one coolers from NZXT DX 62 and
the X 52 with a premium price that
reflects its a superiority over the
previous generation and comes with the
same six year warranty feature set
between these two is identical we have
dual fans included per cooler their new
air P radiator fans gone are the wide
bladed fans we have all the same
mounting hardware tube length is the
same and even the thickness of the
radiators is the same at 30 millimetres
one is just bigger at 280 millimeters
versus the more common to 40 million
radiator now what ends xt is bringing to
the table is a fantastic new physical
element to the CPU block with this
infinite mirror design and a load of
lighting options to properly support
this RGB goodness so the new coolers now
have braided tubing which also
apparently is stronger compared to the
previous generation where the tubes were
plain rubberized and I actually prefer
the tube design on the X 61 but at least
they've maintained the thinner tubing
which is much easier to bend compared to
the really thick ones on the H 100 V 2
but no doubt the CPU block is now a lot
more attractive and capable it is a much
taller body now - but still shorter than
the Intel stock cooler by 7 millimeters
all the cables are now detachable that
makes installation easier having no
cables dangling around as you lower the
CPU block and interestingly the cables
are no longer sleeved like we saw on the
X 61 making them easier to high a total
of 4 PWM fans are supported on the high
giving full fan control for push-pull
options and there isn't much anything
else to say aside from showing you the
bottom of the CPU blog that has thermal
paste pre-applied installation was
identical to many AOS you can buy today
on my ex 99 system I even left the
corsair standoffs from the h1 100 IV 2
that are identical while on my skylake
machine replacing the ex 61 did not
require any additional mounting hardware
now so what's really cool about the CPU
block is that infinite loop and the
interior and also the exterior
reflections creating this interesting
depth effect with those light rings
inside especially when you view it on an
angle we have the depth effect more
visible and I love the transparency of
the top surface when the lights are on
plus how well the NZXT text is
integrated into that Center it's very
clean you don't see any wiring and this
2 zone lighting system works really well
that encourages some serious light play
to make sure that these coolers fit with
your build perfectly full control is
enabled through camp software which
brilliantly highlights the consistency
of their entire ecosystem here you have
control curves for the fans and the pump
and which temperature variable controls
the speed which in my case is the CPU so
first I swapped out the X 61 out of my
own system and replaced it with the X 62
to see if the cooler is quieter at full
load and what type of temperatures we
would get I use the same thermal paste
for both coolers to keep things even and
this is what the X 61 sounds like at
full load
and now I've swapped out for the X 62
cooler and it's much quieter
now something to keep in mind is that
comparing CPU temperatures over time and
there's practically no difference maybe
the groupings for core temperatures is a
little bit tighter on the X 62 but at
much lower pump speed so here the new
pump design shows off what it can do at
lower rpm next I wanted to test the X 52
inside the s 340 elite and compared to
the H 1 100 IV 2 which is one of the
more popular a iOS at full load they
sounded about the same and our 4
gigahertz 6800 K remained on average at
64 degrees Celsius with the X 52 giving
us a slightly less fluctuating curve and
so as a performance upgrade X 62 and X
52 might offer only marginal
improvements over your previous 280 or
240 millimeter all in one cooler but in
the case of my system in my upgrade it
is now much quieter compared to the X 61
cooler and this really highlights that
the whole coolness factor of this new
mirror design on top of the pump so let
me show you all the lighting effects
that are plenty and they're awesome
let's go inside Camp alright so now
we're inside cam the first thing I want
to show you guys is CPU usage right now
it's hovering under 2% which is pretty
good
initially when installed it was 30% but
a firmware update to fix that so if
you're having problems with high CPU
usage make sure to update your former so
I really like the way this is laid out
so here you can change performance mode
from silent to performance mode or fixed
mode something that you determine
yourself if you want to go and configure
that you can either click this button
here or you go and go into tuning and
here we can go into edit fans which I've
showed you guys before now let's talk
about the lighting which is one the
coolest things you can do with this
cooler so first thing you can select
logo or ring LED once they're both
selected only effects that are going to
be can Co he Civ with both LED zones are
shown so for example if I choose
breathing and I choose this red color
Save Changes you immediately see what
that reflects on the actual cooler and I
love that all these colors are pretty
accurate so if you're selecting
something like in this area like it
actually show you that color on the
cooler itself if you want to go green
and the colors are quite accurate so
here we have these fading effects and
you can add more colors it's all
intuitive you can move colors around and
this is controlling both right now the
logo and the ring LED I really like this
one
this one looks cool and it's quite
uniform in terms of how things are being
fading out and stuff
this one is pulse I really like how NZXT
in the middle first comes up and then
the fades away and then the green comes
out comes around so you can also let's
add maybe like a blue so it gives us a
nice different effect that's awesome and
the spectral wave I don't really like
this one because it's not very uniform
it's kind of chaotic and you can change
the speed and look what happens when the
slowest speed right now it's not uniform
it's kind of jerky but what I like to do
is just select my logo LED and then
choose a solid color for you so maybe
like a nice blue here and then we have
these effects on this one this selected
go to ring LED so now we're only change
a color for the ring LED and I really
like the watercooler
this is a really cool one so let's save
it you can see how it's rotating with
the colors and it's very uniform you're
going to also go into Tai Chi and select
which color you want so maybe like a
purple and an orange st. changes and
that looks fantastic if you go into
loading this is the default one and this
is the most uniform in terms of how
changes so that looks amazing and really
loving the purples here and also the
yellows are quite accurate I mean all
the colors are accurate but I really
love the way purple just looks through
there if you go to the smart stuff you
can select the color based on
temperature or your FPS or GPU
temperature and audio that will just
this is the level of the loudness and
will change based on color it's gonna
it's a little bit chaotic so I'll just
recommend to sticking to these presets
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
let me know what you think about this
new pump cooler mirror designed for LEDs
I'm happy to see you know proper RGB and
inside a CPU cooler it's quite
interesting to see where we'll go next
in this category but I'm Dimitri with
Harbor Canucks thank so much for
watching we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
