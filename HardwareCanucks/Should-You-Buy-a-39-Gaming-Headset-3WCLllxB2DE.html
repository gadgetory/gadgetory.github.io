this is the cooler master master pulse
MH 320 it's a $40 gaming headset so you
know I'm impressed with what
coolermaster is done with budget
oriented peripherals I mean recently we
just got a chance to check out their new
MS 120 gaming keyboard and a mouse combo
set was priced about $90 and I was
surprised by what they were able to
offer so if you're interested in that
video you can check it out right here or
I'll leave the link to that video in the
description down below now when it comes
to gaming headsets there are two primary
things that matter to me the most one of
them is comfort and the other being a
more balanced sound signature so I'm
typically not a fan of gaming headsets
that feature excessive bass because that
would kind of ruin my gaming experience
and also you know it would definitely
not come up really well with my music
listening experience as well but that
might not be the same for you you might
have a different taste you might like
headsets with excessive bass the image
320 is purely targeted towards cameras
who are strictly on a budget but also
looking to get all the necessary
features at no additional cost so let's
find out if this headsets worth $40
right after a message from our sponsor
what inside the view 31 you should put a
ring on it yes time to make it hard to
be official
there will take ring high static
pressure fans because your case deserves
a ring full details in description below
all right first up build quality and
surprisingly coolermaster has done a
pretty good job with the image 320
considering the price the year cups are
made out of hard plastic material and
they are reinforced well to the metal
frame right above these self adjusting
headband its rock-solid and feels
durable however the downside to this
type of design is that the metal frame
absorbs and then transmits sounds when
it gets in contact with anything I've
experienced a similar issue with they're
much more expensive master pulse Pro
headset and honestly it was not a
pleasing experience now I was informed
by Coolermaster that they'll be adding
vibration tempers right where the
headband gets in contact with you hear
cups and they expect that inclusion to
reduce the vibration noise by up to
fifty percent okay so here's where
things get a little interesting that
screenshot was sent to me by
Coolermaster weeks before the image 320
launched and I was testing the
pre-production sample off that Kimmy
headset and it's sitting with me right
here so this is the pre-production
sample and this is the main production
sample now when I received the main
production sample about a couple days
ago I was trying to look for the dampers
and unfortunately I wasn't able to find
any on the new sample so I was expecting
some sort of material between the ear
cuffs and the frame and unfortunately it
wasn't here so I'm not sure what that
you know what coolermaster was telling
us you know with emails and stuff so I
guess what I'm trying to say here is
that I'm not thoroughly impressed with
coolermaster at this moment because you
know they promised us something but they
didn't really deliver that with the main
samples so I really don't know what's
going on anyways getting back to the
review the clamping force exhibited by
the frame was not too strong when
compared to the master pulse Pro wearing
these were pretty comfortable the
headset didn't feel too heavy so that
was awesome the leather ear cups are
nice and foamy there's plenty of cushion
to prevent your ears from making contact
with the drivers although they're not as
breathable when compared to a mesh type
ear pad so expect sweat build up if
you're considering this headset for long
or gaming sessions
the boom microphone uses a suitable type
mechanism and it's pretty flexible for
easier maneuverability now the
microphone is bi-directional but check
this out you may or may not be able to
hear me out that well and that's partly
due to because of microphone doesn't
pick my vocals that well so you might
have to end up boosting the volume on
your end but it seriously does not do a
really good job just picking up audio in
general and so it's really disappointing
and I don't think it will suit anything
including you know streaming or even
casual Skype calls I don't think this
microphone would do any justice and what
you're listening to right now is the
microphone gain level boosted plus 20 DB
through the windows some properties and
well it does seem to do the trick
it still doesn't sound that great I mean
it picks up background noise my vocals
sound absolutely horrible and you know
you can actually get a better sense of
how this microphone sounds even with a
few adjustments within the sound
properties now just so you're aware I
had to go through to pre-production
samples and now this main production
sample and unfortunately the quality
difference hasn't been that significant
and they almost they almost sound the
same so it's really disappointing I was
expecting some better quality now if
you're willing to spend an extra 10
dollars here's what you get so this is
what the microphone sounds like with the
HyperX stinger and you can automatically
notice as there is a day and night
difference between this and the MH 320
the vocals are the microphone picks up
my vocals really well it isolates a
background noise and my voice is more
natural it's audible that's important
and you know what's even more
interesting is that it's a lot more
comfortable to wear than the MHC 20 like
you can see the design is very stealth
it's very simple so overall I'm really
enjoying this headset now I'd like to
hear your thoughts on the audio
differences between this and the mh2 20
do you notice a significant difference
and what are your thoughts on the audio
quality in the first place so leave us a
comment down below the cable is non
removable and it's not braided this
should help avoid unnecessary
reverberations plus it's reinforced of
the headset pretty well it's about two
meters in length so you shouldn't have a
problem rounding it behind your PC the
3.5 millimeter connectors are splitted
four headphone and microphone inputs
plus there is an inline remote control
box that allows you to adjust the
for the headset and there's also an
option to mute the microphone which is
ironic given how muted the microphone
sounds on the headset in the first place
now given this as a $40.00 gaming
headset don't expect things like RGB
lining of virtual 7.1 surround sound and
all the other crazy features and like I
mentioned at the beginning of this video
all I care about
is design sound quality and comfort
so the MH 320 did pretty well with a
design or I guess the build quality for
its price but it did flop out in the
microphone so I guess the last chance
for to impress me would be in the sound
quality department but did it
unfortunately it did not now remember
headset reviews are purely subjective
said take whatever I say with a grain of
salt because we think and perceive audio
differently with that being said the
image 320 fails to produce a balanced
sound signature there's way too much
emphasis on the low ends and it
absolutely destroys the details in the
mids and the high frequency range if
you're planning to listen to a lot of
vocals or just music in general you
might not enjoy these pair the treble
sounded muffled almost as if there was a
mass right in front of it and I really
didn't enjoy that game II on your hand
was satisfactory I jumped into a quick
battlefield 1 deathmatch session to
check out how well the drivers tweeted
gun shots and movements it sounded boomy
when firing shots and I was able to pick
up my footsteps fairly well but honestly
I enjoyed gaming with these stinger
headset just because it was much more
comfortable to wear for longer sessions
and most importantly it sounded balanced
with the right amount of bass and great
response to the mids in the highs so in
short the Coolermaster mh3 20 is a
disappointment at least in my books
first of all the design is all right I
mean the build quality is great for the
price and all but I really don't like
this metal frame it seriously gets
annoying the microphone is absolutely
horrible I would not even consider using
this for Skype calls or any other
conversation or even you know streaming
if you're really into that now I
completely understand that cool masters
trying to expand their preferred lineup
to audio accessories but unfortunately
the execution with the master pulse Pro
headset and now this NH 320 is just not
right now don't get me wrong they make
fantastic keyboards mice and
cases but when it comes to gaming
headsets I'm just gonna have to pass but
guys if you're in the market for a
budget gaming headset spend the extra
$10 and pick the HyperX stinger it's
just in much better gaming headset but
the design is simple it's so comfortable
for longer gaming sessions and the sound
quality is ridiculously good I mean
it's balanced there's just the right
amount of bass the trebles are so
pronounced and most importantly the
microphone is miles better than the
image 320 so yeah I'd like to hear your
thoughts on the MH 320 what do you guys
think of this game II had said is it
worth $40 or you know would you rather
spend an extra $10 and pick the HyperX
stinger let me know in the comments down
