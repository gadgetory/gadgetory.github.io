of AMD's Raven rich apos and we here at
Harbor Canucks have been hard at work
benchmarking these guys and the results
are really fascinating considering their
price now before I get into the
technical details I want to quickly go
over what exactly an APU is well the
expanded term for that is accelerated
processing unit
it was initially introduced with the
Llano architecture and it has evolved
through subsequent generations and the
idea behind an APU is to offer good x86
performance along with class-leading
graphics capabilities and I think Raven
Ridge might finally bring the dream of
APU success to a reality now these Raven
Ridge apos are a slightly updated
version of the Xen architecture and
while the 2000 series branding might
cause a slight confusion with the 12
nanometers n+ architecture it's not it's
just not it's basically a first
generation rise in desktop CPU with Vega
graphics and if you're interested in
learning more about the nuts and bolts
of these new AP use make sure to check
out our Raven Ridge explained video
right over here plus if you are
interested in learning more about the
performance and how it compares to the
rest of the Rison series processors
including the Rison 5 1500 X and of
course the 1400 I'll leave a link to our
website article in the description down
below so you can check that out these
EPS are supposed to be different from
previous generations since those feature
weak processing cores and Xen has
improved a lot of that in some cases it
could be almost double the performance
of previous generation Bristol rich ap
use and that's pretty awesome
you see Raven Ridge is a potential
avenue for entry-level users who are
thinking about going through a system
building in several steps basically they
can pick up one of these new views that
feature
respectable graphics and get away with
some light 1080p gaming and they can
obviously expand the performance by
adding a discrete graphics card once
prices start to normalize because you
know miners the main reason behind this
video is to actually find out how good
the internal GPU is in games that people
play the most but most importantly we're
going to be focusing a little bit on x86
performance as well I should also
mention that these ApS can be easily
adapted into all-in-one desktop systems
as well as notebooks
pretty relatively affordable price point
but the ultimate question is can you
actually game on a $99 APU let's find
out but first a quick message from our
sponsor
say goodbye to cables it's time to enjoy
wireless audio with the corsair void RGB
gaming headset with the light and come
full frame low profile mic on headset
volume control and mic mute + dual side
illumination check out the void RGB by
corsair the perfect way to hear your
game let's quickly go over the specs of
these Raven Ridge eight views starting
with the $170 horizon 520 400 G it
features four cores with eight threads
comes with a base clock of 3.6 gigahertz
with a boost up to 3.9 you may also
notice that AMD has reduced the amount
of l3 cache on the 2400 G when compared
to the Rison 5 1400 which by the way has
been pushed to an end-of-life status
alongside the Rison 3 1200 the reduction
of cache and internal memory latencies
has allowed the new CPU package to
achieve higher memory speeds up to 29 33
megahertz on dual channel kits and even
higher with overclocking the Bizon 320
200 G is a pretty tempting option for
$99
it's a quad-core CPU without hyper
threading yet it offers significantly
higher bass and boost frequencies when
compared to the Rison 3 1200 and as
mentioned earlier it can also support
memory speeds as far as 29 33 megahertz
so that's pretty cool I should also
mention that these ApS are replacing the
1400 and 1200 respectively and should
offer more performance perhaps the
biggest loss and something the AP used
to share in common with Zen based Athlon
processors is the lack of 16 dedicated
graphics lanes for discrete GPUs this
was done to save dye space simplify
manufacturing and push towards a lower
pricing structure now granted today's
mid-range GPUs don't really need an X 16
link even in our testing GT X 1080 isn't
bottlenecked by pcie 3.0 X 8 interface
but the optics of it are quite poor and
not to complete the Raven Ridge apu
puzzle is of course going over the Vega
based graphics processors that are
integrated into their dye package their
code named Vega 11 and Vega 8 with
respect to 2400 G and 2200 G and they
imply the number of
compute units Vega 11 has 704 stream
processors 16 ro PS and 44 texture units
which puts it about one-fifth as
powerful as aim DS own Vega 56 GPU Vega
8 is a slightly cut-down version of that
and that's obvious given its nine dollar
price tag these GPUs can reserve up to
two gigabytes worth of system memory
that can be set in the BIOS but their
default configuration is 512 megabytes
now those specs might not sound like
much but in the onboard graphics realm
it's pretty impressive plus given the
architectural improvements of Vega over
the r7 generation used in Bristol Ridge
the difference will be like night and
day
let's discuss compatibility with aim for
motherboards these chips should work on
X 370 be 350 and a320 chipsets but as
you can see the number of i/o are
limited as you go down by chipset for
example X 370 provides for SATA and 8
PCI gen 2 lanes while be 350 cuts that
down to 2 SATA and six PCI gen 2 there
are also some limitations with USB 3.1
gen2 connectivity but if you think about
it pairing these new ap use with a B 350
or a 320 motherboards makes a lot more
sense as they give you the best bang for
your buck technically you could opt for
an X 370 motherboard but in all honesty
that platform seems to overkill when
paired with a ribbon rich APU next up is
platform cost and this is an interesting
one so if you combine the cost of the
$99 2200 G and a similarly priced be 350
motherboard your memory investment is
going to be closer to the combined
pricing for the CPU and motherboard
which is kind of insane especially if
you plan on using a 16 gigabyte kit
which is the minimum we would run
welcome to 2018 my friends okay so like
I mentioned in the beginning this video
is not going to discuss on how Raven
Ridge alliance with the rest of
processors and the reason behind that is
because apu stopped processors are meant
to compete in a market where Intel has
no competition we really want to see how
well these processors particularly the
one that cost $90 performs in games
above everything else because I'm sure
that's why you're here but we also
wanted to do some real-world tests to
see how well these apos could deliver
you know respectable productivity
performance
because I'm sure you'd be using this for
other tasks apart from gaming now for
gaming benchmarks we also decided to
throw a basic gtx 1050 to simulate a
lower end GPU scenario and it's also a
good point of reference for you guys if
you're interested in comparing the
performance differences now
unfortunately we didn't get a chance to
get our hands on with gtx 1040 which is
invidious lower end GTX 10 series
graphics cards but as of right now I
think we're just gonna stick with the GT
x 1050 our test setup involves an msi be
350 ITX motherboard and Noctua NHS 12
cooler to cool the AP use 16 gigabytes
of Corsair Vengeance lpx dual channel
ddr3 memory at 26 66 megahertz with
these timings and we used two gigabytes
in BIOS for IGP partition alright let's
roll out those results starting with
Adobe Media encoder we see the higher
clock speeds are heavily utilized and
they're able to deliver pretty good
results you may also notice that we did
overclock the processor to see how that
could affect the real-world benchmarks
and the results really do speak for
themselves the lower l3 cache found on
the 2400 G and the 2200 G doesn't really
affect performance with blender as you
can see the 2400 G runs almost
neck-to-neck with the risin 5 1500 X
while costing less moving on to
handbrake and the 2400 G continues to
offer our performance that's similar to
the 1500 X but the 2200 G starts falling
behind a 1300 X okay moment of truth how
do these apos play well with gaming well
as you can see there are a hell of a lot
better than the integrated solution from
Intel 3dmark Cloud Gate and sky diver
performed really well on the 2400 G with
Vega 11 graphics and the 2200 G with
Vega 8 it's obviously not gonna match
gtx 1050 performance but that shouldn't
disappoint you take dota 2 for instance
at 1080p set to medium preset lead 2411
graphics dishes out well over 60 frames
per second wildly 2200 G with slightly
lower compute units isn't too shy from
these 60 frames per second mark
Wolfenstein at 1080p set to medium also
does a pretty good job on both ap use
averaging around 40 frames per second
and 33 frames per second respectively
here's a quick look at Civilization six
very respectable performance at 1080p
set to low settings now in the past
integrated graphics illusions have
benefited immensely from higher memory
speeds so we decided to apply an XMPP
profile of 32 hundred megahertz going
anywhere above this range could result
in BSL ease unless timings loosened so
we remained here at 14 14 14 32 and guys
check this out we're looking at a 12 to
18 percent framerate improvement
entitled select civilization 6 doom and
overwatch and that certainly isn't
something to sneeze at our next step was
to address the core frequencies of the
horizon 5 2400 G's GPU itself because
overclocking the integrated graphics
contributes to the overall overclock of
the entire processor unfortunately our
2200 G had some issues with stability
when overclocking the integrated
graphics so that isn't going to be in
these charts with the 2400 G it wasn't
really an easy thing overclocking due to
the terrible beta bios on the MSI bt-50
motherboard but AMD's rising master
software took some of that stress away
and we ended up with a constant
14:38 megahertz which was the maximum
that could be achieved without black
screening during game testing or
applying excessive voltage as you can
see the overall performance did indeed
improve but nothing like it did with
faster memory
it could be than memory speeds where
once again the culprit and ended up
limiting GPU throughput or this could
have been just a law of diminishing
returns either way frame rates were
certainly impressive for an integrated
graphics solution
also don't forget about power
consumption as well overclocking these
apos contributes to the power current
and thermal limit of the processor and
due to that the integrated graphics chip
will be capped at lower than expected
limits many times as for cooling these
chips the stock cooler that comes with
these apos do a pretty good job keeping
temperatures under control while
overclocking but we recommend something
like the Noctua NHL 9 series since it's
quieter and performs really well when
compared to stock solutions so Candy's a
POS really play 1080p
at a lower price point the answer is yes
absolutely but there are some
limitations with the risin 5 2400 G and
the risin 320 200 G especially with the
way how they rely on memory frequencies
for example you know it's stock settings
both apos do a pretty good job yielding
comfortable frame rates especially in
titles like dota 2 csgo civilization 6
Vega 11 and Vega 8 does not have a
problem firing through those titles
provided that you do some image
adjustments but if you are interested in
slightly demanding tales like doom or
watch Wolfenstein Destiny - overclocking
the memory can significantly increase
the performance and we've seen that by
the results not to mention even bumping
up the core speed on the IGP contributed
to that as well now investing in a dual
channel thirty-two hundred megahertz
memory kid might sound like a good idea
but from a price to performance ratio it
just doesn't make any sense pairing it
up with a raven rich apu because you'd
be paying a lot more for the ram with
the combined costs of the APU and a
motherboard because drm pricing it's a
thing it's a thing in 2018 personally I
think Raven Ridge is an excellent
solution for people who are looking to
build their systems by steps so for
example they can pick one of these a POS
and start gaming or get away with some
light 1080p gaming and if they want to
increase their performance they can
obviously add a discrete GPU given that
prices normalize given how the current
cryptocurrency market is and how it has
affected the pricing on GPUs
I think Raven Ridge might be a temporary
solution if you consider from that
perspective but if you are looking to
also build your very first computer and
if you don't if you're on a tight budget
this is definitely a great option
because you really don't have to invest
on a discrete GPU you can definitely
just start gaming on it right away with
your CPU memory and motherboard and of
course the rest of components apart from
a discreet graphics card I do have to
mention that there are some limitations
with this platform especially with i/o
so for example you can throw in two nvme
SSDs put them in raid or go through a
quad or dual channel SLI setups that
just doesn't make any sense
with these Raven Ridge ApS and you've
seen that with the i/o list that I
talked about earlier in the video so at
the end of the day there
two questions that needs to be answered
one are these apu is really worth a
price - is it really worth upgrading
from a 1500 x or 1300 x let me answer
question 1
i think if you are looking to build your
very first gaming computer you should
definitely consider these new Raven
Ridge AP use and B to answer your second
question you should probably not
consider upgrading from a 1500 X to the
2400 G or even the 2200 G coming from a
thirty-minute X because the performance
difference isn't that drastic but what
I'm really excited about is wait how oh
yeah man fractures are going to
implement these a POS on their products
for example all-in-one desktop systems
and portable laptops because that would
be an interesting I think that would be
an interesting way to approach gaming or
mainstream gaming I would say at a
relatively affordable price point so
what do you guys think about Raven Ridge
APU specifically the 2400 G and E 2200 G
let me know in the comments down below
