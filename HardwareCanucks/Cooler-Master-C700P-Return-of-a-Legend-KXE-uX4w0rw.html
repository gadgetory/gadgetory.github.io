cluemaster cases let's check the map
alright so this is the H 500 P I think
this will be my new airport case I'm so
excited for this one and then we have C
700p it's the new cosmos case alright
and packing is finished
so exactly how awesome is the new cosmos
let's find out where Atlas creativity is
fueled by the best instruments it
doesn't always come easy and in the
process you often realize how important
quality is the RT 400 by OCC gives you
quality and speed with M de to interface
the schieben and flash and a PCIe
bracket making it possible to focus on
what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty alright so the new cosmos C 700
P is cooler masters most anticipated to
release of the year aside from the H 500
P of course and for a good reason we
finally get the refreshed cosmos that is
modern is got character like no other
and promises all the irrelevant features
for 2017 release and of course it's
expected premium price of $2.99 once
again is targeting that niche water
cooling and modding community with now
bigger shoes to fill based on the cosmos
past the structure is a mix of materials
that works very well together visually
thanks to that beautiful gray color
coordination on the plastics and the
aluminum but there's one thing that
throws off this whole quality color
coordination balance out of the window
and that's all the metal surfaces on the
exterior and on the interior they're way
too easily to get just covered in finger
marks and it just doesn't look good
after a single assembly so it's a bummer
that they're not treated with anything
like the plastics have that look
fantastic
well there's the metal don't the
aluminum feet and handles are now a
staple of course resembling skis
attachment like it's about to head down
a snowy cliff with excellent curvature
on either side to comp in the front and
rear plastic pieces and the case is
already super heavy
so you'd appreciate the awesome paint
job that hides all that plastic
underneath it now the top handles on my
unit arrived slightly loose which is
weird but this also highlights the
modularity of the frame so you could
potentially take them off if you wish to
experiment with the modding abilities
and of course they are part of the
cosmos design
language and are confidently used for
transport the tempered-glass side panel
is curved and this is a big deal because
the yields to create that front
curvature we are told are super low so
it looks kind of cool with this dual
angle reflection
but since the other side panel is a
simple mat metal it kind of loses that
left-to-right uniformity but it sure
must have been extra difficult getting
both side panels to be that curved glass
the tint on the glass is really not to
my taste it's a little bit too dark and
really can't see inside and also has
that green cast on the window so I wish
that it was more neutral now both side
panels are magnetic and open up like
these luxury car doors and can be lifted
off their rear hinges that make the
frame much lighter during assembly the
front i/o is absolutely loaded with
power and reset to fan settings and
Lanning customization of course it's
2017 and finally it's up to the task for
a serious motherboard with 4 USB 3 ports
and a Gen 2 type C port so you can feel
secure with all your external storage
needs and you can even build your own
USB Drive with a Type C interface which
is Gen 2 using m dot 2 SSD so if you're
interested to see how that's done make
sure to check it out here the lighting
on this case is quite unique with these
ambient portions and top and bottom it's
a little bit too much for me personally
I prefer more subtle lighting but here
it kind of makes sense where the
enclosure itself is that showpiece and I
love how the handles are sort of part of
that light show with interesting
reflections and softening out that light
spill the colors vibrant and despite the
large sections uniformity is fantastic
and the inclusion of a four pin RGB
connector is brilliant so you can
control the color from your motherboard
and by the way any of the three sections
can be disconnected as well from the hub
if it's too much for you the front
section opens up like this to reveal a
removable dust filter that isn't super
fine and I think that's on purpose to
limit the airflow bottleneck because
that front portion is very close to the
dust filter behind there's a removable
fan bracket with 2:140 Miller fans
included so mounting a 280 mm the
radiator is not a problem and this
bracket also supports a 360 rod with
some flexible mounting points so that's
awesome
and you can even go with a triple one
140 mover a fan setup or a 420 memory
reader on this bracket so I'm very happy
to see water cooling taken into account
with user friendliness in mind using
these brackets and you can see just how
open that the entire front section is
with 90 millimeters of space between the
frame and the closest drive caddy so in
total we have three 140 Miller fans
included but why are they these fans
cooler master has much better quality
fans and then to $99 price point I mean
the beautiful enclosure is one thing but
having sort of a full package that feels
complete is another thing and most
likely users will be replacing the fans
with their own but still it would been
great to see some quality fans included
here instead of these reference fans
that are included in all of their cases
now this next portion got me confused
because we have dual five in the quarter
inch Bay covers on the dust filter but
there's only a single five in the
quarter inch drive bay so for example
moving it down is not really an option
because it will be blocked by the fan
bracket and it doesn't fully align with
the mounting locations and you also have
to remove it in order to install a 360
radiator at the top and I find that
wasteful because it doesn't take
advantage of the whole modularity aspect
that this case tries to bring forward
and so this could be a sign that some of
these features were rushed out and not
completely refined before release up top
the dust cover is removable and just
like in the front this bracket is
mounted with two screws and it's
actually identical to what we find at
the front so all the same radiator and
cooling options apply and this design
thinking has definitely been influenced
by their master case series and it's so
refreshing to finally have a cosmos case
that is ready for user friendly
enthusiasts water cooling checking out
the interior at first glance it looks a
bit weird with these large metal covers
at the bottom and the front there is an
SSD mount on the side of the shroud with
proper cable cut out and the shroud
itself is not secured on the opposite
side so it's a bit wobbly the other
piece has these cutouts to perhaps
showcase the reservoir behind it but
what I find really odd is the inclusion
of only two Drive bracket that's like
they went to the other extreme for
storage the previous cosmos had 11 dry
brackets and this one only has
- they sit on this modular system which
is great but no additional accessories
are included the power supply has its
own elevated platform that's because the
case is so tall you can reposition one
on the front brackets here for airflow
and no worries about the dust as it's
fully covered to me this dual cover
design is not ideal because if you
remove the front portion to potentially
highlight your water cooling Hardware
the power supply shroud is on its own
and doesn't look that great it's fully
open at the front and you wouldn't
really do much in form of hiding your
cables on the other side we also have
some strange decisions like the two SSD
caddies one of which is already occupied
with a fan controller and the lighting
hub so I mean there's plenty of space in
here so why are keep eye on the precious
Drive brackets on top of that we also
have this not so easy to remove metal
cover near the front that makes no sense
to hide this section because it's not
like you'll be routing an army of cables
to that part in the case although it's a
perfect way to hide the mess that's
there by default but the SI 700p is one
of the few enclosures that take
advantage of that fully modular frame in
that you can inverse the motherboard
tray orientation if you want the system
on your left side and because the side
panels are symmetrical you can simply
swap them accordingly now the procedure
to inverse the motherboard tray is
frustrating the user manual sucks
there are no visual guides on the actual
frame on where each piece should be
aligned to you know be quiet get this
right with their color coded screws on
the dark base 900 so the procedure is
the less frustrating and the one thing I
will say about the cosmos is that the
frame has so much potential for
refinement because of the mounting
locations that not all four sides you
can do a lot with that you can even
rotate the motherboard tray 90 degrees
with some optional accessories all right
so the motherboard is now inverted so by
default Coolermaster suggest for you to
move the power supply plate to the top
so it's gonna be above here but because
of these holes here you can simply align
the motherboard the way you want and
have the power supply still on the
bottom which is which is great this is
how let's say I would position myself my
system when the GPU is up here maybe
extra fans on the top to help the GPU
airflow but because the case is so tall
of course you can still position
radiators in the bottom this way and
yeah just as long as you take your time
and be patient in terms of rotating
these components you should be okay I am
surprised they have not added dual
system compatibility as there is room
for an ITX system and here somewhere and
thanks to that fully modular structure
it's not totally out of questions so
perhaps we'll see that later on I feel
like this is the best cosmos case so far
but unfortunately like every other case
in this lineup some things just don't
make sense for the target audience to me
it feels like the project of two teams
who don't communicate you give us
modularity on the frame level with
fantastic water cooling your options but
totally lose track with paneling that
will hide all that open goodness in the
front and give no effort in cable
management I think the power supply
shroud should have spanned that entire
bottom section that usually looks better
and have a smaller panel to cover up the
top section that you can potentially
take out to show you radiator to show
your drives and reservoir it's like
Coolermaster has put so much thought
into redesign in the exterior so it
feels fresh and you know giving us all
these modular options but not giving
them refinement that is needed for this
price point and for the target audience
for example if the shroud made contact
with the motherboard it will allow for
less dispersion of those cables in the
bottom and I know this is difficult to
do because the motherboard tray has
multiple mounting locations but some
form of cover up top would be nice - to
control how cables Bend over the tray EA
TX motherboards will fit no problem and
as usual a case of this caliber requires
some form of custom water cooling and
the dual fan bracket will handle that no
problem moving over to the back I
actually moved that metal piece closer
to the middle to cover up this area
where most of the cables are
concentrated so if you're feeling lazy
and this is an option alright so that is
my experience with a/c 700p I am happy
with the direction they're taking taking
that whole module approach to the next
level so no just replacing your drives
and replacing the side panels on our
previous cases now we have that entire
structure but that has all the mounting
points around it so you could
potentially do anything with it and I'm
really excited to see where Coolermaster
we'll take that idea my two things that
I'm not happy with and cluemaster
certainly has to improve our decoding on
the metal is just a huge fingerprint
magnet and I don't like the panels at
all inside that is you know power supply
shroud and that side panel I wish for
the power supply shop with a single
piece by itself along with the smaller
piece for the top section so that way
you can cover up all that bottom area
and not really worry about covering up
this area that you potentially want to
highlight and if you leave just the
power supply shroud it looks weird and
number two is refinement Coolermaster
definitely has to improve the user
manual is complete it's just not
acceptable to have something like this
on such an expensive case and such a
complex enclosure where you have all
these mounting options and things and
then move that into the case itself have
visual indicators on where to install
the motherboard and how do these
different pieces sort of come up to
create these different interior layouts
for the cosmos alright so that is it for
my review let me know what you think of
the keys down in the comments below and
do you think the cosmos line has revived
based on this release I think so but I'm
curious to hear what you think I'm
Dimitri thanks so much for watching make
