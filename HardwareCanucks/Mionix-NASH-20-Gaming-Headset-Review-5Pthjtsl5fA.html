great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hardware conducts and today we've got
another gaming headset on the review
table this time from my onyx who are
gaining popularity among gamers for
their continued commitment towards
functional and affordable peripherals so
this is the Nash 20 and being priced at
$130 there's a lot at stake here
as we already have many established
products for gaming audio from Sam
Heiser Logitech Corsair coolermaster and
now actually Kingston in the mix Plus
this price point may turn off the casual
gamer who is looking for that sub $100
piece the Nash 20 is simple in design
with matte black rubberized coating that
easily reveals all the handling marks
and also on our sample started to peel
on the headband I'm a little concerned
of what the headset will look like after
the coating starts to wear down in other
parts of the product the my onyx logo
embedded on each side is a nice touch
Plus on top the headband as well so it's
not flashy in any way the headset is
quite light combine this with large
rectangular and deep ear cushions and I
found wearing the Nash 20 for a few
hours without any complications the
white headband helps in the comfort
department with thick padding and my
only complaint here would be the large
and bulky format I'm not a fan of this
direction and I hope my onyx takes this
into consideration for their next design
for example if the plastic housing for
the ear cups wasn't as thick putting on
my glasses with the Nash 20 was alright
thanks to the thick padding and the
headset is fairly flexible with some ear
cup articulation and of course these ear
size adjustable it feels like it could
take some beating and I guess that's a
good thing being gaming oriented auto
consequently will be followed by
inevitable peeling it connects through
standard mic and headphone jacks with
color tips and the cable is braided but
not removable in being 2 metres in
length I would rather see a provided
extension with the shorter native cable
on the headset to avoid unnecessary
cable clutter the microphone is not the
touchable
it is low-profile however and is muted
when in the upright position as you can
hear it picks up my voice quite well
although it isn't as clean as I'd like
with quite a bit of noise we do have a
volume wheel on the left ear cup so
having this control directly on the
headset is my preferred option instead
of the very common dangling inline
controls on the cord that are not as
accessible so one comes to gaming
performance I was actually surprised at
how well the Nash xx handled the range
I'm really happy to report these are not
bass heavy in fact the low in region is
well controlled for a gaming headset
with just enough power to deliver full
sound but without feeling overpowered
this in turn leaves an undisturbed
mid-range that can deliver that crystal
detail of footsteps on the other side of
the wall or enemy chatter with a good
sense of scale of how far those enemy
soldiers are the higher-end section
needs a little adjustment to boost some
of that siblings for a brighter and more
detail sound but overall the Nash xx
serve satisfactory for my gaming
experience the warmth of the sound is
just excellent for long gaming sessions
without leaving ringing ears the 50
millimeter drive is really do an
outstanding job with the large
soundstage as well with good positional
awareness plus they are angled inside
the housing are providing proper audio
direction these being semi-closed they
do leak sound so keep that in mind also
offer excellent isolation from your
surrounding environment now riding the
headset through some music I wasn't
entirely happy with the lower base
region opening of young and beautiful
wasn't strong without hitting those sub
bass notes Auto approved otherwise with
mid bass and decent upper base and back
to black and no charge in wild so the
mid tones are reserved for enhanced
soundstage in-game but in turn caused
more distant vocals for music listening
to all my love nightfall and a sky full
of stars all head vocals move slightly
behind the main instrument line that
resulted in a somewhat congested sound
that I did not appreciate so the Nash xx
enters the gaming market with a lot of
positives and I'm
they say all the essentials have been
covered such as comfort with great
padding and perfect clamping force solid
built quality mic mute when in the
upright position volume dial right on
headset and acceptable sound quality
being gaming oriented with the large
soundstage however the peeling coating
non remove microphone and cables just
subpar microphone quality and its bulky
format all serve and major disadvantage
considering the high price the Nash 20
is not a bad headset but to me it
doesn't stand out within the gaming
offerings and why they sound great
I feel the overall package needs to
offer more for the price you pay so that
