Canucks and this is Anthony from tweak
town we're here GDC in San Jose an
awesome show we got to see some really
cool stuff but there was one major
announcement that everybody was so
excited to hear and that is Pascal me
and Anthony here can talk to you about
that everything you need to know about
the future Pascal or the the current
progress on the future of invidious
next-gen architecture
so the p100 the nvidia p100 stands for
press cow oh yes what do you think about
it a lot of tech crammed into a 16mm
thin v process from TSMC Pascal
architecture itself and hbf to page B m2
was a huge increase over HB m1 which was
on AMD's Radeon r9 fury X and a huge
increase on the gddr5 on every card that
we've seen into an hour by height next
980ti 390 m/s and everything before big
challenge for NVIDIA be challenge for
TSM see I think it's been 5 years 5
years is a long time and then it's the
longest time between no chips
we went from 40 to 28 a lot quicker yeah
and that is a huge phew it's a huge part
it's a lot of work it's probably more
work than they've ever had to do before
that's why it's taken so long and this
is something that we've been talking to
Anthony about of potentially why they
skip the 800 series for the best of
graphics cards because they knew the
Pascal was coming they knew that this is
going to be a huge thing for Nvidia a
huge thing for for graphics discrete
graphics so you know we had 700 skipped
800 there was some stuff on mobile but
then we went to 900 series and now the
next thing is going to be in any
speculation on the name uh G falls 10k I
really like 10k even though it's going
from 980 if you can't really go to 1080
as we've been talking it's going to be
GeForce GTX 1080 is going to sound like
1080p it'll sound weak 10k sounds pretty
powerful but what do you guys think
leave your thoughts in the comments
below but what would the Nvidia is
Pascal next generation graphics lineup
will be called but so 16mm really
impressive stuff HBM to that stuff is
like that's that's next-gen right there
so gddr5 on the 980 to go and Titan X is
about 330 gigabytes a second which is
quite fast
the HP m1 on the fury X is 512 gigabytes
a second HBM towards our theoretical max
of thousand twenty four gigabytes a
second which is a terabyte per second
three times faster than tight
next part the fury acts had 5:12 and it
didn't do that much more it didn't
provide a huge increase but it was
limited to four gigabytes so HBM one is
limited to four gigabytes only maximum
HP m2 can grow up to i think 32
gigabytes we won't see that on a g-force
card enormously 8i maybe 16 or a g-force
card which is still insane by having 32
gig of crazy fast next-gen Bram is still
there line boy
so not only are we jumping the leap and
the memory tech because it's 3d stacked
and everything but you're jumping in
there's just massive capacity to well I
guess it would be interesting to see
what benefits we gain for gamers but VR
man yes VR the gaming side you don't
mind that and we've never had a Trinity
of upgrades we've never had a no change
of 16 mm and HBM 2 and an architectural
change is normally one you know a year
later another no allowed or another so
hates room 2 is going to it's going to
deliver more benefits than what we think
in just from the transistors point of
view so the 980ti has seven or eight
billion billion eight billion and then
the the P 100 GPU alone without the HBM
is 1550 and then card with hpm is 150
billion transistors so 20x you're going
from 8 billion to 15 billion on the GP
100 yep and that's mainly thanks to them
being out of shrink the chip down and
then add even more transistors to it so
it doesn't sound impressive just going
up by 100% 8 building into 15 you've got
to remember they're doing it on
something that's radically smaller so if
I was doing it on the same size you
probably would see 25 30 billion right
so young like that but then getting
something but that is smaller and
cramming twice many transistors onto it
is that's as a as a tech enthusiast I
knowed it out at that I'm playing the VR
will be a big part of Pascal anything
that I haven't talked too much about
their portion VR but it's going to be
insane this year the demos that they're
showing now versus what we've seen at
sea
yes and Computex in the past it's so
fantastic to be able to experience those
demos because you see the advancement in
the the textures high-resolution
everything well not only the graphics on
the side of things but the latency side
of things
the framerate side of things right now
right the VR ready PC sticker indicates
90 90 P 90 frames per second which is
awesome it's way better than 30 fps it
having consoles and the 60 FPS average
it you get on PC gaming these days it's
a it's a big leap and the new headsets
much better the final versions of the
rift are awesome the final version of
the vive is even better and then a video
showing off light-filled headsets here
at UMC as well which is a whole new way
of actually rendering the pixels to the
headset to your eyes which you need to
see if you need to see VR to be out
understand it you need to see light
foods we ought to understand that you
have like another iteration it's just
you think that you've seen everything as
CS which is only three months ago and
then you come here it's like ah okay
there's been this new a new glass when
you you can't keep up we're here every
every event and we can't keep up so what
can we expect for the consumer side of
Pascal
first of all Jensen announced that the
Tesla P 100 is available for production
today which means that the enterprise
levels of course will be the first to
cover that area but the consumer side
hopefully we'll get that do you think
we'll get the Pascal card in this year I
think we'll see Pascal pour for copy
text which is the end of May so any and
the main one a half months
well I think the performance will be
huge I think maybe gtx 980ti
if we're aiming at that type of card
probably 1.5 x performance so another
50% on top for a single card so 1.5 X
performance from a 980ti
yes on a single card that uses less
power that runs cooler and there's a lot
smaller so we should go from an ODI
being you know X big to a much smaller
card maybe 2/3 the size kind of like an
iron iron Theory X and just to give you
a little wrap-up of what it's like to be
actually in the show GDC so it's a bunch
of seminars where you have
first analysts and you know some low
press like us to to see all this stuff
and deliver this information to you but
going to seminars can be extremely
intimidating because it's just
information over the head where if
you're not in the Lavelle developing
field it's a little bit out of our
league but so much crazy and incredibly
expensive server ax Hardware everywhere
on the show floor what's your favorite
part about GDC man just the hardware
just saying so many graphics cards i way
more love graphics cards and walking
past racks and racks like we will pass
these servers with up like 16 graphics
cards of them with two GPUs both
graphics cards 32 gig or the 32 GPUs in
a single system but Canada's run Crysis
you know no caramels no not at all
not a row but that is probably the only
show where we go around and see eight
980ti stacked on in one case and then
you get a totally new sense of what it's
like to to see that type of hardware and
experience it and one interesting part
about one PC that we saw it have 8 9 ATT
eyes and it had three power supplies
that were both what 12 over a thousand
water oh three with 1600 watt 16 one of
the weighing over a dozen down the power
supply but then you realize the actual
power supply that 1600 watts was a very
thin tube yeah and then obviously it's a
lot more expensive than the consumer
side but you know that so cool that we
never see these things on the consumer
side of things which is understandably
so but it's so cool be able to see that
at 1600 watts like I think you're even
understanding this was in it was it you
saw any and I think I asked twice this
is 1600 watts you know answer 1600 watts
it was just incredibly small like it was
loud I think they were worth $1,000 each
yeah just for one six hundred watt
passed by and you've got three of those
and I GTX not reach guys but that would
be our little conversation on Pascal
will happen at GDC a little expectation
the forecast on when we could
potentially expect the consumer Pascal
from in the video super excited to see
when that comes out to market Anthony
thank you so much for your insight Thank
You Man
don't forget to subscribe make sure to
follow us on all social media for you
know our continuous update on the Pascal
guys I'm Dimitri with our Canucks this
is anything we do in town thank you
thanks so much for watching we'll see
you in next video if yeah if we maintain
like this very intimate close I don't
know we're okay that's the what is it
the deleted sings yeah yeah course I'll
remember that for a long time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
