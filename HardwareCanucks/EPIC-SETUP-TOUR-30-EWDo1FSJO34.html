great technology selection and service
hello everyone i'm dmitri with Huracan
axe and welcome to another video now
i've been working out of the new office
for a while now everything is pretty
much 100% aside from a few tweaks here
and there but this setup will be
featured on setup wars run by the tech
source Edgar he's got amazing content
make sure to go subscribe to him and say
hello that I sent you but without
further ado let me show you what this
space is all about welcome so this space
is much bigger compared to what I've
been working from in the past it
actually gives me enough room to breathe
maneuver around for filming and as an
editing then gives me satisfying time
when performing those long and editing
marathons so let's take a look at the
desk first aside from a few minor tweaks
this configuration hasn't changed all
that much for my previous setup I'm
still rocking dual Acer xB 270 HP
monitors that are so good productivity
and gaming too they are G's incompatible
and 144 Hertz refresh rate that doesn't
only benefit game time but
responsiveness on the desktop is also
felt so every video I produced for her
recognized goes through these pixels
first I'm happy to say that I finally
added a lighting strip behind the desk
which is from hue plus system by NZXT
that offers so much color customization
so expect a little extra flare in my
shots from now on and because it's a
separate lighting channel I can change
the color of this glow without affecting
the color of my PC which is pretty cool
now you notice I have no speakers at the
moment and that's because my ears have
been so spoiled by the fantastic
Sennheiser HD 800 headphones that fully
drive my audio experience for music and
editing but if you have any suggestions
for compact studio monitors please let
me know with a comment below my
headphones rest on the Silverstone
headphone stand that is fully aluminium
and can support two or even three pairs
and that's because for gaming I put
these on the game one pair for
son Heiser that are based on the same
drivers as the HD 598 without standing
soundstage and also an amazing
microphone speaking of which ever since
my blue Yeti broke all of my vocals for
hardrock Canucks have gone through this
microphone the audio technica 2035 which
is plugged into the scarlett 2i2 and
sits beside the o2 headphone amplifier
which is surprisingly good to drive the
HD 800 I am still typing on the
Coolermaster Nova touch gkl because the
light topper switches which are amazing
and recently have started using the Zoe
F key one Mouse that is so accurate its
driverless and my aim game is strong my
friends only think though the switches
are quite heavy but still I highly
recommended my desk companion include
this toy Trabant that's as slow as a toy
car as in real life and my case
companion is this plant that discreetly
hides the power button on the PC the
verdict gear SL 4000 is what's been
supporting me since I've moved into the
new office which is actually pretty
comfortable I've experienced no back
pains or awkward things poking me around
so that's a positive and powering my
editing needs is this machine that we've
recently built the skylake editing PC
it's very quiet even at full load
performance wise the fork or chip
compares to a six core workstation and
these dual 980 is maybe an overkill for
CUDA GPU acceleration inside Adobe but
for gaming they are 100 percent utilized
top it up with some sexy hue plus
lighting from NZXT and an aluminum
enclosure from fantex and you've got
yourself a very lovely workstation for
the future years to come on the same
slide as my desk is the shelf that acts
as both an open storage system so I have
to make sure things are organized but it
also serves as an awesome dynamic
backdrop for videos add some Christmas
lights get proper distance so things are
out of focus and bam you have yourself a
very pleasing image it's like organized
chaos in the background I love it and
here you also find some upcoming product
reviews and other builds that we are
working on and sometimes I need to stack
things on top of each other to make sure
that
a proper audio when the microphone is
off the desk so the shelf here is pretty
organized with everything to do with
cases and accessories on the second
shelf while all my gaming peripherals
and audio are on the shelf above it and
aside from creating a schedule on
upcoming videos having things right in
your face is a good reminder as to what
I need to be working on next you can see
this very small mice collection so stay
tuned for an upcoming top 5 mice of 2015
video and ever since I switched to
filming on the gh4 my camera gear have
shrunk significantly to a manageable
amount when traveling with just the
second portable lens and the Sony rx100
mark 3 for our behind the scenes series
so as you can see this side of the room
is all filled with something for video
backdrop editing or storage while the
other side is completely bare with just
a single filming table and a set of
lights and this gives me a nice balance
of delivering a plain white shot mixed
in with some other backdrops for an
interesting video plus the table has a
gloss finish that creates these awesome
reflections so guys this concludes the
tour I hope you enjoyed leave a like if
you did now I have two questions for you
one is do you have any feedback for this
space to make it more efficient or more
productive for my workflow as I'm sure
you're pretty aware of it by now and the
second question is do you have a desk or
a case companion just like me to make
your space a little bit more personal
leave them in the comments down below
also make sure to subscribe to her
aqueducts for more similar content and
don't forget to check out the text
source channel for the setup wars and
awesome series where he shows off a
bunch of cool setups that feature all
types of configurations and maybe you
gives you an idea on how to do yours
so I'm Dimitri with haruka Knox thanks
for watching we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
