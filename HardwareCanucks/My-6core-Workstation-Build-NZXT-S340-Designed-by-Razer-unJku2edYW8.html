great technology selection and service
with my upcoming sky league upgrade to
be used as my main workstation I decided
to recycle some of the parts from my
previous x79 platform and build a nice
little secondary editing station that I
can use for benchmarking and offload
some of the rendering power from the
skylight system that I'll be building
shortly what's up guys I'm Dimitri with
hurricane axe and first let's quickly do
the part rundown I love the blown out
view of the system it's a nice way to
visualize if anything is missing
so first the core of the system is my
sort of aging x79 pro motherboard from
Asus that's certainly really well up to
this point I say that because some USB
ports are not working and one of my RAM
slots is broken
but everything else is perfectly fine
with the super stable 4.2 gigahertz
overclock on the 3930k which is a 6 core
beast of a chip that handles editing
like a boss it's kept cool with the NZXT
kraken ex 61 which is my favorite Aleman
cooler because of all manual controls
and RGB lighting and one of my 980 eyes
will be going in here there's a very
powerful combination with that six core
CPU and 32 gigabytes of RAM for storage
I'm keeping everything inside on a pair
of Samsung 850 Pro SSDs that I will set
up in raid 0 and to power everything be
quiet hooked us up with their dark pro
750 watt platinum efficiency power
supply because I want a silent machine
with reliable power and lastly for the
case we're using the newly released NZXT
s340 designed by Razer Edition which is
a fairly compact enclosure it's full
metal so the build quality is fantastic
and for the purpose of this build it
will do just fine the Razer features on
here include a logo at the front a green
underglow on each side that looks pretty
awesome and keeping up with the theme of
green there are USB 3 ports and an
illuminated power button at the top plus
the green logo on the inside but looking
past the branding the s3 40 is still a
great enclosure it's
all elevated on rubber case feet and
despite having a totally solid front
panel for that really sleek square form
factor that I appreciate the panel is
actually spaced out to allow adequate
intake of air so I'm a huge fan of
chamber separation and the s340 offers
just that with two 120mm exhaust fans
included inside and to spice things up
with a little bit of color we have the
hue plus from NZXT that allows manual
color control from the desktop and we'll
have a full video on that in just a
little bit so after a quick and easy
assembly here's the second editing
station it's a very simple build yet a
very powerful machine for rendering the
280 member radiator is installed at the
front that also acts as the main intake
and eventually I will get some sleeved
cables to make the interior match a
little bit more as for the LEDs I match
the color of the NZXT logo on the cooler
and the geforce text that is more
yellowish tone green and add a 2 hue
plus strips one at the top and one
behind the cable management cover to the
right of the motherboard the cool thing
about the hue plasto is the size as it
is actually the same width as an SSD and
therefore can be mounted onto this SSD
bracket which i've done here and it sits
on top of the power supply shroud beside
one of the SSDs the under glow of the
case is very cool it is an ambient light
and not super harsh and the window is
also tinted which makes components
inside notice visible but the custom
lighting I've installed helps to pop
some of those components without
revealing the full color of the
components because the hardware is not
perfectly color matched plus the master
cables from the power supply will have
to be common flash somehow for now now
the cool thing about the hue plasto is
the whole load of lighting modes that I
will play around with and for this video
showcase I decide to rainbow this PC
just for now which looks very strange on
its own but combined with the full set
of RGB peripherals with the same effect
and it somehow looks acceptable for this
type of course
now just to be clear I'm not a Razer
fanboy but anyone would strict brand
loyalty would appreciate this type of
cohesion which is of course optional so
guys this concludes the construction of
my secondary workstation PC I hope you
enjoyed and click the subscribe button

thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
