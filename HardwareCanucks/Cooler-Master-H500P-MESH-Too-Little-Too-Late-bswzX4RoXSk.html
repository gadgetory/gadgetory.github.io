what's up guys I'm Dimitri and behind me
is the new cool master h 500 p mesh they
have made some changes for better air
flow better overall like functionality
and paneling and now it comes in this
beautiful white let's check it out right
after this finally an ultra slim body
keyboard with mechanical red or blue
switches designed and perfected for work
and play that the Sorel Graham XS
evolved to fit right in check it out
below alright so first make sure to
check out our original H 500 P review to
get the basic understanding and what
this case is all about and so I'm happy
to say the price has not changed it's
still $149 which is nice we get these
upgrades without the price premium so
now let's talk about everything that has
changed first is the new color now it's
matte white that is uniform across
materials so the interior metal pieces
are the same color as the exterior
plastic ones now I actually prefer the
metallic coating on the original it just
looks better to me the white I don't
mind it but you have to approach it with
a particular hardware color coordination
in mind but the white frame is mixed
with some black accents like PCI
brackets thumb screws the ventilation
area and I'm actually quite happy that
all the fans are now y2
this does help to hide them a bit inside
and if you're illuminating the interior
the light spill would complement this
color choice the rear side panel is also
fully white with white paneling behind
the motherboard tray and this definitely
opens some cool opportunities to
showcase cable management and you know
like routing those individual channels
and the only visually awkward element on
the exterior is that blackout perimeter
around the glass it's way too thick
especially because we have so much white
around it and potentially if it was
thinner or maybe even white it would
have looked better next are all the
paneling improvements so first the front
panel is now reinforced with a top clip
so it's no longer loose requires you to
press in to disconnect it it also now is
entirely covered in this mesh material
for better airflow plus the name with a
filter built
this is clearly the result of a massive
disappointment of the original design so
this is how it should have been released
in the first place I think now the
measure design helps to outline each of
the 200 millimeter fans with these
darker shapes it's nice but if you were
to replace them for three smaller
friends then the front panel would look
kind of awkward being split in the
middle like that also it's great to see
they've removed the stickers from the
fans just to avoid any you know
inconsistencies if the sticker is not
perfectly centered because then the fan
blade would look to be wobbling which
was present on the original enclosure
the side panels are still hinged and
have this convenient two step mounting
procedure but the tempered glass mount
has been tightened so it's not as loose
as on the original the top panel remains
the same with this acrylic but now
there's a thumb screw holding it in
place so it doesn't simply pop out
during assembly now I wish the top panel
would also receive the mesh treatment
simply because the fans are so close to
the top that the airflow was simply
bounced back into the case unless you're
using really low rpm fans and also we
have this weird exterior inconsistency
we have glass we have mesh and we have
this acrylic panel and it's almost like
ku master is undecided on what on how
they want the H 500 P to look the IO is
still the same with four USB ports but
now they've added this sliding hub it's
for lighting control so you can either
connect the four pin RGB connector to
your motherboard as was with the
original and have software control or
now you can route the reset switch into
this hub and control the lighting switch
that way the hub also has a button so
you can cycle colors through that and
preserve the reset switch for the
motherboard now the hub is kind of like
a nice inclusion so you have two options
for color control but we're told for the
next iteration of the H 500 P they'll
build the hub into the front IO so you
don't have to deal with additional cable
work and so while I appreciate these
like upgrades are coming out and you
know they're better for the consumer
without increasing the price point I
wish that Coolermaster would simply just
like sit down and do all these upgrades
all at once so that the consumer can
receive the final and finished and
refined product quicker instead of
having this like three iterations of the
same case that is receiving these like
incremental upgrades over
an entire year moving on to the inside
the only difference is the new power
supply bracket and I'm so happy that
it's been added allowing you to install
your unit from the rear without removing
the shroud first which was super
inconvenient on the original as for the
rest of the internals everything is the
same it kind of sucks they have not
modified the front shroud section
because in the second position which
clears up room in the front for a
radiator
you still need to remove the closest SSD
caddy because otherwise the shroud will
not slide back as for the paneling
behind the motherboard tray it's still
not thick enough to properly accommodate
entrance of thicker cables from the side
and while you can work around this panel
it just could be so much better to
actually hide your cables and be used to
secure them as well and I don't even
want to install the side panel because I
love the look of this like open I seen
the cables and seeing the paneling but
you can see it's not even shaped
properly to hide the needed sections
furthermore this interior plate is a bit
useless because it cannot house a
reservoir and there are no cable type
points on the back of it it's simply
here to cover this opening which is
meant for cables but nothing around it
caters to its intended purpose and
finally I wanted to see the temperature
differences in this new mesh versus the
original which I no longer have so I
have to use some other creative means to
cover up the front section with tape so
that we could mimic this sort of
restricted front airflow from the
original model and so here are the
results the idle temperatures are 2 to 3
degrees Celsius cooler for the new mesh
revision while firing up the load
scenario we see a substantial reduction
in CPU temperature while also giving us
a cooler GPU with just a slightly higher
core clock and because the front panel
is now more open it is also slightly
louder alright so for the conclusion I
want to say that the mesh revision is
super necessary because I feel like
Coolermaster lost a lot of credibility
with the original release saying it's
like high airflow or it's like trying to
follow in the footsteps of the high
airflow series while not exactly
delivering to that airflow expectations
with that super restrictive front
paneling but now that's been changed
along with a few other things so I feel
like these upgrades are coming in and
they're appreciated however it still
somehow does not feel enough because
refinements and
grades are still under way and I'm
excited to see what type of new features
we'll see on the metallic version if any
but it feels like there's still
constantly improving things while you
are kind of stuck with whatever you get
and if you have any ideas on what would
make the H 400 P your dream airflow case
let me know in the comments below let's
talk about this so cool master can read
that feedback and potentially integrate
that into their you know next case
release so that we don't have to be
constantly asking them for features
they'll all be already included at
launch hopefully we'll see I'm Dimitri
thanks much for watching we'll see you
