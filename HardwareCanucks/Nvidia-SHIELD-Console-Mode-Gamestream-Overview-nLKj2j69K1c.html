oh hey Oh a shield okay so when this guy
launched expectations were a little bit
tempered and that's to be expected I
mean it's the first real handheld
Android gaming device that really came
on the market it did have a couple
really cool selling features though it
was able to play Android based games as
well as able to play PC games by
streaming them to the actual handheld
device so in order to play them on the
shield you needed a couple things you
needed to have a coupler based GPU as
well as a router with a 5 gigahertz band
so it was basically just going after the
likes of the PS Vita and I say was
because now and videos kind of turned
the RAI on something that's a little
more generic they're going after
consoles so as such console mode was
born you could use a Bluetooth
controller from the comfort of your own
couch and play your PC games when your
PC's a room point all right guys so now
we're going to take a look how to
actually sync up your Nvidia shield with
your PC so to start things off you're
going to take your actual shield and
you're going to jump into the Nvidia
application by pressing the Nvidia
application now this brings you into
something that looks a lot like steams
big picture and that's because it pretty
much is steams big picture so we're
going to go over to PC games select it
and you're going to select the PC that
is connected to your network that has a
Kepler based GPU for me this is
motivation gamers so I'm going to select
connect and now as you can see here it's
asking us to connect the shield to the
PC so quite simply you just hit connect
it's now connected to the PC so now all
my games are on the shield so let's take
a look now how to actually end your
console mode first thing that we need to
do to get gaming is you need to connect
a bluetooth enable controller like this
Nyko controller the connection process
is really simple and like the majority
of Bluetooth devices all you have to do
is sync the two together after the tour
syncs you can connect a mini HDMI cable
from your TV and enter console mode we
can get into our PC games by entering
the same ways we have been before you
can launch the Nvidia app and using game
stream we can launch even the most
recent holiday hit titles
including Black Flag Batman battlefield
4 and many others so let's jump into
Crysis 3 all in all the actual
experience when you're gaming from your
couch using the shield is pretty
incredible it's also really seamless you
can't even tell the fact that it's you
know taking what basically your PC is
feeding up for graphics and streaming it
down to the actual device and then
displaying it on your TV like I said
it's a seamless experience now there are
some hiccups some of the hiccups that
I've noticed basically is that you can't
use your PC at the exact same time that
you're actually gaming if you're playing
a game and let's say my girlfriend wants
to go on skype or do some web browsing
and stuff she can't actually do it
because you can't alt-tab out of the
game and do what you want to do so
that's one of the hiccups as well to
some games aren't completely supported
so for games like Battlefield 4 that are
based at a chrome there's a little bit
of a unique experience in regards to
getting them all set up so in order to
show you the experience and how to get
the game set up we've disconnected our
shields from the TV and now we're just
going to demonstrate on how to do it
with your PC so the first step that you
would have to do is you launch
battlefields for from the actual shields
in console mode the way that you
normally would if it was connected to
your TV this will cause the Chrome
browser to load up with your battlefield
4 content when this happens your shield
will basically just crash out and say
that it can no longer connect to the to
the network so when it does that what
we're going to do is we're going to
click OK and launch the game this one
being battlefield 4 from your actual
Chrome browser and then re-enter the
shield by pressing resume
so now by pressing resume it's going to
jump right back into battlefield 4 and
720p glory as well too with console mode
you have the ability that you can enter
into your Netflix and Hulu content now
my Netflix experience has been a bit of
a mixed bag I can't really tell if it's
because of the 5 gigahertz band or if
it's because the application is an
Android based application but the
quality on Netflix isn't really
necessarily what I'd expect or want to
see out of something that I would say is
a 1080p experience now in saying that
you also have the ability that you can
play 4k videos using this device now I
kind of wish that I had a 4k TV so I
could show you exactly what the
experience was like but yet trust me you
can play 4k videos and kV and FLV
content so another one of the hiccups is
the fact that the shield doesn't
actually accept a native 1080p stream
the stream that it accepts is actually
720 which because I have a 1080p TV is
now being upscaled to 1080p so in other
words you're not getting true 1080p
resolution now that will change in the
future because Nvidia will allow us to
connect in micro USB to Ethernet adapter
so we can actually have a hard wired
connection to our network which means
that will accept a 1080p stream
however those adapters and I think the
firmware is not available as right now
and when you do that you lose the micro
USB port which means that you can't
actually charge the device so you might
only get a couple hours with the gaming
so another thing to mention as well is
that with GeForce experience it allows
you to optimize your games based on your
systems configuration so in other words
your shield experience will be optimized
as well now because of the fact that it
runs on a 720p stream that means that
you're going to be able to use lower
based Kepler GPUs to get the same
optimal gaming performance that might
not impact your performance on the
shield
so all in all and video was pretty
innovative when they thought of this
console mode and what is really an
incredible device the shield they gave
users the ability to play next-gen
content now using the horsepower their
piece
to basically fuel where you're gonna see
on the screen at 1080p resolutions so
let's take a look at the good things and
some of the bad things about the device
the device is pretty small and it does
pack a punch with the Tegra 4 processor
and it also has the ability that you can
play next-gen quality content on your TV
right now just like a next-gen console
and it can act as a pretty decent media
player however on the flip side you're
limited to Nvidia hardware and it would
limit the exposure so you can't use an
AMD device there's no real multitasking
so other people can't use the PC while
you're gaming and some controllers that
you might get for Bluetooth are pretty
sensitive and there is a little bit of a
learning curve so guys
console mode is a pretty solid option
and it does actually give you some
benefits and some really great things
that will help you compete against this
next gen consoles it will give you that
next gen console feel and you can play
next gen content now but would that
actually replace next-gen consoles like
the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one I'm not
too sure guys I'm Matt for Hardware
canucks
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
