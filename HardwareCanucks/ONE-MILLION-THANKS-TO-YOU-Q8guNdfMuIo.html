been seven years and videos how many
videos almost 1,300
and wanna know the best part okay what
we just surpassed 1 million subscribers
well you seem to have things under
control
you were always there for me Fred thank
you and thank you okay so I think it's
safe to say shuttle value to mod my fork
that's pretty impressive and if I notice
after unboxing there
are there significant differences
because
neener I did experience oh this was only
did
is so awesome
and putting these on these city guys
impeach what's up guys a b-tree once
again is keeper here with harbor
kinetics hello good people Tom Petri
what's
what's up guys ever hear anybody ever
connect sex for watching we hope you
enjoyed this review don't forget
subscribe and see you next week man
so this is a weird video to me because 1
million subscribers is just such an
accomplishment but there's also so vague
because you know we didn't start this
out thinking we're gonna reach this goal
or we didn't have the goals in mind
because we just started out doing this
because we wanted to make videos and we
liked doing them and we liked sharing
them and you guys loved them so this
whole circulation of content that has
led us to this place is it's quite
surprising and it's like it kind of
really puts everything into perspective
on how much appreciation we have for the
audience and the community that we've
built here and also for our team that
has collaborated on all this content
that you know allows you guys to watch
the stuff and allows us to continue to
be making videos that we like to make -
now I remember my very first Harper
Canucks video the Silverstone r03 which
still by the way is a fantastic
enclosure today but just from that point
up to you know how many videos like a
thousand videos later just how many
challenges and how many creative like
roadblocks we have to face in order to
surprise you guys in order to deliver
something new and also keep us engaged
as creators and you know I just want to
thank each and every one who has ever
commented and given us feedback because
all that kind of feeds into this machine
of our content creation so that we can
be you know sane and still sit in front
of our computers for eight hours on an
edit and shoot for 20 hours for for
certain b-roll to make one product that
is enjoyable to watch and makes us happy
too now we as a team have always
accepted feedback input and criticism
from our community so that we can
properly navigate this landscape of your
expectations and so that we can be like
happy individuals on both sides and I
really really appreciate
this engagement that we've had with you
guys
that you know when I log in on Saturday
morning to check out the common it's you
know the majority of the commentators is
just like really good engagement from
the communities you know that's just
helping us but helping everyone else
that is on this platform and for that I
thank you and of course our relationship
with sponsors has evolved into this
experimentation point where the
community and our delivery of ads have
come kind of like merged into this
interesting symbiotic relationship that
allows us to sustain the channel and
also hear any pushback that you might
have based on what you see and for that
I really appreciate how like things have
been handled on that side of thing and
from the viewership especially when we
see and hear comments about like certain
ad spot that you'd like guys loved that
makes it all worth it one that looks
like we have a message from uber take it
away
okay so this is take two of my thank you
message because the mean tree I don't
want you to do start laughing but really
thank you guys thank you so much for
your support we have reached a million
subscribers on YouTube and that is just
amazing words can't really describe how
thankful we are here at Hardwick in acts
and I am just so glad to be a part of an
amazing team Mike aka Skye MTL is an
awesome boss a slash friend I mean he's
always been there for us
Demitri man it's been an awesome journey
working with you and just sharing on
ideas and of course you know I love the
times when we sort of goof around when
we're together because you know we're
all so productive but we also have a
really good time but most specifically
it's it's a support that you guys have
been giving us and just the way have you
been interacting or how we've been able
to interact with you guys it's just
fascinating because you know we are as
we are family and I think it's just it's
just amazing to see the support and it's
kind of overwhelming too because
I just I still can't believe that we're
here because when I started hard-working
acts I think we were around these 70,000
subscriber mark and it has been a long
journey ever since that time and you
know my first review for the channel was
a gimme - video and it was the my onyx
AV or 7000 it's what got me started on
the channel and we've evolved big-time
ever since then I mean we've expanded to
multiple attic or E's we will try our
very best to give you guys the best
possible content we have made mistakes
in the past and you know we have
addressed them we've we've we've
definitely brought them up and again
that's all thanks to you guys I mean
without you know this would have been
possible so I want to take this time to
thank you so much for your support and I
will see you all in the next video
alright so I think it is time to close
off this video and 1 million subscribers
that is incredible so I can't I'm gonna
sleep so well tonight and just gives us
that little extra push to do something
new and surprise you guys because that
is what's all about alongside us having
a good time too so keep doing what
you're doing and yeah we'll see you in
the next video
make sure to check out this other
relevant content subscribe to our new
boot sequence channel too
