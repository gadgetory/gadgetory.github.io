switching to risin is our primary
workstation workhorse for video
production and gaming etc people have
been asking if it's been worth it both
Eber and I utilized the 1700 X CPU and 8
core 16 thread monster and it really
choose to rendering videos and you know
gaming is fine the main question that
I'm here to answer if it's been worth it
for me now I think three months is a
good time for him to understand the
capabilities of this ecosystem but also
understand and discover its drawbacks so
let's talk about all that right after
this wondering how to fix a boring fan
check out halos RGB there are super slim
fan frames that light up your blades of
any shade come on 120 and 140 member
sizes to fit any fan and a control
through your motherboard or your fan
text case available in beautiful
aluminum or simple plastic it's time to
Halos your build outline what matters so
I'm gonna start off by saying if you
have not seen our original video of
switching to Rison from my previous into
base machine make sure to check it out a
lot of insightful information on why we
made the switch in the first place and
give you a really good reference point
as to how much performance gain we get
we got in premiere for rendering videos
now the main benefit for me with Rison
really came through multitasking and
that I was not able to do before because
it was just it would really slow down
render times so now I could be rendering
a video on the background working on the
thumbnail in Photoshop watching a 4k
video from Ebro for example downloading
games on Steam all that without
impacting too much on the render times
and what you can see from this graph is
that additional time saved in render
times while doing all these other things
in the background but as many people
pointed out that render times is not
everything so while you could be
rendering things in 10 minutes sources
20 minutes what performance like in real
life scrubbing on a timeline with 4k
footage and all that and that's when
things get interesting so for my
premiere workflow I edit with proxies
which means lower resolution files are
used in the timeline the deliver much
smoother scrubbing I can cut faster and
most importantly preview my edit without
any stutter since 4k files with some
color and other effects applied I really
difficult to preview in real time
without dropped frames so this is when
my machine start to act
and drop rings like crazy even using
proxies on my rise in machine what's
more interesting is that I dropped more
frames when using the proxies those
lower resolution files then using actual
4k files so something definitely was
wrong now the reason why dropped frames
are the enemy for every editor is
because when I'm trying to preview my
timeline I want the playback to be as
smooth as possible so I know exactly
when to cut it I can edit to the music
easier and just becomes a really nice
and seamless process but if you're
dropping frames the footage is
stuttering it's not playing back in the
real time it's like gaming at like 2 FPS
it's really annoying it was really
getting to a point where I had my Intel
based machine which I now use for case
reviews kind of ready on standby in case
I need to swap out my system and just
continue on editing without all these
kind of like slowdowns that I was
experiencing before even though my
render times would be slower at least my
performance on the on the timeline would
be significantly better especially when
I'm using proxies and for gaming in
general I'm totally fine with the
performance especially since I'm running
in gtx 1088 almost 2 gigahertz but for
example of where my scaling system was
far superior is when you need really
high frame rate like when i reviewed a
240 hertz display and my Rison system
wasn't able to reach stable 240 hertz
fps and csgo at low settings where's my
6700 K could easily reach 300 + and on
my rising machine I experienced a few
really bad frame drops in the middle of
gameplay in csgo which I've never
experienced on my Intel machine what's
more I was experiencing unexpected
crashes while rendering videos even
though my temperatures and both views
were all sort of in line and not out of
boundaries to cause these issues but
then on one of the crashes my Intel end
game is is the on which the OS is
installed was not being recognized until
I pulled that out switch some slots and
then even tried it on a different
machine only for it to work again after
inserting it and resetting the CMOS and
resetting the bias and all that stuff
however the one piece of information I
haven't told you is that when I did that
swap from Intel to Rison my OS drive
I didn't format it I simply plugged it
in and I did a Windows reset or some
refresh where it keeps all my files but
just does it clean so
Refresh of Windows but AMD recommends a
complete format of the always drive so
that three installs everything
completely fresh and so I was hoping
that that was the baseline of all my
issues and it was time to do a clean
Windows install and ever since doing
that clean windows installed updating to
the latest bios running the latest AMD
drivers I have not experienced any
crashes or unusual behavior from a video
production work or gaming so proxy
workflow in Premiere is back to normal
it's flawless no hiccups or dropped
frames and the new buyers brings
stability and slightly wider memory
compatibility so I can run thirty-two
hundred megahertz on the memory on some
rise and tested kits and so the Rison
platform is updating which is awesome
but I've never had to worry about
high-speed memory compatibility on my
intro machines nor have I needed to
update the BIOS as much as I have on
Rison we also found out that some
hardware is not even tested on AMD
platform like the student half-inch
external enclosure by silverstone i was
gonna use this to house my SSDs and
being able to freely move my system from
case to case without having to worry of
migrating my storage as well but there's
something wrong with the SATA signal
strength on the rise in motherboards
whereas on intel platform this thing
works just fine we've also stumbled upon
weird behavior using the USB 3.1 gen2
port on the rise and motherboard versus
on my skype machine using this m dot 2's
as the inside the gen 2 enclosure
everything is fine the speeds are great
on the rise in motherboard we get slower
speeds and inconsistent results
throughout our testing if you guys are
interested to see how to build your own
M that to assess the USB stick check it
out right over here I also found out
that Rison is really unmatched for adobe
lightroom which is a really popular app
for photographers so just zooming in to
get the full resolution preview takes a
while changing any in the exposure
settings really takes it all in the
system and they take a while to load as
well and just switching between pictures
take a really long time for them to load
again it's really sluggish and just an
unpleasant experience from where I'm
coming from using my static machine or
even using my MacBook Pro that feels
faster and every
with Adobe Lightroom I've also
experienced more than normal bugs in
Adobe Premiere which is unfortunate but
I think it's related to in video drivers
since they came out so frequently with
all these new games that there must be
some incompatibility with Adobe
so I reverted to an older driver that I
know works fine and I haven't had any
issues since now my overclocking journey
to 4 gigahertz has not been entirely
successful and you can check out that
failure of a video here I'm giving it
enough cooling with a dark rock pro 3
cooler there's enough voltage in them
there as well but maybe I'm just not as
lucky with my 1700 X Eber has he's
running at 4 gigahertz no problem but
maybe I'm just not as lucky I've settled
at 3.8 gigahertz which I'm happy with
and at 26 66 megahertz on the memory and
so in contrast to my previous into
experience risin 7 doesn't look that
great in terms of early stability issues
difficulties with overclocking and
unoptimized a performance for really
important apps so that might suggest
that you should avoid rising right now
because despite these platform issues I
can still do more things and render
videos faster with Rison 7 now I've done
this fun calculation where in the past
three months I have rendered 41 videos
with a total of three hundred and
twenty-one minutes of 4k footage I
render at least two versions of each
video so that's 642 minutes and my
render speed on horizon is about 2x of
the length of the sequence so that means
my machine has spent roughly twelve
hundred and eighty four minutes
rendering video projects or about 21
hours of render time and based on my
calculations on how fast this skylake
machine was rendering I've saved over 10
hours on the render times and that's why
Rison has been definitely worth it and
what I started doing recently with the
time savings is actually increasing the
bitrate of my exports so the video
quality is much higher and I'm still
saving time when the 1700 X and so the
takeaway from this video are a few
points one is I'm approaching this from
a user's perspective and not exactly
like a short-term reviewer because I've
actually been using this machine for
three months extensively so you know
it's kind of unfortunate that I've
stumbled upon those issues that were
frustrating but of course in the end
once I did the reinstall I realized that
that was my mistake and number two the
risin 7 1700 X and the 17 100 delivers
such a good value for a multitasking
processor so I could be doing things in
the background that they're really heavy
and occupy like 100 percent of the CPU
on all 16 threads but not really feeling
the system bogged down while I'm
checking email watching other youtube 4k
videos or anything else in the
foreground that isn't as intensive and
while I am approaching this from a video
production standpoint it does apply to
really anything CPU intensive and so I'm
going to say it one more time that
switching to Rison for our workstation
pcs has not been a mistake
I'm really happy that we did despite the
hiccups along the way you know as long
as everything is ironed out and it has
been for the most part and the fact that
we can save 10 hours every three months
that's 40 hours a year that's entire
work week in the year that my computer
is not rendering videos
that is important but I do have coffee
lake coming to me and I'm excited to try
it out in the production environment
just like I did with Rison
to see if would be worth the switch so
make sure to subscribe and check out
these other relevant videos regarding
Rison we've made plenty I hope you guys
enjoyed this little three-month update
process and if you are on the horizon
what has your experience been like let
me know in the comments below I'm a
Dmitry we'll see you in the next video
isn't it awesome how quiet this machine
is I love this compact package</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
