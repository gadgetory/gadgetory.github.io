possible without the innovative fantex
world-leading nvidia graphics memory
partner corsair and the retail partner
NCIX along with silverstone and in win
EVGA introduced their first gaming
keyboard the z10 at CES this year and
they made some slight changes to it like
the brightness and volume dimmer have a
sliding mechanism instead of the scroll
wheel that they had previously one of
the cool things that they've added to
this functionality of the keyboard is
the ability to connect one of their
classified GPUs directly to the keyboard
using Eve baud connections this would
allow you to not only monitor a lot of
voltages and clocks but actually get
inside the settings and tinker with many
other parameters that are otherwise
unavailable through desktop software the
display otherwise is pretty boring with
a single color and not really pixel
dense but seeing a VGA take a new
approach to utilize a display for GPU
overclocking is pretty awesome
we hope to see some gaming integrations
in here as well but we don't expect it
to be much as for the keyboard itself
they've decided on kale switches blue
and brown with five macro buttons on the
left side there's an oversized space bar
a removable wrist rest with a good
feeling rubberized texture and finally a
USB pass-through port on the left side
that I'm happy to see really there's
nothing special about the z10 just the
added direct communication between a
classified GPU for overclocking stay
tuned for us to fully test out that
feature in a future video
EDG also showcased the x3 gaming mouse
and something interesting that I found
was that they have included a
fingerprint scanner on the left side of
the mouse and coming to think of it this
is actually a pretty good spot that
would naturally fall under your thumb
and allow users to quickly unlock their
pcs the symmetrical plastic shell feels
solid and I'm looking forward towards
taking a close look off the x3 for the
full review but facts aside what are
your thoughts on the z10 this
overclocking the GPU from the keyboard
and a fingerprint scanner in the mouse
interests you is it something that you
would use occasionally let us know in
