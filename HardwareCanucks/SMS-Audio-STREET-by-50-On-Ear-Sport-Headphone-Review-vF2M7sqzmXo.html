teamed up to deliver something
incredible stay tuned for more details
this video is brought to you by NCIX
great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hardware conducts and when we were
approached by SMS audio to review this
tree by 50 on your headphones I was a
bit skeptical to be honest I mean this
is an audio product connected with a
celebrity and we know how that has
played out in the past so I went in with
an open mind to review this fair the
celebrity face behind us in this audio
is 50 50 cents so yes premium pricing is
expected the on ear wired sport will
cost you $180 and for an athletic
headphone it seems a bit much but of
course the UH price to compete with
beats from dr. dre but there is value
added such as a really pleasant unboxing
experience with cushion covers and an
actual sports towel included as well
there's a pretty nice carrying case to
color match the scheme of the headphone
itself as there are three colors a very
nice slight tangle free cord with an
integrated mic and multi use button and
also a 90 degree headphone jack it snaps
into the headphone with continents and
it will require some force for removal
so it won't just accidentally pop out or
disconnect the headphones are extremely
light and fold in for a more compact
form very flexible as you can see I mean
these things can be penned in forms that
makes me a little bit uncomfortable but
they still hold very well although there
is some creaking at the joints where
they do fold and I would say this would
be the faulty point in the entire
construction the headphones are covered
in the rubberized material that we saw
gotten accustomed to it's very pleasing
to the touch and it does leave finger
marks so keep that in mind
SMS logo is embedded on each side with
color-coded ear cushions as there are
three different colors to choose from
now one thing that is very wall is the
thickness the shape and the feel of
these ear cushions with perforation that
keeps your ears cool which is no gimmick
after about a full hour workout sure
there was some heat accumulation where
the ear cups made contact with my ear
but nowhere as much as traditional on
your headphones my critique here would
be the inconsistency so the perforation
on the ear cup
reveals white foam while the perforation
on the headband reveals yellow foam also
the perforation is quite large - almost
polka dot like and putting these on they
are low-profile as you can see they're
also very light and with just the right
amount of clamping pressure and for them
being athletic targeted that's a very
important element to get right and so
they did these are on ear so soft ear
cushions covered my ear entirely very
well actually four nice isolation at
moderate volumes and without music you
can actually hear your surrounding
environment pretty well the frame of the
headphone does allow glasses to fit
quite well I was happy to see that now I
usually would opt in for in earphones
when working out or jogging and the
street by 50 might actually be an
alternative thanks to the light form
they stayed on very well even with
vigorous head shaking plus the cord is
extremely light it's almost like wearing
wireless headphones so it doesn't weigh
on the one side the included removable
washable covers are not as comfortable
and I would have actually preferred
fully removable ear cushions instead as
for the music quality I used our Oh two
headphone amplifier from JD's labs and
was quite surprised at what I heard I
was expecting these to have a solid base
extension considering the target
audience but the base was weak with a
disappointing representation only the
lower base was somewhat decent but it
still like that punchy feeling listening
to night call and no church in the wild
the constant bass kick was non evident I
was disappointed the mid-range is pushed
back so the vocals are way too distant
in my opinion male vocals in time in
particular had me reaching for an
equaliser to bring back some of that
detail the treble here is also tamed
without that energy that I was expecting
for an athletic headphone now on the one
hand the dark sound signature of the
street by 51 years is great for long
listening sessions without introducing
any sort of fatigue but I found myself
not really enjoying the workout as the
dole responds with reserve mid-tones and
the lack of punchy bass kind of killed
it for me although one impressive
characteristic was the soundstage these
forty Milner drivers do excellent at
expanding your audio and
with surprising amount of depth but I
didn't exactly compliment my workout
Tunes unless you're in love with some
classical or live recordings and the
best thing about these is the form
factor they're light they're comfortable
they're flexible and compact with
complementing removable cable they kept
my ears cool despite them being on ear
and my favorite part of the sound
signature is the soundstage that does
surprisingly well with the audio depth
however the poor bass response didn't
have me pumped up during workouts the
team treble means dull sound and the
lack of consistency in the foam used
even though you have to see it to notice
it still doesn't look very nice for this
price range now strictly from an audio
standpoint the on ear Sport come out
disappointing but it's all the value
added features that make this award II
consideration if you do require the on
ear headphone for your workout so I'm
interested to see how many of you would
be interested in this type of active
lifestyle headphone and this price range
there are many alternatives not exactly
this light for athletic use but take a
look at em 50s from audio technical that
are stellar the HD to 80s from
sennheiser are solid and there are also
some outstanding offerings from bio
dynamics like the dt 770 pro and then
short the street by 50 on your sport are
less about audio and more about the form
factor for your mobile needs and what
that concludes a review thanks for
