HyperX week and while we've already
covered the upcoming cloud flying a
wireless headset you can find the link
right over here there are a few other
newcomers as well some updated versions
of current generation peripherals like
the alloy elite keyboard and Pulsifer
Gaming Mouse while others but the fury
SSD are brand new if you want to add a
bit of unique flair to your build look
no further because HyperX has some
interesting stuff coming your way
but before all of that I wanted to thank
fantex Corsair and cooler master for
providing sponsorship support during
this show without them we would have
been on delayed flights and our hotel
internet access would have been from the
dark ages okay so with that out of the
way let's get on to the fun stuff
starting with the alloy elite RGB gaming
keyboard this is basically the same
keyboard we've reviewed earlier this
year but with the addition of RGB
honestly there was no reason for HyperX
to change a formula that already works
so well
the alloy elite RGB represents the
pinnacle of hyper axis full-size
keyboard designs and its price of $170
reflects that for anyone keeping track
at home
that's a $60 premium over the red
illuminated standard le keyboard but
this is a foxy peripheral so you get
almost crazy number features like a
solid steel frame USB 2.0 past report a
detachable wrist rest and the usual and
key rollover and antique you'll stick
technology those dedicated media buttons
with the volume dial will come handy as
well not to mention Kingston's well
design ingenuity software like with many
other high-end gaming peripherals HyperX
will be offering the elite with three
different Cherry MX key choices red
brown and of course blue if you want to
know more about our impressions on the
standard elite make sure to check out
the link above for gamers who need all
of its features it would be hard to
recommend anything else moving on to
another popular hyper X peripheral that
is being updated we have the pulse fire
mouse this one is receiving an extensive
update to create a new product rather
than replacing the original one outright
the new pulse fire search takes the
first pulse fires body and adds a new
Pixar 3389 sensor that boosts maximum
dpi from 3200 to 16,000 new almond
switches have been added to which moves
durability from 20 million clicks to
about 50 million
finally the pulse fire search receives
RGB
learning and compatibility with
hyperemesis new and Genuity software to
implement custom macros and store them
in an on-board library since the
standard pacifier will remain around at
it's more affordable $49 price point the
surge will have a small premium with its
cost booster to $69.99 now speaking of
that ingenuity software it's something
new for HyperX since all their
peripherals were quite basic and didn't
really need anything to control their
features but with the addition of RGB a
bit more control was needed and that's
where ingenuity steps into place right
now it's still in beta form but it
offers everything we have come to expect
from a program like this there's the
ability to modify the RGB LEDs implement
shortcuts and macros create custom
profiles and much more we can't wait to
see what the final version looks like
all right
RGB trend continues with this guys the
fury RGB SSD yes you heard that right
rather than requiring modders to pay
upwards of 30 dollars for SSD cases with
integrated RGB lighting HyperX is
offering it by default the lighting
effects will be controllable through
software like as rocks RGB sync aces or
sync gigabytes RGB fusion and MSI some
mystic light sync that's pretty cool but
don't think for a second that the pretty
Syria Heights poor performance the fury
SSD will incorporate the latest 3d NAND
technology to deliver read speeds of
approximately 550 megabytes per second
and writes at 500 megabytes per second
while targeting sequential performance
unlike hyper axis current SSD lineup it
will be available in higher capacities
of up to 2 terabytes as well when it's
launched in this summer
expect it to be featured in a few of our
bills as well now the last thing we
wanted touch base on is hyper axis first
RGB memory modules the predator RGB
series I'm well aware that a lot of
other companies have launched
motherboard powered modules but these
are actually the first to feature IR or
infrared technology to remain in sync
basically this means that they will be
perfectly even when displaying various
effects unlike other modules on the
market and that's pretty cool and I
can't wait to see in action in q2 of
2018 so that wraps up our visit to
HyperX and we want to thank them again

needed to produce this video if you want
to know more about anything with feature
