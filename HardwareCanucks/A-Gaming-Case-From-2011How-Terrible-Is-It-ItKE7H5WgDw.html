Canucks review today we've got the
air-cool cyclone 2 with the upgrade USB
ports this case is very exciting for its
Starla now that my friends is a blast
from the past that's how we used to
start all of our case videos what's up
guys I'm Dimitri and today I'm bringing
you something unique and different
taking a look at an enclosure from 2011
so about seven years ago from air cool
this cyclone - sometimes it's fun to go
in the past and re-review things that we
thought back then we're like the state
of the art the highest and premium
products but now let's see exactly how
we have evolved from seven years ago I
really appreciate the handle more Keys
boxes need to have a camp head back
there she is so this is a really
interesting composition in the frame
that you see we have a case from 2018
case from 2011 I'm super excited to see
what the experience would be like in
building something like this and doing
cable management right now we have so
much focus on kayo management with
modern enclosures that you know what was
the experience like seven years ago well
let's see for ourselves right after this
menu and there Mac slick fusion is their
first addressable RGB all-in-one cooler
with a standard 240 ml rad and
absolutely beautiful RGB ring
elimination on the fence and the pump to
highlight that unique flow indicator
through the transparent top check out
the lake fusion down below so I feel
like the warning signs for extremely
restrictive front intake go all the way
back to 2011 because this front panel is
hilarious not only in its design format
but also functionality so from a design
perspective actually blends very well
with this whole like you know jet engine
side looks which are LEDs and they're
not there for air flow but check this
out we have this little perforation on
the front but on the back here there's
nothing it's completely closed so
there's no air coming in or out out of
this entire front panel so we just have
the optical bay area and the little
floppy disk area - and you can see the
gloss spreads all the way to the top
panel and
here we have this really cool kind like
jet engine kind of an exhaust looking
plate but it's kind of pointless because
there is no fan underneath so I'm not
sure why this exists but you can see
gloss in 2011 is kind of acceptable
right so why is it still present on most
modern cases mesh if I see we have this
disgusting gloss on the interior panel
not cool so this is actually the
upgraded version with 2 USB 3 s you know
colored headphone jacks there's an eSATA
port for the O which I find hilarious
the power button it's actually game
discreet kind of this like thin in the
top and it's nice and large but the
reset button is hidden over here and
also has a really nice tactile feel to
it now I do appreciate their commitment
to making sure their case format fits
some form of like a unique design
element so it says star cruiser here
which matches the whole jet engine sort
of front facade here but it also has
cyclone on the front and air cool so I
feel like their cohesion element was a
bit lacking back in the day oh my god we
have thumb screws the days before
tempered glass was everywhere so this is
acrylic and it's like a mix between you
know so we can actually populate the fan
here but they forgot one crucial thing
there is no dust filter but yeah fans on
the side panel is definitely a trend
that has been dead for a while so let me
know if you want to see it come back in
cases down the line oh my god look the
actual jet engine parts are part of the
side panel
that's hilarious wow what a removable
hard drive cage in 2011 Dan because you
know you want that extra graphics card
clearance what does the back look like
huh it's actually not bad at all I mean
the grommets cutouts could be slightly
bigger there's a side this is the amount
over here hmm no bad at all no wonder
this case was over a hundred dollars
when it was launched I mean look at all
this additional material and the tooling
required to attach the plastic onto the
side panels we got it for around 30
euros thanks to caseking for the hook up
the metal side panels by the way are
super thin I feel like I can bend it
with just my thumb
yeah yeah look at all the dust okay for
airflow a single 140 mm fan is included
with blue LED although it is completely
choked ah it looks like you can't
install a fan above here that's why this
whole top looks this way mm-hmm
got it and you can see the rest of the
LEDs are spread through the low you know
engine holes that are routed through
these little wires over here one of them
already popped out oh and you gotta
appreciate the little shark sticker in
the middle of the fan where is the
consistency we have the star cruiser we
have the cyclone and now we have the
shark and taking a look at the inside it
looks a little bare bones for today's
time but back in the day this is
actually really high quality stuff so we
have this blue interior color scheme
going on you know the five and a quarter
inch little lock mechanism have the same
color the removable drive cage is
colored in the same blue as the rest of
the body so it matches very well the
bottom drive cage is non removable it is
riveted but it is not actually attached
to the motherboard tray so you could
potentially remove this without
affecting the structural integrity of
the entire frame the optical drive is
also riveted we have that additional fan
at the top for exhaust I'm guessing and
we have an additional 120mm fan for the
rear exhaust I do like these PCI
brackets that are also in blue and there
are no thumb screws instead we have
these nice silver screws here and the
flock of cables it's actually not too
bad
I see maliks connections you know that's
obviously a sign that something is
outdated but I'm sure that's just for
the lighting but at least the audio
cables black this would be an easy job
for cable management and unfortunately
the only dust filter in this entire case
is at the bottom for your power supply
which is good but nowhere else on the
case so I am genuinely impressed at what
you get in 2011 two fans that are LED
based we have removable drive cage with
plenty of hard drive
you know population we have an SSD caddy
in the back we have an additional fan
that is hidden it's kind of like
discreet you know in this optical area
and the entire motherboard area seems
open you know there is no power supply
shroud but those key
we later and so now it's about time you
put a system into this thing and see how
it performs
what do you know the lighting on the
front panel does not work the morgues
connection for some reason it's not
sending power to the leds the rear fan
is working fine and it's very bright
spilling a lot of light on to the
interior so the front fan is also
working the front fan is actually not
illuminated so the actual LEDs have been
removed and been placed on to the front
panel but yeah they're not receiving
power so instead I put a cable mod LED
strip in the front panel so we can see
what the case looks like because I mean
that's the whole attraction of this
entire enclosure and also can we just
take a second and admire this beautiful
reflection on the wall it's coming from
inside the case but there's a lot of
like things blocking the LED strip so
however this light is being reflected
from inside the case looks absolutely
beautiful and look at these light
streaks on the bottom actually the look
thing that looks really cool I don't
think we'll see anything become the
standard in terms of you know
illuminating the exterior for your
future cases but this visual accidental
artifact is appreciated
all right so for me this entire assembly
process and the experience has been
weirdly familiar you know if you would
take like a 20-17 mid-tower you would
have to take all the same steps to
achieve like a clean cable management
system and make sure that all your
hardware fits where it should and over
the years it's interesting to see how
things have changed so we no longer see
these game redesigns this is the
definition of what people avoid the five
in the quarter inch drive area has
definitely been removed from today's
cases but I wonder why if we had four of
them in the first place maybe have a DVD
drive a CD drive so you can you know
copy the discs and stuff like that but
why would you ever need four and
internally the main change we see is
with the front section so we've removed
the restriction for the front airflow
not only for the front panel but for the
actual frame itself and that next
barrier of having those hard drive
caddies that you could remove
potentially to allow for larger graphics
cards clearance and also allow that
unrestricted front intake and so the
biggest shift has come in terms of
airflow so this case does not support a
240mm radiator
whereas now that's kind of like
the default configuration for any case
that comes out if it does not support
the 240 rod then what are you doing now
air flow in this case is not good my CPU
was throttling it like 94 degrees
Celsius and even opening the front panel
didn't help much but we were throttling
less perhaps the most surprising thing
for me was the whole cable management
situation that I was not expecting to be
that good so all the rubber grommets for
example are spaced out well the only
thing is they're quite small so you
can't fit that many cables comfortably
through and the rubber grommet kind of
falls out for example the power supply
area that rubber grommet is quite small
however at the back we have all the
necessary cable tie points to route your
cables just perfectly fine and we even
have a small lip you know at the very
bottom so you can tuck your cables there
and close the panel without any issues
and if you want to install the module
drive back inside the case it would not
interfere with my 10 a half inch GPU
which is awesome the CPU cut out above
the motherboard is properly located and
it's large enough to pass your cable
through some cases now don't even have
this now what's interesting about the
cable tie points they are a bit smaller
in size so it potentially cannot pass
multiple cable ties through it whereas
now it's slightly longer and gives you a
little bit more mobility when you do the
cable management but one more thing that
surprised me was the inclusion of this
little plastic clip that allows you to
install the motherboard standoffs
something that you know 90% of cases
today don't include by the case from
2011 did and to tie this whole
experience of like working with
something for 2011 I want to reflect as
to where we are heading in terms of case
design so first visual aspects it's
awesome that we're constantly seeing new
case designs but it's weird that with
the inclusion of tempered glass and all
the you know a squared off corners
everything kind of looks the same and
I'm wondering if we'll ever revert back
to something like this I want to see
more specialized cases because right now
every single interior can accommodate
for absolutely any type of hardware but
imagine if we are as a user kind of like
our channel into a particular build
scenario I think that would benefit the
market right now because everything kind
of is
same and I definitely want to see the
next chapter of progression in terms of
case designs to be focused on cable
management so with cases like the H 500
P all the little plating behind the
motherboard tray allows the case to look
so unique and you don't even have to
install the side panel to kind of cover
up all the scavo's because the plating
and all the low sections are already
covered and then we have the new H
series from NZXT that allows you to
channel cables without much effort
because we have those little plastic
guides and makes the organization a lot
easier and so hopefully in six to seven
years we'll be looking at cases that
were launched
you know this year and laugh about their
stupid design decisions and weird frame
structural things internally and see how
the case market has evolved and so I
would love for you to share your
earliest case experience like working
inside something old like this and how
does that contrast to you know how we
work with cases and systems today I hope
