say hello to the Logitech g13 mechanical
gaming keyboard it simple works right
out of the box and it only costs $90 now
that spices things up in the competitive
market since the HyperX a low FPS we
took a look at cost $10 more because
there's strafe cost $20 more than the g4
13 now just to clarify these are
full-size mechanical keyboards but due
to their pricing you are missing a few
key features versus higher priced
alternatives that may or may not affect
your buying decisions so how does the g4
13 compare against its bigger brothers
the G Pearl and the GA 10 more on it
right after this
introducing the new occb X 500 all state
drives from Toshiba it offers great well
balanced speeds built with mlc nand
flash for superior endurance and is also
backed by five year advanced warranty
program learn more about the VX 500 at
OCC comm alright first things first what
exactly are you losing feature wise with
the g4 13 compared to its bigger
brothers the GPRO and the GA 10 well the
obvious one is RGB lighting and that's
okay for me personally since they're
still backlit the default color stays
red and I think it matches the design
really well plus red is typically the
color choice that other brands use when
they sell mid-range mechanical keyboards
the only exception to that is Razer next
up is size but that's subjective I've
been using the G pro as my daily driver
since it arrived at the studio and I'm
really enjoying it so far
I love the compact form factor and the
removable cable is a nice touch the g4
13 on the other hand is a full-sized
mechanical keyboard so you're getting
the standard numpad which is perfect if
you're working with a lot of numbers and
while it does take up a little more
space than a TKO keyboard it's actually
pretty compact there are no dedicated
macro buttons or included wrist rest
that would expand a typical full-size
keyboard footprint my buddy Dimitri has
done a fantastic video comparing tkl
keyboards to a full-size and if you're
interested I'll leave a link in the
description
below as a bonus logitech has included a
single USB 2.0 pass to report at the
back for plugging in any USB powered
device on the downside it requires more
bandwidth to drive that port
hence the cable is really thick so keep
that in mind it's also non-renewable
unlike the G Pearl and look Logitech's
goal of the GPRO was to offer a gaming
keyboard for professional eSports who
care about customizable lighting compact
nature excellent switch performance and
portability
now with the g4 13 they're really
targeting towards amateurs like me or
anyone who games casually without
leaving their desk and I'm glad they
have those criterias covered to be
honest with you that focus doesn't make
the g4 13 subpar for gaming it's
actually a great gaming companion the
build quality along with the design of
the g4 13 is really good essentially
they've laid a solid piece of aluminum
on top of the plastic chassis which
gives the chassis excellent rigidity and
as you can see it barely flexes no
matter how hard I push right now the g4
13 will come in two distinctive flavors
the carbon model I have here features a
stealthy black anodized aluminum finish
and the silver model is a Best Buy
exclusive only do note that the edges of
the aluminum frame are a bit too sharp
but they don't get in the way when
you're typing on the keyboard Logitech
has also included optional contour key
caps for the woz and mobile key set if
you need additional grip or for better
separation with the rest of the keys
personally I would never swap these
stock keys for these just because it
takes away the stealth appeal of the g4
13 that I'm already digging
moving on to switches well that's the
best part the g4 13 comes with
logitech's custom design romaji switches
like the ones they found on the G pearl
and the GA 10 this is pretty important
since both of those keyboards cost a lot
more to give you a little refresher the
romaji
incorporates lighting right at the
center of the stem and in turn it
outputs a uniform and consistent
lighting per key so it avoids the
brightness gradient found on standard
Cherry MX switches it looks amazing in
person and honestly I'm not a fan of
inconsistent lights pill sound on other
gaming keyboards so this is a good
design in my eyes the switch is act
exactly the same as a cheaper meaning
tuition takes place at 1.5 millimeters
and it only requires 45 grams of force
to register press now if you compare
that to a popular switch like the cherry
MX read that actuated two millimeters
would be exact same amount of force it's
almost identical but this is just
Logitech steak on a faster switch and
that's true these are really fast almost
closer to the MX speeds which is found
on the k95 Platinum from Corsair other
than that there's nothing really more to
talk about these switches since they are
just as fast as the ones found on the G
Perot and my gaming experience with
these were also similar it's almost like
using the G Pro if you don't pay
attention to extra features like RGB
lighting compactness renewable cable etc
and the best part is you don't have to
pay a premium price to get a similar
gaming experience
speaking of gaming the emoji switches do
a great job at that now I'm already used
to these switches from the G Pro so
switching to the g4 13 didn't feel
different they are lighter so it's
easier for movements throughout the
gameplay and finger fatigue is
completely kind of question last but not
least is the driver software and it's
one of the best to work around with
you're greeted with a physical overview
of the keyboard and Logitech has added a
function key inversion toggle that
switches the secondary commands like
media playback buttons and the
brightness control as primary so you
don't have to keep hitting the function
to control them macros can be easily
assigned from f1 through f12 Logitech
has pre-programmed a handful of commands
that users can take advantage of which
is cool you can create profiles and play
around with the lighting which is also
fairly limited when it comes to
customizability you only get the option
to adjust brightness and enable or
disable the breathing effect along with
its respective speed so to conclude the
g4 13 from Logitech it's an interesting
entry into the mid-range gaming
mechanical keyboards for one it only
cost $90 and you're getting the exact
same switches found on the GPL and the
GA 10 which are the romaji switches the
build quality is great and you're
getting all the essentials of a
full-sized mechanical keyboard like a
numpad
dedicated or integrated Mac a media
playback buttons macro customization
through the function keys and adjustable
sliders which is pretty cool if you
really want to give romaji switches a
try give this a shot and I'm sure
you won't regret it and we're also
giving it the harbor connects dan good
Valley Award
well that concludes this review hope you
enjoyed what do you guys think about the
g4 13 from Logitech if the prize
justifiable for what you're paying and
