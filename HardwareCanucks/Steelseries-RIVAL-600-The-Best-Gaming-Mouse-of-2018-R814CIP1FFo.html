Canucks and there's one particular
product category that I've been
collecting over the years and that is
something that I've used as my daily
driver for a significant amount of time
and that is gaming mice so I started off
with the launch deck g502 I moved into
the my onyx caster then I moved on to
the Zoe fk1
then onto the SteelSeries rival 300 and
they'll ride about 700 then on to the
large 2g 4 or 3 and then the large the G
Pro and now back to SteelSeries for the
rival 310 so the rival 310 currently is
my favorite gaming mouse the shape the
sensor the performance out of the world
you know what helps me with my precise
aimed and csgo and also on a desktop but
now they're claiming they'll win you
over with the rival 600 so this thing
actually combines modular elements and
their new true move 3 plus sensor that
has a dedicated sensor just to detect
the liftoff distance so there's
absolutely or minimal jitter when the
mouse comes down onto the surface I've
actually never experienced any issues
with the rival 310 in terms of the lift
off distance adjustments and my play
style actually involves lifting the
mouse quite a lot so I'm really excited
to see how the rival 600 stacks up so
let's check it out right after this hi
I'm looking for a case well look no
further I got this beauty with all steel
premium frame with a side of tempered
glass - beautifully showcase any cooling
adventure you might pursue and cable
management system that you wish you had
earlier the age 709 this one's for you
hoo hoo this one's gonna be a good one
so let's first start with the price it
fits right in between the $59 rival 310
and the $99 rival 700 so I think that
$79 price point is pretty standard among
other champions like the g5 or two or
the my onyx castor but for those wanting
the best of the best the rival 600
delivers so first the coating on the
buttons and side grips are smooth
silicon it feels awesome to the touch
and has pleasant grip heinous to it the
side sections are also magnetic and pop
out when the force is applied below the
mouse and that's important so they don't
simply break apart during gaming and
these reveal four pockets on each side
that are for weight adjustment we have
this awesome rubber pouch that contains
four gram weights that you can populate
into any of the eight slots and by
default the mouse is 96 grams which is a
bit heavier versus the 88 gram rival 310
and with all the weights you can add up
to 32 grams if you prefer a heavier
Mouse but it also allows you for like
customization of the balance on each
side to create the best configuration
for your handling taste so I'm not the
one to play around with weights
personally you know I prefer to just get
comfortable with the default body but I
noticed that I would left the left side
of the mouse a bit too much when moving
to the right or doing flicks and that
would cause the sensor to stop tracking
because the mouse was just way too high
so to prevent that I added more weights
to the left side and it actually seemed
to balance it out nicely now keep in
mind when taking off the side grips some
weights might fall out but I really
appreciate the rubber storage
compartment that you can wrap around the
mouse cable so it doesn't get lost and
if all the weights are in place it holds
down the cable quite well if you made
your body differences between the rival
3 10 include a much larger fin for the
DPI change button I don't like this
because when clicking the scroll wheel
is just too easy to accidentally click
the DPI button as well you can see the
primary buttons are a bit higher that
compliments claw grip slightly better
the right curve on the rival 600 has a
larger slant that feels more comfortable
but because of the removable side grips
you can feel that opening underneath the
thumb of the frame but overall it's a
super comfortable Mouse but I do prefer
the rival 310 for the larger side
buttons and better curvature on the
primary clicks the scroll wheel is
absolutely fantastic with great texture
tactile bumps lots of control and super
nice middle click the primary buttons
have a muted audible actuation and are
extremely satisfying with pressure and
travel distance these side buttons are
quite small but easy to press plus
there's a third click here too that for
me is quite far and needs Henery
adjustment to reach the cable is non
braided so that's awesome it is
removable with this chunky entrance so
regular micro USB cables should also
work now I don't particularly care about
RGB but the aid zone illumination is
well implemented it looks quite nice but
keep the middle stripes all the same
color as the gradient between the zones
is not because
we pretty and so now the coolest part of
the 600 is the sensor so the main
tracking sensor is the same true mu3 as
found on the drive of 310 it's fantastic
delivers true one-to-one tracking for
the entire sensitivity range from 100 to
12000 but now they've added a liftoff
distance sensor for more accurate
liftoff distance control and so that
means when the mouse is either being
lifted off the surface or comes back
down you have the least amount of
unwanted cursor movement and this sensor
is so good that setting it to the lowest
point possible means that it will
actually stop tracking in some sections
of my mouse mat where my hand had
depressed the fabric making it almost
unusable in like half the mouse mat
where my hand usually sits now to me I
cannot feel any surface variation in the
thickness of the mouse mat but the mouse
can because it has such precise you know
distance lift off distance detection
that the mouse is thinking that you are
actually lifting the mouse and it's not
just that slight depression in the
fabric and it's kind of funny because
I've always asked still serious to
include some sort of lift off distance
adjustment because many other gaming
mice do that but it's hilarious for them
to go ahead and come up with this best
solution to actually include a separate
sensor that's sole purpose is to detect
that distance but does it really matter
so when I tested it side by side to the
rival 310 that has no lift off distance
adjustment the 600 is just a tiny bit
better at limiting that motion during
lift and contact so yes there is a
benefit the sensor performance better
but I'm also glad they've added the
weight adjustment because otherwise
paying that $20 price premium would not
be worth it
now gaming on this one felt incredible
good aim adjustment is comfortable flex
motion is under control and overall
tracking is absolutely fantastic
and the only performance difference I
could feel versus the 3/10 was that the
Teflon feet and the surface traction
felt rougher and not as smooth on the
rival 600 and the 310 perhaps maybe it's
been worn in so so much at the bottom
that it feels much smoother but you can
actually hear the difference too
and so for those looking to get into
SteelSeries mice the rival 600 is highly
recommended it's got their best sensor
so far it's got nice weight system for
balance distribution it's got really
nice body comfortable to use and a
really good price point too so we're
giving it the Harbor Canucks damn we
reward
however the fin button on the rival 310
is more comfortable especially because I
use the middle mouse click all the time
and a slightly more angle or slant and
primary buttons and the larger browser
buttons is why I'm keeping the rival 310
as my primary mouse for now alright guys
so that's all my thoughts on the rival
600 but I'm curious to know if any of
you have actually ever used the lift off
distance adjustment for your mouse if it
has it or if you've ever used that
surface calibration tool that basically
also detects the optimal surface
tracking and the distance let me know in
the comments below and I'm wondering
like you know if the rival 600 are they
trying to push too much new things or is
this like incremental change in that
precise lift off distance control
actually worth it to professional gamers
or you guys let me know in the comments
I'm a Dmitry thanks so much for watching
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
