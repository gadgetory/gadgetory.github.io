axe and so far we've seen a lot of
peripherals at CES 2018 but when we
visited HyperX one really stood out to
us
this is their very first wireless gaming
headset the cloud flight now it might
not look all that special and there are
quite a few wireless gaming headsets
already on the market but there are ton
of reasons why I'm so excited for it to
launch a bit later this month but before
I get into that let's take a quick
message at our sponsors our 2018 CES
coverage is brought to you by fan tax
Corsair and Coolermaster so let's talk
about why the team here at CES are so
excited about this headset first of all
the HyperX thought series has always
been one of the best gaming headsets on
the market from the original cloud to
the new stinger alpha and the revolver
their price to performance ratios have
been very very good and comfort is
always taken into account as a matter of
fact the cloud series is one of the best
selling headsets around and I'm not
surprised about that at all now HyperX
is taking the cloud to its next logical
step by introducing a wireless version
called the cloud fight from the outside
it has the same basic design features of
others in the cloud line up with a
stealthy black color scheme along with
some red accents the HyperX logo is
illuminated with internal LEDs but those
can be easily turned off by the press of
a button
speaking of buttons hyperox has worked
hard to integrate them into the overall
aesthetic and I think they've been
pretty successful with them you can
adjust volume mute change the led
effects or turn off the headset
completely microphones in the cloud
series have always been pretty good and
this one is no different
it is completely removable and features
advanced noise canceling technology
compatibility with discord and teamspeak
is integrated as well we didn't get to
test it extensively but it sounds like
it is in line with HyperX s latest
launches and don't forget a full review
will be posted very soon but what about
sound well first of all I have to
mention that HyperX did the right thing
here and kept it pretty simple by going
with a stereo setup virtual surround
sound hasn't been well implemented in
headphones and trying to integrate
multi-channel sound over wireless could
have probably caused more problems than
it was worth but with the cloud flight I
have to say that the great soundstage
we've come to expect with HyperX is
definitely there and it isn't ruined by
the implementation of wireless
technology the 50 millimeter drivers
provide rich Buy
without it being too blue me and the ear
cups are nice and soft so very
comfortable those ear cups also rotate
90 degrees so they can fit easily around
your neck when not in use even the range
is good actually really good since the
2.4 gigahertz operating frequency not
only provides good audio quality but
also a long operating distance and
compatibility with PC ps4 and ps4 pro we
weren't able to test battery life but
HyperX claims the cloud flight will
offer up to an amazing 30 hours of
continual playback before needing a
recharge supposedly that's an
industry-leading number and don't worry
that claim will be tested by us but if
you want a game in Wired mode the flight
will offer that too through a 3.5
millimeter audio connector let's talk
about pricing because the HyperX cloud
client isn't inexpensive since it will
cost around $160 when it launches lady
in January if you put that next to
competitors like Corsairs avoid pro and
the logitech g930 it's about $60 more
but the addition of longer battery life
and the 2.4 gigahertz wireless spectrum
instead of bluetooth do add value so
that's about it for the cloud flight and
we're super excited to test it over a
long term I'd also like to thank ington
for sponsoring our visit to their suite
if you want to know more about it check
out the links in the description down
below or check out Kingston's YouTube
channel but what about you guys do you
prefer the freedom of wireless or the no
fuss setup and a lower price of wide
solutions let us know in the comments
down below I me more with how it
connects thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
