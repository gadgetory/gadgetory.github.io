such an expensive case in my life this
is the course their concept case based
on the 760 T model that cost $18,000 for
the case alone our complex trip is
brought to you by fan tech schoolmaster
and MSI now the whole idea behind this
case is not to really sell to the mass
audience but as a concept curve to see
what Corsair is capable of throwing out
that cash money but seriously in when
every year does like crazy bills and
crazy cases that nobody wants to buy
just there to show you see what they're
capable of and they potentially take
some those features from those really
ridiculous cases and apply them to their
mainstream cases and well I doubt that
Corsair would apply something like this
because this is full carbon fiber and
looks absolutely amazing I've never seen
anything like it
beautiful orange you know lighting
within the case and beautiful orange
framing - tempered glass on the front
that is curved and they went really fool
out with the build inside that you know
this is 18,000 for the case alone
obviously on non mass scale production
this would be you know economies of
scale so it's kind of I'm happy to see
something like this because not only are
they able to show off that they can do
something cool and like for hype and
just like this is this is what we do
because we're course there and stuff but
inside we also seeing their water
cooling integration that they're trying
to really push forward because everyone
is also doing the same thing and $18,000
case it's quite cool but there's another
thing that Corsair has an upper sleeve
in the gaming Department let's check it
out alright so this is another concept
of course they're showing this is the
concept Zeus it's a wireless Qi charging
mouse mat not a wireless mouse map it's
a wireless key charger built into the
mouse mat with a wireless mouse being
able to charge off that Qi charger you
simply back it on up over here well
until until the logos glows red that
means the Qi charger has been activated
over here that my friends is pretty cool
and this is the only region on the mouse
mat that the Qi charger is built in
because we're told as the coil gets
bigger the diminishing returns on your
charging capabilities are
bored so here we don't have confirmation
on whether or not if it's the capacity
of the charge between forty and seventy
seven percent of versus your having the
mouse plugged in but this is a cool
concept of having of gaming and never
having to literally plug in the mouse
into your computer for charging you
simply line it up with the dot there and
everything will charge just perfectly
well we have no confirmation on the
mouse we're told it's give me a seven
button mouse so we don't care about the
mouse we care about the technology is
built into here and allowing this
convenience of charging a wireless
peripherals with things and you can put
your phone there too if you have an
iPhone or an Android phone connecting
this little dongle will do the trick as
well so another advantage that we were
just told about is depending on your
wrist style and how you play if you like
to flicking around or you like to keep
your hand moving movement to a very
local area if you don't use the entire
mouse mat you can leave your phone here
to charge that's one thing plus this
mouse pad has a USB 3.1 that's built
into this little dongle here so you
could potentially plug in the mouse and
charge that that way or use the receiver
that comes with the mouse to plug in
here so you have the least amount of
distance and you'll get the best signal
possible alright guys so that concludes
the concert demonstration here at
Corsair are you excited about the 760
potentially making a return with some
cool carbon fiber and a particular color
specific accents how are you feel about
the Qi charger built into the wire into
the mouse mat with a wireless mouse I'm
sure they'll add like RGB and everything
else
yeah I'm Dimitri our connect thanks for
watching ibrahim oh yeah so thanks for
watching I'll see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
