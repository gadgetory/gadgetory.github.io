budget-conscious consumers are always
trying to get the best bang for the buck
but most often the low price tag comes
with many compromises and build quality
but also features it makes us question
the balance between affordability and
functionality so a company under the
name cougar is really redefining what
affordability means within this fastly
competitive Sassy's market so this mini
gaming case
spike is the lowest priced case we've
ever reviewed here at Huracan ox
retailing at $35 now of course concerns
do arise because of the price but I'm
sure many are willing to overlook the
negatives at such an attractive low-cost
solution
I mean individual side panels are sold
at similar price so keeping that in mind
let's get on with the review so the case
does manage to give off a unique vibe
with this front panel the rest of the
construction is thin steel we don't get
that tough feel but it does manage to
pull off a decent build quality at this
price point now we have two five and a
quarter inch drive bays along with a 3.5
inch below with your power and reset
buttons two USB ports one which is USB 3
and your audio jacks now the panel can
easily be removed from the front which
reveals all the connections are attached
to the panel itself and not to the frame
a single fan can be installed either 120
90 or 80 millimeter are supported with a
sight cutout to route your cable it's a
nice consideration and we do have a
front mesh but unfortunately no dust
odor I speaking of fans only one fan is
included with the spike for your rear
exhaust so it is highly recommended that
you install that front intake for
adequate passive airflow now the case
does have small anti-vibration pads
installed at the bottom which is better
than nothing
the top of the case is bare which means
no additional fan mounts can be
installed and only one way to install
your power supply facing down now this
is one of the few cases that we've
looked at with the top mounted power
supply but in this case it actually
works and we'll talk about that a bit
later now my only concern is this very
small power supply base that supports
the unit and it would be nice to see it
enlarged to reassurance that it won't
drop on your motherboard
aside from securing it from the back now
in the back we have four PCI slots that
are unfortunately non-reusable
and additional side venting and given
the limited airflow options here the
side fan mounting options are very
welcome which are positioned to cool
both your CPU and your GPU now look
inside the old black interior is going
to be well received for a value case
here we also have the old toolless
mounting for your optical and hard
drives and right below is the space that
has the potential to house 14 inch
graphics cards which is pretty
impressive also that front fan installed
you have yourself a nice cooling
solution although your 3.5 inch rise
might get a little toasty as they are
outside of the airflow channel now we
can also install a single 2.5 inch drive
on the floor although it might be a
little difficult accessing while your
graphics cards are in place and looking
in the back there isn't much here and
there's absolutely no room behind the
motherboard tray so expect to do all
your cable management internally and
with the first few parts installed this
micro ATX case doesn't stack too bad
of course cable management is limited
but there is plenty of room at the top
to store all your cables now clearance
for your CPU heatsink and memory may
become an issue especially for your
memory modules because of those 3.5 inch
drives of course this will vary based on
motherboards but any module higher than
2 inches will have clearance issues so
continuing with cable management to my
surprise wiring everything wasn't so
difficult at all
little cramped but honestly it cleaned
up pretty well considering all the
cables are inside of the case and not at
the back and I was actually quite
surprised at how the spy can handle such
enthusiast load and show cases that even
a $35 case can do the job well with
support for long graphics cards up to
four fans for cooling three hard drives
and one SSD is pretty much all we need
for a decent gaming rig anyway and the
entire package for such a low price is
an absolutely and no brainer for any
value build and also cable management if
done properly will leave the internals
clutter free now of course our critique
cannot be seduced by the price but these
are minor issues that if taken into
account can make this an even more
competitive case for example the lack of
a dust filter the front and slightly
taller case feet would be nice however
no matter of the price the sticking out
3.5 inch drives are no excuse and the
simple 90-degree rotation of the cage
would solve for the extra RAM clearance
and get rid of that extra cable mess but
seriously guys for a $35 case this is an
absolutely damn good value product from
Cougar so that wraps up a review for the
spike thanks for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
