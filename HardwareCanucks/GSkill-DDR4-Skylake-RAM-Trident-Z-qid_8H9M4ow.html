possible without innovative fantex
world-leading Nvidia graphics memory
partner Corsair and retail partner and
CIX
along with silverstone and in win so
intel skylake is fast approaching and
aside from seeing many motherboards at
Computex that are prepping for that
launch g-scale showed off their new ddr4
trident z ram that is designed for
skylake it will be dual channel memory
speeds will start at 3333 megahertz we
are told the modules will be available
in 4 8 and 16 gigabyte capacities at 1.3
5 volts with unconfirmed latencies yet
one of the interesting design choices
though g.skill has made for the trident
z has is this multicolored design or
double-sided color combination the
modules they showed us on the shore
floor had one side black aluminum and
the other silver with this really
distinctive glossy red separator in the
middle I asked if we could swap the
colors or have some modular heatsink
plates if this was where we headed with
RAM and you know choosing your own color
but for now it will stay put the way it
is I think the heatsink looks really
awesome with fins on an angle like that
but it will all come down to color
preference and whether or not you like
this type of combination there will be
four versions released to suit the most
common color schemes for the motherboard
so we'll have orange green red and blue
but this double-sided concept won't pick
up unless there's interest and from what
we are told on the show floor it's
either you love it or you hate it so let
us know how you feel about the design
with your comment below so thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
