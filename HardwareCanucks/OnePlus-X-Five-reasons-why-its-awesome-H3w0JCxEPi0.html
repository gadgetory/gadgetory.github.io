great technology selection and service
so the oneplus X is now available to
purchase without an invite every huge
day this is a fantastic direction for
oneplus to make this device available to
the masses and actually what they've
done with the oneplus 2 is completely
remove the invite system so now you can
buy the oneplus 2 no invite needed
what's up guys I'm Dimitri with Huracan
acts and this is top 5 reasons of why
you should consider buying the oneplus X
if it's in your budget so first the
value you get with a smartphone is
pretty fantastic at $249 plus a rubber
case is included with an awesome tangle
free micro USB cable and leave it to
oneplus 2 seriously set the benchmark of
what a budget smartphone should look
like
and what it should feel like now come
the specs without any real drawbacks at
this price point we have a Snapdragon
801 processor at 2.3 gigahertz Adreno
330 GPU 3 gigs of ram and 16 gigabytes
of storage 2525 milliamp hour battery
and LTE support but with some bands
missing so for AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile in the
States you'll be moved to the lower
speed now would you consider the lack of
USB type-c NFC AC Wi-Fi quick charging
and 4k video a deal-breaker at this
price point no because those features
are normally associated with smart
phones triple the price of the oneplus X
but where it lacks in those add-on
high-end features it makes up with the
display and the build the display here
is fantastic it's 5 inches 1080p
resolution it is an AMOLED type panel
with Gorilla Glass 3 the blacks are
super deep and contrast is really
awesome white balance is right on point
and vibrancy is it a very pleasing level
just look at it next to the oneplus two
the color on the oneplus X pops out
without being harsh the oranges and the
blues still maintain plenty of
definition and for the display alone I
could see myself switching to the
oneplus X as my daily driver this is
very well complemented by the build
which follows in line as one of the best
features of the smartphone not
only to have a metal frame surrounding
the entire device but also glass front
and back sides with extremely satisfying
handling the back is a fingerprint
canvas of course but you won't really
care because of how nice it feels and
even though it's using older Gorilla
Glass 3 the touch surface of the display
is smoother and feels better to navigate
versus the newer Gorilla Glass 4 found
only one plus to some other awesome
physical elements on the oneplus X
include an alert slider with three
confident steps and really clicky power
and volume rocker we have a multicolor
notification LED in the top right and
the discreet built-in capacitive buttons
that allow that front face of the
oneplus X to remain beautiful and I
actually prefer them like this instead
of them being backlit furthermore
removing the SIM card tray you can
either populate it with two SIM cards or
use one of the slots for a micro SD card
to expand your storage which is an
awesome implementation with this tray
and lastly the full experience taking
everything into account has been
surprisingly positive it's a fast device
and oxigen the West is pretty much stock
Android anyway with a few built-in
customizations like double tap to wake
double tap the home button to bring up
the camera choose your accent color and
I'm getting more comfortable with using
shelf but I think it's pretty limited
still and I hope that they let us
replace it with Google now the earphone
speaker is very clear the bottom speaker
is actually louder than the oneplus 2
speaker and the camera is totally
passable one that doesn't have image
stabilization for low-light shooting but
in my experience it has been more
consistent and more accurate with
exposure again when compared to the
oneplus 2 so these were my five reasons
why you should consider the oneplus X
with battery life being ok with three
plus hours on screen time but there are
two things that really highlight the
cost-cutting with this device first the
Wi-Fi range is not so good having about
40% signal strength in the room just
next to the router while the oneplus 2
has about 90% signal strength and to the
EMC see storage is very slow updating
apps takes forever and saving photos
after using the photo editor is
painfully slow but luckily these are the
only two instances of real-world
slowdowns when it comes to storage
when using the oneplus X and with all
things considered oneplus x delivers a
very satisfying package one that I
couldn't wait to open and if you're
looking for a thumbs up experience with
a few my networks then the oneplus X is
definitely worth the wait for a Tuesday
I'm Dimitri with a broken ax thanks so
much for watching we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
