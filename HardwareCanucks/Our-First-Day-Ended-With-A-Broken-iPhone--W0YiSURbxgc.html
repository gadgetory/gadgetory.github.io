this will be our fifth time attending
complex love the show love taipei life
seeing all my peeps and over years we've
learned how to pack light gear wise yes
yes and yes little luggage for uber as
requested as for camera gear one body
and two lenses and this is the
wide-angle stuff for vlogs but the
tamara on 2275 is the general go around
b-roll lens while this thing is for more
environmental and this thing well maybe
for another time we got battery life
four days with 20,000 milliamp hour
battery bank and if you're wondering why
it's so green behind these because
there's a lot of green reflecting from
the leaves and the trees outside we're
very close to the tree okay Computex
2019 it is folks i am thrilled for this
trip first of all I get to see Dimitri
I'm actually waiting for Mike right now
he's gonna come pick me up and work man
ahead to the airport but first the huge
thanks to our sponsors fine thanks and
SteelSeries for making our complex trip
possible also it's raining outside so I
hope that our way to the airport would
be just fine I'm not checking in any
bags because I'm a baller he's such a
show-off
look at him jeez man but he has a sick
ride doh so anyways
another one of those flights it is 4:30
in the morning
so we have landed interesting enough the
plane arrived an hour early after a 15
hour flight
yeah and Dimitri's flight arrives in two
hours so we absolutely have no idea what
we're gonna be doing because we have to
get through immigration immigration is
open but nothing else is open check it
assume yeah we can't get a SIM card
nothing
now just like last time we'll land it a
different terminal so I gotta go pick
them up
boys I'm coming why I be working
they have no idea I'm coming excuse me
sirs
the boys reunite these people have
arrived here since four o'clock in the
morning and will be the first time we
exit to the airport after six hours to
feel the air oh it is wonderful
it is 33 degrees right now it is lovely
awesome to see a familiar place oh yeah
the Airbnb zebra how many layers do you
got on right now so we have the same
exact Airbnb as last time and apparently
the guys have already claimed the bigger
rooms you know so Eber is like I'm gonna
just sleep in here head has already
accustomed to his big space and put all
his gear away come on Eva what happened
to the my room is so much better for you
like look at this you have a tiny bit
less space but a nice compact bed where
you don't have to worry and the best
thing you have a desk you have a desk in
your room
Eber I think we should switch no Mike
over here has he got a private bathroom
private shower an amazing view well I'm
sleeping the closet over here while you
can you can totally just have so many
people over here no Eber I have some
delivery for you you all can enjoy but
the question is do they have anything
for me Michael

very much and we have more socks
sponsored by Lenovo I really feel like
this is better than Intel so you know
like this this is very colorful yeah all

anything from I don't have anything for
you though no I don't need anything from

Taiwan like Oh

store my camera was having issues had a
big black dot in the camera sensor looks
like there was something just inside the
lens housing and they took away my
iPhone but luckily the repairs only
