Canucks and we're here at the team group
sweet the Computex 2018 and we're here
to check out some of the cool a tough
gimmie alliance memory
so let's actually check them out the
first huge shout out to our sponsors
fantex thermal taking cool master Gotham
is coverage would have not been possible
so apart from checking out cases here at
Computex we wanted to cover something a
bit different so this is the tough
gaming Alliance ddr4 and it pretty much
breaks the trend of other memory there's
no heat sink or fancy RG B's but rather
a simple raw black PCB with mid-tone
yellow graphics silkscreen onto it as
you might have guessed teen group has
teamed up with the Asus tough brand to
launch these modules and they're
supposed to match certain motherboards
in the tough lineup right now this
product will only be launched into an
entry-level price point with a four
times a gigabyte kit that runs at twenty
four hundred megahertz on samsung be
Dyan modules over clunking is possible
but the lack of a heat spreader means
you need to ensure that there's adequate
cooling if you want higher frequencies
honestly guys this memory kit looks
absolutely amazing
but this isn't quite a finished product
yet the final version will have the
yellow design on both sides of the PCB
and there may also be an additional
speed been released when they officially
launched it a bit later this year the
other modules you may have seen in some
of the last shots of the Vulcan tough
ddr4 these still have the yellow and
black color scheme but incorporated
heatsink and will go for a higher price
than the standard kit team group expects
this particular kit will use a
combination of micron and hynek's chips
to achieve speeds of up to 36 hundred
megahertz while offering capacities of
16 gigabytes and 32 gigabytes ok time to
move on to something a bit more in line
where a lot of the market is headed
right now yeah that's that's RGB again
but I think team group has done this
thing right say hello to the T Force
Excalibur this is one of team groups
higher end products and it uses a unique
internal diffuser to dissipate the RGB
illumination so each module produces a
subtle glow rather than a harsh light
the setup also allows for a much larger
viewing area than similar modules from
companies like Coursera and G scale the
xcalibur is also available in two
versions one with a standard RGB light
bar and another special edition with a
unique crosshatch design we are
wondering which one would you prefer so
let us know in the comments down below
the very last bit of RAM I wanted to
talk about is a new T force extreme
which uses a very simple but highly
effective heat spreader to achieve some
amazing speeds now this is team's
leading edge memory so it doesn't come
cheap but by using hand-picked Samsung
beaded chips it's certified to hit 4,500
megahertz as a matter of fact with the
right cooling and by using a coffee Lake
CPU with a good memory controller these
modules have hit over 50 500 megahertz
dam alright so normally I'd stop here
but just before we left the meeting here
a team group we saw this thing hanging
off a display basically it's a zinc
alloy 128 gigabyte USB 3.1 genuine thumb
drive that also acts as a bottle opener
box cutter and a tape measure I could
have really used one of these during the
show and with a price of just $35 when
it's launched in October you should be
wanting one too well that's it from Team
Group guys I hope you enjoyed this
little pause from all the case news
we've been posting recently hopefully
you'll stick around since we've got a
ton more content coming up from Computex
2018 i'm ebar with hardware connects
thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
