and simple looking case from fractal
design here's the Ark MIDI tower the
company specializes in cooling power
supplies and chassis so designing
practical cases should not be a foreign
territory the case is priced around $100
and should be available now the chassis
is deceivingly small and at first raise
some concerns with its specifications
but they had us fooled and how spacious
it really is on the inside and we
finally have a wide enough enclosure
that can support high CPU coolers
without compromising precious space from
all the cable management at the back so
let's take a look the case is made of
steel with aluminum looking front panel
that is actually plastic giving the
impression of high-quality brushed
aluminum without paying the premium and
another plastic top panel that blends in
really well with the steel side panels
the buttons are located on the top to
keep the front panel clean with the
power and reset buttons your audio to
regular USB ports and one USB 3 ports
which connects to an internal 20-pin
cable and the adapter is not included
leaving it useless for non-supported
motherboards and the front panel has 2 v
in the quarter inch optical base with
included 3.5 inch adapter with
complementary bay cover but the main
focus here is on the airflow the panel
has a built in dust filter supports two
140 mm fans with one already included
and are secured using fan Clips instead
of screws to ease out on the assembly
the fan blades are white which fits in
really well with the other white accents
on the inside and they are also braided
in black which we really like two comma
flash all the cables now the top panel
is also removable with a built-in dust
filter and this is where the arc really
stands out from the rest similar sized
enclosures the top panel can house 320
or 140 millimeter fans or 180 plus
either 120 or 140 mm in a fan this means
the dual rod can be installed for
internal water cooling and clearance is
not an issue for the fans closest to the
front even with the top optical drive in
place and more ventilation can be added
by the side panel with marketing for an
optional 180 or 140 million fan
movie on we have our usual placement for
the back with water cooling holes an
exhaust fan io area 7 PCI slots and
additional vertical one for mounting
accessories and the bottom mounted power
supply with a removable dual dust filter
the chassis is also elevated by case
feet with vibration absorbance and is
very stable checking the inside we have
a fairly small CPU cutout with rubber
grommets around the motherboard tray the
power supply is raised for anything from
the bottom and the back wall is covered
in any vibration surface to prevent
unnecessary noise and all the PCI slots
are in white and the case is equipped
with two extra 140 million fans moving
on the optical drives must be secured
with screws so no tool is mounting here
and below that are the two harddrive
cages with built-in SSD support the top
hard drive cage is removable just with
two thumb screws this allows
installation of longer video cards and
direct the airflow for the internals you
can also rotate the cage for more direct
airflow over your hard drives all the
dry brackets are secured with thumb
screws for reassurance and the bracket
has anti-vibration grommets for your 3.5
inch drives which you have to install
using provided screws and the bracket
also supports 2.5 inch drives now the
white accents on the drive brackets the
fans and the PCI covers is sort of a
company staple and this helps to break
up the black theme on the inside and
adds a touch of character to the arc at
the back we have some cable tie
mountings and one inch of space between
the motherboard tray and the panel which
is plenty of room for all your cable
management needs and we have not yet
seen this much room on such a small
enclosure now we didn't run into a small
hiccup when installing our drive onto
the top slot of the bottom cage now this
is because the screws that hold the
mounting system for the top hard drive
cage did not allow clearance for the
drive underneath now this is a quick fix
if the top cage is removed
as part of the accessories an angled
wrench is included and this removes the
cage rails from both top and the bottom
but of course in case the user needs all
the available drive space it won't have
clearance
unless user modified and the chassis
also supports an optional 120 or 140
Milner fan for the bottom intake and
power supply is up to 170 millimeters
will still have clearance as part of the
accessories fractal design includes a
PCI fan controller which you can mount
on the vertical PCI slot at the back the
controller supports three fans with
included fan cable extensions which are
unfortunately not braided and finally
with the system installed it is quite
amazing and how well it handles with
cable management rubber grommets are of
high quality and they are large enough
to pass all the needed cables and GPU
support with cage removed is 470
millimeters which is 18.5 inches plenty
of room for any high end graphics card
and with the cage installed carton
lengths of 290 millimeters will be
supported and that is eleven point five
inches and obviously not forgetting the
CPU cutout it won't be useful for all
motherboards because it doesn't support
high CPU placement keys manufacturers
must expend the cat out to the top just
to cover a larger spectrum of different
motherboards and to summarize the arc is
quite impressive in almost all the
fields the elegant and simple design
really holds its own with the aluminum
looking front panel and module hard
drive cage possibilities for extremely
long graphics cards or just take
advantage of a more direct airflow and
the cooling for the arc is a big plus
with many mounting options on the top
panel and generally all around the
chassis with dust filters to keep the
system clean with cable management that
cleans up nicely with minimal effort and
the best part of the arc tower is its
value bringing in at around $100 the arc
stands along one of the best cases at
this price range despite its small size
and the plastic parts the case feels
very solid
they've managed to cut down on expensive
materials without compromising on the
overall quality but there is room for
improvement and we hope track
design is listening the CPU cutout is
too small and won't allow an easy cooler
swap as if promises and the USB 3 to USB
2 adapter is not included which we
believe should become available if the
cases USB 3 ready and the side panel
doesn't have a dust filter which
consumers have started to ask for as
additional cooling for your GPU is
becoming very attractive the arc MIDI
tower receives the hardware conducts
damn good value worth as it promises to
deliver exceptional cooling and Hardware
possibilities similarly seen on more
expensive cases and that is it for this
one hope you enjoyed it and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
