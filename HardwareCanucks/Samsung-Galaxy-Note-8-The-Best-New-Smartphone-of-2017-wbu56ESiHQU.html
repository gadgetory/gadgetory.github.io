for the video because Samsung actually
took us on a helicopter ride throughout
New York City to check out the landscape
and stuff this is my first time here in
the city so it was definitely an awesome
and breathtaking experience with the
helicopter and of course I took my scene
100 so the shots that you saw an intro
was you know Shaun the scene went under
some of it on the scene 100 and some of
it on the note 8 and I have it right
here so let's actually talk about this
phone because this has been quite an
exposed excitement a lot of people I've
been excited about the note aid I
certainly was because of course we've
you know seen you know things of the
past we're just not gonna talk about
that but the noh8 has been interesting
so let's actually dive in into the specs
and my initial impressions about this
phone the Graham spectrum keyboard bike
Tesoro comes with a new mechanical agile
switch with low profile key caps with
super fast response and shorter
actuation distance plus all the
customization included with RGB lighting
and macros for a premium user let's kick
things off with the display because it's
actually one of the main selling
features for the note 8 the signature
infinity edge display has made its way
into the device and it looks amazing in
person Galaxy Note fans are definitely
going to love this implementation and we
kind of saw it coming especially after
all that praise for the s8 in the NSA
plus technically what you're looking at
is a 6.3 inch Super AMOLED quad HD Plus
display with a resolution of 29 60 by
1440 so it's slightly bigger than the si
plus we're talking point 1 inches so
it's really not that big of a difference
so it features the same 18 by 9 aspect
ratio like the Galaxy phones so you'll
be able to get a lot more vertical
screen real estate to view content on
now just like any other Samsung flagship
phone you're getting ip68 water and dust
resistant rating so that's a great
feature to have on the note
we're also having in terms of specs raw
performance you're looking at an
octa-core Snapdragon processor with six
gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of
storage
there's also expandable storage which is
great so if you wanna expand the storage
to 120 gigabytes or even higher you can
definitely do that the front in the back
are made out of Gorilla Glass 5 now like
I mentioned in my galaxy si+ review I'm
really not a fan of this glossy material
and glossy texture so I guess we'll have
to see how it holds up in my full review
so yeah stay tuned for that did I also
mention that it comes with a headphone
jack yeah it comes with a headphone jack
which is great now one of the reasons
why people consider the note series of
Samsung phones compared to the Galaxy
phones or the Galaxy S series of phones
is obviously the implementation of s-pen
so in this case we have a really
intuitive S Pen and I feel like this is
an excellent tool to take notes if
you're you know someone who's just
working on the go but let's talk about
some of the more impressive and really
cool features that I found to be really
interesting the first thing that caught
my eye was the screen off notes feature
so basically what this means is when
your phone is idle you can pull out the
Samsung Galaxy S or the S Pen and start
taking notes on the screen by itself so
it has a completely black screen so now
since it's an AMOLED display what you're
basically seeing is just your notes so
you don't have to physically unlock the
phone and start taking notes so it's
like right on time quick you're really
quick to taking notes you can take up to
100 pages as far as I know but again
this is an awesome feature especially if
you're you know you know if you're about
to leave the grocery you can just
quickly jot down when you need to grab
or what you need to get but also if
you're you know taking quick notes on
making a video like what I am doing you
can definitely do that with this we
tried the S Pen features a point seven
millimeter tip but it's what's even
interesting is that it can even write on
the phone when it's wet so again it's
also high p16 water-resistant so it's
not just a phone alone the S pen's
water-resistant which is great all right
so let's talk about the camera or
cameras to be more specific on the
Galaxy Note 8 now Samsung decided to go
with a dual camera system this time
around
first camera is a wide-angle lens with a
12 megapixel sensor and an F 1.7
aperture the second one is a telephoto
lens with a 12 megapixel sensor and an F
two-point-four aperture with two times
the optical zoom both of them feature
dual pixel autofocus so expect faster
autofocus focusing just like the Samsung
Galaxy s8 on the si+ I should also
mention that both these cameras come
with optical image stabilization so you
know this should help you compose better
low-light shots so you won't really
expect lens blur when you're shooting
low light photos but like I said I'm
really excited to test the cameras on
the note aid in my full review so here's
some test samples that I took with the
note 8 throughout my helicopter ride
exploring New York City again it was an
awesome experience and I was able to
capture those moments with this phone
and it was really an interesting
experience I want to hear your thoughts
about your initial impressions on the
quality of these pictures you know talk
about its dynamic range you know I'm
gonna let you guys judge it for
yourselves
one of the main selling features with
the dual camera systems is the light
focus feature so essentially when you
point at a subject when you switch to
the light focus feature within the
camera app you have the ability to blur
out the background so to create this
portrait effect so kind of like the
iPhone 7 like currently the effect that
what you get with the iPhone 7 plus or
if I recall some other Android flagship
phones have that feature this seems like
an interesting approach especially
taking advantage of the dual cameras and
creating this blur effect with certain
pictures especially if you're taking
portraits like I said expect full
thorough in-depth review about the note
8 and I'll definitely cover the cameras
and of course these new live focus
features in the full review price-wise
you're looking at nine hundred and
thirty dollars us and $12.99 Canadian
for the Galaxy Note 8 it is a steep
price to pay for a smart phone and
availability such as September the 15th
so you'll be able to pick one up if you
really want the best of the best from
Samsung so I want to hear your thoughts
on the Galaxy Note 8 are you excited
about it are you not excited about it
what are some of the features that
interests you the most you know the
s-pen like some of the features that yes
man like the screen off a note-taking
feature or the dual cameras like I said
stay tuned for the full review I'll be
testing on the phone in thorough depth
in depth but yeah I guess I mean bro
with hard connects thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
