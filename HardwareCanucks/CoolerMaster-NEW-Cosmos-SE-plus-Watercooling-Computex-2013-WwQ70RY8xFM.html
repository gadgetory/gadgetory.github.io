booth here at Computex 2013 I'm here
with Richard
Richards is the product manager for
Coolermaster they have some new coolers
here which is the internal water coolers
so Richard tell us about the sytem 120 d
and whatever else we have here as you
can say there are two different series
of the liquid products here for this one
like the sytem 120 d the e stands for
dual as you can see we have the new 120
millimetres radiator and with the fan in
the middle so it's quite different from
the other competitors because our so you
can see the comb ability will be almost
alike 120 single radiator but the Papa
has recruited almost the reach 200 240
millimeters the radiator liquid cooling
so that's the specialty for this part of
it right so you basically take your your
standard 240 millimeter radiator you cut
it in half and you piece it together
like a sandwich will defend the middle
tell us about what is the performance
like with the radiators being spaced out
is that a good thing if you have a
thicker radiator how is the performance
improved versus just a single thick
radiator actually we have dominant a
stuff about this but actually for this
design would be better for the thickness
of the radiators the reducer as well
will probably around the 99.99 the door
speed follows
and once they're released the end of
this month okay so moving on to the
neptune series so this is not the your
this is not the sandwich
sort of radiator so tell us about the
neptune 280 which is right here and the
140 as you can see the just this part I
saw or India as well and this comes with
two different sizes and winds of 140
millimeters and the other one is 280 and
the specialty of this product is all the
water bras design and pump design are
from our company self design so it's
kind of the milestone product for our
company
so it is you have a slightly larger
radiator so the competitors usually have
the 120 millimeter so this is a 140
millimeter so a lot more fins you can
install bigger fans so better cooling
and we're also told that while internal
design obviously this copper base plate
yes that's right and how many fans is
will this be included with one or two to
two fans will be included so you can do
be able to do push and pull
configuration so you guys if you're
interested in internal water cooling
cool master it's a you know they are
giving us that extra product so a lot of
competition in the market a lot of the
all these vertical and components to
choose from alright so moving on with
the cooler master booth this is the
cosmos S II and we have a lovely lady
here showing off exactly what cool
master is all about now cooler master
this is the cosmos se he pulling off the
original design is the cosmos to which
was very popular it's very elegant
you have the same handles on the top
aluminum as same for the bottom you know
very very cool and elegant case now
internals this is an ATX set up power
supply at the bottom dust filter in
there dust filter in the top triple fans
support in the front as you can see here
the the hard drive space is is removable
so there is a internal water cooling
pump and reservoir installed there so
you can remove all the things inside but
you have powerful GTX Titans install
their internal water cooling very cool
stuff
it looks like you can install a 3.5 inch
drives at the bottom as well so in case
you remove the entire hard drive cage
you can still power up your system with
one drive installed cosmos - sorry the
cosmos S II is very popular for its
obviously cable management really great
stuff from from cool master this case
will be released for 259 in July so be
able to purchase that continue on when
the entire cosmos lineup so thank you so
much great case from cool master</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
