in acts and if you're thinking about
adding some flair to your gaming PC I
think the number one thing that comes to
your mind would be to add some sort of
RGB lining to help showcase the
components a little bit better now the
problem is that if you end up mixing and
matching different lighting components
from different brands there isn't a
unified solution to control them all for
example if you're by thermal takes ring
plus RGB fans and if you want to control
lighting through Asus aura or MSI's
mystic lighting software you'd have to
invest in an additional controller
that's again an additional cost in order
for those devices to start talking to
the motherboard and the same story goes
with coarse a sliding ecosystem they
really won't be able to talk with
thermal takes lining systems so there's
a whole lot of incompatibility issues
that are kind of going all over the
archana market right now in fact I have
done a full in-depth video covering some
of the Cork's with the RGB market as of
right now so if you're interested in
checking it out I'll leave a link right
about here but today we're here to
discuss NZXT s Q 2 ecosystem because
supposedly
this is bringing a lot more features and
accessories to the table so let's check
this out right after message from our
sponsor the new vitality H 370
performance motherboard is well equipped
for agent processors with 10 power phase
design dual ultra and our two slots for
storage and fantastic audio interface
and dual RGB headers for addressable and
12 volt lighting accessories check out
the full asrock 300 series line up down
below alright so before I get to hue -
and the new accessories I do want to go
over something very important especially
for existing hue plus users and that's
compatibility so the new hue 2
accessories will not work with your
existing hue + hub and the reason I say
that is because the micro processors
that are built inside the new led
accessories will respond differently to
the hue to controller compared to the
original Q + a hub so that's something
to keep in mind especially if you're
planning on using the underglow
accessory or the cable comb accessory
you're out of luck if you're an existing
hue plus user but if you want to use
your existing nzc LED strips and if you
want to take advantage of the new
ecosystem from NZXT you can definitely
use those components with the new hub
and they'll work just fine so let's
start off with the hue to lining kit
that's priced around $75
they have redesigned the stuff to make
it look a little bit more minimal you
can say goodbye to the glossy plastic
finish from the original hue Plus hub
however the subtle power LED has been
relocated inside the hub that actually
makes it quite difficult to check power
status so that's something to keep note
of it still maintains that two and a
half inch profile so you can install
this on an SSD bracket included with
your case and tuck it away but I would
be extra cautious with cable management
so in my case my primary workstation PC
is the Lindley PC 11 dynamic chassis and
it doesn't come with a separate power
supply shroud so all the cables are
pretty much visible so this again
heavily depends from a case to case
basis some of the improvements made to
the hue 2 hub is the addition of two
extra channels making a total of four
instead of two from the original hue
Plus hub and it now supports up to 40
LEDs or six accessories per channel this
is certainly a welcoming change
especially if you're working with
compact builds so if you're working with
a micro ATX or a mini ITX chassis and if
you are intending to use the NASD q2 eco
system you can actually get away with
one q2 hub and mount as much as connect
as much as leni accessories as possible
if you're into that kind of thing I
should also mention that powering the
hue 2 hub requires a molex connector
guys its molex I don't understand why
NZXT is going with this particular
connector it's 2018 they're supposed to
use status so yeah it just doesn't make
any sense so out of the box you get for
300 millimeter strips a micro USB cable
the molex power connector and all the
necessary hew connectors with extension
cables as well but I have to mention
that if you are using an existing Kraken
a aia cooler you might need to check
your motherboard connectors because if
it only comes with a single USB 2.0
header you might be out of luck because
again this connector connects to the PC
or it communicates with the PC using the
internal USB 2.0 header so if your
motherboard comes with a single
connector then again you kind of have to
sacrifice either one of those so that's
something to keep in mind now you could
obviously bypass this issue by going
with NZXT external USB 2.0 hub but that
goes for around twenty-five dollars so
it is next a dish
like investment if you want to take
advantage of all of NZ's components
next up we have the hue to cable comb
accessory price to have $30 this is a
clip-on accessory for your motherboard
CPU and GPU power cables if you want to
add RGB lighting to those components as
well they are daisy chained to a single
connector which means you just have to
plug it directly to the hue to hub to
control the 18 addressable LEDs and
here's a live look at the cable comb
accessory once you have them installed
on the power supply cables now the one
thing that I did notice is that you know
it the lighting actually doesn't
showcase that well if you have them
installed on custom black and white
sleeves you're actually much better off
using them if you have custom white
cables because that's how it'll sort of
diffuse that light a little bit better
but right now it looks pretty good but
it looked even a lot better if I had
like cables but I don't have that to
showcase it again this this is what they
look like and of course as you can see I
have them said to the fading effect and
they do look quite amazing next up we
have the hue to under glow accessory
priced at $35 and as the name suggests
this adds under glow lighting to your
case so out of the box you get two
modules that come with a metal housing
and their respective cables and
interestingly enough NZXT has added a
diffusion layer on top of the LEDs to
help soften the light output and I think
that's very thoughtful installation on
the other hand is pretty interesting so
given that these modules are an external
accessory NZXT actually requires you to
use this pci expansion bracket inside
your case to help ease the cable routing
but this heavily depends on the type of
chassis you're working with now in my
case I use the PC 11 dynamic and it
doesn't come with any cutouts at the
bottom for the cable to seamlessly pass
through so now I have an entire
workstation PC sitting on top of the
cable and that questions long-term
durability and if you take a look at the
bottom of the OL 11 dynamic case the
right side of the chassis is covered
with the magnetic dust filter so I
actually had to offset the mesh filter
to accommodate one of the modules so
again compatibility is a concern for
this underglow accessory especially if
you're working with a case like the
piece you learned dynamic and if you are
if you have cases that don't actually
have the elevated support that are
sitting on standoffs then you basically
won't be able to use the under cool
lighting in the first place so highly I
would highly recommend
checking our compatibility and see if
you actually have the space underneath
your case if you can accommodate the
lighting and then pull the trigger on
this accessory lastly we have the hue to
ambient kid and this thing costs $100
and for that NZXT claims that users will
be able to achieve a more immersive
desktop experience when it comes to
setting up the mood for your desk setup
and not to mention gaming so essentially
it's a set of LED strips that are
attached to the back of your monitor to
help create this ambient lighting
atmosphere out of the box you get the
control hub that goes behind your
monitor for 300 millimeter LED strips
and for 250 millimeter strips a two
point five meter USB cable to connect to
the rear i/o of your PC the channel
cable that connects the strips to the
controller along with the extensions a
power adapter for the hub and supporting
plugs for different regions and some 3m
dual lock strips to mount the controller
to your monitor so the setup process is
actually pretty straightforward
in fact NCHS includes this nice little
handy configuration guide that lets you
configure the LEDs or gives you a nice
little representation to mount the LEDs
from various size monitors so anywhere
between 21 inches all the way up to a 35
inch ultra wide monitor and I think
that's pretty convenient but you need to
make sure that you're connecting the
five bulb pin to the 5 volt header when
you're linking the two strips on the
same channel so after installing the
strips and the controller behind your
monitor next thing that you need to do
is connect the power cables and then the
USB cable to the rear i/o of your PC and
then firearm cam go into the lighting
tab and select the smart tab and click
on ambient for the ambient mode to take
effect and right off the bat I've got
admin this thing looks gorgeous now
there are a few things that I did notice
while watching content and gaming so for
instance if you're in a video where
there is a warm background the kid
doesn't really completely replicate the
color theme and you can't clearly see
that over here and for the most part the
neutral backgrounds exhibit a cooler
white light and for images that are
mostly blue the lighting does reflect
the color scheme it mostly works and of
course it does add that immersion level
but it obviously doesn't replicate that
color scheme for every case scenario so
that's something to keep note of however
I did notice that the transitions
between different color themes where an
s smooth as I expected it to be it
certainly felt a little bit choppy and
again I think this
something that can that they can improve
upon the next revision gaming on the
other hand was a fantastic experience
the ambient lighting kid certainly helps
add that immersive layer and I
thoroughly enjoyed my time playing
around with it but I did wish if cam was
able to sync up with the game engine so
if you were being shot or if you're in a
pursuit the lighting could have turned
red or blue depending on the scenario
but that wasn't the case with this
ambient game so again that's something
to keep note of but unfortunately that's
where all the positive things about the
hue to ambient kit come to an end
because as you can see behind my monitor
I actually don't have those strips or
the ambient kit turned on and its sole
reason for that is because the strips
actually don't stick to mm monitor for a
long time in fact I had it set it up one
evening the next day I woke up the whole
strip sort of fell apart the decent
didn't really stick towards the plastic
finish on my monitor so it really isn't
it doesn't really work with my panel in
fact it could even get worse if your
monitor features a glossy plastic
surface now I did contact NC XD about
this issue and it is quite concerning
because it is an ambient kit after all
and if it doesn't really stick to the
back of your monitor then it defeats the
purpose of the whole ambient experience
in the first place and they're obviously
working on to fixing the whole adhesive
issue in fact they are offering
customers with some additional
replacement 3m strips they did send me
some additional 3m double-sided tape but
that didn't do the trick
either because I used them to install
the strip's once again and unfortunately
all I have to report I have to report
that they just don't work with my
monitor so again I can't really
recommend this particular accessory for
now because you really won't be able to
get the best out of the box experience
at least for now although you could you
know go around this your way by
installing you know iron tapes or
something that's maybe well chrome might
work in your case if you want to do it
your way if you want to add some DIY
perks to this particular setup so why
don't we hop onto a quick demo to take a
look at the lighting systems with the
hue to lighting kit and of course the
ambient kit as well alright so welcome
to the cam software walkthrough as you
can see I do have my system set up over
here with the hue lighting kit and I
have disabled the Animax RGB fans on my
radiator just so that it doesn't fiddle
around or doesn't really mean I mess
around with the huge
letting kid because you guys really want
to see what the effects look like in
real time so let's hop onto cam and you
guys are probably aware of the UI now I
have two channels activated onto the
Hugh to kid that's installed inside my
PC channel two is the exterior lighting
so if I turn that off you'll be able to
notice that the exterior lighting is
turned off and if I turn off channel 3
that's the interior lighting of this
system so let's go back and turn on
channel 3 and channel 2 and if I want to
play around with the effects or if I
want to sync the lighting effects across
both those channels I can just click on
both of them and select for example if I
want a spectrum way I can just go ahead
and click that effect and hit apply and
it just automatically just translates
into this rainbow RGB effect there are
various effects that you can play around
with like breathing fading there's also
pulse effect which is actually a pretty
cool again multitude of effects that you
can play around with which is pretty
awesome don't forget that all of these
LEDs are addressable so if you want to
go ahead and customize these lights to
an individual color you can certainly do
that by just clicking on these
individual like light boxes and it will
and you can go ahead and change the
color of those by ourselves now there
are some smart lighting effects that are
also integrated within cam software so
if you won the lining to react to your
CPU or GPU temperatures you can
certainly do that in this case I have
them assigned to GPU or if I want to
switch things up to CPU I can certainly
do that as well the ambient mode doesn't
really work with the hue to strips up
because I don't have because in order
for ambient mode to kick in you'll need
at least a minimum of three strips per
channel but in this case I only have two
accessories connected to one channel
which is why I won't be able to take
advantage of that inside the case
alright so taking a look at the hue to
ambient kit you do have the option to
disable the lighting per channel but in
order for ambient mode to work you need
to have both the channels enabled and of
course you have to go into the smart
option to enable the ambient mode to
take place and of course there is the
option to calibrate the monitors or
lighting across the monitors so once you
go through that process then that's all
that's how the mi mode will sort of kick
in so that's something to keep note of
but if you want to go ahead and you know
select this custom preset if you don't
like the ambient mode you can go ahead
and playing around with different
effects like breathing fading there's
also a spectrum wave there is super
rainbow there is just a multitude of
lining effects that you can take
advantage of if you're really into
spicing up your lighting or the ambient
mood within your desk setup
alright guys so this has certainly been
an interesting video for me personally
because I had a lot of expectations for
the new hue to EQ system particularly
the ambient kid from NZXT because it
certainly adds a lot of flare in fact I
really wanted to have an ambient
lighting set up behind my monitor to
help with you know b-roll shots and all
that kind of stuff but unfortunately it
doesn't really work that well it's
particularly not suitable for my monitor
the strip's really don't attach in fact
the replacement the replacement strips
didn't really work out that well so it's
kind of a bummer
as for the rest of the accessories they
are obviously pretty cool I will mention
that you are kind of stuck to the whole
ecosystem within NZXT because if you
were to add you know lighting
accessories from Thermaltake or some
other kids that are addressable you
won't really be able to communicate or
be you won't be able to customize the
colors from those accessories or
third-party accessories within camp
because it's its own little bubble
because it has micro processors that
only communicate with any z-axis
controller so those are some of the
things that you'll need to keep in mind
before pulling the trigger and I want to
hear your thoughts on q2 from NZ XD what
do you guys think about it are you
willing to pay the price premium to get
into their own ecosystem especially if
you're willing to compromise on adding
third-party lonny accessories to your
gaming PC are you willing to take that
risk but most importantly I do want to
quickly go over NZXT scams software
because I've had a lot of issues with
cam in the past years because my crack
and cooler won't get detected within cam
and I've had a lot of other lighting
controller issues with cam as well
there's a whole bunch of reports on cam
software instabilities on online so it
certainly has its own quirks and MZ has
a long way to go especially when it
comes to tweaking and tuning their own
cam software and of course taking care
of the accessory kits in the first place
but until then we just gonna have to
wait and see what they have down the
pipeline but yeah let me know what you
guys think about the whole q2 lighting
kit in the comments
below amiibo with Heinrich annex thank
you so much watching make sure to check
out our new boo sequins channel for the
