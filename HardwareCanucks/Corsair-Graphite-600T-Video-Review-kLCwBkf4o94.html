with its obsidian series proved that the
company has what it takes to be in the
enclosure business the only downside for
many people was the price now however
they are launching a new graphite series
tower that not only offers many of the
great features of the obsidian but a
whole new design and lower price so here
is the corsair graphite 600 t is a case
designed purely for the enthusiast and
computer builder much like the 800 d
this case can handle just about anything
the 600 T is expected to debut in late
September for an MSRP of around $160 so
let's take a look now here's the thing
Corsair claims that these 600 t is in
mid tower
however it's probably the biggest mid
tower you'll find it pushes that
description to the limit at 20 inches
high twenty three point three inches
long and ten point four inches wide the
case has a solid steel body structure
and they've used plastic to shape the
outer design but it is definitely not
cheap or flimsy now Corsair has realized
that dust filters are essential and so
is easy access there's a 200 millimeter
front intake fan and the dust filter
very easily snaps out the front ports
are at the top and they've included four
USB to along with USB three and firewire
there's audio inputs and unobtrusive
power and reset buttons you also have a
very prominent for fan speed control
knob the top panel also features a
removable mesh cover underneath you can
install 220 millimeter exhaust fans
which work great for a concealed water
cooling setup there's also a hidden lock
for your side panel the back of the case
features a hundred and twenty millimeter
exhaust fan eight PCI expansion slots
water tubing holes and a bottom mounted
power supply in typical Corsair fashion
the side panel removes incredibly easy
without the need for screws and you can
see that nice graphite finish the layout
of the interior takes many cues from the
award-winning 800 D and that is great
news for
system builders starting with the power
supply we have the ability to adjust the
support bracket depending on the power
supplies length also tucked away
underneath is a removable dust filter
the company has also re-engineered the
hard drive bays to let users configure
them to fit their design we can remove
the top three drive base and just leave
them out or install them at the bottom
of the case this leaves more room up top
for larger video cards if airflow is our
concern just get rid of the front rack
entirely one of the key features of the
Corsair design is cable management all
around the motherboard tray whether
you're using an e TX or M ATX board
there are rubber grommets that help keep
clutter down and keep your build looking
very sharp exhaust fans are on the rear
120 mil and top 200 mil there is also an
oversized CPU backplate opening which
should work with pretty much any board a
bit of a redesign to list drive bay as
well very solid and easy to use a
critical aspect of many cases is all
about what you don't see with the 600 T
there is a ton of room in behind the
motherboard tray for running cables
starting off on the assembly you can see
how the 600 T won't have a problem with
pretty much any ATX standard component
even oversized power supplies or if
slightly wider motherboards are going to
be fine it cleans up very nicely and
very quickly we were able to make use of
the grommeted spacing to keep things
inside looking very tidy and very clean
if you were worried about having to fit
an unconventionally large sized graphics
card don't be our AMD 5870 fits in with
both hard drive trays installed and
there's still a couple of inches of room
meaning an AMD 5970 will be no sweat my
favorite and truly an awesome addition
to this case is the layout for internal
water cooling keep in mind this is a mid
Tower
check this out we take out the included
200 millimeter top fan add in our dual
120 millimeter radiator and then as we
move to the top you'll see we have the
fans installed underneath that top mesh
piece it's a completely concealed system
it keeps the outside looking slick
without having a massive radiator that
looks sort of like a tail jutting out
the back as we turn it around what may
seem like a complete mess of cables on
the back with no hope of fitting your
back panel over is actually no problem
at all the design of the side panel
gives extra room and it's easier to use
than your typical slide on panel design
overall the 600 T is very sharp-looking
inside and out they've moved away from
the box design of the Obsidian series
and given this case a bit more
personality now while I was initially
concerned when I heard the words less
expensive and plastic being talked about
this thing is anything but a cheap
plastic case and it's not just all for
looks as we saw the design is used for
the advantage of the system builder
integrated dust filters cable management
improvements and all of the water
cooling options another major
improvement that many are going to like
is air flow but those two massive 200
millimeter fans there should be no
complaints about Heat with a price tag
of just above 150 dollars the 600 T is
incredibly competitive with other
enthusiast oriented chass√© ease when it
comes to the cases ease of use and
flexibility it offers features that you
really never see in a case in this
category
thumbs up to Corsair for one damn good
case we hope you enjoyed the Harbour
Canucks product showcase on the Corsair
