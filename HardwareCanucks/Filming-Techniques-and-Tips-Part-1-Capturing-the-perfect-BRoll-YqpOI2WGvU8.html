Canucks and in this video we'll be going
over the basics of be rolling I'll give
you a few tips and tricks of something
some of the things that I keep in mind
every time I turn on that camera
position my scene and push that record
button
so I'm tweet tree come on on the
unicycle it's an awesome shirt let's get
with it first shot of this review the
silverstone army zo2 all that right
battery dead so the first basic rule you
have to understand is always think about
perspective well when I say perspective
I mean the camera is in the same plane
as the subject you're trying to film is
it about the subject looking down on a
subject or is it below it and so each of
those perspectives creates a very
different effect in the way you try to
present whatever you trying to shoot so
for example here's a shot of this case
with a plane above the subject looking
down and it kind of reveals a lot of the
background elements it doesn't fully
isolate the subject in this second
review from the form from the background
and the foreground isn't totally
isolated
now here's an exact same shot with the
exact same settings with a tripod lower
and now you're looking from the plane
below the subject looking up and it
creates this very towering effect where
the subject they're trying to highlight
is very powerful looking and this really
works really well with cases in with any
straight lines because you have this
very interesting look and so you could
create different dynamics and whatever
trying to highlight using this type of
plane method whether or not you try to
be above it below it or in the center
and the center is very awesome as well
just to create your lines so that
everything is straight everything is in
perspective and nothing is in the skewed
plane that sometimes does not work at
all for some shots so always think about
perspective whether you want to be above
it on the same line as the subject or
below for that really towering work the
second thing to think about
all the time when you're doing any type
of be rolling is the tools that you use
do not overuse the tools and also the
settings so right now I should say I've
set up my office in this t-shaped format
why desk why desk the screen should be
on to give me a bit of extra light from
there turn out that light on over here
and basically I'm trying to capture as
much as possible within this type of
environment
and then I will actually change this up
I either move the desk over here or put
it this in that spot just because of the
blue light that shines from the case so
always think about trying to change your
environment as otherwise you know
filming this entire case review in this
tea format for the viewers we extremely
boring and now back to the tools I don't
even use the slider all the time I only
try to utilize some establishing shots
maybe a conclusion shot maybe something
for the cinematic intro that we do but
as you notice throughout the review it
is not being utilized all that often
just because I don't want every single
shot to be a slide shot
I don't want every single shot to be a
pan shot and I don't want every single
shot to be you know some type of
combination using the tripod with the
slider so always try to think of a good
balance in terms of giving yourself a
nice slider effect nice pan nice tilt
whatever and then you know try to
balance out the motion versus static
shots so a good example of what I just
said would be for example to do an
opening slide shot so there is motion
and then do a macro shot so a change of
the focal length of the lens if you
don't have different lenses just maybe
come closer to the subject and do the
minimum minimum focusing distance so you
have not only the perspective change you
also have the change of motion so you
are going from something that is dynamic
to something that is static and you
notice that they might use all the time
I usually try to bounce out a few motion
shots and then put in a static shot like
a macro something so if you're seeing a
shot and the composition that you like
try to capture that in either the
dynamic motion so pay until slider
whatever that you have available for it
to do create some type of motion and
then try to go in and do the exact same
composition slightly differently but
without movement and then when you go
back to edit you have those two options
to play with you can choose one to go in
the beginning of the review and the
other want to go in the end of review or
some combination of that so that you
don't or you
the footage too much and you still have
very unique shots throughout the entire
video now people are always curious
about our slider shots coupling the
staple of our recognized style and so
the tip here is to be always consistent
with motion so that in case you need to
warp it later instead in the premiere
software or any other video editing
software it's not as difficult then you
won't get many artifacts so if you do
get that slide delete that footage and
just do it again so this is a perfect
example talking about diverse shots I
have this here it's a very wide angle
showing you the entire casein in frame
and see nothing is cut out and now let's
do a tighter shot just of the logo which
would reveal just a tiny bit of extra
diversity in what I'm trying to showcase
here one of the most important aspects
in terms of be rolling is trying to
think about your composition always
having that back your mind if you can
enable the rule of thirds grid on your
screen on your camera do it it will help
you try to Center things able to help
you to your correct for your perspective
if something is slightly skewed and you
know it does not may not be as
professional as what you could
potentially make it but also it comes
down to practice and making sure that
you like what you see the way I usually
do it is blast out some trance music as
I think as I film my reviews that's why
I'm sort of energized by whatever I'm
listening to and trying to also come up
with some creative ideas in terms of how
I want to showcase a product that I'm
filming so always think about your
composition and very important
don't try to be random sometimes random
is great but don't always try to be
random don't just set up a camera and
then do a slide or you know do a pan or
whatever try to really think about your
setting trying to visualize how
everything in the background is you know
located try to look in the entire frame
and see if there's anything that needs
to be removed from the shot sometimes I
have little items in the frame that I'm
like ah crap I wish I need to remove
them and I go back and remove that and
do another shot so just be not super
random with your shots set them up the
way you like because that way you'll be
happy as an editor looking those shots
later when you're compiling your entire
movie and the last piece of the puzzle
that that will give you guys before I
head out is go wide what I mean by that
is try to utilize a wide field of view
so something that is not super zoomed in
because I see so many tech you tubers
that use your lies macro a little bit
too much and you don't get the full
sense of the object that you're trying
to showcase and sometimes you want to
see the whole object there is time place
for macro shots when you're trying to
highlight any texture or certain little
tiny elements on the object and
obviously that's important but try not
to you a lot
try not to overdone overdo that and
actually that ties when the entire
pattern or theme on this video try not
to overdo any of the things that we
talked about today and not try to do
overdo your slides don't overdo your
pants try to see what is a good balance
what feels right within the final edit
and whatever makes you happy with the
finished product so I'm Dimitri with I
recognize I hope you enjoyed this behind
the scenes of how I pyrrole so I hope
you enjoyed this content make sure to
subscribe and fall for every behind the
scenes and how-to videos for every
Friday thanks for much for watching
we'll see you in the next they see me
roll in b-roll then I promised myself I
wouldn't do that but it's in there
already</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
