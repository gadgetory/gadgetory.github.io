simplistic Scandinavian appeal with easy
to work in internals great air flow and
storage potential and comes in both the
windows or plain side panels for your
preference the a qgq 701 is a widely
popular audio enthusiast
entry-level headphone that has some
people in love with the sound signature
and some people completely disappointed
in comparison to similarly priced
headphones from sennheiser like HD 600
and 650 s and given how subjective all
of our personal audio experience is
let's see what we think about the oddity
of the Q 701 and decide how this sub
$500 pair stacks up and starting with
the forum and personally love the
circular ear cup design with perforation
and small EKG accents spread around and
this has been established as the a key G
look with very light leather headband
with small pockets that feel excellent
and these overhead tubes that housed
internal cabling from one ear cup to the
other the leather headband is flexible
as you can see there isn't that much
resistance and it will auto adjust the
size of the headphone based on your head
and while comfortable it's a style that
may be unfamiliar to many and there is a
slight adjustment period
the headphone unfortunately does feel a
little fragile given we have no solid
headband and these are quite flexible
tubes but with careful handling I have
no doubt these will last a long time the
mini XLR cable is removable that sits on
the left ear cup depending on the model
you get the cable varies in color so
here's the green cable very similar to
Razer green and included is a three
meter non coiled cable and also a six
meter cable included in the package
not sure why six meter cables exist in
first place instead the coiled cable
would make more sense and putting these
on they are large and the round ear cups
do cover my ears entirely the velour
cushions are angled for appropriate
sound direction and not quite hard
meaning they form a decent seal around
you ear with enough internal space for
the ears to breathe and not make contact
with the drivers so that's a great
and combine this with natural clamping
and you can wear these for hours without
pressure fatigue now despite these being
an open headphone there is heat
accumulation not inside the ear cuffs
themselves but on the surface where it
makes contact with your skin give that a
nine and do that two-second release once
in a while and this style is not
something you'd wear outside although
you could if you were into that type of
thing but given the large form even when
putting them on your neck it's a little
uncomfortable unless you're looking to
keep warm
as far as audio quality goes I was
pleased as I do prefer a brighter
response the headphones sounded very
technical very crisp that was pretty
awesome for trance and house you know
being able to hear distinct highs with a
good low in response listening to a
Legia the entire high range really stood
out where usually with warmer headphones
it's less sibling so if you're in favor
of a slightly more harsh and electric
signature you'd be happy with a Q 71 I
think the consensus among the 71 owners
is they're edgy and I would totally
agree this harsh high-end however
doesn't fully compliment vocals and
particularly I found the higher range of
female vocals not particularly pleasing
we're listening to applause came under
complete disappointment so if really
bright sound is not yourself it's not
for your ears then stay away
it might introduce some fatigue over
long listening sessions for those who
are used to a more mellow high-end
response the mid-range hear sounds
balanced I'll tell with such dominant
treble it does feel less present the
bass response is tight but not for bass
heads and it can be lost when the rest
of the spectrum kicks in like in a
little party never killed nobody is a
perfect example of how bass is present
in the beginning of the song but gets
lost soon after and that's the thing the
high-end really steals the show here
where this balance of dominant treble
does diminish the warmth and the body of
the sound now one really impressive
characteristic is the open feel the q 71
provides the soundstage is large and
accurate where you can pinpoint the
separation of instruments and their
proximity to each other this would be an
excellent gaming headphone if you want
to hear a
little queue in new environment to
pinpoint where the enemy players are I
can't however see why so many people do
not like the sound signature of the
queue of 701 as it lacks the warmth of
the upper base and mid-range that's a
little too thin
the sound is sharp and for trends and
house I found it I deal with a nice hit
on low end but for funk and soul and
hip-hop and more emotional genres the
cue 71 was almost lifeless and to wrap
this up the cue 701 have comfort
absolutely amazing and accurate
soundstage with a specific treble
extension that's suitable for those on
the market for bright and edgy sound
removable cable is a bonus alto coiled
cable included then I'd say the six
meter cable is in most cases to be left
unused so wasteful the sound signature
is very specific that to me likes to
warmth and therefore isn't ideal for an
all-purpose headphone the most important
thing to take away with the cue 71 is
it's not an all-around headphone meeting
and complements electrical sound and not
so much the rest and I could see how the
HT 650s from Sennheiser have been chosen
as a more superior headphone as it
complements a wider range of music
however the AKG 701 still a headphone to
recommend if you're looking for a unique
sound signature to add to your
collection but I wouldn't necessarily
start with a cue 71 if you are in the
market for an open style design so what
about you guys whatever sound do you
prefer and what headphones you'd
recommend to the rest of our viewers for
your favorite music genres as always
