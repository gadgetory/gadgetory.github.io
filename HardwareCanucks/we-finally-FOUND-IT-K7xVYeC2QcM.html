we have a third member arriving tomorrow
so they're giving us a larger room with
three beds today and I'm just packing up
this room we're gonna move into the new
room all right we've just been moved to
a new room since we will be accommodated
for three people so a new room comes
with a new view hard-working ox is at
another fantastic Computex show all
thanks to Nvidia fantex and cix and MSI
Eber when you walk up the first thing
you saw was this monstrosity nice little
scary bowl over here right did you get
scared at all no anything you're
probably scared of that so based on our
previous episodes if the bathroom wasn't
weird enough this one is even weirder so
first of all we have a tub which is
right in front of the entrance so as you
walk in you literally are greeted by
this tub now we have a nice mirror so
you can see what's going on and we have
this hole here so this is a shower has
no tinting on the glass panel it's just
completely open and so this shower is
here but it also has a whole tour to go
towards the tub like you can see
yourself hello and then this is the
bathroom so the bathroom in the previous
room was much better with a better view
but as you're in here look at this we
have a nice mirror but then we have this
sliding door to reveal the master
bedroom we'll be utilizing this big
table to set up three computers to do
editing and voiceovers and stuff luckily
that thing closes although I can easily
open it from this side so I'm not sure
if there's gonna be any tricks of
somebody's sleeve maybe
so today's going to be one of thinking
up our complex badges and going
exploring the city before the show
starts
the whole week is gonna be very busy so
we're trying to consume an absorbs much
of the city as possible
perfect okay thank you so much just
picked up it's really hot out so Ibrahim
picked up to have a nice view hat
here's the sewage bigger man what's
going on
in a Samsung store jake the seventh look
what we found
we're gonna go to go on go on right
there
look at this view nicely getting to a
park finally check this out separate
little middle lane for the bikes so you
can go up the stairs or you come down or
you can come down yeah hmm this looks
like a good bench to have some drinks
this is the coolest and elevator it's a
very cool thing that's actually very
cool we're in the restaurant right now
this is fresh wasabi you have to grind
it in here and collect it with this
spoon so it doesn't get fresher than
this
and this out this awesome bottle so we
have a little bit of alcohol on the
outside but on the interior it's nice
it's keeping the bottle cold by the two
liquids well but liquid and solids are
separate so they don't mix for the first
time all right
boy stur for the first time here ago
yeah ah hi so that dinner was absolutely
amazing so much fresh seafood you
literally walk in see the fish that you
want you pick it out and they may bring
it out for you it's so humid outside
that when you get out of the hotel from
an air-conditioned spot you get the lens
that is easy
back to 7-eleven
be very handsome favoritism themselves
and coming from 7-eleven finally I have
found chips that I've been waiting for
plum chips the packaging has changed but
the flavor has remained the same
so today has been sort of an an eventful
yet quite mellow day tomorrow is the
Computex day we have bunch meetings we
have the ATM pick up to go for an
exciting factory tour stay tuned for
that be very excited yeah we'll be using
the C 124 PD as the main camera so it's
2 a.m. now to go edit this vlog and then
go to sleep
hope you guys enjoyed it we'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
