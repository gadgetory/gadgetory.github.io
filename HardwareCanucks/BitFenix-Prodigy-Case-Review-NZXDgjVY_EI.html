work next review we are checking out
this stylish and elegant mini ITX case
from BitFenix The Prodigy enough of the
plain and boring black boxes mini ITX
cases usually reassembled so here we
have a breath of fresh air amongst the
competition and the black version is
also available with minor changes to the
exterior you are expected to pay around
$80 for this one which is pretty decent
considering the aesthetics and its
internal functions but despite its small
form-factor the chassis is actually
quite large when compared to the
standard mini ITX cases so make sure to
double check the dimensions prior taking
out your wallet but BitFenix is
targeting this towards an enthusiast
market which helps to explain its
relatively larger size so let's dive
right in
the exterior is a combination of steel
and plastic which does have the soft
touch treatment that we are so familiar
with the front panel has one optical Bay
and a black bezel that incorporates the
venting strips unfortunately this design
practically chokes the front intake fan
and I wish they kept the same meshed
panel that is found on the black version
of the same case and behind the panel we
find a variety of fan mounting options
BitFenix includes 120mm fan for the
front but ideally if you are cooling on
air it is designed for a larger fan
something around 180 200 or 230
millionaire fan
alright the handles are the next part
they can be used to transport and they
seem relatively strong but they are a
bit too flexible I'm not gonna lie that
does bother me a little bit and I would
have preferred something a lot more
solid but after working with the case
the handles should have no issues
transporting a fully loaded system and
the bottom features the same type of
flexible feet which makes the case prone
to sliding and wobbling and the top has
dual dust filter that clips in and can
easily be removed for cleaning and you
can mount dual 120mm fans or even a
radiator unfortunately if you do mount
the second fan closer to the front you
will not have clearance for the optical
drive and I wish to design this case
allow fan mounts above the frame
without compromising on its stylish
appeal and it would also allow an
optical drive to be installed now
strangely all the front panel connectors
are located on the side door which helps
to keep the front clean but limits the
orientation of the case while in use so
the placement of these connections is
really impractical and we want to see
them move to the front where they belong
but here we have the power and the reset
buttons the headphone and microphone
jacks and 2 USB 3 ports which can be
connected through the 20 pin or the USB
to plug the side panel can also mount to
SSDs it's not the most comfortable
location for wiring but still a good
spot for additional drives the other
side panel has dedicated venting holes
for your graphics card so you can pull
air from the outside this is very much
needed as the graphics card practically
touches the side panel at the back we
have an exhaust for both 120 and 140 mm
fans two expansion slots are your area
and then bottom mounted power supply
with a removable dust filter now finally
take a look inside the prodigy we have
the hard drive cage with five tools
brackets that are SSD compatible the
cage is modular so it can be removed
simply by pulling it out no need for
that screwdriver and this would allow
for a beefy graphics card to be
installed as we have clearance up to 12
inches this is pretty impressive for an
ITX case and this is also one of the
reasons the prodigy is so large the
power supply cage has cable cutouts all
around but has clearance only for power
supplies up to 160 millimeters in even
then it's a tighter fit I would have
liked to see the power supply bracket
that allows longer units to be installed
and for this reason our silverstone unit
didn't exactly properly fit into the
prodigy the included front intake fan is
mostly blocked by the drive cage so
installing 140 mm fan would allow a more
direct airflow towards your main
components and as mentioned earlier the
drive cage is modular it can either be
removed or rotated and if you do decide
to completely remove the hard drive cage
you have the options to install three
2.5 inch drives inside the case turn the
power supply cage mounting and the
removal of which will be
I'm problematic and one more on the
bottom of the case now the reasons you
might want to remove the optical mouse
and the entire drive cage is full water
cooling to my surprise you can fit two
hundred forty million radiators one at
the top and one at the front of course
this means losing out on the optical
drive if the ride is on the top and
sacrificing the entire drive cage is not
very appealing if you do decide to
install the ride at the front so finally
putting in our mini ITX board CPU
coolers up to 175 millimeters are okay
but many people have raised the issue of
not having clearance for the CPU
backplate as the motherboard standoffs
are a bit too short
so between extra step it up in quality
control department to not turn off its
customers and finally closing the side
panel this is another disadvantage of
having all those front cable connections
on the side panel and that's just the
wiring becomes really awkward and we
really wish between X can sit right next
time with the front panel and so
partially assembled our triple slot
graphics card wouldn't fit our power
supply was a bit too long but in terms
of cabling prodigy stacks up quite well
and I can definitely imagine a clean and
powerful build that could be used for
land parties or just regular home use so
to wrap it up prodigy brings to the
table a very stylish and elegant chassis
that can house all the enthusiast
hardware with long graphics cards and
240 million radiators we have plenty of
storage capacity and it's a relatively
small stature that allows easy
portability and all that it's a
reasonable and a very competitive price
that consumers will find appealing
however in the flipside airflow for the
arctic white version drastically suffers
because of the front panel and
practically chokes the front intake and
you already know my opinion about the
front panel connectors that are located
on the side panel and that's really
terrible placement and they should have
included a power supply bracket that
allows longer units to be installed but
overall it's a unique case that has a
lot of potential for a decent system and
we're giving it the hardware canucks
damn good value word
the really whole BitFenix further
improves their game when it comes to
design and quality control and that's it
for this one guys thanks for watching
and we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
