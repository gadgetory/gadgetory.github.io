hardware connects and welcome to an
interesting camera comparison between
the Google pixel three and the way they
phone to now this is by no means a full
head-to-head comparison in fact I still
have to spend more time evaluating the
hardware and my experiencing using both
of these devices so stay tuned for my
reviews or individual reviews on both
these devices in the next few months but
my recent trip to Beijing I took both
these phones with me to test the camp
performance because you know
interestingly enough these both cost
$7.99 and I thought you know it would
give us a unique perspective as to how
as to what these phones could offer
given that they cost exactly the same
because both of these devices are
tailored towards a different time of
demographic so let's check out the
results right after this one of the best
gaming headsets is now available through
mass drop the PC 3 7 X has fantastic
drivers incredible comfort and the best
microphone in class plus they look
awesome for a gaming headset check out
the drop link below alright so before I
show you the results I do want to
mention something so remember I said I
took both these devices with me on my
recent trip to Beijing I did and I
performed a lot of camera tests between
the two but on my way back Michael
decided to accidentally factory reset at
the razor phone - so it literally just
wiped all of the pictures that was taken
on the razor phone - which was really
depressing didn't really it it was quite
it was quite a terrific terrific
experience actually so I got my baby
back to Toronto and I just had to
reshoot my camera comparison so yeah
that's we're gonna leave it at all right
so specs why is the pixel 3 features a
single 12.2 megapixel rear-facing camera
with an f1 pointed aperture the razor
phone 2 features dual sony IMX 12
megapixel sensors and different focal
lengths so one of them is a standard F
1.75 lens and the other being a
telephoto F 2.6 lens the razor phone 2
has oh is on both lenses whereas the
pixel 3 features oh is and electronic
image stabilization I'm going to start
with the rear cameras and move on to the
front-facing sensors later on I shot
these photos in auto mode with HDR
turned on to get the optimal results and
at first glance I notice that the pixel
3 retains a lot of the detail with
subjects compared to the razor phone 2
and I think part of this has to do with
these software processing it's not
overly done like LG but rather
razor-sharp no pun intended by the way
with the razor phone too the detail is
certainly present but it comes a bit
shorter when compared to the pixel
especially when you zoom in and crop
photos the other thing that surprised me
the most was how well the dynamic range
was on the razor phone too
it's really amazing to see how razor has
stepped up the quality game in that
department it's really hard to find any
overexposed shots on the razor phone too
simply because the HDR processing is
done pretty well and you won't be
disappointed with the results I also
want to touch base on the exposure and
as you're watching these samples you'll
notice that the pixel 3 tends to
underexpose in most situations compared
to the razor phone 2 but with that being
said you can easily fix that through an
editing app like Snapseed or Adobe
Lightroom now in terms of colors this is
totally subjective but I actually prefer
the razor phone to over the pixel 3
simply because razor actually does a
good job capturing the natural two-tone
colors of a subject depending on the
lighting situation whereas the pixel of
3d has a weird magenta shift and I'm not
a fan of that I think it was AI
processing is trying to spice things up
by increasing the saturation making
things look pretty compared to what's
actually out there again you may
disagree with me on that but in the end
of the day it's all about personal
preference taking a look at low-light
performance and I have to give this one
to the pixel 3 the images still maintain
their sharpness and color without
introducing a lot of noise and it just
looks awesome
the razor phone too on the other hand
does ok but you lose detail and there is
a little bit of noise and images and in
some cases it starts to introduce weird
color shifts so that's something to keep
in mind now I should also mention that
the dedicated telephoto lens on the
razor phone tube comes in really useful
if you want to zoom into subjects since
there's a lot more detail preserved
compared to the pixel threes enhanced
digital zoom feature and that's to be
expected portrait mode on the other hand
certainly favors the pixel 3 and no
matter how hard you try Google's AI is
really good at isolating the subject
from the background plus it's super
sharp so you really won't be too
pointed with the results however in some
cases I was able to notice that weird
magenta shift that I talked about
earlier I mean it's a cooler look
compared to the slightly warmer tone on
the razor phone too but just from a
feature standpoint pixel 3 takes the
edge here because the end results are
getting nowhere compared to the razor
phone 2 in terms of the sharpness and
the subject separation when we want to
the front-facing camera tests and
interestingly enough the number of
cameras on these devices are at the
complete opposite so the pixel 3 has two
front facing cameras and the razor phone
2 has just one suspects bias the pixel 3
features 8 megapixel sensors with a
standard one featuring an F 1.8 aperture
compared to the wide-angle lens that has
an F 2.2 weighting the razor phone 2 has
an 8 megapixel sensor with an F 2.0
aperture and right off the bat the pixel
3 dominates the razor phone - I mean
when you look at all aspects like
dynamic range sharpness colors subject
separation etc there is no denying the
fact that Google has worked really hard
and delivering the best overall camera
experience that additional wide-angle
lens comes in really useful for group
selfies if you're into that kind of
stuff
now with the razor phone - I feel like
they could have tweaked the sensor a
little bit because I think they're using
the exact same one from the original
razor phone so if you take a lot of
selfies I would completely skip the
razor phone - and get the pixel 3
portrait mode again favored C pixel 3
there is great subject / background
separation whereas with the razor phone
- let's just say it's completely
unusable
alright good people this is the video
test on the razor phone - and the pixel
3 as you can probably tell there's a lot
of jitter I guess a lot of motion on the
razor phone - compared the pixel 3
because the pixel 3 looks like it has OS
and E is which means it's doing a pretty
good job stabilizing this footage
whereas with the razor - phone - it's
just clearly not evident so the pixel 3
but this is also a good microphone test
because it's it's a pretty windy day
today in Toronto also really really cold
and freezing my hand right now but yeah
let me know what you guys think about
the microphone quality as well in the
comment down below so this is the
front-facing camera test on the pixel
three and the razor phone too as you can
see there's a lot of exposure I mean
highlights on the razor phone two are
completely blown out where's the pixel
three you can certainly retain a lot of
that there's also a lot more detail on
the pixel three compared to the razor
phone too
and of course the colors are a little
bit washed out in the razor phone tube
compared to the pixel three but it also
gives a good idea or representation on
what the microphone quality is like on
both these phones and before I wrap up
my thoughts I do want to talk about my
experience using the camera apps on both
these smartphones so the pixel 3 was
pretty straightforward I just opened the
app I was just pointing out this you
know a particular subject and I was able
to capture that moment right away
whereas it the razor phone too you have
to actually spend some time to frame and
of course make sure that you actually
hit the shutter button because in some
cases it actually takes 2 to 3 seconds
to complete that shutter and that's just
kind of annoying at least in some cases
especially if you want to capture that
right moment you have a very I guess you
have a tendency of losing that with the
razor phone to compare to the pixel 3 so
that's something to keep in mind another
thing that I want to mention is that
there's a significant amount of delay
with the live viewfinder on the razor
camera app so if you are putting in a
subject you are known gonna be noticing
a little bit of delay in that regard now
in terms of video performance the pixel
3 is the clear winner here because the
sensor has both OS and yes the final
results are very much usable colors are
well balanced it's got great sharpness
and you know it's not as washed out when
compared to the razor phone too I should
also mention the pixel 3 does have a
slow motion capabilities whereas the
razor phone 2 doesn't and microphone
quality I'm I'm kind of neutral in that
regard because I haven't compared it to
the iPhone 10s and the other smart
phones out there so I want to hear your
thoughts on the overall camera
comparison what do you guys think about
it let me know in the comments and which
one do you actually prefer considering
both of these devices cost $7.99 stay
tuned for my full review on the pixel 3
and the razor phone 2 in the next few
months
