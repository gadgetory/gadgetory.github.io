Haruka ducks and welcome back to another
view they were taking a look at another
wireless speaker that would serve the
purpose of portable audio Center so this
would be the KMC 3 or clips Music Center
for all of you Audio lovers clips should
certainly ring a bell as the company is
recognized within the quality audio
sphere and based on that you are
expected to pay the premium of 399 for
this unit and there are also multiple
color options available now when they
say portable audio Center I don't mean
that in the conventional put it in your
pocket type of way because the speaker
is actually quiet large here it is next
to my phone and by dimensions alone this
will only go where you really want it to
go also because the unit is very heavy
at three and a half kilograms the
built-in handle on top of the unit sure
helps with transportation and the
rubberized coating on the body helps to
prevent the in small scratches and
things during transport now in form of
design there's nothing special about the
KMC 3 it looks the part of a speaker and
nothing more at the back you can see to
Sound ports and exilic jack to turn this
into a wired speaker although no cable
is included so you will have to come up
with your own male-to-male 3.5
millimeter jack we also have AC 4 power
and a USB port for charging your mobile
devices the power brick with the KMC 3
is very large so keep that in mind if
you plan on using this as a music center
in your living room the anti slip pocket
at the top can be utilized for your
phone or keys or whatever you may wish
to put there while enjoying your music
and the capacitive menu is also built-in
into the handle with the power button
Bluetooth connection LED and volume
adjustment pressing both the plus and
minus signs at the same time will switch
between wireless and wired sources it is
very unfortunate however not to see any
battery indicator for such an expensive
device and the only indicator is the
power button that will blink once you
hit the low battery state and coming to
one of the most disappointing aspects of
the KMC 3 is the lack of a rechargeable
battery the listing is powered through 8
D batteries that are not included by the
way they are located at the bottom
hina cover that can be removed quickly
with a coin and while I could see the
benefit of getting more batteries if you
need to replace them without needing to
plug this thing to charge I feel a
built-in rechargeable battery might have
been more appealing I mean realistically
won't be carrying around 8 D batteries
in case you need to recharge now with
all that said when it comes to Bluetooth
audio you always hit compression that
disturbs detail and compromises on the
range but cliffs certainly have squeezed
their audio muscles with this game c3 as
it sounds very powerful and very
enjoyable the Bluetooth codec used here
is an app text codec that is supposed to
deliver two CD quality audio but
fortunately it's only available on the
handful devices my Nexus 4 doesn't have
it but the Samsung s3 does and also very
sorry for all the iPhone users as the
aplex codec is not available there now
with both my Nexus 4 and the Samsung s3
testing the same files the difference in
mid-range clarity was definitely present
not in all songs but the wireless audio
quality with the aplex codec is superior
i also have to praise them on design in
this 35 watt 5 in the quarter inch
subwoofer inside the unit because the
low-end response is amazing for any
hip-hop or rap lovers that would be here
in heaven just because the low-end
response is full and detailed and always
evident the stereo drivers are much
smaller they are 2 inch 15 watt full
range drivers so if you are more on
instrumental or vocal heavy genres the
KMC won't really satisfy as the bass
does overpower the high-end and it does
miss out on that crispy and detailed
tremble so the game c3 is bass heavy
even playing around with the equalizer
on my phone I couldn't get that
mid-range detail that I was hoping for
in the $400 speaker so this would narrow
down the intended purpose of the speaker
which is you bring this thing to a beach
to a party on your balcony or into a
park for that plain and simple listening
with extremely powerful and loud drivers
that don't fall apart even close to 100%
volume only in a few tracks experience
very bad distortion at higher volumes in
Wireless mode while the song sounded
much better when connected through the
XL
port of course if you're like me and you
need to hear your mid-range in the way
you're accustomed to the KMC three will
fall short of your expectations now the
company suggests up to 26 hours of
battery life at around 50% volume it is
actually quite good and with our daily
casual listening for the two weeks I had
with the unit the game c3 was still
running on those original 8 batteries
came c3 also comes with a small remote
that is very useful to cycle between
tracks but the range on the remote is so
low and you need direct line-of-sight
for the remote to work which was a bit
annoying so I actually ended up using my
phone more than the remote the unit will
also stay connected and powered on for
as long as that Bluetooth connection is
in sync with your phone disconnecting km
c3 from your Bluetooth settings will
result an automatic shutdown of the unit
to preserve battery life now the sound
is more on the dark side meaning punchy
bass with muffled mid-range and rolled
off highs but to be honest detailed
enough for an enjoyable experience
especially for base friendly tunes USB
charging is a nice option plus the
capacitive buttons blend in with the
overall sleek and modern design the
included remote is very helpful to power
on the unit from distance and the
battery life was plenty good on those
eight batteries now there are many
things I think clips should have done
differently starting with the battery I
think we've been more appealing with the
built-in rechargeable battery as
realistically you won't be carrying
around 8 D batteries in case you run out
of charge the axillary cable is not
included which is strange considering
the option is available devices that do
support optics codec for Bluetooth audio
will sound better but the list is quite
limited and lastly the price while you
are still getting impressive Bluetooth
audio the audit flaws just don't satisfy
the $400 investment unless you really
want something this powerful and
potentially just use this as a wireless
speaker but constantly plugged in for
power now I wouldn't consider the sound
signature icon necessarily as if you
want detail in your mid-range and crisp
eyes you rather stick to Wired speakers
but if you want a portable boombox the
KMC 3 will certainly satisfy well this
concludes our review of the KMC 3 from
clips now
would you consider getting into
Bluetooth audio and what do you guys
think clips should have done differently
