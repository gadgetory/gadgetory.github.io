Computex 2017 but it seems like everyone
is talking about the many x $2.99
motherboards on display some of the
first ones we saw were from msi and
they'll have a full lineup with their
Intel's upcoming high and refresh let's
take a look at these crazy motherboards
right at the base our coffee leg strip
is brought to you by frantic
schoolmaster and MSI so at the top of
MSI's x2 19m Android lineup is the
gaming m7 ack which is meant for people
who want extreme performance and all the
best features the X $2.99 platform has
to offer
this means native support for dual and
triple graphics cards each with access
to sixteen pcie 3.0 lanes but
unfortunately with both AMD and NVIDIA
moving away from support for more than
two GPUs and crossfire or SLI the
benefits of this feature are minimal for
gamers however all those extra lanes
lead up to some really awesome storage
potential with dual end are two slots
that support and DME SSDs a u2 connector
and more than enough left over lanes to
add even more high bandwidth devices and
other than the potential for this board
to become your one-stop-shop for
high-end storage and graphics needs msi
has built a few more features for
enthusiasts so there's a brand new 10 +
1 + 1 phase power layout and MSI's turbo
socket both of which should help
upcoming sky like X and K me like X
processors need their highest
overclocking potential there's also a
brand new thermal solution placed
directly over each MDOT two slot we
actually first saw this at CES from Asus
but the latest generation high-speed and
then two drives have pretty hot running
controller chips so these motherboard
mounted heat sinks ensure thermal
throttling is eliminated while also
avoiding high conflicts with add-in
cards and of course this board also
comes with plenty of LED illumination
zones and all the cool kids on the block
now have some form of illumination
there's also the double shot pro
technology from killer networks which
allows the dual killer 2500 ethernet
connector and the killer 1535 Wi-Fi
adapter to work together for optimal
online gameplay
we've already seen this actually from
previous events on motherboards and even
on notebooks unfortunately the actual
price of the m7 ack is unknown but don't
expect it to be inexpensive
next up is the option that will surely
cost less than the ACK but there's
plenty of things to like this is
the X 299 gaming Pro carbon a/c and as a
matter of fact it keeps many of the a
CK's best features and adds in a few of
its own as its name suggests it comes
with an integrated wireless AC module
for ultra quick wireless experience and
as with many X to 99 motherboards we've
seen at this year there's for reinforced
PCI slots that can be used for double or
triple graphics cards and two banks of 4
memory slots since Intel's upcoming
processors will continue to support quad
channel layouts there's even a pair of
PCIe
and the two stocks with their own
cool-looking heatsink module and the
usual u dot to interconnect where things
get really interesting however is with
the heatsink cover and some other cool
accessories which can be 3d printed so
MSI will have templates available for
the community so all of them you know if
you have a 3d printer you can just print
them off and mod your motherboard on
your own and the last word that we were
shown this one I think is where people
gravitate towards buying even though we
don't have the price yet this is the X
299 tomahawk will be one of the least
expensive motherboards and MSI's X 299
lineup and of course you give up on some
the extra conductivity we talked about
but most of the cutting edge comes from
the reducing of the number of connectors
rather than eliminating them altogether
for example the tomahawk has a pair of
reinforced PCIe slots where's the other
slots don't have any of the extra steel
shielding I don't think that's a big
deal since most people will end up
installing one or two heavy cards anyway
also only one of the two end up two
slots has a heatsink over it once again
this is not a big deal since I'm sure a
single m dot 2 or au dot to drive paired
with a high-capacity hard drive will be
all that people who need another nice
addition is a USB 3.1 gen2 header for
the front panel USB C connections and
hopefully most cases will begin to add
these high-speed gen2 type-c headers
very soon and so that ends our time with
Emma size upcoming X 299 boards what do
you guys think is X 299 and inches high
end processors something you guys are
looking forward to are you happy enough
with your current system or if you have
to buy one of these motherboards which
one would it be
