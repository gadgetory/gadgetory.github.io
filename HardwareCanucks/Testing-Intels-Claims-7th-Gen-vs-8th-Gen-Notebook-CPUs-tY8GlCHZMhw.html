connects and about three months ago
Intel announced their new a generation
mobile processors code-named cable a car
specifically designed for ultra bucks
the specs looked really promising I mean
we're talking quad-core processors
jammed inside these ultra slim form
factor notebooks that promise to deliver
a fantastic multitasking performance
along with better battery life over last
generation if you're interested to learn
more about these new cpus make sure to
check out our explained video right over
here but today we're gonna test out
Intel's claims on these new CPUs and
it's very rare to get the opportunity to
benchmark two notebooks side by side
featuring processors from different
generations but you know identical specs
in terms of the rest of the hardware so
this video is gonna be pretty
straightforward I'll be running a series
of synthetic and real-world benchmarks
to see what sort of a performance
improvement we get with these new
processors but also perhaps come to a
conclusion as to whether or not it's
worth buying a discounted seventh
generation notebook for the holidays or
pick up one of these newer notebooks
with the new a generation processor so
let's dive in right after this so it was
kind of a love at first sight you know
there's really nothing like this
exterior I love the metallic color the
tinted glass panel the RGB fans at the
front it's basically a see-through case
and who doesn't love that your graphics
card can go vertical
the top is Radiator friendly and the
right side is so unique when exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
aged 500 key
master check it out inscription below
okay so the contenders for this test are
two notebooks from Dell more
specifically the XPS 13 both units are
powered by Core i7 processors and the
only difference between the two is their
microarchitecture and a different memory
configuration right now the agent model
is about $200 more expensive but if you
factor in Dell sales into equation that
number jumps up to about $400 on one
hand we have a unit with a cable a core
i7 75-68 processor featuring two cores
four threads with a base clock of 2.4
gigahertz and a boost up to 3.8 it comes
with 4 megabytes of cash and a TDP of
just 15 watts
the newer XPS 13 model features the
eighth generation KB Lake our eye 78550
year processor that's quad core hyper
threaded comes with a slightly lower
base clock of 1.8 gigahertz but a
maximum turbo frequency up to 4
gigahertz it also comes with twice the
amount of cache and surprisingly the TDP
remains the same when compared to last
gen and that last point is important
since Intel was able to achieve this by
drastically separating these speeds
achieved by single and all core
performance you see on a desktop side
we're used to seeing a few hundred
megahertz but in this case the Delta is
several gigahertz basically Intel's
prioritizing multiple threads over raw
frequencies when an application
determines all eight threads are needed
unfortunately there isn't a significant
increase in graphics performance until
did we name it from HD to you HD
graphics implying that these new CPUs
can playback 4k content without breaking
a sweat
they feature the same 300 megahertz base
clock but the boost clock is a hundred
megahertz higher on the eighth
generation CPU now coming back to these
notebooks the newer XPS 13 isn't that
different from its predecessor in terms
of design and features both look exactly
the same
I'll be the 7th gen review sample I got
came in this rose gold finish but you
can pick up the newer model in the same
color
they featured the exact same 13.3 inch
qHD + infinity edge display and it's
really hard to tell the difference
between the two because the color
reproduction along with viewing angles
and brightness levels are on point
vio once again remains identical however
I do want to point out
the older model that I have here comes
with eight gigabytes of lpddr3 RAM
clocked at 1866 megahertz versus sixteen
gigabytes found on the newer model
that's clocked at 21 33 megahertz the
SSD is also very in size so the SEM gen
model has a 256 gigabyte nvme drive or
as the 8th gen has a 512 gigabyte nvme
drive now remember both these notebooks
can be configured the way you like
directly from Dells website so if you
want a seventh-generation notebook with
a core i5 processor or you know 5 tol
gigabytes of storage or perhaps 16
gigabytes of RAM you can always do that
or you could pick up these in the newer
XPS model with a core i5 eight
generation processor 8 gigabytes of RAM
and perhaps a 512 256 or a one terabyte
variant remember pricing can also vary
depending on configuration and again
this all comes down to what you really
want but in this case I mean I'm gonna
be testing two of the higher-end
versions so I'll be testing a core i7
model from the a generation and a core
i7 model from the same generation both
on the XPS 13 notebooks alright so let's
move on to the performance segment
comparing the two CPUs our first round
of basic synthetic tests shows the 8550
you dishing out roughly 47% more
performance compared to the seventh gen
7560 you programs like Cinebench r15 in
the multi core test takes advantage of
the 85 50 you really well the OpenGL
test doesn't really show a major
difference between the two in terms of
frame rates but that was expected
considering there isn't a major
improvement with the hardware the same
story applies with our real-world tests
the new a generation CPUs blazed through
multitasking especially with intensive
applications like handbrake Lux mark &amp;amp;
WinRAR GIMP is a slight exemption here
since it seems like the higher base
clock on the assumption CPU seems to
favor this program but overall I'm
really impressed with the new cable a
card processors now I wouldn't recommend
editing videos on both these machines
since the lack of a dedicated GPU
severely affects render times but if you
we're to give it a shot anyway the a
generation series contributes a lot
towards reducing render times in this
case I ran a one-minute 4 KH doses or
export using Premiere Pro CC 2017 and
the quad-core architecture on the new
CPUs were roughly 20% faster than
last gen that's pretty amazing guys I
also push the integrated graphics on
both models and all I can say is that
the new CPUs performs quite well in its
low-voltage form it really is a
welcoming upgrade from its predecessor
running over watch at 1080p at the
lowest setting give us around 68 frames
per second on the newer model when
compared to 54 frames per second on the
7 gen model dota 2 ran almost neck to
neck on both notebooks and I think part
of that had to do with optimizations but
in all honesty I wouldn't recommend an
ultrabook for gaming because it isn't
really meant for that task unless if you
decide to hook up an external GPU but
that's a conversation for another video
asked for temperatures this one wasn't
too surprising number adding more course
into the exact same chassis in this case
the same notebook can result in higher
idle and low temperatures as you can see
the newer model did run a little bit
hotter than last gen so to keep that in
mind and this brings us to our last test
battery life do note that both these
novels feature a 60 watt hour battery
and our heavy load test consists of
running reel bench on a loop until the
battery is completely depleted
surprisingly the new Asian model
surpassed the older one by 50 minutes
but what really blew my mind was during
the light load test where I looped
refreshing a webpage the new XPS 15
lasted an hour and a half longer than
last year's model this really proves
that Intel has done a terrific job
balancing performance and power
efficiency on these new mobile cable
acar CPUs well the results really do
speak to themselves guys Intel wasn't
really joking with these newer eighth
generation CPUs I mean we're talking is
significant roughly a 50% increase in
terms of raw multitasking performance
when compared to 7 generation and what's
what really surprised me the most was
the battery life out of both these notes
when I was doing the comparison test the
a generation notebook pretty much did an
hour and a half at last an hour and a
half longer than the sound generation
know but given the fact that it came
with a quad-core CPU and so that to me
was just insane and it kind of blew my
mind for a second so it really is an
awesome upgrade if you're coming from a
skylake or even a previous generation
number or if you're in the market for an
ultrabook I think right now there's
probably the best time to pick up one of
these new notebooks so I'd love to hear
your thoughts about this comparison
between sound generation mobile see
versus a Jen what do you guys think
about it leave a comment down below
would you rather spend that money to
pick up the newer XPS 13 model or would
you you know consider getting the
discounted seven generation notebook
because they'll has some pretty good
deals online so yeah let me know in the
comments down below
