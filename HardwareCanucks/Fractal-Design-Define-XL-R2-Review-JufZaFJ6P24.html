Rocks review we're very excited to check
out another case from fractal design as
they have really built off their game
which shows just how committed they are
at setting themselves apart from the
competition so this new case is sort of
a mix between the defined excel and the
r4 so mixing enthusiastically features
from the r4 and the silent design from
the excel and there is released at a
very appealing price so let's take a
look and starting with the outside this
looks and feels practically identical to
the define excel we have full steel
construction except for the plastic
front panel we have a hint of aluminum
on that elegant reflective surface and
the case is really solid throughout now
it is designed to be a silent chassis
but like with most cases in its category
you will have to choose between maximum
airflow or complete silence or of course
working something out in between the two
options the front intake is completely
covered so the venting strips on the
sides will allow for the airflow to
enter the door is magnetically attached
but it still doesn't open wide enough
nor can it be switch to be open from the
other side sound dampening foam is
installed but it will definitely reduce
the cooling potential we also have for
optical Bay covers that can easily be
removed from the front below which is
another cover for the fan bracket and
now I really like the fan setup the
bracket removes easily from the case and
you can clean the dust filters replace
the fans and both 120 and 140 mm outs
are available also a bonus a fan is
already included however I would suggest
occupying that second slot for optimal
front intake now one common flaw that is
found on pretty much every single case
is the available spacing for the air
flow to pass through the hard drive cage
now there should be the next innovative
solution for optimal air flow of course
rotating the cage is available but let's
face it none of us want those cables
sticking out
now one neat feature on the front is
this 3-speed fan controller with three
fan headers all the connections are
located at the top we have our power and
reset buttons audio jacks and USB ports
of course we all know top connections
are not always ideal and may cause some
clearance issues and moving on we have
two mounts available for the top
supporting both 120 and 140 mm fans
initially they are covered wood sound
dampening panels but for good cooling
you should install exhaust fans and of
course for all your water cooling lovers
dual radiators are supported at the back
standard settings here with exhaust fan
io area power supply mount and nine PCI
slots meaning extended ATX and excel ATX
motherboards are supported and of course
it wouldn't be complete without a
removable dust filter at the bottom
which covers both the power supply and
the bottom intake fan
all right so let's finally look inside
the for optical base are not to list
unfortunately so you will need to use
screws the two hard drive cages below
are fully modular meaning both can be
repositioned or removed if needed
now for the top cage two thumb screws is
all it takes a very simple solution that
works really well the process for the
bottom cage is a bit different for one
the bottom intake fan must be removed
and several other screws in order to
unmount the bottom cage it then can be
relocated further away from the front
for installation of a dual radiator so
this makes this silent chassis even more
appealing as water cooling support is
integrated pretty well into the design
now the drive brackets have not changed
included the rubber grommets help to
reduce noise from spinning drives and of
course SSDs are supported brackets can
further be secured with screws for safe
shipping and look in the back we have
many rubber grommets placed
appropriately around the motherboard
tray plenty of cable tie notches are
spread around as well so setting up your
cabling should not be concerned
especially with the large gap between
the panel and the motherboard tray now
there is one little thing that really
bothers me and I'm surprised it has been
overlooked
now the power supply is raised by these
tall rubber feet which is good since it
allows for extra breathing room but they
can easily be removed and there is
nothing in the back of the case to
support the power supply a little
platform would have been better which
would make the installation of the power
supply slightly easier and also we are
working with our long 188 millimeter
power supply which still has clearance
for the module cables with the bottom
intake installed and putting in our 11 a
half inch graphics card absolutely no
problem and the case supports up to 13
inches for the top cage in place now one
thing I'd like to mention before we
conclude are these side panels they are
surprisingly heavy so careful not to
scratch the floor when taking them off
they are completely covered in
high-density material that helps to
reduce the overall noise
and we also have an optional fan mount
for cooling the internals now working
with in such a large enclosure provides
a lot of headroom for cable management
so you don't stress about the clean
build as it just happens naturally now
we have support for two dual radiators
larger motherboards and graphics cards
is very appealing along with lots of
drive storage with excellent modular
cage options now when it comes to the
price whether you opt in for complete
silence or a more dominant airflow the
XLR 2 offers excellent value the middle
ground however between airflow and
silence is somewhat limiting with
restrictive front airflow also the power
supply standoffs really should be
redesigned and instead offer a more
stable platform but overall the defined
XL r2 is a well integrated mix between
the new r4 and the earlier version of
the define XL it is functional full of
great features and deserves the hardware
canucks damn good at word so thanks guys
for watching I hope you enjoyed the
review see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
