hard-working product showcase we have a
really exciting case on the table today
it's the land cool Dragon Lord a PC k-6
- now you probably haven't heard of land
cool they're relatively new to the
market but they are definitely not new
to cases they are subsidiary brand of
Lian Li which is a Taiwanese
manufacturer who is well-known for their
aluminum cases and their relatively high
price land cool brand is intended to be
a little more price conscious but the
case is still spawned from the mines at
Lian Leeds so we're hoping that it
carries some of the same traits that
makes the company's top and chassis so
well known the k62 takes a somewhat
familiar and relatively simple design
and looks to make it into something that
looks good is easy to use and is
relatively affordable the biggest
difference between Lian Li and land cool
is the fact that land cools cases are
constructed out of a solid steel rather
than Lian Li who typically uses aluminum
this has quite a bit of weight and the
total is a hefty 21 pounds it is 18
point 4 inches wide
nineteen point five inches high and
nineteen point six inches in length the
front panel is plastic with venting for
air flow and five Bay's for external
drives the panel is easily removable
with little force and is great for
getting at the removal dust filters
which the 140 ml LED fan is sure to
attract at the top we have a simple
connector assortment with just two USB
audio and microphone jacks
along with activity LEDs and power reset
switches the back of the top panel has
open slots for air flow and quickly
removing the cover reveals two more
hundred and forty mm LED fans now this
is pretty cool
LAN cool is designed the fans to be
quickly and easily removed in fact all
of the fans on the chassis use this same
design it may be a bit gimmicky because
honestly how often are you changing fans
but you'll soon get the idea the side
window uses an open and thick clear
plexiglass side which isn't nearly as
dull as the video makes it there is an
alternate version of the case out
without the side window if it's not your
thing jumping to the back we realized
that the case is a bottom mounted power
apply design and the top holds 120
millimeter exhaust fan the i/o area and
water cooling holes the PCI expansion
slots have an added bonus with eight in
total making this the perfect solution
for persons using a dual slot video card
at the bottom of their motherboard and
at the bottom of the power supply area
the bottom of the case has also not been
overlooked it includes a dust filter
directly underneath the power supply and
again it is incredibly easy to remove
and clean now here's where the real fun
begins
let's open it up for a closer look the
inside is a perfectly painted black
giving a uniform look to the computer
once assembled there's plenty of space
and it's really well structured for good
airflow looking at the power supply it
sits on raised rails above the filtered
air intake area and is an excellent
design for proper cooling the k62 uses
an innovative screwless rack style hard
drive bay design of which there are room
for four three and a half inch drives
moving up there are also five five and a
quarter inch drive bays only two of
which use another unique screwless
system the case supports both ATX and M
ATX form factors with pre-installed
studs there's also the coveted CPU
cooler backplate opening as well as
openings around the side and bottom of
where the board typically sits the
motherboard tray is spaced away from the
back panel to allow for cable routing
along the back as you can see the PCI
slot seems to come with some rather
large retention clips but as you'll see
it's all part of the genius design
now let's move to the installation the
included accessories have quite a few
unique and rather unknown additions
along with a clear lack of the usual
Fistful of screws if you haven't figured
out what the big deal with the k62 is
here it is you won't be needing this at
all
leave it in the drawer because the land
cool case is 100% to lists that means
you won't be needing a screwdriver to
install any of the components so let's
see how it's done starting off with the
power supply a bracket is included that
fits neatly over the unit and clamps
down to hold it into place it's
surprisingly secure and is definitely
not going to come loose when moving the
computer around there's also an add-in
for cable retention that clips into the
bottom of the case to assist with clean
wiring it's little things like this that
really make the case stand out as you
may know installing a motherboard can
often be a bit of a frustrating task
having carefully positioned screws and
managed screwdrivers that's where these
come in LAN cool has specifically
engineered thumb screws that are tall
enough to grasp and the right diameter
to fit in the studs motherboard
installation really takes a matter of
seconds for the hard drives the mounting
bracket here uses clips on the side to
hold the drive secure they're also
vibration dampeners in order to reduce
the noise these brackets do also hold
2.5 inch SSDs but that will require
screws the drives slide into place in
the rack system and are secured by
pushing a small lever on the side which
closes the gap the drives can also be
installed with the connectors to the
back to improve on wiring the top to
external drive bays are screw lists as
well attach clipped unlocks from the
side the drive is slid into place and
the clip re secured to hold the drive
installation expansion cards is just as
ridiculously simple the back hosts
built-in PCI retention clips and is just
a three step process unhook the clips
install the card push the clips back in
to securely lock the card into place
last but definitely not least we have
the challenge of wiring the land cool
makes it quick work the ins't
motherboard tray and dry base allow for
cables to run up the back and keep
clutter out of the front spaces on the
tray allow for connectors from the back
out into the front and to attach where
necessary unfortunately water cooling
appears to be a feature that was
overlooked during the design the case is
not enormous so spacing for radiators is
a bit slim however that's not really a
good excuse it's already obvious the
dual rad isn't going to work out well
because the top fans are 140 millimeter
and the radiators are typically designed
for 120 millimeter fans the top wasn't
even an option installing the radiator
on the back appears to be the only way
to go
unfortunately the positioning of the
tubing holes is far too close to the 120
millimeter back fan and completely
cutting off access we flipped the
radiator around and ran into the same
problem a single rad wasn't available
but the mounting issue would be the
exact same seemingly the only place to
put a rad is loosely set at the top of
the case with no way to secure it as a
result of its clean design and well
placed fans the k62 has excellent
airflow it features plenty of exhaust
points right above the largest heat
producing hardware and given that heat
rises the top 240 millimeter fans are
perfectly placed every intake point is
covered by easy to clean dust filters so
dirt shouldn't be a problem and that
wraps up our look at the land cool PC
k62
this case is an excellent piece of work
it takes basic case design makes it
gorgeous and adds a whole slew of unique
features that really make it a joy to
work with the tool list design is
anything but a gimmick and it has
practical use that not only shaves off
build time but really reduces
frustration land cool has taken some of
the best of Lian Li and put it into
steel form to keep the price competitive
it is however not without its flaws
water cooling is going to prove to be a
problem for those who want to secure the
radiator and there is very little room
at the bottom to mount up
with that said we hope you enjoyed our
