hurricane axe and we're back at
Coolermaster for one more look at some
of their stuff and this time it's gonna
be some peripherals no not any case we
originally saw many of these at CES this
year but only in prototype form now
they've been refined and they're almost
ready for official launch a bit later
this year
supposedly coolermaster have listened to
the feedback from the comments and
videos that were created around CES and
have done appropriate updates that's
pretty exciting since it proves
companies do listen to your comments and
make changes where they can now before
we get into all the updates the team
wanted to thank Coolermaster fantex and
Thermaltake for their support during
this show okay so let's get on to the
meat of this video since there's a lot
to cover and I want to start with the CK
600 series since this is one keyboard
that we're really excited about just
like the Tesoro Graham XS Coolermaster
is aiming for a very specific crowd with
these extremely thin keyboards they're
for people who want compact high-quality
peripherals that look great but don't
sacrifice the feel of true mechanical
switches in order to accomplish this
Coolermaster teamed up with cherry whose
new MX red low-profile switch is being
rolled out these are then installed into
a plastic and brushed aluminum shell to
create a slim keyboard that feels
amazing and has keys which provide just
the right amount of tactile feedback
another interesting thing here is that
Coolermaster has removed any and all
branding so that you get the clean look
that is retained across the range
speaking of the range it will be
available in three different sizes the
full-size CK 648 ekl model called the CK
630 and D CK 620 which is the super
compact 67 key model all of them have
RGB backlighting and a detachable USBC
cable however in order to complement the
portability setup the C key 620 and CK
630 have an integrated battery so they
can be used wirelessly over a Bluetooth
4.0 connection right now it looks like
the larger CK 640 and a CK 630 will be
available closer to the end of this year
while the 620 will come sometime in 2019
the next thing that I wanted to talk
about is the mm 830 which will be cool a
masters flagship mouse when it's
released this summer
this is another one you might remember
from CES 2018 because it incorporates a
couple of interesting features this is a
mouse that's targeted towards gamers who
want custom
and a larger than normal number of macro
keys first of all there's a small OLED
panel in front of the thumb rest that
can show everything from CPU
temperatures to a logo of your choice it
is an interesting feature because I'm
not quite sure how often these type of
things are used if this is something you
would be interested in using let us know
in the comments down below what's the
best use case another interesting
feature is the four buttons integrated
just above the thumb rest honestly this
area has received a huge revision since
the last time we saw it back then the
positioning didn't quite feel right and
they required hard process to engage
typically buttons in this area should
require more force to avoid mistaken
clicks but not that much there are right
now perfectly spaced apart and require
just the right amount of force to
activate other features you may be
interested in knowing about the mm 830
ra 2400 dpi sensor and of course some
subtle RGB lighting zones we can't wait
to get our hands on this one finally I
wanted to talk about cooler masters
latest headsets since their last
generation really needed some work this
is the MH 750 series which is going to
try to improve all the areas where their
previous headsets fell flat
both the MH 751 and the MH 750 to have
40 millimeter drivers and a really handy
detachable 3.5 monitor cable and also
have a convenient locking mechanism
there's also a detachable mic and a
design that folds completely flat
meanwhile the acrylic cover ear cups do
give an interesting three-dimensional
look to the whole thing but I have mixed
feelings about that while none of this
sound particularly interesting and it
doesn't set the image 750 series apart
from the competition there has been a
lot of thought put into updating
microphone quality comfort and bass
response the price is also pretty
competitive at $70 for the standard MH
751 and $100 for the MH 752 which comes
with an all inline USB sound card and
7.1 support so guys that's it from
cooler masters peripheral side stay
tuned for more coverage from Computex
2018 a kneebar with Hydra connects thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
