recognized as Computex comes to a close
you can probably hear your a bunch of
this assembly of all these boots a very
interesting and unique product we count
here at woulding the winning one
mechanical analog keyboard huge thanks
to our Computex sponsors for sending us
out here shout out to nvidia fantex and
cix and msi so this Wooding one witting
whatever you want to call it we're going
to stick with the slight D in there the
winning one is using a new analog switch
the flare tech switches which you have a
pressure-sensitive activate activation
that is recorded let's say in gameplay
so depending on how far down you press
the faster you move in game and if you
press just the line tiny a little bit
you're moving just just a little bit
slowly like this or you know if I click
it fast like here go back to the center
so that's the whole idea of the switch
maybe it's going to sort of
revolutionize the way we think about the
canticle keyboards but I'm happy that we
get to try one so the way the switch
works is we have a light sensor it's an
infrared sensor going into a lens then
it's bouncing back from this lens back
into a different sensor and the
depending on how far down you click the
switch the reflection is then recorded
by the circuit board and that returns
how far the switch is down so that it
doesn't record on and off it records the
distance and therefore it's it's
treating the keys as an analog joystick
so that's the whole idea of needing to
remap the keyboard and like your warzone
or your arrow keys to the joystick
controls because when you connect the
keyboard to your computer it's not just
detected as a keyboard it's detected as
a keyboard as a controller and as a
joystick right now the flare tech
actuation is at 2 millimeters so you do
have to quit press quite a bit down for
the key to start to actuate and we have
up to four millimeters where the switch
sort of bottoms out so that's the range
now the cool thing is because it's an
analogue because it's an optical switch
this lighting light readout you can
adjust the sensitivity curve of the
switch so for example if you want the
key to not absorb 100% of the light you
can set that and also you can set the
flare tech switch to respond
- how fast you actuate so let's say you
do a slow tap that is aw but let's say
you do a double tap and that activates
like a shift W so there's multiple ways
you can configure the switch and that
supposed to be configured with the
pressure of how far you down you press
which is pretty awesome opens a ton of a
new possibility that we never seen like
that before
the limitations here is that the flare
tech of course there will be some needed
support from the developers of the game
so let's say if you have a double tap
function it will enable some different
things aside from the key and would be
really cool to see sort of this type of
implementation and support from the
developers with the Wooding one the
switch is MX compatible so you can
replace the actual top switches since
there is no mechanical contact you can
replace the optical switch itself and
you'll with the keyboard you'll have
multiple optical switches provided just
in case you need to replace one and also
provide you with the different feeling
switch so we have sort of the red flare
tech switches which is a 45 grams switch
and we have the flare tech blue which
has a little bit of tactile bump which
is 55 grams so that users can choose
whichever they prefer is linear or a
tactile the switch is rated at 100
million clicks because there is no
contact versus 50 million on MX cherries
and availability is July their
Kickstarter right now about 130 US
dollars and plus depending on the
configuration so guys this has been the
winning one in my experience I like it
but you do have to adjust to it for
example because of that 2 millimeter
actuation distance which is which is a
hardware limitation for the switch right
now you do have to press the switch
enough for it to start to actually go
down and actuate otherwise it's been a
quite cool to also play around with the
switch without the key cap in there or
without the switch itself so you can see
I see the light and you can move your
finger up and down to move your
character and that's awesome but guys
let us know what you think about this
concept is it something that you would
perhaps experiment with check them out
with a link down below I'm Dimitri with
harbor conducts thanks so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
