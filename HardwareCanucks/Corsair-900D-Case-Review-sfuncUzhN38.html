Canucks and well what can I say it is
finally here the monster from courser
it's so big it doesn't even fully fit on
my review table now with the release of
the 900 D Corsair is making a bold
statement like they did back in 2008
with the 800 d and well there are a lot
of new and improved features to see I
feel coarser is becoming a little too
comfortable with this dominating
attitude and are on the slippery slope
with quality control but more on that
later the 900 e retails for $350 which
is probably not much if you're planning
to utilize the chassis to its full
potential but also means high
expectations with quality which
unfortunately is not the case here the
chassis is simply elegant certainly an
eye candy for PC builder with that
massive tinted window to reveal your
hardware and brushed aluminum on the
front and certainly it's very
distinguishable chassis and we like it
the front panel is removable that
reveals a fine mesh dust filter and
triple 120-millimeter front intake
measuring the spacing between the fans
and the front panel we have 35
millimeters which is adequate to prevent
choking the fans plus the drive cage is
somewhat open to allow airflow
penetration the given the chassis is so
wide it does affect a look at the front
with an optical drive installed so
unless you do the hidden mod yourself
either live with it or opt out for an
external optical drive now remember how
I mentioned Corsair is on a slippery
slope with quality control and this is
one of those instances where the
connection cover broke on the first time
when I pressed it to open and now it
just flaps around this is an easy fix
with some glue but I want to expect a
perfect case if I spend so much money on
it behind the cover we have a total of
six USB ports two of which are USB 3 PR
buttons and audio jacks the top mesh has
a different design a break from the
conventional honeycomb or circular
ventilation also has a built-in dust
filter it is removable I had to do it
off camera because there is very
difficult trying to Lodge it out of
place but here you get an idea of what
is possible for top airflow options a
400 millimeter rad or 360 choose your
pick at the rear the 900 d accommodates
4
we had clearance for anything you choose
to install at the top with just under
five inches of clearance until the
memory modules plus a 140 military
exhaust fan is included we then have 10
expansion thoughts with more venting
that could be used for a reservoir and
two mounting slots for power supply at
the bottom with the extra ventilation on
the inside of the frame unfortunately
though it is unfiltered now the chassis
has nothing at the bottom as it utilized
this decides for mounting and has rubber
feet to prevent scratches and noise and
finally let's take off this beautiful
panel and explore the roomy interior the
900 d utilizes tooless panels so with
the push of a button the panel comes off
and this is another issue I ran into
pushing the button did not release the
panel and I had to force it out from the
bottom while the rear panel also had
problems and upon closer inspection
another plastic bit broke off that keeps
the hinges in place and they had to
manually reset the mechanism every time
I took off the rear panel here is me
again trying to take off the main panel
and this was only possible with access
from the bottom very inconvenient and
unacceptable for the price as expected
the 900 is very open in each section
serves a purpose I was happy to see some
attention to detail with rubber inserts
for some of the edges to absorb any
vibrations caused by the panel's the
main chamber has a modular drive cage
that can be repositioned and mount an
additional 120 millimeter fan on there 2
more drive cages are located in the
basement behind the bottom panel and
just as easily can be relocated to suit
your configuration there are a total of
three cage platforms in the bottom
providing the option to clear up space
in the main chamber which can actually
be utilized for a front radiator with
over three inches of clearance the drive
caddy is a standard flexible for
mounting with SSD support and only one
of the three drive cages is
hot-swappable this is very much
appreciated and brings back some of the
original features from the 800 d now the
bottom chamber is loaded with features
and opening up both panels we have a
magnetic dust filter also a fine mesh
making this a full dust proof enclosure
now we have two slots for power supply
and that is a
course if you need extra juice for your
rig but also because each side supports
a 480 millimeter radiator at the bottom
mounting the power supply in the default
spot will allow clean up cable
management and course includes a set of
brackets for support of a radiator on
the other side simply remove the Kage
platforms and screw on the brackets it's
very simple and now you have a native
support for dual 480 million radiators
with a small compromise of one hard
drive gauge and a total of four and a
half inches of clearance is available
for the side radiator meaning push and
pull is certainly possible the bottom
doors by default a blocked with another
panel that is removable with screws I've
read it into little trouble with one of
the screw inserts you're popping off
nothing serious but again shows the lack
of quality control with this case and
closing the bottom panel ventilation is
now open and the fans should have
absolutely no issues bringing in cool
air and at the rear Corsair is pretty
much known for the cable management
style really nothing negative to say
here if you cable clamps are included
and you most likely will need the extra
reach from the bottom all the way to
your 8 pin CPU connector and the 900 D
comes with an extension
there are many cable tiny notches and
cutouts all around the motherboard plus
an inch of space to work with which
makes cable management more pleasant
than anything else
the slogan with the 930 is what will you
do with all this room and it's funny
they say that because mounting our ATX
board in there you really start to
wonder what will you do with all this
room after hooking everything up there's
over 16 inches of clearance until the
drive cage and the 900 d is left wanting
more it really screams for a powerhouse
of a system and our little reference
build does not do justice of the
monstrosity the 900 d can become plus it
can handle a lot more at the back to the
900 e definitely stands out within the
market of enthusiasts enclosures the
sheer scale of this tower is impressive
and utilizes every inch of its internals
for potential powerhouse utilization of
the bottom chamber for radiators or
drive storage is up to you and it's
water cooling where the 900 d shines
with dual for 8 a.m. in rats support at
once basically without compromise
or hassle now of course there were
issues that I ran into like the broken
connections panel in the front and
stairs side panels that do not work as
intended and extremely difficult process
to remove the top dust filter are all
signs of poor quality control or just
design flaws for something this
expensive this is unacceptable
the 930 is not a bad chassis at all in
fact it's one of the best cases for
water cooling enthusiasts what's not
great is quality control and reading up
on issues with loose panels broken
plastics and warping during shipment
because the case is so heavy so just be
aware that there will certainly be
issues and due to such limited
quantities be prepared to be patient for
any of the replacement parts and that
concludes our review for the 900 d let
us know what you think of this case as
