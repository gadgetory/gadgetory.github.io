at a photo from B Phoenix the shinobi XL
they have taken they're quite popular
mid towers the shinobi and enlarged it
leaving many of the same features on the
outside as well as the inside the case
is released at around $150 so not bad
for a full tower category the case would
appeal to many who like the simple and
minimalistic design the top and front
panels are made of plastic and covered
in beach Phoenix's soft touch coating
which adds the rubber as steel and
enhances the overall build quality the
front panel connectors are located at
the top and concerning the sizing of the
chassis it may become problematic if
placed under the desk or in tighter
spots the orange USB port is big Fenix's
supercharged port it's not for data
transfers but for charging your USB
devices it sends up to 2.5 amps of
current and it charges about five times
faster than a regular USB port so a neat
little feature that will definitely be
of use in the current day in age next
are the 4 USB 3 ports the connector both
the 20 pin and the regular 9 pin
depending on your motherboard then we
have our audio ports your power button
and they hardly accessible a reset
button that must be pressed with a pen
or something thin for it to register the
front panel has 5 optical drives with
meshed venting strips running down on
each side behind the panel and remove
the dust filter covers that provided 230
millimeter fan with the option to
install a triple 120 millimeter fan
intake with the top fan mounted on one
of the five the quarter inch drive
panels meaning the bottom three optical
base will be taken up so defense options
for the front intake are pretty decent
but having only the small venting strips
on the panel not much air flow will be
delivered the top panel has a tight mesh
to catch the settling dust with support
for a triple radiator and more venting
steps on each side to maintain a uniform
design now the front panel should have
had the same ventilation mesh to allow
less resisting airflow the top panel is
removable and B Phoenix includes a
second 230mm fan for the top and users
can mount an additional
230 mil Marfan for a powerful exhaust
now given these fans are over $20 in
their own props to meet Phoenix for
supplying two of these fans the top also
supports triple 120 millimeter fans for
water course unfortunately fans cannot
be mounted above the frame and all the
parts must be mounted inside which is a
bit disappointing you will not be able
to have a push and pull configuration
with a standard radiator and given the
size of this enclosure we feel this is a
major drawback take a look at the back
we have water cooling holes an exhaust
fan IO area nine PCI slots and the
bottom mounted power supply with a
removable dust filter moving inside all
the optical base utilize a tool
astounding system and hard drive cage
supports up to seven 3.5 and 2.5 inch
drives using this tool as brackets now
the brackets aren't exactly secured and
can fall off the rails easily now this
is an issue with the 3.5 inch drives but
if mounting SSDs you can secure the
bracket to the cage using a single screw
we would recommend this if the case is
in transport on the other side the CPU
cut out is fairly large with rubber
grommets spread all around the mother
wood tray for your cable management
now these garments are pretty small and
can fall out easily when passing cables
through them and given this is a full
Tower
the case has support for XL ATX
motherboards which is the reason for
those nine PCI slots Quad SLI or
crossfire for all of you enthusiasts at
the bottom of the case there are two
dust filters for the optional 120
millimeter fans and that first
impression said seam these filters could
easily be removed but unfortunately
that's not the case
they said extremely tight and they're
secured from the inside removal which
requires to poke through each corner to
release the dust filter the fan can be
installed for the bottom intake and the
filter would just be screwed on with the
fan not the most ideal way and could be
a little frustrating the entire hard
drive cage can either be removed or
rotated and if removed the bottom intake
could be utilized perfectly for a dual
radiator or a standard triple rad can be
installed on place for the front intake
but unfortunately voltage
the hard drive cage is not made easy and
definitely needs to be reconsidered
first you must remove 11 screws the top
four are hardly accessible then you need
to remove both the dust filters which in
itself is quite a challenge and only
then the hard drive cage is free and can
be rotated now once the cage is rotated
neither of the bottom fans can be
utilized as there's no clearance and on
top of that wiring and drives now
becomes a problem as it is difficult to
route the cables behind the cage also
this prevents any graphics cards longer
than ten and a half inches to be
installed so rotating the cage seems to
introduce more hassle and limitations
than benefits and the more appropriate
solution for the cage is to divide it
into two parts either which can be
removed if needed we've seen this method
from many manufacturers in the Phoenix
needs to adapt to the current market
standard if they want to stay
competitive included with the case is a
five and a quarter inch adapter that
supports 3.5 and 2.5 inch drives so in
case the hard drive cage is removed for
water cooling you can still mount a
single drive looking in the back of the
case there's a ton of room for all your
cable management and spread around are
these cable tie notches that can really
be helpful and no issues should arise
with cable routing his rubber grommets
are conveniently placed around the
motherboard and fully assembled the
shinobi excel does not disappoint the
spacious interior is what you would
expect from a full Tower cleaning up all
the cables at the back is really easy
due to how much space is available and
graphics cards on length of 13 1 1
inches are supported with the cage in
place meaning the full potential of what
can be installed inside is not limited
by any hardware so overall the shinobi
excel is a good candidate within the
Fulton family it is nice to see they've
expanded the shinobi line is it appeals
to many budget consumers the simple and
clean design is the preferred choice for
many and the overall build quality is
decent but definitely could be improved
like the annoying rubber grommets that
possibly fall out and the unsecured hard
drive brackets it has plenty of storage
area and can mount the largest GPUs on
the market and it's always exciting to
see some innovations within
closure market like the new supercharged
port for charging your device's water
cooling capabilities could be improved
but it does support 360 and 240 million
rads however there are a number of small
flaws that really add up and we hope it
Phenix with address them in the future
starting with the top panel it would be
nice being able to install the fans
above the steel frame for a push and
pull configuration the front intake fans
are practically choked on the front
panel and there needs to be more meshed
ventilation to really take advantage of
that 230 mm a fan and the last major
turnoff about the Shinobi excel is the
rotation of the hard drive cage it is
not made simple and carries with it many
limitations like the inability to
install bottom intake fans and an
extremely tedious process of the actual
rotation and obviously difficult wiring
for the drives but that being said
modding the chassis is an option to
really take advantage of its large size
and the internal design at this price
range there are plenty of competition
swirling around and the shinobi excel
offers many possibilities and has great
potential and that concludes the review
for the shinobi Excel thank guys for
watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
