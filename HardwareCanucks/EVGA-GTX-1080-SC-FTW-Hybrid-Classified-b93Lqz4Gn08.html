exciting especially when we get to see
and hear what all the custom board
partners are how they're handling the
cooler what are they doing with the
power faces so here with the VGA the GTX
1080 superclocked FTW the hybrid and the
ultimate the mother of all gods GPU here
is they classified so let's talk about
them now huge thanks to our Computex
sponsors for sending us out here shout
out to Nvidia fantex and cix and MSI so
first let's talk about the GTX 1080
superclocked Edition a CX 3.0 cooler
design dual fans back plate and white on
the shroud they're not exactly sure if
everybody's gonna love the white but
we've seen many motherboards that
feature white design and many cases that
have white interiors this white and
black combination perhaps mixin is a new
color in your bill might be a cool idea
the awesome part about this the super
clock is the price point at 649 so $50
cheaper then the reference editions
founders Edition from Nvidia I think
that's awesome now the clocks are not
totally and known yet simply because
EVGA is going through a bit of the green
light process and trying to make sure
that all the clocks are stable so no
solid you know clock speeds are known
yet but the founders edition is easily
able to achieve 2 gigahertz and passed
with good temperatures and good fan
profile so here
the fan profile edit the default state
hits about 60 to 70 degrees Celsius at
load and so that's with default fan
profile so if you want to ramp up those
fans you can achieve even better
temperatures and I would say easily
achieve 2 gigahertz plus on the core 4
power is gonna still have an 8 pin so
that's just like a reference design
everything is going to be reference
aside from the AC X 3.0 cooler moving on
to the FTW Edition which that one has an
extra 8 pin so it's gonna have double
the face power so giving us 10 face
power instead of 5 on the reference and
the fully RGB shroud ACX 3.0 just as
well so instead of just having white on
the shroud you have full RGB spectrum
which is pretty awesome in my opinion
however
the backplate there's no color there the
f2w will be priced at 679 so a $30
premium over the SC but given the extra
8 pin and extra overclocked ability and
the extra face power perhaps a high
overclock 2.5 gigahertz somebody's say
maybe the third card is the hybrid the
price is still unannounced but most
likely I don't know hopefully like a 6
$99 price point but given we have a 120
mm millimeter all-in-one cooler built in
it's the same one as before the card is
still two and a half inches looks quite
different from the previous hybrids but
still remaining in the same character
within the EVGA x' line so that will
have an additional 8 pin so basically
it's like the FTW GPU with the 10th fire
power faces instead of 5 like on the
reference but with a new cooler so that
you can the card will be like I would
say 55 degrees upload which is awesome
which is what the previous hybrid cards
have been at so very excited with a new
line from the EVGA with the GTX 1080s
plus a 10 70s here the gtx 1070 it's
launching june 10th so it's awesome to
see it here very nice a similar cooler
as the SC version with the white shroud
nice little text on the top
no RGB most likely will a release of FTW
edition therefore anyway and the last
card that we saw here is the GG a GTX
1080
classifieds like the king of EVGA GPUs
I'm really excited to see what type of
overclocks we can achieve on that one
perhaps a 2.2 gigahertz but that will
all depend on the green light program
that Nvidia is running through the
cooler is really awesome very large EVGA
is doing RGB here as well massive fans
backplate all the same story but with a
low twist on combining the whole family
of this new GT X 1080 cards with a
similar design language for the shroud
and that's appreciated one really cool
product they're also announcing for the
GPUs is the EVGA power link which is
basically like a angle bracket with a
dual eight pins on the for power that
goes into the GPU and reroutes that
connection off to the side so when the
graphics card is installed in the case
and
centered position instead of the cables
showing up inside your window now those
cables are being rerouted it looks like
a really cool concept and I definitely
think it's going to be very useful for
many martyrs and anybody with a window
who wants to reroute those cables so
that the GPU looks freakin awesome the
new high bandwidth sli bridges are here
EVGA has a little custom one with a VGA
logo it's going to be illuminated and
with little switch in the bottom here we
have RGB W so red green blue and white
LED illumination that you can change
through there so this entire lineup of
GTX 1080s from EVGA looks awesome
especially those bright phones price
points reference at 619 the SC at 649
the FTW at 679 and the hybrid
unannounced most likely 699 looks
awesome especially because we are slowly
reaching towards that MSRP price point
of that $5.99 so the closer we get there
the more you know the more happy the
consumers will be but the cards look
awesome can't wait to overclock some of
these especially since we have such
great coolers a6 3.0 so guys I'm Dimitri
with our connects thanks much for
watching which card would you pick if
you were to buy the GTX 980 from this
lineup let us know in the comments below
thanks much for watching we'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
