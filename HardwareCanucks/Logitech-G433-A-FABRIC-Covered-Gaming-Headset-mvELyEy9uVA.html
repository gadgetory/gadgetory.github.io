throw it slightly lighter
how exciting can gaming headphones get
large tech seems to have added some
spice to the game with a G 433 nobody
let's check it out choose be quiet to
join the silent revolution designed and
tested in Germany they're meticulous
passion for quiet PC components ranges
from premium power supplies CPU coolers
and fans and innovative PC cases all of
which aim to achieve one thing is this
thing even on that's right totally quiet
power supplies even under load silent
wings fans the little awesome airflow
with noise that doesn't reach your ears
all enclosed in the package designed to
be quiet so the g4 33 comes in as a very
appealing price point at $99 switch for
a surround sound headset in this very
crowded marketplace it's pretty good and
largest thing is trying to impress us
from all the angles and one of the most
notable changes here is the fabric cover
on the headset that is available in red
blue bull camo and this boring black and
I think it's a very good approach to
cover up the crappy feeling plastic so
it's a good way to introduce a good
feeling headset because our perception
of quality is usually derived from
handling a product and feeling it and
how it sounds and was there any creaking
plastic because the quality on the G 233
was terrible because of the plastic so
have they succeeded with the g4 33 well
the size adjustment is good it doesn't
crack and it certainly looks good but it
still feels like a bathing suit material
it's very harsh it doesn't have the
softness that I expect and unfortunately
the ear cups feel the same and if you
have dandruff I'm sorry
as all the little crevasses pick up dry
skin very well it's very visible the
hair gets stuck a dark gray color as the
phone
would have worked much better they're
not irritating to wear but they sound
like sandpaper when the headset moves on
your head it's very unappealing and the
replacement ear cups are therefore
appreciated I swapped mine right away
and because the large rectangular shape
of the ear cups you have to be kind of
rough when removing and installing the
ear pads and because of the different
material on the replacement ear cups the
headset doesn't look so good anymore
having these two types of visible fabric
in terms of shape they're not
particularly bulky they're a bit wider
than my sign Heiser game one but I love
the ability to fold them on your neck
with no restriction to head movement but
unfortunately even the headband padding
has the same harsh feeling and that is
not very comfortable the material choice
here is very poor and it's upsetting
because everything else around the
headset is excellent in terms of comfort
there's no large clamping force they're
light enough so you can wear them they
breathe and so that you know the actual
ear cup size is large enough so there's
no clamping force even if you have large
ears they expand so all those elements
are excellent but why do you go with
such soft par and just terrible padding
I don't understand but hey you are
paying for something and packaging here
is incredible so we got dual layered box
fantastic print job but who is this guy
plus the hidden keep playing slogan yeah
I appreciate it but it's way over the
top and you could have easily shaved off
a lot of the cost on the packaging and
invest those resources into things that
matter on the headset when will they
learn quality products first before
quality packaging please but we do get
plenty of accessories so there's a carry
pouch that is good to store extra cables
an extra set of ear pads that I
mentioned earlier then a rural
microphone that is flexible and there's
only one way to insert it into the
headset so that's good
and if it's not populated the input jack
seems kind of lonely and exposed so
that's what the microphone sounds like
it's plugged in directly into the USB
sound card there's not enough power in
it to drive my car properly and it's
very quiet and you have to boost it
either in post or add gain which
introduces hiss but yeah this is what
the quality is like then there's the
main USB sound card for surround sound
audio there are no
Oh LED indicators here it's very simple
plug-and-play and control through the
gaming large stick software then we have
the main PC cable with a mic mute
function and volume control plus a short
clip all of which feel excellent so nice
feedback on the button and the firm
volume wheel plus different ends so you
cannot confuse what plugs and where then
there's the mobile cable with a mic
built-in and a multi-function button and
finally mic / headphone jack splitter
for the PC if you want to plug this into
your sound card so I do appreciate the
very modular nature of the g4 33 with
all the possible cables that you would
need but I feel there is your compromise
in order to meet that $99 price point
with good packaging and good accessories
they have to chip out on some things
like very important padding on a headset
come on Logitech and also a subpar USB
DAC that has very low volume mic output
and the only thing left to cover is the
audio I was pretty satisfied for $99 to
get a clean detail and a powerful signal
that is not harsh it's not tinny and you
get a nice bass boost that actually
vibrates the drivers a little bit yeah I
don't think that's a defect it's felt
very powerful without destroying any
other frequencies so that's pretty good
to hear so from an audio perspective I
would use this as my main gaming headset
if it wasn't of course for the really
terrible padding on the top the
replacement cups are fine though
but as soon as you enable surround sound
through the you know the launched gaming
software you lose the powerful volume
everything becomes distant mess and you
lose all the positional accuracy that
you normally get with stereo so just
experience and the surround sound
through the DAC is terrible so I would
just leave it at stereo and the flat
profile is very good but of course you
can play around with the EQ settings and
those different profiles that are built
in which all have their nice quirks and
they don't destroy the audio frequency
so there you have it another example on
how a gaming headset that tries to do it
all have good packaging with accessories
good customization options for color as
in terms of the frame design comfort
level is good but there's so many things
that are wrong starting with the
material on the padding it's not
comfortable I would gladly ditch all
that fancy packaging for nice
lure paths that you see on you know
other quality headsets or maybe even
like give me a pleather headband that
doesn't feel like sandpaper on my skin
please but when it comes to the USB DAC
in stereo mode
it's excellent with different EQ
profiles but in surround sound mode
which is what you're trying to sell us
for this headset it's not a good
experience the powerful volume is not
there and the detail is not there and
that's unfortunately because we've heard
good surround sounds from large tech in
the past with their g6 33 so you know
these compromises here just really
downgrade the whole experience with a
$99 price point that is so appealing but
all these little drawbacks that kind of
chip away at the value and it makes me
difficult to recommend the G's 433 and
so my final remarks for Logitech would
be to focus on good tiding in their next
revision of the headset because I think
that really destroys this product which
is quality in perhaps if you're trying
to be fancy with packaging have the
fancy packaging sleeve but the rest of
packaging to be simplified and those
resources to be invested into the
product itself and I wish that more
gaming companies would recognize that
and really invest everything into here
and not to here so guys I hope you
enjoyed this review I love the material
direction but the implementation is just
not there yet but let me know what you
think of the g4 33 and everything we
discussed in this video I'm Dimitri with
