completely revamp product by
Coolermaster a company who is producing
some of the hottest cases on the market
right now what we have is the cooler
master storm sniper which we've seen
before but now it's coming with a bit of
a twist the case is now a black edition
which means a black paint job inside it
out as well as sort of a few other
treats the case is the replacement to
the original so it comes in at roughly
the same price and it can be found on
store shelves now the body is
constructed of solid steel and there's
plastic accents on the top bottom and
front with steel to reinforce the
handles the one thing that's very unique
is that Coolermaster has managed to get
away with putting a lot of plastic on
the case without hurting the aesthetics
or really diving into the cheap and
flimsy category and because of all the
extra molding on the outside it does
increase the physical dimensions of the
case it's 22 inches long 10 inches wide
and just under 22 inches high it also
weighs in at 23 and a half pounds so it
isn't especially light but it is very
solid at the top of the case we have our
rather large power button a dial to
adjust the 200 millimeter fans
throughout the case and then an LED
on/off button there's four USB ports and
firewire then eSATA audio and activity
LEDs there's five external drive bays on
the front with filters and an LED 200
millimeter fan at the bottom the case
comes in two varieties the one has a
mesh side panel as seen here with
another giant 200 millimeter LED fan
however there is a windowed version but
it comes without the fan at the back we
have our tube holes 120 millimeter
exhaust fan io area on the side a
vertical PCI slot along with seven
expansion slots a second section for
tubing and then your bottom mounted
power supply the case stands on raised
feet which can be rotated on a 90 degree
angle now there's also a ton of venting
on the bottom in order to reduce the
dust intake inside the case the dust
filter for the front 200 millimeter fan
easily snaps in and out making cleaning
very simple and taking side panel off
the major change to the case is the
interior is black now this has been
something that many hire in cases and
even if you
arranged cases have quickly adopted in
the past year so Kula master is sort of
playing a little bit of catch-up but it
looks really good at the bottom back of
the case we have the spot for a power
supply which will sit and raised there's
also space for a hundred and twenty
millimeter intake fan with a dust filter
so it's easy to clean and it snaps in so
it's screwless there's also the front
hard drive bays which use the cooler
master screwless system and then above
that the traditional cooler master
screwless cd-rom drive base at the back
there's a horizontal PCI Express slot
which actually has clips in order to run
wires others 820 millimeter exhaust fan
and then the CPU backplate opening at
the top there's a two hundred millimeter
LED exhaust fan as you can see they have
included spacing for wiring as well as a
CPU cooler backplate opening the drive
bays are all inset as well to allow for
more cable storage and as you'll see
with the back panel it isn't flat
most of it has been pushed out and this
is what gives you so much room to run
wires for accessories there's a few
unknowns we have labeled bag of screws
an SSD bracket and three point five to
five and a quarter inch rails as well as
optional rubber feet if you want to
replace the rotating ones at the bottom
and then tubing rubber grommets and one
thing we noticed when we first opened up
the unit is that Coolermaster has
included one of their new sniper mouse
pads and this thing is very nice it's
got a rubber base bottom and cloth top
and something you'd normally pay a
pretty penny for they've included it for
free and it hasn't altered the price of
the case
they've used the typical Coolermaster
harddrive mounting system which takes a
plastic bracket where you put the hard
drive in and it fits in and clamps tight
it's very solid and it holds the drives
in well the other great thing about this
case is that it will fit the new ATI
5870 video cards which are 11 inches
long and there's room to spare the one
thing we were a little concerned about
is that the case uses plastic retention
clips for the video card but unlike some
other poorly manufactured cases these
clips are very secure and they're gonna
hold the video card in without the need
for screws found that wiring the case
was incredibly easy mainly due to the
enormous space in behind the motherboard
tray where you can store all the wires
it can keep everything clean you can
have great airflow and you can make it
look really nice
I'm putting the back panel on it fits
over top of all the wires in the back
without a lot of fuss or hassle you
won't be able to have a clump like we
have here but if you spread it out a bit
it's really hassle free now as you can
imagine airflow in the case is not a
problem you have the front 200
millimeter fan as well as on the side as
the intake points and then you have the
200 millimeter and 120 at the back end
top as the exhaust points there's also
the optional 120 millimeter down at the
bottom now with all this air being moved
around the big question is what are the
temperatures like so we took a look and
here are the numbers
now given that the sniper has a little
bit of a different design it does make
it a difficult task to find where you
can put a radiator
however Coolermaster has included a
space inside to mount a dual 120
millimeter rad you'll have to take up
the top 200 millimeter fan to fit it but
if you replace the fans you shouldn't
lose too much air flow and so that wraps
up our look at the cooler master storm
sniper now as far as positives go for
the case there really is a whole slew of
things that we like and keep in mind
you're paying about a hundred and fifty
dollars for this case so it's very
reasonably priced for what you get first
and foremost is the excellent air flow
you have the three two hundred
millimeter fans and you have the
adjustable fan dial so if you're more of
a person that likes a quieter system and
you still want that great airflow you
can have it and then if you're somebody
who's willing to trade off noise for
better airflow and better temperatures
you can have that as well and along with
that it also has excellent cable
management you're able to tuck the wires
up in behind and make a really clean
looking system blue masters made this a
very very solid build they've used a lot
of plastic on it but it's very solid
plastic it's not flimsy and bendy and
all the metal is very rigid the
motherboard tray is very sturdy and
everything just feels well built and the
only thing that could really be seen as
a negative for this case is the way it
looks for those that like more of these
box style standard square cases on the
rounded edges and funky design may not
be for you however personally I really
like the look of this case they went
with a sniper theme and I think they
really captured that so that's it for
the hardware connect product showcase on
the cooler master storm sniper now if
