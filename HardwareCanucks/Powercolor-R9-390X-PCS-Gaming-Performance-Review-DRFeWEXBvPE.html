learning platform with over 3,000 video
courses covering business technology and
vast creative fields I've been exploring
the adobe CC section just to cover my
bases for new workflow and new tools to
help with our productions for a free 10
day trial visit linda.com / h WC and
turn your curiosity into making things
happen hello everyone this is dmitri
with hardware canucks and today on the
review table is an hour 939 TX pcs+ from
power color if you're in the market for
39 TX your options are plenty with
excellent offerings from sapphire asus
gigabyte msi and so it really comes down
to choosing a card that offers the best
overall package as they all have a
gigabytes of ram the core on a pc s plus
is only miniscule 10 megahertz higher
than reference bringing it to 1000 60
megahertz and the card is priced at the
same 429 USD so really the only major
difference between the competition is
the cooler and power color does not
disappoint we have a triple 80-member
fan array that shuts off during light
load five heat pipes in total on a full
copper base plate and the massive chunk
of aluminum fin array and the familiar
aluminum shroud with both silver and
black accents plus there's a
full-contact heat plate that makes
contact with all the important parts on
the PCB for controlled temperatures here
the shroud actually extends beyond the
two PCI slots making this a thick card
that will occupy two and a half slots
and extends beyond the PCB making this
GPU 11.5 inches in length in addition of
a backplate is welcome it certainly adds
an appealing element when installed
inside the case but there is no actual
cooling value as it doesn't make contact
with the PCB having said that this is
the coolest 3 90 X we've tested so far
reaching a stable 64c under load a good
7 degrees cooler than sapphire zone
triple fan cooler this however comes at
a cost as fans ramped up and knocks out
over 2,300 RPM
em making this one of the loudest cards
and our stack unless you go in to tinker
with your own custom fan profile to
compromise a little bit on temperatures
but save you from this unnecessary noise
for powers requires an 8 + 6 pin which
is the same as on the reference card
with power consumption staying exactly
where expected just a slightly below the
reference 39 TX most likely because of
slightly lower temperatures the IO is a
bit disappointing with dual DVI single
hdmi 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.2 while other
39 TX cards sport triple DisplayPort for
better triple monitor flexibility
jumping into gaming performance at 1440p
first the results aren't all that
different from the reference 3 90 x
because the core is clocked only 10
megahertz higher and the cards falls
right below the 980 or overtakes it in
some games too
when we move on to 4k benchmarks the
extra memory on the 390 X adds a few
extra frames to overtake the 980 in many
of the titles and while the frames are
hovering around the 30s at this high
resolution this should set a good
understanding of what the 390 x is
capable of when we talk overclocking the
Granada xt core is already pretty much
maxed out but the pcs plus handled an
extra 107 megahertz on the core to reach
a final clock speed of 1167 megahertz
that is impressive and would add a few
extra frames on average but with higher
temperatures and at the end of the day
the power color r9 390 X pcs+ is a great
card one that handles temperatures and
gaming like a boss within the stack
however at the compromise of a larger
than competition cooler annoyingly loud
fan profile at load and limited I oh why
don't we see Triple D P remains a
question mark and there is no particular
unique feature to differentiate it from
other 390 X's and while that concludes
