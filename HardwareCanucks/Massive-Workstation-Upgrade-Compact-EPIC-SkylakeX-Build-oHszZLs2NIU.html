what's up guys Eber here with hurricane
axe and I finally got the time to build
my very first Skellig X PC it's actually
sitting right behind me now building pcs
is in rocket science in fact anyone can
do it and if you've been following our
channel for a while we've posted a
variety of bills at different price
points but we really haven't approached
the hid T market specifically you know
what you could get with the best
possible components out there especially
on the Intel side now a couple weeks
back we did a video explaining to you
the benefits of Scottie X and the X to
an end platform we talked about the
processors and their respective
specifications along with compatibility
for motherboards memory coolers power
supplies etc so if you've missed out on
the video make sure to check it out
right over here in this video I'll be
walking you through the components that
I've chosen for this epic X 299 gaming
slash workstation PC and I've added a
little bit of a twist to this build by
making it as compact as possible but at
the same time also giving it as much as
power as I can and the end result is
pretty staggering I also want to take
this time to thank Intel and the rest of
our partners for making this video
possible
and if you're interested in learning
more about these components I'll make
sure to link every one of them in the
description down below just for your
convenience
so yeah sit back and enjoy the rest of
video finally an ultra slim body
keyboard with mechanical red or blue
switches designed and perfected for work
and play that the Sorel Graham XS
evolved to fit right in check it out
below ok so there are three reasons why
we decided to go with scanning X first
and foremost we really haven't done that
much content around this platform and it
looked like a great opportunity to test
out its capabilities and what it can
offer for our team members especially
since its kind of what we do and of
course for people who might want similar
needs we're talking video production
advanced 3d rendering enhanced
parallelism through multitasking and
let's just goes on Scylla Keck CPUs
offer massive number of threads plus the
ability to reach higher clock speeds the
x-29 platform is a flexible ecosystem
that can offer you everything from an
ultra high-end system to a compact ITX
setup you can go crazy with multiple
GPUs three or four m2 nvme SSDs within
the mother
and then expand on that later on with an
extension card there are a variety of
configurations you can go with so let's
check out some of the choices I've made
for the PC and some of them may surprise
you kicking things off with a CPU I
chose the Intel Core I 979 ATX seen
Extreme Edition 18 Core 36 started in
Monster
this is Intel's top-of-the-line CPU
sporting a baseline of 2.6 gigahertz
that can run its turbo frequency to 4.2
gigahertz it was primarily chosen for
the sheer number of threads to aid our
workflow especially with premiere and
some of the programs that we use plus
I'm interested to see how far we can
push the CPU with overclocking speaking
of overclocking cooling the CPU is an
important factor to consider because
static-x processors do produce a lot of
heat especially when overclocked even
the slightest increase in voltage can
increase the temperature output like
crazy so I decided to go with NCHS sx60
2 to 80 millimeter a i/o cooler and set
it up as a push-pull configuration for
maximum heat dissipation and this cooler
does look gorgeous with that Infinity
mayor design lit up as for the
motherboard well this one might surprise
a lot of you especially after looking at
its ties meet the MSI x2 99m gaming Pro
carbon a/c remember we were looking to
reduce the overall footprint of this PC
and for that we decided to pick an M ATX
motherboard but don't let that size fool
you because this motherboard has almost
all the features Intel skylake X
platform is known for now that doesn't
necessarily make it fair to compare it
with a full sized ATX solution but this
board should get the job done as it
offers to nvme m2 slots
support for two GPUs RAM support up to
64 gigabytes the i/o is respectable
considering this form factor as you get
a USB 3.1 gen2 type-c and type 8
connectivity dual Intel gaming line
ports and a great internal deck once
again pretty dope for a package this
small if you ask me now memory prices
are totally out of control at least at
the time of making this video but
throwing in as much as memory for
programs like Adobe After Effects and
other rendering Suites can come in
really beneficial 128 gigabyte kits are
extremely rare and the msi board doesn't
support it in the first place so I
decided to go with G skills 64 gigabyte
trident
the RGB kid capable of thing as far as
29 33 megahertz with the XMB profile
enabled and we also cannot forget G
skills gorgeous RGB illumination it's
one of the best looking kits around and
it's compatible MSI's mystic light
software for easier customization which
is awesome moving after storage we
decide to use Intel drives since they're
well-known for their longevity and
continual performance over time
in fact my very first SSD was Intel's
520 series and I used it to upgrade the
stock hard drive on my very old XPS 15
no but some of you may recall this was
the l5 o 2x model it was was quite the
experience the performance increase was
definitely drastic and it's still
staying strong I've actually passed it
on to my family members and they're
still using it just fine and it's and
it's holding up really well so Intel
hooked us up with a couple of nvme and
SATA base drives as well as they're
obtained 900 piece series SSD this
particular drive is entirely based off a
new storage technology called 3d
crosspoint non-volatile storage
unlike NAND in simple terms think of it
as stacking memory layers on top of each
other in a 3d manner for the fastest
bandwidth you also get the best
endurance and specs wise this might
attract a lot of enthusiasts out there
we're talking nearly 2.5 gigabytes per
second on sequential reads and up to 2
gigabytes per second on sequential
writes this drive also shines in its low
QD and render performance and it uses
the u2 interface unfortunately the MSF
board doesn't come with one but
thankfully Intel has included a unit 2 2
m dot 2 adapter and it comes in this
2280 form factor which should work with
the MSI board this is an excellent
option if you're using an M ATX
motherboard that doesn't come with a
native you know connector as you're not
sacrificing a lot in terms of bandwidth
as the 900p is also using a PCI gen3
x4 nvme interface and will be using this
as a primary boot drive for maximum
performance for a scratch disk we chose
Intel's 760 P series 512 gigabyte nvme
SSD it's got fantastic sequential read
and write performance thanks to the 64
layer Intel 3d NAND technology they
should really help our editing workflow
especially with raw 4k footage
our last set of drives for data storage
are intel's 545 series SATA base SSDs
these drives offer great performance
with a price and we'll be creating a
raid 0 array using two of these drives
I'd highly recommend backing up the
files stored on the array on a regular
basis just in case because if one drive
gets corrupted you would lose all the
data now we have decided to connect my
local nas as a backup solution which
should eliminate the stress off our
shoulders for graphics we took it to
another level by going with to reference
GT X 1080 T eyes and there are three
reasons for that one being obvious
extreme performance this is probably
just as overkill as you can get -
considering that I'm packing so much
power inside a compact case which I'll
get to shortly
I wanted to exhaust the heat generated
by these GPUs outside the case and the
reference cooler looked ideal for that
lastly if I were to throw in a custom
water block for water cooling in the
future it could be a lot easier working
with reference based GPUs now we
understand the component selection is
way out of price range for most people
especially with the high price of GPUs
and memory these days but we have done a
lot of affordable bills this time we
wanted to put together something
cutting-edge when we onto our case of
choice and this one interested me the
most
we chose NZXT SH 400 micro ATX case
primarily due to its native support for
the MSI board we're using but also for
its minimalist approach in design
there's not a lot of aggressive elements
especially with the fun panel and from a
feature standpoint the H 400 I offers a
spacious interior support for up to 280
millimeter radiator at the front and top
so you could potentially build a custom
loop inside and it comes in a variety of
color accents and in our case we chose
this matte black finish with blue
accents to complement Intel's branding
and that will be the theme for the rest
of the build powering the whole PC is C
Sonic's prime ultra titanium 1001
modular power supply
it comes with an 80 plus titanium
certification for the best efficiency
during runtime especially under load and
given its excellent modularity plus the
extra wattage Headroom this should
provide enough power for the 18 core CPU
as well as the 210 ATT eyes now I could
have gone with a stock power cables that
came inside the box but I felt like it
would be incomplete on a high-end bill
like this so kale mod provided us with
some custom black and blue cables to
complement a color scheme off this PC
each cable is sleeved with cable
signature menthe flex leaving for vivid
colors and supreme flexibility and
they're 100% heat shrink free which
ultimately leads to a clean and
professional looking build not to
mention routing these cables are a lot
easier than stock ones and they have
kits available for pretty much every PSU
out there its 2018 so we've decided to
add in some RGB flair inside the build
we're not going for the Candyland effect
I'm just not a fan of the rainbow colors
but I'd like to sync up every components
to a uniform color output in this case
blue since that's our theme so I've
decided to use thermal takes ring plus
12 LED premium fans and I've got the 120
millimeter 3-pack variant these fans
look gorgeous with their 12 controllable
LEDs with great light coverage and
they're really bright too perhaps the
most interesting part about this set is
the digital controller that acts as the
central hub to both power and control
the lighting of the fans so you don't
have to worry about three pin Peter Liam
connectors on the motherboard and their
nine fan blade design allows for higher
airflow along with quieter operation
which is perfect for a build like this
and guys we weren't constrained by
specific budget for this build we just
simply wanted to put together the best
possible PC with the components we had
our hands on but if you are looking for
alternatives you could opt for the 10
cores 7900 X and a single GPU solution
like a gtx 1070 but coming to think of
it the mining situation is still going
on and I really don't want you guys to
pay twice the price for a 1070 so I'm
just I'm just gonna quite down
so I've run into a bit of a problem I
guess I always do because my building
PC's I always mess up something anyways
I just want to walk you through my
experience building this PCE especially
since you don't Scott in a team called
processor 2 GPUs and it's it's overkill
for for a compact case but it's also it
kind of pushes the the cases limits and
what it can hold so first and foremost
cable management that's important so I
tried my best to keep things clean but
it is pretty difficult because
especially if you're trying to use a if
you're going for a dual GPU setup it's
really hard to route the cables through
this little cutout that they have here
so NZXT actually it was it's pretty
small so it's only like a little square
shape but I tried my best to basically
bring out all the cables I could within
within that cut out over there so that
was that was pretty challenging and of
course the most important one is
cleaning so this little guy over here is
causing a major bottleneck issue when
trying to install the GPU so for
instance if I were to install the first
GPU I have to bend this this little guy
right over here to get the GPU in and
yeah that's how you actually install the
first one the second one's not bad
because it just gets sanded which is
really weird but that was one of my
concerns another one is of course taking
a look at the back so what's switch
gears and move or words the back here as
you can see it's it's quite the mess
definitely not what I would expect from
a compact microSD X case as you can see
it's a little it's all danav cables here
I definitely need a lot of work or it
definitely needs a lot of work but it's
also challenging because if you think
about it there's only so much room left
to tuck away the cables so it's it's
really hard so you have to probably just
jam the side panel to get it all in
another thing that I want to talk about
is the air cooler that I mounted the
front so I decided to go for a push-pull
configuration so two fans of the front
two fans in the back because I'm cooling
an 18 core monster so I'm and then using
me X 62 cooler from NZXT so it's a two
eighty millimeter radiator it should be
good enough given that I'm doing a
push-pull configuration
home that temperatures will be entering
control especially when overclocking but
I guess we'll find that out while
testing but here's the problem the front
dust filter actually doesn't fit because
of the because of how large these fans
are so if you're doing you 240
millimeter radiator has a push-pull
configuration I think you should be just
fine because the fans are pretty small
and the front filters just should work
just fine but if you can as you can see
it doesn't go through because the fans
are just they're just they're just
getting in the way so what I've done is
just basically just jam this thing in
like that I'm just gonna while I'm
holding the camera on one hand but
basically I did what I did is I just
sort of eyeballed the alignment for the
filter and the fans and then I just
jammed it in so after all that hassle
going through cable management and a few
DIY fixes the build is finally complete
and it definitely looks staggering
especially after configuring the
lighting to dark blue I've also led the
geforce gtx logo remain at its green
setting and i think it adds some
contrast to the build but i'd love to
hear your thoughts on the visual side of
this pc in the comments but overall i'm
actually pretty happy with the way how
this turned out i mean think about it
this is an h 400 i case with basically
the best possible components they can
find on the planet jammed into a micro
ATX case
RGB lighting was Frehley straightforward
I'm pretty happy with the uniform color
output with all the components I used
three different software's so NZXT scam
for the AO cooler thermal takes ring RGB
software control for the ring RGB fans
and the LED strip and finally I'm a size
mystic software for the Triton see my
kid okay so I wanted to spend a
dedicated video talking about the
performance of this PC but I decided to
throw in a few benchmarks just to see
what you can expect from a PC like this
so I took the stock settings that came
out of the bar
and I did a little bit of old clocking
not the best don't work like that God
but I did manage to get the 18 core CPU
to 3.5 gigahertz and the memory
overclocked at 29 33 megahertz and you
will see by the results that it well he
wasn't a massive difference but anyways
let's go ahead and compare the results
starting with Cinebench r15 running the
cpu test the 79-80 extreme edition at
stock settings scored well over 3,000
points but with that slight overclock it
dished out 83 points more than the first
one so it's not a significant difference
switching to OpenGL and the results
shouldn't surprise you the 210 ATT is
dished out well over 100 60 frames per
second and there wasn't a huge
difference with stock and overclock
settings once again I also ran blender
with the BMW scene and the system
rendered that in two and a half minutes
and yeah there wasn't really a
difference not much compared to you know
overclocked but what really surprised me
was the rendering performance in Adobe
Premiere Pro I took a one-minute 4k
timeline and exported that to the
YouTube 4k h.264 preset and at stock
settings the 18 core CPU rendered it at
49 seconds that's way faster than a one
to one ratio testing it a bit further
I took a nine and a half minute 1080p
timeline and I rendered it out in 4k so
basically upscaling the video using the
YouTube preset and the system completed
that task in eight minutes really proves
how fast a 79-80 extremization cpu is
the 2.5 gigahertz overclock didn't
really do that much but I intend to
spend some more time on that so stay
tuned for our full analysis in part 3
when it comes to gaming performance well
expect breathtaking frame rates
battlefield one at 1440p said - hi -
Todd over 144 frames per second on
average mind you this was tested with
the dx11 setting as dx12 cost drivers
stability issues with SLI or watch at
1440p said - epic averaged around 295
frames per second that's just insane do
at 1440p said - ultra using the Vulkan
API averaged well over a hundred 55
frames per second and finally Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon set - 1440p and
very high text out on both 1080 T is
giving us well over 100 frames per
second so 4k gaming is definitely
possible
with a system like this especially with
two gtx 980ti s so maybe I'll include 4k
benchmarks in the next video you know
where I'm talking about the full
analysis so if you're interested in that
let me know in the comments down below
but I wanted to explain why the slight
overclock didn't really help improve the
performance basically with all course
set to the same speed there's a
reduction with the turbo max so
essentially you know running at stock
sayings the turbo max would allow the
CPU to go as far as 4.2 gigahertz in
lightly threaded apps like games but
when you fiddle around with the settings
in the BIOS that potentially reduces and
creates sort of a bottleneck when it
comes to hitting that max speed however
there are ways around that performance
reduction when overclocking which we
will talk about in the next video
there's definitely a lot of things to
explore with this build and I do intend
to spend some time testing it in depth
and going through different performance
analysis and creating my own custom
benchmark where I'm rendering a 4k video
while gaming while also doing some other
tasks and comparing to you know my
current editing PC so yeah definitely
stay tuned for our analysis so what are
your thoughts on this epic X 299 gaming
slash workstation PC are you surprised
with some of the component selections or
are there any alternatives that could
have been a better fit in this compact
micro ATX case let us know in the
comments down below also if you have any
suggestions for benchmarks let me know
in the comments down below of programs
that you may be using on regular basis
that you would want to see how well it
could perform on this PC again comments
is all of yours amiibo with hurricane
axe thank you so much for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
