to another hurricane axe review the n
series from Coolermaster is very
refreshing as it tries to blend
enthusiast friendly features and compact
and minimalistic form so we're checking
out the N 600 sort of budget $80 mint
hour which follows a similar front panel
design as the rest of the n serious
cases but with a beautiful tented side
panel no fan grills here just simple
acrylic exactly how we like it so this
front mesh design is quite nice also has
a built in dust filter now we've
mentioned this before but installing any
type of optical drive will disturb the
uniform look of the front panel for
connections the front fan led can be
switched on or off we have four USB
ports with audio jacks power and reset
button taking of the front panel I'm
surprised Coolermaster has gone this
route with fans installed inside the
frame removing which is a much more
difficult process than it should be that
requires this assembly of the drive cage
inside and the removal of the connection
module at the front in order to get
access to some mounting holes so the
whole process is extremely inconvenient
in the back we have a total of seven PCI
expansion slots plus a vertical one for
accessories two speed fan controller for
exhaust fan and the removable power
supply filter both the side panel and
the top include a dual exhaust with the
internal dust filter they're not the
most accessible especially with fans
installed but you can't easily just
mount them on the outside without
disturbing the externals too much
alright so I'm really interested in
checking out how the engineers of the
cool master can utilize the space most
efficiently and at first glance it looks
promising so we have the standard
toolless optical mounts with modular
drive gauge and another 3.5 inch drive
gauge right below it the N 600 comes
with seven pairs of mounting clips that
work for both mechanical drives and SSDs
the brackets are tools for larger drives
but need to use screws for the two
points
five inch drives the N 600 allows you to
either remove the top cage walls
completely or expand the width to allow
3.5 inch drives to fit this is not a bad
idea if you need more storage but you do
lose out on SSD compatibility now
luckily n 600 utilizes the space at the
rear for a single SSD which is very
useful now also I'm glad to see proper
cable management designed with more room
quality rubber grommets and many cable
tie mounts scattered all around
it's these critical details that
simplify your assembly and saves you
some nerves now I was also excited to
see a side fan mount implemented to cool
your drives this way the hot air gets
exhausted right away without interfering
with the rest of your internals but also
cooler master praises D and 600 for its
240 millimeter radiator support on the
side but unfortunately trying by all
means to fit our standard ride with fans
didn't work so good by custom loops but
since all-in-one radiators are usually
smaller there's still some water cooling
hope left a few extra fans can be added
one at the bottom but only with the
lowest drive slot empty otherwise
there's no clearance and the second 120
millimeter fan to the cage bracket to
help with additional airflow so fully
assembled and with our monster installed
we have 13 inches of clearance with the
SSD Kage wall and about 12 inches with
the wall extended so no problem with
long GPU support regardless of your
configuration spinning the case around
cables are nicely tucked away and secure
to the back of the motherboard tray and
everything on the inside looks very tidy
and clean so really happy how the N 600
is designed and to wrap things up the n
600 despite the small hiccup with the
dual radiator is actually a strong
contender with elegant aesthetics
modular drive cage excellent cable
management and a well-rounded price at
$80 however a very inconvenient mounting
system for those front fans is rather
disappointing
especially coming from Coolermaster plus
no proper 240 millimeter radiator
support on the side but we have to say
the N 600 is a right step into the
future of enclosures with higher space
efficiency and utilization because today
let's face it the more compact the
better and we're giving in the harmonics
damn good value award so thanks guys for
watching and we'll see you in next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
