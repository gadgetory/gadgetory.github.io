great technology selection and service
with holidays right around the corner we
have a new GPU release from AMD the 380
X now this card is very interesting
because it catches up with aim these
latest features like free sync via star
and framerate target control full dx12
and Vulcan support and it aims to fill
the price gap between the r9 380 and the
r9 390 being released at $230 for the
reference models and all the way up to
260 dollars for the overclocked fancier
editions so this price bracket may seem
attractive at first but the higher
performing models are approaching the
pricing floor of the r9 390 and the GTX
970 that seemed to offer better price
the performance value the r9 380 X is
based on a fully enabled Antiqua XD core
with 2048 stream processors 4 gigabytes
of gddr5 memory on a 256 bit bus and
specs wise it's almost identical to the
r9 280x but with a much lower power
envelope the sapphire nitro 380 X is the
card that we have today this is the
overclocked card with up to 1000 40
megahertz on the core from the factory
it comes with a sexy aluminum backplate
although I only wish that the model
stickers were not so intrusive being on
there but other than that this is one
good-looking GPU I absolutely love the
new sapphire design that is slightly
taller than usual but it's still a -
slaughters I know that measures at 9.5
inches or 24 centimeters the dual fan
heatsink combined with large copper heat
pipes at the bottom and added efficiency
of the core allows the card to remain
completely silent as fans stop spinning
when on idle and during load the Nitro
380 X is one of the quietest cards in
our testing stack with temperatures at
load hovering around high 60s Celsius
the card requires two 6-pin power
connections that place out to be a
little bit more power efficient than the
previous generation the heat
xD core but still far more power hungry
than the competing lower end gtx 960 the
IO consists of a single display port
HDMI 1.4 a and two DVI outputs and so
based on the specs and the price target
it's quite clear that the new 380 X is
not only ready to dominate 1080p gaming
but acts as a solid entry into 1440p
resolutions as well so get comfortable
and let's see how well the Nitro 380 X
performs starting with 1080p now keep in
mind when looking at these numbers that
we do these tests at Ultra and the
highest settings possible to throw the
cards into the most demanding situations
so being mindful the fact that 60fps may
not appear on the graph but it is
totally achievable with a few settings
toned down
getting into 1440p benchmarks and a
similar trend occurs with a pretty
substantial gap between the three ATX
and the competing gtx 960 while
remaining far below the capabilities of
the r9 390 and the GTX 970 so
performance wise it fits in that exact
spot which isn't the attack by the
competition and that's perhaps on
purpose to separate the enthusiast level
cards versus the more wallet friendly
options and so where does it leave us
with the 380 X well on the one hand it's
new feature set power efficiency and
performance leaves as satisfying but on
the other hand the discussion of value
is an important one to have as the just
so slightly more expensive options
deliver much better performance so I
think the fate of the 380 X release will
largely depend on holiday deals and if
customers can feel that the value is
there which it is
for the reference clock but custom
cooled models so what do you guys think
of this 380 X release based on the
numbers you saw today and if you're in
the market for a new GPU does the 380 X
appeal to you in any shape or form you
know where to leave your thoughts down
in the comments below I hope you enjoyed
this review this is Dmitry with Haruka
Knox make sure to go 1440p on that like
button and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
