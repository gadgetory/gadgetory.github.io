exciting deliveries I've had in last
couple of weeks let me show you I mean
look at this giant bag of potatoes on
the new EVGA case arrived - we got a
deal with these first another case all
right so it's the new DG 7 from EVGA I
have no idea what to expect all I know
it's a mid tower and EVGA case history
has not been extremely positive I mean
they do unique things so let's see what
this guy is all about that feels like a
glass panel in the front all right okay
not liking the model numbers sticker
over here again all right so welcome to
our review of the DG 7 now the thing is
I'm excited to see how the market
accepts the AVG's direction into the mid
tower category and my initial
impressions at the moment our labyrinth
makes because I wasn't expecting so much
branding to be slapped all over the
place and you know just a few things
like black fans included on a fully
white interior exterior body and so I
think the color mismatches a little bit
present too but let's see what's under
the hood right after this we capture our
experiences to remind us of the past
with fantastic visual quality but what
about the sound it helps to piece
together the moment and now you can with
the Sennheiser AM be a smart headset
that doesn't just record the audio it
lets you feel and relive your
environment because the microphones pick
up sound just like you would the end
result is a stunning capture of 3d audio
so you can visit the past again check
out son Heiser and be a smart headset
linked below all right so the D g7
series is available in four
configurations and two color options
with the white being a $10 premium now
this is a good move to diversify AVG's
presence and different price points but
they're also kind of on
mine's the higher-end 76 and 77 cases
because the frame itself is identical to
the $59 model and that's an issue I have
the GG 77 in white so that's the most
expensive at $149 it is a mid Tower and
it doesn't particularly stand out in any
way and you can say the resemblance to
the s 340 elite is present with its boxy
frame and a relatively same size but
here we have rounded edges and make no
mistake this is an EVGA case with nots
of the screen branding all over the
place that over time has actually grown
on me
on paper this case has some unique
elements like tempered glass on three
sides a cool K boost button a bunch of
colored stickers so no one is confused
on the model name of your case but I
really do appreciate that this is a
sticker and not something more permanent
and we even get all the tooling for a
vertical GPU installation so that's very
nice to see lower end models do not have
these add-ons and therefore are much
cheaper now the case comes in black
color as well that I think would look
better because the entire frame here is
white so the four included fans plus all
the cabling is black and I wish that we
only had some white accents for that
color coordination with the black
interior instead because that always
looks better when it comes to cable
management and hardware so with regards
to these three glass panels well unlike
the usual transparent glass that we see
the front and right side are solid and
white so they don't even look like glass
giving an impression of a glossy plastic
instead and cheapening the full look
furthermore the right side panel is
semi-transparent and gives off this
yellow cast on the interior of the case
highlighting any openings and depending
on the angle it might not look very good
on top of this dilemma toe comes the
build quality that generally is fine
nothing is like falling out rattling but
the top and the rear plastic covers
really cheapen the feel among on the
glass
although the removable plastic cover at
the rear is a good initiative to
encourage different designs and it's not
included on the lower tier models
unfortunately like many other cases in
2017 the gg7 completely chokes the front
intake area with only a small
ventilation gap on the right side taking
off the glass we see a perfectly
reasonable space
fans and up to a 360 movement radiator
but add in the dust filter and that tiny
gap for air and those fans are not going
to breathe for very long and that is so
unfortunate because it's become such a
common thing to complain about with
regards to front airflow and I'm
honestly surprised it was launched this
way up top after removing the panel we
see a decent layout for fans as well but
despite having room for three 120mm fans
the front aisle cables will interfere a
little bit with that third spot the
mounting strips are centered and there's
not enough height on the case so
radiator up top is out of question and
by the way there is no dust filter on
here just a coarse mesh the IO is
standard with USB 3 power reset and
audio jacks and that K boost button that
requires a connection to your
motherboard and when activated it locks
both the CPU and the GPU to maximum
performance state now it only works with
EVGA graphics cards so on my GTX 1084
the win it locked the frequency to 1960
megahertz regardless of the load while
staying at about 17 20 megahertz with K
boost off giving me a significant higher
score in fire strike with K boost
enabled so you can do this manually by
enabling high performance mode in power
settings and the maximum performance in
the Nvidia control panel
but what K boosts does is just doesn't
allow the maximum frequency to drop
below that so you're running on the
hotter GPU but at maximum performance
possible so I like this feature because
it's kind of like an instantaneous
overclock with a simple press of a
button but it does require a little bit
work on your end making sure there's
nothing running in the background
otherwise K boost will just lock up and
not turn on until those applications are
closed it's also an incentive to stay
with an EVGA GPU ecosystem but for those
without EVGA GPU these higher and tier
cases are really not appealing up top we
also have this RGB LED controller
located in a somewhat awkward to access
spot so you can line up any regular
12-volt RGB LED strips and match it to
the case lighting now I would have
suggested to relocate this controller to
the back but as you can see with a fully
white frame and almost no spacing for
cables I understand why the controller
is hidden the software is pretty basic
it looks
outdated tow and Windows Defender freaks
out thinking this is malware but color
is nice on the exterior although I wish
that the EVGA text near the power supply
didn't have that additional outline but
what's weird is this LED text at the
front that looks fine but it's
completely covered by the front glass
panel it's not even visible unless you
look into the spacing on the right I
think for the black version the glass is
transparent and this text shines right
through but not on the white model for
storage we get duo three and a half inch
drive caddies and two SSD caddies so
drive options for 150 bucks are pretty
limited and check out this fantastic
quality dust filter this is probably the
only upgrade they forgot to add to this
higher tier model now the internal
layout is also a bit disappointing the
frame doesn't promote friendly cable
management with spacing between the two
metal sheets and no rubber grommets
anywhere now I generally like a
perforated power supply shroud but with
all that white paint job everything
underneath will be visible the one write
feature thought they got is this large
cutout at the front for radiator support
but unfortunately the paneling is
choking the intake anyway so a full
airflow potential cannot be achieved now
I did some airflow tests with the
included fans on full blast at 1800 rpm
running close to 70 degrees Celsius
upload while dropping 10 degrees with
that front glass panel removed and the
one thing I would recommend for you to
do to improve airflow is to just remove
that glass panel entirely because
without it the case still looks pretty
fine and so here we have my system
assembled that falls in line with the
color scheme and you know the frame is
not bad with proper cutouts below the
motherboard tray and I keep thinking
that a $59 case that DG 73 will deliver
the exact same building experience as
this and despite all the add-ons on the
DG 7 and 7 I feel it's not a good value
because the frame itself is more suited
to the lower end because cable
management is poor because this large
opening doesn't really allow clean cable
pass-through unless you use the space at
the front but that's also where your
three and a half inch drives are
supposed to go it's not exactly refined
with the i/o cables right in your face
and the top fan mounts are centered so a
radiator will not fit there are also no
thumb screws on the
see I slots and just for reference
here's a fan tax and two pro-am special
edition in white with a much better
interior for any radiator installation a
cleaner cable management job and much
better quality fans - with RGB fan
frames and the case feels sturdy as well
and it's 30 bucks cheaper versus this DG
77 in white and the only advantage with
the higher model is the vertical GPU
bracket so you can show off that
beautiful shroud installation of which
is straightforward and the bracket does
keep the GPU slightly off the frame but
the end result looks fantastic alright
so let me conclude with this I think
variety is needed in order to
accommodate certain features here and
there and have a broader spectrum of
price points so you can accommodate
different markets but when you take a
mediocre and sort of budget oriented
frame and move it into a higher tier
price point then none of bling or
accessories can really improve that user
experience and so we find ourselves in a
bit of a lipstick on the pig type of
situation I think they're pricing on the
higher end is not competitive because we
have the p400s the s340 elite the end to
pro em all offer better features for
less money but on their lower end that
DG 73 at 59 bucks sounds like an
excellent deal especially when you take
into account this frame you know there
has some issues but at that budget price
point it is actually pretty excellent so
I'm very curious to hear what you guys
think about this full lineup of new DG 7
