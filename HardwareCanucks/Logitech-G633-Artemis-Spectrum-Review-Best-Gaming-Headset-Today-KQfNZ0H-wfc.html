great technology selection and service
when it comes to gaming headsets I've
always been skeptical as the selling
point many of the times isn't audio but
flashy packaging and weird headset
design that would make you question
quality of the audio
luckily gaming companies are now
realizing the need to step up their game
and I'm happy to say that as a gamer
today you have far better heads and
options than a year ago
thanks to this merge of good quality
audio drivers proper software support
and extra functionality for games all of
which are found on the new Logitech G
633 gaming headset
so the G 633 is actually a unique
headset because despite having this
gaming centric physical design it
delivers quite well in the audio
department notice the lighting sections
of the headset that include illuminated
G and this strip on the back of the
headset of course there is zero
functionality in the RGB lighting on a
headphone but as gaming companies enter
eSports arena with sponsorships this is
an effective way to build brand
recognition Plus imagine if a team
member dies light goes off or health
status is color coded or even perhaps
lighting interacts with music or the
gaming environment as of now the user is
still limited to solid color breathing
or the cycling effect now the sliding on
the sides and back will be visible for
spectators only without creating any
unwanted reflections on your screen it
is vibrant and RGB so you can color
match to your other peripherals and that
is of course appreciate it the build
quality here may appear to be weak just
because the headset is extremely light
and it's mainly plastic with the metal
headband and the ear cups are pretty
loose which I don't find amusing but
keep in mind perception of weight does
not equal quality build I actually like
what Logitech has done here giving us a
lightweight frame with better grade
screws and extra plated plastics so to
be worn for hours at a time without
causing any headband fatigue nor
settling any pressure anywhere the ear
cushions are perfect for exactly that
with non irritating and pleasant to the
touch fabric that is washable plus they
are deep enough so your ears don't make
any contact with the internal drive wall
and they allow you to breathe that's
important I went for an eight-hour day
wearing the G 633 that let my ears
breathe and most importantly this over
ear design is done right for a
comfortable experience for extra
customization the side plates are
magnetic and that's removable you can
see the illumination here that would let
users 3d print their own plates and
allow Logitech to release title specific
editions
this headset on left ear cup we have
several buttons that at first I thought
I would never use and this is completely
pointless but they are actually quite
handy from the bottom we have a volume
wheel that has very light steps but
allows either really fast volume change
or precise and two-step intervals
followed by a dedicated mic mute button
that you cannot remap and I find that
pointless as the mic is muted when in
the upright position and I find simply
tucking away the microphone is easier
than having to reach all the way back to
press the mic mute button while we're on
the microphone it is stashed away on the
left and features extra extendable reach
with the flexible cable there is a red
LED on the side to indicate when the
microphone is muted and it's perfectly
visible within your peripheral vision
and here's what the microphone actually
sounds like you're listening to it now
there is an ability to enable side tone
which allows you to hear yourself
in-game which I love I hate not hearing
myself as I speak inside the game when
everything and all the audio is blasting
in the headphone and you can actually
control the volume of the side tone or
disable it completely and you can map
that also to the gee-gees which i've
done and is super useful probably the
only fault of this microphone is the
noise cancellation you can hear exactly
what I'm typing and in game that will be
also audible and this entire microphone
recording has been unedited there is no
sound effects applied to it so you can
hear exactly what it sounds like then we
have three g keys that are programmable
to anything you want like enabling 7.1
surround sound changing EQ settings
switching between color profiles and
your sound profiles and etc I left them
at their default functionality as they
were never used during my game time just
because my left hand is on a keyboard
and taking that off to fiddle around the
buttons on the headset means losing that
precious time off the keyboard so they
were left at their default setting
but for productivity on the desktop it's
actually quite handy for media controls
like play pause without having to reach
for the keyboard
now unfortunately despite having
different shaped keys for easier
distinction they are so close together
that even after trying to learn where
those G keys are I always press the
wrong one and finally at the very top is
a switch between PC or 3.5 millimeter
jack as the headset can either be used
in the USB mode or use the second
provided cable for analog mode that has
an inline remote with a short clip with
play/pause functionality the volume
adjust mic mute and your choice of
microphones to use pretty handy little
inline remote but given how bulky the
headset is I doubt it will be used
outside of the home for music listening
but of course to each their own and that
is an option and I also love the
foldable feature that allows the headset
to rest around your neck without any
movement restrictions and because of
this I kept the headset around my neck
more times when not in use rather than
put it off me and onto the desk so now
for sound quality let's talk about that
this has become my go-to headset for
gaming because Logitech has done a
fantastic job with the pro G drivers
that use a hybrid mesh for the driver
cone to eliminate frequency distortions
with excellent clear highs controlled
base that feels powerful and
non-destructive for the mid-range if
pushed higher the stereo projection is
beautiful and allows detection of any
surround elements in game this is a csgo
dreamer plus enabling surround sound
mixer you have an option of DTS X with
three room profiles that fine-tune the
EQ for either movie playback fps or
music studio with either front or wide
stereo mode that modify the soundstage
with great results and enabling Dolby
surround sound just expands the
soundstage even further but I found it
to completely remove any accurate
positional awareness in games and I did
not use it at all stick to the stereo
profile for best detail and if you want
to set a custom EQ profile that are
really good for what they are designed
to do but of course full manual EQ is
available once
add the new EQ profile and the launch
the gaming software is actually one of
the best with user-friendly tabs and
options so just make sure you stick to
48 kilohertz or below to utilize all
these options and so the Logitech G 633
is one of the best gaming headsets on
the market right now that sounds
fantastic
with great microphone and a comfy and
the $150 price tag is a bit high but you
won't need to upgrade for a while and
we're giving it the Harbour Canucks game
reward and that is it for this review
