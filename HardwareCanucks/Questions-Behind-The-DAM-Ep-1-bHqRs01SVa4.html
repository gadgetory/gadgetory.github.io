first behind them episode the pilot
episode of future vlog and
behind-the-scenes stuff so today we're
answering the questions from Twitter
let's go to eavers
so we're doing it all right welcome to e
within you got there for me man bananas
man just be small potatoes I can I work
fine for you but at a time okay
it's the way we're eating camera we're
not eating camera zero
it's time to show off your elites I
wouldn't a exceed alright guys so here I
am with Eber Eva how you doing man I'm
doing well how about you great great
today is the first episode of behind
them where it's a new series we're
launching for Harkin axe to give you the
behind-the-scenes of what's happening
here between Eber and I and other parts
of the crew that are you know that are
not really known on the channel because
they're behind the scenes and doing
stuff for the website and other
administration stuff so here we decide
to take this time answer some of the
questions that you guys sent in to
Twitter and Facebook so here we go all
right so the first question is who runs
the YouTube channel and then who runs
the the website stuff and so mean Eber
and Aiden are the YouTube producers and
I think we're doing a pretty good job
there but you know there's a lot of
behind the scenes that you guys are
never experienced because you know it's
not usually spoken about so that's the
whole idea behind the series so we want
to give very big credit to Mike Sky MTL
who is our editor in chief or Harbor
Kanak so he does a lot of things that a
goal that makes this stuff possible and
allow us time to actually create content
so how much do you love Michael I love
him so much
for example the new GPUs that come out
the 1080i or risin side and you see POS
K be like all those benchmarks that you
see on our review videos where performed
by Mike it was not me it was just it was
Mike he spent tireless hours trying to
formulate this how much time goes into
benchmarking it's insane so huge shout
out to Mike at hands who also does like
you know script proofing and just idea
brainstorming stuff of that so it's not
just me and Eber you know we are like a
collaborative effort so teamwork I would
say is on point plus we have Patrick and
Anthony who are taking care of written
articles in the website so really I
deferred and the second question is
what's up with the beaver the beaver is
part of the hierarchy nagas branding and
the name you know you can see the beaver
and you're like that that's the Huracan
ox thing right we had a really good
illustrator when the harbour Canucks was
first starting out and they wanted to
illustrate a good Canadian mascot like
an animal so the beaver was the perfect
choice and so I don't know it's kind of
vintage now but let us know what you
think about it
next question is it required that all of
our hosts for harbor Canucks have an
accent I would say yes because variety
is the spice of life man whoa what is
the best thermal compound to use between
toothpastes sliced ham or gummy bears
sliced ham guys I mean it's obvious you
use it to overclock your cpu and that
would cook the ham so you can use that
for your next day's breakfast Eva how do
you get such good color in your b-roll
ultimately you want to get the color
right in camera first and then worry
about color grading and color correcting
it in post and I would say that includes
make sure that your white balance is
correct because correcting for white
balance is quite difficult if you're not
turning wrong and make sure that your
exposure stuff so it set your zebras to
100% that way you know when you're
clipping and that way you don't over
expose things that you don't need to
over expose Eva what's your all-time
favorite keyboard whitefox all day next
question what is the best cpu for around
$300 for streaming editing and gaming I
would say risin 5 1600 it's under 300
bucks so you can invest additional money
saved on that for better GPU what has
been the most rewarding part about
harmonics ah it's all about recognition
right I mean the work we put into is not
gone to like a drain or something like
that it's it's it's out there people
enjoy it and we're recognized for that
work and I really appreciate you know
the comments the feedback on every video
I read them every day so it's really
it's really it's encouraging to continue
yeah
Dimitri how did we become so popular for
case reviews case we use huh oh man if I
do another case review and next week I
am going to just cases delivered such a
better visual appearance in video so you
can actually see what's happening versus
written content which has static
pictures which for many product is fine
obviously right but I guess at the time
we really diversify that delivery better
than any article out there so that's
that's how it grew and you know majority
of our audience still prefer case
reviews but my friends we are expanding
on content so yeah just be ready for
mall Bieber what are your top three hair
products
use hair products so I really don't have
any water that's it I don't have a three
I just have one is there a place you
want to see Hardware conducts be down
the line or are we happy with it now
great question by late even I'd love to
see how it connects expand into
different product categories but most
importantly I'd love to have a studio
here in Toronto because right now we're
working within different remote
locations so it's really hard to you
know collaboratively work and be more
productive I don't know if I'll be more
productive with you in the room go
elderly man I mean we've been producing
some good content some weird extra but
most importantly you know it's all about
space efficiency right because within
this four walls you only have your own
limitations so having that extra you
know space and then studio would be cool
and stepping up that production level
but also moving away from like the
YouTube side of things and the
production stuff is to really merge the
site and all the platforms in like a
woman hub and we're currently going
through a side read it redesigned so
that's coming later I'm really excited
so but what do you what do you guys
think where should where do you see how
recognize going forward I mean we've
already started doing diverse content
and stuff and you know little bit of
personality building all right here's
another one how do you install GPU
drivers with uninstalling the older ones
easy display driver I'm installer DD you
downloaded remove your previous drivers
from control panel Long's ddu and safe
mode and let it handle all the
installation procedure and install the
new drivers that you download from AMD
Nvidia or Intel thank you
what's your favorite video you've ever
produced and why so for me I would say
like most recently the one plus 3t when
I took in the park I did there was like
this Fox stuff coming out was beautiful
I really enjoyed shooting it and also
just a little break from case reviews my
friends
what were you definitely the 2016 razor
blade review I did spent quite some time
on that intro and then from Mikey pants
he really enjoyed the Rd 400 pyrrole
that we did for OCD which is still our
premium most elite spot that we produced
very proud of that video too and that
painting was my wife painting so I was
just shooting it and as she was just in
the element knowing what to paint for
the drive so I
again turned out pretty good little I'm
recording okay thanks my beloved Nvidia
so the entry here is an interesting
question how our PC tech tubers coping
up would be ad Boyd con from our
perspective we haven't been affected by
personally because we don't produce any
controversial content that would be
deemed you know non ad friendly from
YouTube side of things but people have
been growing frustrated with YouTube's
lack of defined guidelines on what would
they would consider you know ad ad
friendly content so it's turning traffic
away from YouTube and it's turning off
some creators to explore other platforms
eibar what has been the highlight moment
of your time in the hardware connection
you got to be careful in this when you
you got to be careful I think it was the
time when I got a message from her
attacks via Twitter saying you've got to
put that 5d Mark 3 to good use man ok
guys that what I said that's look and so
I guess that's where I got started also
you're like seeing the initial point as
the highlight mm-hmm okay well that's
that's an optimistic way to view things
I guess the next best highlight after
that was me meeting this guy okay we
went for a little little lunch date to
discuss what's happening I will
paraphrase from Michael so for him it
was the CES so previous CES where the
entire team sort of kind of was in one
space collaborating you know because we
all do work remotely so it was a very
interesting dynamic you get to learn how
you work with other people and you get
to learn how they work with other people
you get to hear them snore we all did so
that's true but I would say for me so
many good so many good things I know
it's quickly got you you know we can we
can like think about our first
computation either you know meeting the
whole team I actually never met any of
the the crew members of heart recognize
yeah two years after I started working
so you know it's all over email right so
we're like constantly just like emailing
each other I was never even on the phone
with Michael or any other team members a
year after so it was just such a like a
WoW moment of thinking like this is a
pretty cool dynamic that has
working for us and yeah do you realize I
was I met Michael for the first time
after three years working with our
connects three years mm-hmm yeah so see
it's kind of a cool way like we know
each other but we've never met each
other well now we have but until then
you haven't so this is a very
interesting and relevant question do you
think Rison will get better in gaming
over time or will Intel always beat it
the problem with Verizon and gaming is
that games in general just love higher
clock speeds so if you compare rising
frequencies with Intel you obviously see
a significant difference between the
core frequencies for titles like
accessing actually the singularity and
warhammer you know it there is a lot of
AI calculations going behind the scenes
with proper coding for those small
on-screen units that you see in game and
so that's where Rison comes in handy
because of its higher multi thread
counts a little variety of spike is what
they say you're high on what these new
cutter looks like and my Jeep it hey
Michael you're in speakerphone so guys
