great technology selection and service
when you go away for four months and
your roommates
rearrange their furniture goodbye old
computer chair he won't be missed
also I was tired of sitting on this
Brown thing luckily that meant it was
time for an upgrade finally my first
proper computer chair dxracer seemed
like a good choice based on all the rave
reviews and in this video we're gonna
put it through the harbor Canucks
treatment let's do it
all right so welcome to our very first
computer chair review this one goes out
to dxracer d series made with specific
fit guidelines and all of their chairs
suit a certain body type height and
weight and given the variety of series
they offer finding the optimal chair for
you should not be a problem they range
anywhere between 300 to 500 dollars
depending on the size and the style of
the chair this particular one is almost
400 dollars and if you spend hours and
hours in front of a computer on daily
basis you should consider the value of
extra comfort and proper posture a chair
should offer and so let's start with the
unboxing experience that left me
satisfied with all the packaging
material and components inside wrapped
in some protective padding I was
impressed at the sheer weight of all the
components like the heavy aluminum wheel
base or the two-piece chair itself
I made sure all the parts were included
nothing was missing
I appreciate the clear and detailed
instructions manual with pictures for
assembly and a little baggie with an
allen key to start the construction and
an extra m8 screw and so first you pop
in the 5 wheels onto the base this
requires no tools next is popping these
five textured plastic covers that are
non-slip and help your feet rest on the
base without sliding off next you didn't
cert the hydraulic unit in the center
and lower in the plastic guard attaching
the bracket to the seat is simple all
the screws are already pre-installed
thus minimizing chances of any missing
screws this process is pretty
straightforward and I would recommend
attaching the right side first as the
bracket stays solid in position and only
then secure the left side you can then
attach the control unit at the base of
the seat screws are already
pre-installed with the lever on the
right side after placing the assemble
chair onto the hydraulic unit the
assembly is complete and we are ready to
sit for cosmetic purposes dxracer
includes these side covers to hide the
exposed joints between the
seed and backrest now I really like the
design choice of the blue accents with
variety of colors to choose from with
perfectly embedded strips throughout the
chair for a great looking product now a
few words on the material is used this
leather like seat and backrest do not
concentrate much heat I am surprised to
feel fine and cool after hours of
editing really happy with that plus I
find the amount of cushion on the seat
itself to really suit my softness
preference without it feeling too hard
nor as soft that you would feel the
bottom of the seat the height adjustable
armrest is super handy to complement the
height of your desk the release
mechanism is easy to work but the right
arm on my chair after a few weeks became
a little stiff requiring two hands to
operate it has a slight curve to it and
is slightly soft providing a comfortable
surface for my elbow and the forearm
while also being scratch resistant
height adjustment of the chair itself is
smooth with an accessible lever on the
right side it goes pretty low but the
total travel distance is about 12
centimeters between the highest point
and the lowest point and I wish the
chair had a bit of extra height range
also the compression of the chair when
you just sit on it is about one
centimeter which is awesome meaning the
height does not change regardless if
there's weight applied on the chair or
not the angle adjustment is also smooth
with an accessible handle on the right
side with 170 degrees in range and you
can even lower yourself to an almost
flat sleeping position with the chair
able to hold you without tilting or
showing any signs of this balance I find
myself using this quite often just to
stretch out my back take a break
listen to some music or whatever and now
for the most important part be organ
ohmic design of the back rest so sitting
down you immediately feel the curvature
shape around your waist and your
shoulders the shoulder wings are pretty
wide but keep you in place from
slouching over and allow you to
straighten out your shoulders and your
arms without feeling too crammed in but
it is the lower waist wings that keep
your forms
great so in the beginning I felt as if
the wings were a little too much in
especially without the back pillow but
after putting the back pillow in place
allow the more comfortable seating
position and extra flexibility for
movement as for the seat itself it is
also curved to keep you in one place the
sides are raised a bit so you don't
shift around and the whole point of this
economic design is to provide consistent
and proper seating position something
I've never had with any of my previous
chair choices the lumbar cushion I think
is a crucial element to proper seating
position it can be moved up and down of
the backrest of course can be removed as
well but without it I find my back too
curved too much and I lose all sense of
sitting straight with it it pushes out
my lower back keeps my posture right and
I can maneuver it on the fly depending
on how high or low I want it the
headrest cushion is also an integral
part of a comfortable chair it's nice
that it's color-coded to each specific
model too it's using a butterfly clip to
pass through the chair it's easily
adjustable and removable it's plenty
thick and is soft and curves nicely
right between my shoulders in my head
strangely without it this whole top area
feels empty and really uncomfortable as
you hit the plastic housing and so
throughout my time with it I've been
editing on this chair for over two
months now and I consider it a total
needed investment for the amount of time
I spent in front of the computer the
build quality is excellent no stitching
has gone undone I haven't discovered any
rips in the material and really the only
hiccup is the right arm razor mechanism
that has become stiff with the lumbar
and neck pillow I find the chair
extremely comfortable I literally sit on
this thing for over 50 hours a week it
does angle and height adjustment well
the rolling around is completely silent
the designer school and the seat shape
and the backrest is forgiving if you do
decide to change up seating position
with one or both legs on the seat
crossing your legs or whatever the price
is a turn off but since we haven't
really had experience with any other
gaming chair
we can comment on how competitive it is
or it is not but man have I enjoyed it
and we're giving it the Harbach knocks
damn good award and you guys let us know
if you have any other experience with
any other chair brands whether or not
it's an office chair or a gaming chair
because we would like to explore this
market segment as it seems to be growing
and what would you consider to be the
most important element within a gaming
chair Sony comments down below make sure
