great technology selection and service
hey guys Dmitry here with Harbor canucks
today we're outside beautiful summer
weather and we're going to checking out
something a little bit different from
our usual computer hardware things but
we're moving into more camera reviews
and so today we're checking out the SOL
shot - this is a very unique tool to
help solo videographers to capture their
motion or whatever they want to do
without actually touching the camera so
if a burr wave to the camera
so Ebers the the video guy right now but
if Eva wasn't there I could potentially
use this device to help me do things
like this if I stand up Eber will try to
track me and follow me as I move around
the scene but if it wasn't there and if
I had a tripod set up there it would be
very difficult
this solo shot device by the name solo
implies a single individual and this
device will help the camera track me
wherever I go and so today we'll be
checking it out in terms of how to set
it up and actually how it works so let's
get started and so the basics behind the
solo shot to assembly consists of the
base unit that has some weight to it
at two pounds it feels solid the main
body is colored in the orange perhaps
for it to stand out from the distance
and there's a retractable antenna on the
side to help with this signal the mini
USB charging port is hidden behind the
rubber cover along with a full-size USB
port for updating the form Ram the
camera mounting plate is at the top
maximum supported weight is five pounds
so most DSLRs and with the lens and many
camcorders are supported the front of
the unit has a few contact points this
is the accessory port for either the
camera controller module and/or the tag
as this is how you charge the tag on the
actual base unit which brings us to the
second necessary component is the tag
first that's what a proof it's
shock-resistant it's fairly compact and
easy to stash away on your person
especially with the optional $10 armband
the base relies on the geographical
location of the
for tracking and therefore you must be
outdoors in the clear area with no tall
buildings nearby so automatically this
won't replace your cameraman and it will
only apply in certain very specific
outdoor situations the base basta tag
will set you back at 399 and if you
decide to get the camera controller
that's an extra $99 and they also offer
a camera bundle which includes a tripod
and a 1080p Sony camcorder as your
ultimate camera bundle I would say it's
a premium price to pay especially since
the results in our experience are not
completely satisfactory but first let's
check out the setup process and here is
where I realized the setup is a little
bit more complicated than it should be
and would turn off potential casual
consumers who just want to experiment
with a solo shot too the first step is
to attach the base to the tripod make
sure that's leveled get the camera
installed at the top with a green LED in
the same direction and then the tag must
be turned on and it has to go through
this warmup period for at least eight
minutes this means the tag must be
outdoors until the red LED starts to
blink and it took about eight to ten
minutes for ours to warm up during this
warm-up period we can set up the mode
utilizing this LED and numbers menu at
the back of the base and this is where
things get a bit tricky as the base has
multiple tracking modes determined by
the LED one green color is for a
surf-and-turf which gives you a good
range of pan and tilt for objects of at
least 50 feet away the red color is for
big altitude mode to film drones
mountain climbing high motorcycle or ski
jumps for objects of at least 100 feet
away and the third mode is orange for
paying only for objects of at least 50
feet away LED number two is your
trajectory setting or for how long the
base continues to track along its
trajectory if the tagged signal is
interrupted and LED 3 determines your
zoom options for widely Diem and tight
mode with green red and orange colors
Spector
and if you are lost like I was for a
first couple of times of going out to
use the device this is a very handy LED
summary that I kept referring to during
my testing but they seriously need to
integrate some type of LCD at the back
of the base for more convenient mode
selection and just understanding this
robot so now after the tag has warmed up
we need to Center the camera on the
object that is at least 50 feet away and
then you must perform a tag walk that
requires at least 50 steps in the
activity area for surf-and-turf
and pan only modes and at least 150
steps for the big altitude mode then you
must return to the base holding the tag
above the camera and pressing the plus
buttons on the tag and the base
simultaneously afterwards return to your
center spot 50 feet away and press the
plus button again on the tag to finally
complete the calibration process and you
will have to do this calibration process
every time you move the base around so
this requires not only patience but
really good understanding of each mode
but when you finally set it up here's
the footage that we got now my immediate
reaction was that 70% of the footage or
so is unusable for our use because of
the jerky motion every time I slow down
the motor on the base does not smooth
out the stop and we get this
inconsistency in motion while I was
running we had some good consistent
tracking but again when I slowed down or
stopped completely this change of
tracking speed is just not to any video
production standard alright that's a
major negative Plus even if we had
everything set up properly the base
sometimes would freak out and completely
who's tracking in the middle of the
shoot and we would go through the
calibration process once again which was
not pleasant now some of the good parts
of using the camera controller module is
remote stop and record option and if
using a DSLR to trigger a series of
photos there's a time-lapse feature
built in and support for multiple tags
if you're recording between
people objects but I think the bottom
line is this the non-smooth and
variation of the speed of the pan is a
complete deal-breaker for us if it can
handle smooth motion then it's a no buy
for any production guys however we are
told that this might be fixed via
firmware in the future for casual
consumers if you want to record yourself
mountain climbing skiing down the hill
surfing the waves riding a motorcycle or
whatever else just be prepared to learn
the solo shot - and how to operate it
because if you're fine with the footage
it is still better than some people
operating the tripod and thus could be a
solution to capture motion just remember
to have somebody on guard decide the
solo shot
so it isn't picked up by a distant
stranger the soil shot is a developing
ecosystem so hopefully when new
revisions are introduced some elements
will be backwards compatible but as of
now it's not the robot camera I was
hoping for
despite being such an innovative gadget
for video in photography enthusiasts so
guys thank you so much for watching make

we'll see you in a next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
