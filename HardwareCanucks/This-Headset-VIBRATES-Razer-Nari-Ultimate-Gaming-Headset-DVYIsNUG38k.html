package from Razer huh what exactly is
that I have no idea man but I'm just
gonna leave it on the desk so feel free
to take a look at it
when you have a time okay all right bye
all right so this looks like it's the
new nari Altima by Weezer feel every
battle you've got a cool sound wave our
presentation over here the future of
gaming audio and merging early haptic
technology this will be interesting
you've got a bunch of stuff here and
assume that's the headset so let me pull
it out check that out it's pretty cool
looking okay so with the nore ultimate
razors really trying something different
by integrating haptic technology within
these headsets so basically it's based
on audio cues from a game engine so
whether that's you know firing gunshots
or blowing up stuff within the gameplay
you're gonna feel a little bit of that
vibration on your ears and I think
that's gonna be certainly interesting to
test out so yeah let's check out the
nori ultimate right after a message from
our sponsor evolved with the times
consider nvme storage today the new RC
100 brings affordable nvme storage into
your hands with various capacities in
this super compact form factor that
points directly into your motherboard
it's extremely powerful and utilizes the
Sheba's advance through the flash memory
for awesome speeds so you can be a happy
user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme
drive to consider check out below
all right so after examining the headset
a bit closely the first thing that
sticks out to me the most is the size of
the noise all tomates I mean it is huge
almost looks like it's gonna crush my
skull or something and this type of
design has been embedded within brazzers
naari series of headsets so it's not
like it's a revolutionary step in terms
of design
they almost look very much identical to
the other naari headsets that razors
offering now given the size of this
headset is also been on the heavier side
as well coming in just a tad about 400
grams which is a lot and you will
definitely start to notice the heaviness
once you start wearing it for longer
periods of time and let's be honest here
for a sec you're not gonna wear this in
public transit just casually moving
around here and there because it's just
not practical that being said I do like
the gunmetal gray finish on this headset
it does add a nice stealth appeal the
body is mostly constructed out of heart
plastic materials but it is put together
really well there are no signs of
creaking which should be expected
considering this thing costs $200 you
heard that right
the naari Ultimates there are $200 now
if you watched any of my previous
headset reviews you know me and my
relationship with headsets featuring
self adjusting headbands it's really not
my thing as the metal frame above the
headband can cause reverberations when
it gets in contact with anything and it
is very much noticeable with the Nouri
ultimate it's not a deal breaker but
it's something worth noting razer has
also implemented a few other cool
add-ons to this headset to make it a bit
more appealing so first up the ear cuffs
they feature cooling gel infused
cushions to reduce heat buildup over
intense gaming sessions so for instance
if you wear this headset first thing
during the day and if you plan on using
it for multiple hours you're gonna
notice that cooling factor for around 10
to 15 minutes around your ears and it's
actually pretty cool but as hours pass
by that's gonna fade out eventually
because heats obviously gonna start
building up and it doesn't stay
consistent but the good thing is that
the cooling gel cushions actually
absorbed the heat really well so I can
actually wear this for longer periods of
time at least during my period of
testing so that's pretty awesome it's
nowhere closer to the active
thermoelectric cooling solution that we
were able to test out with the HB
mindframe headset if you guys are
interested in checking that out I'll
leave a link right over here but that's
a
nothing's powered by USB and it's you
can adjust how active the cooling should
be through software which is again
pretty amazing cool tech next up is
flexibility and the Inari ultimate can
be comfortably placed around your neck
with the ear cuffs rotated 90 degrees so
you can easily maneuver your head around
if you're taking constant breaks here
and there which is pretty nice I should
also mention that this is a wireless
gaming headset and it communicates with
your PC via this included 2.4 gigahertz
USB receiver
kudos to razor for making it low-profile
unlike some other wireless headsets
we've taken a look at in the past plus
there's a built-in storage compartment
within the headset to safely store it
which is awesome now you can also use
the nari ultimate in Wired mode and that
can be done by connecting the included
3.5 mm audio cable to an Xbox one or ps4
controller or even your smartphone
provided that it has a headphone jack to
expand usability but I will mention that
haptic feedback does work in Wired mode
it's just that you have to make sure
that there's actual power on the headset
because that technology is powered by
the battery cells built inside the
headset so that's something to keep note
of if you run out of battery you're
definitely gonna miss haptics I should
also mention that when you're using the
Nouri ultimate in Wired mode it is going
to disable RGB lighting permanently
which is a good thing but do note that
you can't adjust the intensity of the
haptics in this mode since it requires
synapse 4 then however if you fine-tune
that in software and then switch the
wired mode the settings will carry along
automatically the included USB cable can
only be used to charge the headset and
while you can still use the headset
while charging the cable by itself is
not long enough so I had a tough time
routing it behind a PC or even you
aren't using my friend IO connector so
that was a little bit uncomfortable so
you have to make sure that you charge
the headset on a regular basis because
this cable is it's not long enough now
in terms of buttons on the left ear cup
there is a mic mute button also Game
Chad Balance dial that can either
increase the in-game volume and decrease
the voice chat or vice versa and I like
this inclusion then you have your power
button a microUSB port to charge that
had said I wished if it was type C but
that's just me there's also an analog
connector to use headset in Wired mode
switching over to the right ear cup
you'll notice the volume dial and do
note that it actually doesn't sync up
with the main
volley mixer on Windows 10 so what I
would recommend is max out the volume
within Windows and then use this dial to
adjust the volume on the headset and now
on to the microphone test and guys I'm
really impressed with the quality coming
out of the narrow Ultimates I mean I am
I system running in the background my
heaters turned on and it does a really
good job by starting that in fact I'm
typing on my mechanical keyboard
featuring romaji switches and as you can
hear it does a really good job isolating
that now I will mention that there is a
little bit digital compression taking
place with my voice so it doesn't sound
as boomy or there's a lack of bass with
my vocals so it doesn't sound full but
that's I guess the nature of all the
background noise compression that's
happening and this also Wireless so
that's another factor to consider the
microphone is non removable but it is
retractable so it goes back to the
headset and there's a little LED
indicator around the tip here so when
you mute the microphone when you
activate the mute button it turns red
which is a good visual indication as to
whether or not if you're you know you're
muted your conversation during a chat or
something like that but let me know in
the comments down below what do you guys
think about the quality is it impressive
for $200 all right so let's switch gears
and talk about the key selling feature
of the naari ultimate and that is razors
hyper sense technology so essentially
they've implemented two advanced LP
haptic drivers developed by Lowe felt
that converts sound signals into dynamic
touch sensory feedback in real-time in
other words you experience haptic
feedback on your face or vibrations if
you want to call it another way
depending on the type of content you're
consuming but it doesn't end there in
fact these drivers are fine-tuned to
cover a wider frequency range unlike
some other haptic drivers that just
cover a narrower range and on top of
that they provide a stereo feedback so
for instance if you're listening to a
music that's more guitar based as the
artist is strumming the strings you
physically feel the vibrations as he's
doing that and it's actually pretty
amazing there is one issue though if the
music you listen to has a large bass
track the haptic feedback will be pretty
constant for example with starboy from
the weekend the vibration didn't stop
through the whole song and it was kind
of annoying
however gaming on the other hand is a
whole other story the haptic feedback
really adds that extra layer of
immersion I tried a few titles like
battlefield
and overwatch and man when you're firing
gunshots or when you even hear
explosions the background the haptic
feedback feels powerful and in some
cases real on top of that it's balanced
on both your left and right channels as
well so if something blows up on the
left and if you shift towards that side
the feedback transitions easily onto
your right channel giving it a great
sense of positional awareness and those
haptic drivers are dynamic meaning if
something blows up farther away from you
it's not gonna sound as powerful or it's
gonna sound it's gonna be present but
it's gonna be a little less powerful
compared to when something blows up you
know a little bit further ahead of you
or something that's closer to you is now
on the downside this technology is more
dependent on the volume as well so if
you increase the volume it's gonna be
more powerful but as you decrease it
it's just gonna fade away very fast so
that's something to be noted now does
that mean that it's gonna take a hit on
sound quality it's really hard to
describe that especially when you're
gaming because for example in
battlefield 1 which a fast-paced game
everything just happened so fast so it's
really hard to break it down because you
have you know great audio quality but
also this haptics just sort of fuse
together giving you this really
interesting immersion effect and again
it sounds great but if I were to just
describe it from a sound signature
perspective just but especially when
listening to you know songs or anything
like that
these headphones are more bass heavy and
they don't necessarily crush the high
frequencies but the mids could do some
work because you know if Razer could
tune it a little bit to give it a little
more body to the sound that would have
been nice but overall they sound pretty
good it's not like revolutionary or
anything like that but again I think the
main star of the show with an Ori
ultimate is the hyper sense technology
moving on to battery life and I'm gonna
say it's decent so with the haptics and
RGB lighting turned on expect up to 8
hours of battery life but with those 2
disabled you can get a little bit over
20 hours which is still a little bit on
the lower side so you have to make sure
that you plug it in every night so that
you can use it the next day I did wish
if Razer included some sort of wireless
charging method especially if they
integrated you know Qi charging it would
have been nice to sort of place it on a
base station or something like that
oops I just hit the keyboard and the
last thing to cover here is Razer
synapse off
we're all at all it's a pretty good
experience with controls for things like
3d spatial audio and all the other
features you'd expect another nice
addition is the ability to control the
haptic feedback intensity which I ended
up setting to 60% in games and 20% for
music setting it to 100% at times did
feel a little bit too powerful but I'm
glad that it's at least customizable the
lighting tab allows you to adjust the
brightness of the LED and of course
cycles between three different effects
like static breathing and spectrum
cycling I still don't understand why RGB
lighting should exist on a headset but
it is there if you need it and it is
nice and subtle the output is diffuse
evenly and when you turn it off it
doesn't really show that there are LED
lit in the first place so that's pretty
cool the one thing I feel that was
missing is a battery percentage to read
out since the small icon just isn't good
enough to tell exactly how much is
remaining and so guys this brings us to
the conclusion and the nori Ultimates by
Razer is certainly an interesting
product for 2018 because for one the
main key selling feature of this headset
is razor hyper since technology that
actually gives you a dynamic real-time
haptic feedback when you're gaming and
it's just awesome it's it doesn't feel
you know as consistent it's actually
responds to different frequency ranges
within a gameplay and you really have to
feel it for yourself in person for other
content consuming stuff like listening
to music it's it again depends on the
type of genre you're listening to in
some cases it gets a little annoying in
some cases it's actually pretty good but
I really have to get props to Razer for
actually trying out something new or you
know trying something different with
their gaming headset and I should
mention that Razer isn't the first brand
to implement this sort of technology on
a headset we've seen other brand startup
implement this on other gaming
peripherals and you know the community
has received it had they have received
an interesting feedback in the community
so there is a price to pay for this
headset $200 is a lot it's it's it hurts
but if you're looking for something with
a little bit more immersion that will
give you that that extra oomph when it
comes to gaming then sure the Nuria
Ultimates is certainly worth trying out
provided that you're okay with
sacrificing some of
the corks that I mentioned earlier in
the review so that's it for me thank you
so much for watching let me know what
you guys think about the nari Ultimates
would you actually consider spending
$200 for a headset that gives you a
real-time haptic feedback if so I'd love
to know your thoughts in the comments
I'm you birth hundred connects thank you
