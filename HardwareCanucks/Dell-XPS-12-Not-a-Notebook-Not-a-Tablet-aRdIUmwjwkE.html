great technology selection and service
what's up guys Eber here with hard rock
UNIX and Dells XPS line of notebooks
have always been known to combine
excellent quality good performance and
high-end looks into a compact design
this is Dells flagship line of notebooks
and they have refreshed it with newer
models like the XPS 12 XPS 13 and XPS 15
the XPS 13 and XPS 15 have received
countless positive reviews but I wanted
to shift gears today to a different
product and that is the XPS 12 unlike
the other notebooks in the lineup the
XPS 12 is a true tune one laptop that
can be easily converted into a tablet
there are two main setup options the one
we are reviewing today starts at one
thousand dollar price point and includes
a dual core core m6 Wi-Fi for processor
with a base clock of 1.1 gigahertz that
can turbo boost up to 2.7 gigahertz
eight gigabytes of RAM a beautiful 1080p
IPS screen and 128 gigabytes of SSD with
Windows 10 installed for $300 more you
can upgrade this configuration to a 4k
IPS screen and a larger 256 gigabyte SSD
I wish that the 256 gigabyte was offered
as a baseline configuration and
unfortunately there is no way to upgrade
the paltry eight gigabyte of system
memory twenty-five percent of which gets
eaten up by Windows alone the
competition in the two-in-one space is
getting fierce right now we have the
surface pro 4 and the lenovo yoga series
that can be considered as primary
alternatives while Apple's MacBook could
also be considered if convertibles isn't
your thing so is the XPS 12 worth
checking out well we're going to find
out the XPS 12 design is pretty
straightforward its screen is detachable
to become a relatively large tablet and
it sits within a slot on the keyboard
for a secured notebook peel all the
components like the battery processor
memory the i/o ports are housed within
the tablets chassis the keyboard
trackpad combo is simply an accessory
that needs to be activated by the
tablets interface and power meanwhile
the keyboard has an incorporated fabric
cover and not only does it protects the
XPS 12 against scratches but it also
acts as a hinge mechanism when
opening and closing the notebook it also
works relatively well but there are some
major shortfalls which I'll go over in a
bit despite the fact that Dell uses a
combination of a magnesium alloy unibody
construction with soft touch finish
alongside edge to edge Gorilla Glass the
build quality of the XPS 12 is really
mixed bag on our sample the top-left
corner between the screen and the
chassis kept popping out this could be
caused due to a weak at visa between the
chassis and the display or just poor
fitment I also found that the rubberized
SD card slot cover tended to pop out and
ended up looking pretty cheap after a
few weeks of use luckily the power
adapter is pretty slim you can easily
carry it in your bag plus the device
charges via USB see Dells included
detachable keyboard on the other hand is
outstandingly well built the solid
chassis is rock-solid with no signs of
flex and typing on it was by far the
best experience I've had in a while
there is a little bit of travel distance
and actuations provide excellent
feedback it's also backlit which is good
for low-light situations the touchpad
was also excellent the surface is so
smooth for your fingers to travel
because the primary left and right click
buttons are seamlessly integrated
towards the bottom like the keyboard it
produces a nice tactile feedback it does
require some pressure to press but I
love using the tap gestures thanks to
Windows 10 the XPS 12 IPS display comes
with a 1920 by 1080 resolution but it is
just too dim to use in bright areas even
though color reproduction was spot-on
viewing angles are good and contrast
ratio was more than a capable the real
problem here is the display is highly
reflective and even if you turn up the
brightness to 100% the amount of glare
makes using it outside or public
transport nearly impossible I wish they
adopted the same anti-glare coating from
the surface pro 3 or 4 it's just the
industry standard in my eyes Dells 12
inch 2 and 1 is also not that bad for
consuming content I spent a few weeks
watching youtube videos in HD not 4k due
to the processing power limitation of
the Core M chip as for the i/o you'll
find a headphone jack
two USB ports a micro SD card reader
covered with a flap and volume adjust
buttons the problem here is the absolute
lack of back
compatible USB 3.0 ports or display
outputs plugging in an external hard
drive flash drive or even an external
display to the XPS 12 requires to use of
a yet to be released adapter that gets
connected to one of the two u.s. PC
ports I mentioned previously Dells
adapter looks sleek in design and it
comes with an HDMI port VGA port on one
side and standard Gigabit Ethernet and a
USB 3.0 port it's cost a hundred bucks
and it doesn't even fit with the XPS 12
design it just sort of hangs there like
an overripe fruit Adele should have
included this with the XPS 12 otherwise
how else are we supposed to connect our
peripherals even the active pen has yet
to be released
seriously Dell what were you thinking
about this all the items that are meant
to allow this two and one to compete
against the likes of the Microsoft
Surface are still not launched I had
some concerns regarding the headphone
jack - Dells built-in amplifier doesn't
do quite the right job to produce audio
that well with music often sounding
muddy the unit comes with Dell smart
audio enable that completely puts you in
this space where music becomes echoey
and turning the feature off makes it
sound a little better but not perfect
fun fact it's actually worse than my
iPod touch I actually had Dmitry try it
out so let's hear what he has to say so
there's definitely a noticeable quality
difference when using you know using the
stock audio versus when you use dil
audio Mac's audio Pro turning the Mac's
audio Pro on it in the largest the
soundstage a little bit there's a few
presets you can adjust but man it
destroys the entire base balance it
becomes very distorted you know just
things become mush and very and in the
high ranges just become you know treble
is very harsh you can obviously adjust
up but just turning it off cleans out
much of that I think the headphone jack
isn't as powerful as it should be it's
not as pronounced even its default state
like you know if you listen to like an
iPod you know this is not the iPod
quality
and how much is this thing fifty hundred
bucks I don't know if you're looking to
listen to audio on this thing it'll pass
but he won't be blown away okay back to
the review I had mixed feelings using
the XPS 12 boat as a tablet and as a
laptop I'll start with the tablet mode
first of all Windows 10 finds it
difficult to communicate with the unit
itself I've experienced touch issues
often sometimes when I plug in the
headphones the device doesn't recognize
the headphones and they have to be
plugged in numerous times before Windows
allows for switching between them and
the integrated speakers Windows 10 isn't
exactly as touch friendly as it should
be either while huge steps have been
taken when compared to Windows 8.1 the
interface just feels clunky and
half-baked and this isn't Dells fault
but it doesn't detract from the XPS 12
tablet experience dell also offers
another accessory called the dell active
pen think of this as a surface pro combo
except you have to pay an extra $70 for
it the pen comes with two types of
batteries one for the stylus pen itself
and the other for the bluetooth module
when you paired it up via bluetooth it
does its thing you can certainly take
notes with it in class but I found a
Windows logo button at the bottom to be
annoying it tended to get activated by
my hand as I was jotting down notes palm
rejection works okay but the takeaway
from this is that it's not even close to
what you would expect from a surface pro
for using the XPS 12 as a laptop still
gave me some issues to to join the
screen to the keyboard module its power
interface has to precisely align with
the eight electrical pins within the
channel built along keyboards top edge
they are not magnetized which means you
cannot carry the tablet or the keyboard
in one hand you also have to be careful
when placing the tablet on the keyboard
since almost 50% of the time I miss the
pins and the keyboard couldn't be
recognized actually getting them aligned
required a bit of adjustment taking a
few seconds to slide the tablet through
the rail until you hear the click it
became extremely annoying the screen
itself can only be oriented in one angle
which is disappointing because you lose
the ability to maneuver with different
angles to compensate for screen glare it
kind of loses the point of being a
laptop
and paying $1,000 for a tune one device
becomes questionable another major
concern I had was the ability to wake
the device from sleep sometimes the
power button responded with just a press
to put the computer to sleep but other
times it was hard for me to actually
wake up the system as it either stopped
responding or I had to force shut down
the system which would potentially lose
data again this comes around to the
point where I talked about how Windows
doesn't communicate that well with the
XPS 12 performance was okay in my
opinion but don't expect miracles from
the dual core Core M processor it's a
far cry from the core i5 options
available in some competitors you can
get the day-to-day tasks done pretty
well but certainly not gaming or video
editing I also found myself having
issues with Wi-Fi connectivity it just
randomly stops working when web browsing
and I had to restart the computer to
make it properly function I'm not sure
if this is a Wi-Fi card issue but
perhaps Dell could fix this with a
future update the battery life was
certainly not the best either and I was
expecting a lot more from that efficient
Core M chip I was only able to get 5 to
6 hours of use with casual web browsing
and script writing when a consuming
content expect around 3 to 4 hours at
most with screen at 75% brightness and I
should also note that when you use the
XPS 12 in tablet mode I also encountered
overheating issues when watching videos
while the unit was charging so I would
recommend using the XPS 12 in laptop
mode during battery charges the XPS 12
feels like a rushed product from Dell
one that was pushed out of the door in
an effort to compete against the surface
yoga and other similar devices the build
is not the best I wished it came with a
quad HD configuration for the price the
volume adjust buttons and the power
button gives you a mushy feel when
pressing and sometimes you might even
have to use your nail to turn on the
device palm rejection while riding with
the active pen was not the best as the
windows logo button got in the way the
Wi-Fi performance was not the best
either as I faced disconnecting issues
and the Wi-Fi adapter not responding
until rebuilt the keyboard on the other
hand was excellent the keys had one of
the best tactile responses but the
trackpad was definitely a pleasure to
use updates may fix some of these issues
in time but for now there are a few
Stoppers here that can't be overlooked I
think the problem here is that I just
can't wrap my head around the pricing of
the XPS 12 based on what you get there
are just far too many compromises here
but there are also quite a few things
that Dell can build upon to create an
amazing product in a future
unfortunately paying 1k for Windows
machine does mean that you are entering
into a premium category and a field Dell
could have improved the XPS 12 to
usability and build quality granted from
a specification perspective it does have
a leg up on the surface pro 4 which
costs significantly more when equipped
with its type cover so Dell certainly
has the value quotient on their side
well that concludes our review of the
Dell XPS 12 2 in 1 laptop be sure to let
