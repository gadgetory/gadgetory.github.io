rather extended absence were thrilled to
bring you yet another Hardware Canucks
product showcase this time we brought
the soon-to-be-released
Coolermaster half nine two to the half
nine to two is the little sibling to the
wildly popular half nine three two it
takes the same foundation that makes the
half nine three to one of the most
popular cases on the market and shrinks
it down into a form factor that suits a
more modest computing environment the
half nine to two is scheduled to be
released in early May for under $130 and
holds a lot of promise cooler master is
toting the nine to two as having all the
benefits of its Big Brother in terms of
design functionality and cooling just in
a smaller and more cost-effective
package so let's take a look and let you
be the judge
the original name for the nine to two
was actually the half mini but a quick
look at the dimensions and you'll see
why it was changed nine to two is 10
inches wide
nineteen point seven inches tall twenty
two point two inches in the length in
comparison the original half nine three
two was nine inches wide 21.5 inches
tall and twenty two point seven inches
in length not much of a difference
looking now at the exterior the front
panel is designed with airflow in mind
it features a large 200 millimeter red
LED fan at the front and full mesh slot
covers all of the face the front face
mold is constructed of plastic but it is
thick and rigid and is not likely to be
damaged moving to the top and front
ports we have the typical 2 USB 1 eSATA
and audio connectors as well as on/off
reset an activity LEDs there is however
one really cool addition the button to
the far left is an LED on/off for the
front 200 millimeter fan a small
addition that is incredibly convenient
also on the top is another 200
millimeter exhaust fan however it is not
LED lit the side panels are simple and
Coolermaster is done away with the
window
however the outside panel does still
have a large grate for an optional 200
millimeter fan to attach to moving to
the back we have the bottom mounted
power supply design and there are seven
expansion Bay's as well as a really cool
unique feature that honestly we haven't
seen anywhere else to the right of the
expansion bays is an 8 slot that runs
vertically this is designed for those
fan controllers or other devices that
often take up valuable real estate on
your back panel it moves it to a more
convenient location that is easily
accessible and isn't hidden by wires or
other things we also have holes for
water cooling tubes up at the top of the
chassis which is the perfect position
for external radiators which we'll take
a look at later we move next to the
interior of the case and while it is
relatively simple in design compared to
many cases Coolermaster has included a
lot of small features that really set it
apart in the long run the case is
constructed out of a lightweight steel
and while it is rather thin it is not
the typical budget grade that is known
to destroy fingers and be easily damaged
as with many of its cases Peugeot master
has included a completely screwless
design for all of the drive bays the
case supports six hard drives all using
their simple yet easy and effective rack
system the hard drives fit into the
plastic tray and are held in by metal
pins and then slid and locked into
position there are also six five and a
quarter inch optical drive bays and
support for optional three and a half
inch bays with the included drive
adapter rails the ROM bays are also
screwless and only require opening the
outside panel you merely slide the drive
in through the front and when in
position for
the lock to securely hold the drive into
place it really could not be simpler
moving to the motherboard trait we see
coolermaster has invested a lot of time
into the development of a practically
perfect layout they've included the
rarely seen CPU backplate opening as
well as other strategically placed
openings around the tray installation of
the components could not be easier and
yes the power supply is upside down the
additional expansion cards are held in
by thumb screws making change is simple
and screwless ROM Bay's make
installation of components very quick
work the real beauty of this case is in
the wiring was such a simple yet well
plan layout building for unobstructed
air flow could not be easier
safe to say even the most inept Gabler's
could keep the internals clean and
ventilated
rotating to the back we see the
motherboard tray and drive bays are
inset to allow plenty of room for wiring
there are also numerous notches along
the typical wiring paths for when to use
zap straps or whatever else the half
nine to two is a pretty cool case that
is to say the airflow design dissipates
large amounts of heat quickly while not
being overly noisy or obnoxious the
included 200 millimeter fans spin at a
leisurely 700 rpm air is drawn in
through the front over the components
and then ventilated out the back through
the top back or side a quick look at the
radiator placement for a water cooling
loop the rad can either be mounted at
the top externally which allows you to
keep the 200 millimeter top fan attached
or internally without the fan if you
want a cleaner look so all in all the
half 9 to 2 is an excellent chassis it
takes the solid foundation of the
previous generation the e half 9-3 tube
and improves on it making it one of the
better mid tower cases on the market
cooler master has not left anything out
with this overhaul the 92 2 is well laid
out with a unique and appealing design
and arguably perfect usability Deere
flow is simple yet effective and there
is plenty of space inside to fill it up
with just about anything we hope you
