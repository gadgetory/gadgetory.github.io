more received since its release in
September 2014 since it sports a solid
sensor distinctive design and extensive
software customization however it seems
course I felt the need to refresh this
mouse with the Corsair m65 pro so what
is Corsair change to give this mouse the
pro insignia and is it enough to justify
an upgrade available for $59.99 the m65
pro keeps a similar price point to its
predecessor the original m65 RGB while
still targeting the high-end mouse
market the mouse is specifically
targeted at FPS gamers boasting
excellent precision and features the
geared towards fast-paced first-person
shooters let's examine the body design
of the mouse the m65 pro has a very
distinctive design with angular cutouts
at the back and the curved side grooves
to support your thumb and pinky the
design is almost identical to its
predecessor with identical button layout
and overall design but there are a few
subtle changes that's not a bad thing
the m60 5s design was already well liked
and it continues to be great here during
my experience using the mouse I found it
to be very comfortable I did find the
back edges to be a little too angular
but I got used to them pretty quickly
the build quality is top-notch too with
Corsair toting an aircraft grade
aluminium unibody design which is
honestly rock-solid the m65 RGB already
had an aluminium unibody design but it
seems that Corsair feels that the build
is even tougher here as that's one of
the selling points of the m65 pro if you
flip the mouse over to the bottom you'll
see the aluminium construction continues
and incorporates three distinctive
weights the stock weight for the mouse
is 115 grams which might be a little on
the heavy side for some people although
it's understandable considering the
aluminium build for those who find it
too light however you have 36.8 5 gram
weights for a total of twenty point five
grams of weight adjustability which is
really nice
you can also adjust the balance of the
mouse by offsetting weight on one side
but even more customization also on the
bottom of five PTFE feet which glide
pretty smoothly although I did find that
one was scraping a little bit on the
mouse mat at first but that went away
with time now let's switch it back to
the top and do a button check the
primary left and right buttons use Omron
switches which I have great tactile
feedback and here's what they sound like
I found these to be some of the most
enjoyable primary clicks I've used
they're very controlled and have a
distinct and satisfying actuation around
the DPI toggles also have a very
distinct actuation as does the scroll
wheel this wheel is one of my favorites
since it has very satisfying scroll
steps with heaps of control so you won't
accidentally over or under scroll
in-game the only downside is that it
takes a little bit too much force to
engage the middle click but otherwise I
have no complaints here moving on to the
side buttons and the first thing you'll
notice is that they're very thin and
quite small which can make them a little
hard to press
but like the top ones they also have
great responsiveness and tend to be
placed well for any number of hand sizes
there's also a sniper button which sits
on the right thumb and it requires
enough force to actuate that it won't be
pressed accidentally once again it feels
almost perfect now so far the build
quality seems pretty top notch it's
comfortable and the buttons are close to
perfect which is shaping the m65 pro to
be a very compelling Mouse however the
m65 RGB also had all of these elements
so whereas the m65 pro changed the
sensor is where the upgrade has come in
the previous m65 used an 8200 dpi
vulgare a dns a 9800 laser sensor and
while it was a very good unit and had
pretty positive reception caalso is up
the game introducing a 12,000 dpi
optical sensor the picsArt pmw 33 6 x
this is a variation of the exceedingly
popular picks up pmw 33 66 which has
been known as one of the best sensors on
the market the difference between the 33
66 and the 33 6x appears to be mainly in
feature set with a 33 6 X having a
higher 12000 dpi and features like
surface calibration something which
we'll look at in the software later this
Center largely speaks for itself and
really doesn't need much testing but for
the sake of thoroughness we'll go
through the tests the first thing to
check is prediction line skipping and
any other issues as expected to 33 6 X
has no issues here and performed well
acceleration and the acceleration is
extremely difficult to test accurately
by hand but I found no issues as
expected
testing flicks in csgo and there's no
issues present it handles these quick
motions precisely and accurately and
doesn't lose tracking at any point in
game I found the accuracy is top-notch
with the M 65 for being enjoyable to use
with the sensor highlighting how
accurate it really is I do have to
question if the outer dpi up to 12,000
is really needed though in game I use
400 dpi and even on my desktop with dual
1440p displays I can easily get away
with 1600 to 3200 dpi and I can't really
see anyone needing that ridiculously
high of a dpi for the few people who use
that sensitivity this Mouse might be
appealing but I can't say that the DPI
race makes any sense to me
except for marketing the last thing to
look at is the Corsair queue software
this is the software Corsair uses for
all their RGB peripherals and it's
probably one of the most feature-rich
on the market right now the first tab
has your profiles where you can
configure all the settings and create
profiles to store everything as well as
options to assign them to games there's
also button assignments where all the
buttons can be rebound or have macros
and actions assigned to them which is
great for customization you can either
create your own actions or import them
and in the actions tab there's a full
list of every available action which can
be sorted by name or type moving on to
the lighting tab and you have two zones
to customize the main course our logo
and under glow as well as a scroll wheel
light there's a quartet of profiles
rainbow solid color color shift and
color pulse you can also import profiles
view all your settings in the lighting
tab and if compatible Corsair
peripherals are detected sync up colors
with them as well the lighting looks
great and the RGB functionality will be
nice to have for some users the next tab
is performance and dpi where the DPI
profiles can be set you can also assign
colors for each profile which will show
on the DPI toggle so you can get an idea
of what setting you're on something
which is really useful meanwhile if you
set it to black the LED will turn off
completely these profiles will also be
stored in the mouse's memory so if you
don't have the software on whatever
computer you can still use your free
customized profiles I do wish you could
choose to have the DPI toggle go on
rainbow breathing mode but it's not a
big complaint courser also includes
pointer speed and ankle snapping
settings as well as lift off distance
control I would have liked to see more
detail than just low medium and
I so that those who lift their mouse a
lock would have full control but at
least it has something the last area is
the device tab where we can choose to
disable the lighting configure the
polling rate up to a thousand Hertz and
implement a firmware update this is also
where surface calibration is housed the
surface calibration is something which
is quite interesting you can use it to
calibrate the sensor for your mouse
surface in order to get the best
performance from the m65 Pro and that's
a really cool feature to include so with
all the nitty-gritty details done and
dusted it's time to sum things up as I
alluded to in the start there are two
types of people wanting to buy this
mouse those who are upgrading from an M
65 or M 65 RGB and those who are looking
to buy a new Mouse is it worth the
upgrade from the M 65 RGB probably not
unless you really need that improved
sensor and extra dpi you're not going to
be getting much out of the upgrade if
you're coming from the original M 65 and
really want that RGB lighting improved
sensor and slight redesigns
it might be worth it but many people
they'll be more than happy with the
original M 65 and if you're looking for
a new Mouse if you want to save some
cash and can give up the RGB lighting
then the original M 65 is a steal
considering it keeps most of what's
loved about this mouse with a much lower
price however it's probably worth the
extra five dollars or so to go from the
M 65 RGB to the pro and get that
improved sensor and slightly better
build the M 65 Pro really doesn't bring
that much new to the table but you can't
really blame it course I knew they
didn't need to completely overhaul
something that was already so good the M
65 RGB was already a great Mouse and the
pro makes it even better bringing that
picks up pmw 33 6 X sensor and improved
build quality for those who like the
design of the M 65 / it's one of the
best FPS mice on the market and it's
well deserving of the hardware canucks
