which I'm seeing right over there and
they're releasing some really exciting
gaming stuff so let's go check it out
but first a message from our sponsor
thanks to faintest Coolermaster and
Corsair for making this trip possible
alright so I'm a huge fan of San
Heiser's gaming lineup and while we're
all drooling about their new HD 820
enthusiast headphone I couldn't help but
get more excited about something more
affordable and relevant for gamers so
here we have the new GSP 600 clothes
design headset I love their approach to
gaming audio with emphasis on great
sound with character without losing
definition and you guys may know the GSP
300 is my current favorite $99 gaming
pair so the 600 design wise follows in
the same footsteps with tall and deep
ear cushions that are a mix between
leather and suede for best isolation
possible while addressing the heat
isolation with this combination of
materials so you get the best isolation
without the sweat the looks may not be
for everyone as the headset is quite
chunky but it's super flexible without
creaking plus additional metal pivot
points around the ear cups conform to
different head shapes also they've added
these sliders above the headband to
control the tightness and pressure
around your ears with several stages of
adjustment for the best fit possible
this is necessary because the headset is
quite large so if you'd want to tighten
the headband for smaller heads you can
do that or you can open it up if it's
too tight
the orange accents are a new color for
some hyzer but they add this unique
metallic definition to the headset and
the volume wheel has nice rotation
density and the mic is muted in the
upright position I have a staple for Sam
Heiser but we are told that has been
improved and potentially will set a new
standard for noise cancellation and
clarity in the microphone Department the
cables are removable that split into
standard 3.5 millimeter jacks and this
is a stereo headset without any surround
sound gimmicks just the way I like it
and the $249 price point is
understandable seeing this is their new
flagship in the gaming series it will
ship and February and right now you get
a free headphone stand with your
pre-order I'll leave a link down below
now we are hoping in
open-back version will come out soon for
those who need that ambient awareness
within the large soundstage and I
personally prefer open style headphones
for gaming so I can hear my own voice
during chat and I also want to give
attention to the super hyped HD 820
headphone that is their first
closed-back premium pair that looks
amazing in this black aluminum and glass
structure the gorilla glass on the sides
is convex and actually helps to reflect
sound waves for a more spacious sound
despite this being a closed back pair
plus it looks absolutely gorgeous the
drivers are the same as on the HD 800 s
that is absolutely incredible and for
all these son Heiser fans the HD 820 was
actually designed by the same guy who
designed the original HD 800 needless to
say this is the new flagship an audio
that are handmade in Germany and are
actually more comfortable than my HD 800
pair thanks to the thick padding that
has incredible passive isolation with
down the heat concentration in this
direction into a closed back design is
super interesting to showcase their
innovation with regards to the iconic
sound signature with all the details
you'd expect in this giant silent
signature but still having a closed back
design and from what I've heard is
definitely an experience even on a loud
show floor especially when combined with
the proper amplifier and so the HD 820
will be available in the summer for
2,400 big ones you can pre-order it now
and let us know if you are actually
interested in seeing more audio coverage
from us in the year stay tuned for our
full reviews of the GSP 6 under it
coming very soon and subscribe for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
