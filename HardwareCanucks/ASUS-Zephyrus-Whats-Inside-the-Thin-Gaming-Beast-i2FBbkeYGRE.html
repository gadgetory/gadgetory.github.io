guys good job hello everyone I'm Dimitri
and the asus of ciphers gaming notebook
at Computex received so much incredible
attention because of a thin profile I
measured my finger and it just this then
as a notebook at 18 millimeters but it's
not only about the senders of the
notebook because gtx 980 has been placed
inside how do they do that in such a
thin profile so there's one keyword
that's been sort of circling around this
incredible machine and that is nvidia
max q design so what is it here it is
explained coolermaster master keys
keyboard line-up is now available and
three sizes to fit within your space
with large medium and small boards with
either beautiful RGB or pure white LED
illumination a little something for
everyone make it yours with the master
keys probe by Coolermaster so to me
Nvidia max screw design is one most
exciting developments for gaming
notebooks in 2017 because it
acknowledges its slight performance
compromise the sake of a lighter of a
more power efficient quieter any thinner
gaming notebook and obviously that's
awesome so the actual max Q term is
derived from the aerospace industry at
which the aerodynamic pressure on a
vehicle like a rocket or an aircraft is
at its maximum so the max Q point
represents the toughest conditions
something can withstand so how does it
apply to the PC notebook space well for
the GPU horsepower try to pack as much
things as possible in a notebook you
have space heat acoustic and electrical
constraints for example gtx 980 is a 181
GPU so how do you pack that into a
gaming notebook that can only supply 90
watts of power due to thermal and
electrical constraints so max Q design
is both a hardware and a software
optimization that find a peak efficiency
point between performance and power is
their relationship is nonlinear for
example by reducing the power of gtx 980
by 40% so from 150 watts to 90 watts we
only lose around 10% performance and
this is done through custom clock curves
type voltage bands and basically
throttling GPU to maintain a certain
power limits certain temperature limit
and certain
acoustic limit as well and this is
important because until now for the thin
light profile gaming notebooks we only
have the razor blade which has a GTX 960
and maintains that 18 is non-uniform
factor but now with max Q design we have
gtx 1070 and a 1080 being rolled out for
the same form factor and that's pretty
awesome
now the GPUs remain the same only the
PCB has been redesigned and obviously
all the driver and software
optimizations go through GeForce
experience and so across the board these
GPUs will consume less power and operate
at their peak efficiencies and custom
clocks and voltages as a reasonable
compromise of performance of around 10%
but of course we'll have to wait and see
that for ourselves
now what about acoustics and this is
really cool because max Q design
notebooks will have a target of acoustic
level at load of 40 DBA and that's like
let's not even audible our resistance
that's like library sounds that's pretty
good my office is around like 34 36 DBA
I'm pointing it at the window where I'm
looking at so no book would be a little
bit louder than what I'm getting from my
completely isolated window that's pretty
good and so specific core clocks and
voltages will kick in to make sure the
notebook stays quiet at blows and that's
awesome because it's coming a long way
my MacBook is incredibly loud once
trying to render something Ebers razor
blade is even louder and if you've heard
that thing it's just like a jet engine
so we've come a long way to make sure
that acoustics are actually under
control without too much of the
compromise on performance
plus a new whisper mode is introduced
that will further reduce the acoustic
level from 40 DBA upload to the 32 DBA
this is only possible with a notebook is
plugged in and this basically they
change the settings to the game so the
stress on the GPU is not as high and
they also frame capped the game so if
you're doing FPS 60 would be fine if
you're doing something slower paced if
they would set up to 40 and this is
something that determined by Nvidia as
your playable settings basically
throttling the GPU so it doesn't consume
as much and allowing these fans to slow
down but if you want the full
performance mode without the acoustic
management all Macs keynote books was
happy
performance mode that basically unlocks
everything that GPU has to offer and
that's nice so performance wise it looks
promising
max you design brings those GTX 280s to
a very slim profile but as we send out
those machines I think the battery life
will be impacted the most and we also
don't know about the temperatures at
least we have that target for the
acoustic levels so the fans won't be
spinning to like 100% both to maintain
those things cool but I guess it will
vary from one machine to another but
still temperatures and the battery life
will have to be determined we still
don't have any information on the lower
tier 10 series card so like 10 50 and a
1050 Ti but it would be so cool to have
those GPUs which are still very powerful
in the notebook sphere to be included in
like very thin ultra books like the XPS
15 or the spectre x360 imagine that's
such a slim profile and still have a lot
of GPU horsepower for perhaps editing
and gaming and that's it about max Q
design I don't even want to speculate
about the prices because as with any
notebook improvements in the GPU space
everything carries a chunky price
premium but make sure to subscribe to be
notified when those machines are finally
in-house so we can do our full suite of
testing I'm three tree with our Canucks
thanks for watching we'll see you next
