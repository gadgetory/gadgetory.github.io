a soos a giant thunderstorm took over
Taipei the rain was a rampage the taxi
driver actually offered us an umbrella
six times because nothing extreme which
slows down to see the ROG lineup of
motherboards let's talk about what we
saw after this our complex trip is
brought to you by fan tech schoolmaster
and MSI so in many ways the X 299 nine
words can be considered an evolution
upwards from the current x99 platform so
rather than needing add-on controllers
for features like high-speed nvme PCI
SSDs and you've got two connectors these
all come baked in natively and Intel
opting will be there to the sky like X
processors feature up to 44 pcie 3.0
lanes from the CPU itself not to mention
a ton of additional functionality from
the chipset and those 44 lanes
don't provide enough bandwidth for the
rumored triple 16x layouts some we're
hoping for but it does allow for 32
lanes to be used for graphics cards
while the additional lanes can be split
off for a single x8 GPU slot or for
length 4 attached PCIe storage devices
and one interesting addition to this
lineup is intel's vrock technology so
when used with an optional asus atom
card it allows for stupidly quick raid
arrays with m dot 2 SSDs and we can't
wait to try this thing out so let's
start with a flagship Rainford 6 extreme
now this one is one absolutely stunning
board for gamers and other enthusiasts
who have liquid cooling systems
basically this is the flagship Asus x99
gaming board and it has every possible
feature that means triple GPU support
even though aim D and NVIDIA are moving
towards primarily dual GPU setups
there's the front panel USB 3.1 gen2
header additional PCIe slots plenty of
other connectivity and the design we've
all come to know from the ROG boards the
Wi-Fi chip is an interesting addition
while most other motherboards either
don't have wireless connectivity at all
or use the fast AC standard
asus has equipped with new rampage
boards with the wireless ad this is next
generation standard that promises speeds
of up to four point six gigabits per
second this motherboard also has dual
flow headers for water cooling that lets
you monitor cooling speed and
temperatures flow data and potential
leakage points
formation can be monitored through these
sensors placed throughout the custom
water blocks and unlike many other x2 99
motherboards the rampant six extreme has
triple integrated ember two slots that
can be used for great arrays instead of
the optional video ah Christ card and -
and the two drives are populated in the
demo two slots beside the memory modules
and one super unique feature the rampage
brings to the market is called the live
- OLED and it lets your monitor system
temperatures frequencies and fan speeds
right on the motherboard in real time
and it's located on the bottom portion
of the rear i/o housing which is on the
best location for display for example
other ASUS motherboards that they've
launched have the OLED screen front and
center below the CPU socket that is much
more visible the dashboard will allow
custom display messages and graphics
also and we'll just add a little extra
flair to your build and it really is
amazing but I think it will appeal more
to people who run an open build since it
will likely be hard to see if the board
is installed inside the case especially
in that position but the lighting is for
sure next level with slightly
transparent armor all over that gives
that needed color ambience plus the full
LED strip on the right side that will
look absolutely stunning with
reflections inside the case but what
happens if you don't want to spend all
that fortune on the rampage six extreme
or you're not going to into extreme
overclocking with Asus apex series well
that's where this tricks X $2.99 e gets
flavored into the equation so this looks
like a great board with standard ATX
dimensions a monochromatic color scheme
and a few LEDs for that touch of
additional color in particular very
distinct ROG depth logo in the center
that to me does not really look that
good but color wise it is fully
controllable via the Asus or a sync
application and while the Strix is a lot
more basic than the other models they're
launching it still comes with dual end
up two slots for nvme SSDs with
integrated heat sinks for optimal
temperatures on board Wi-Fi and USB 3.1
gen2 connectors for the front and back
panels and honestly what all of this it
is kind of hard to understand why
someone would need to spend so much more
on the rampage or the apex but one cool
touch on the back are these continued
white stripes to keep up with the color
transition on both sides and so that's
it for the ROG boards the eight
board that is designated for
overclocking will also be available
it just wasn't finalized and that's not
really shown during the show so what do
you guys think about the X 299 so far
from a soos or any of these boards worth
your money is there something you would
like to see let us know in the comments
below thanks so much for watching don't
