but what's more exciting in you ITX case
from fantex
the shift and the shift X are here this
is the shift X ok let's roll the HR
invest in stores that makes a difference
choose toshiba rd 400 and DME SSDs that
are incredibly fast and reliable
backed by advanced warranty programs so
you can focus on what matters
Rd 400 check it out from the description
below
fans of all shift and the shift X have a
very unique take on an Ikea system that
allows you to vertically display the
case on your desk or laid horizontally
for an htpc type of situation for your
living room in this video we'll only be
taking a look at the shift and the shift
X will have to be another time because I
want to build in both and see how they
differ so yeah why are they still inside
the case
all right so priced at 110 dollars the
evolved shift is one of the more premium
ITX cases but for a good reason as the
name suggests it's meant to blend in or
shift with any environment
thanks to looking pretty from pretty
much any angle I personally love the
towering character especially because
the footprint is the length of a GTX 970
while not being much wider this means to
shift is perfectly capable of living on
your desk as long as you're fine with
the height which is about the same
height as my evolve ATX but of course it
is much thinner I do appreciate how
cohesive the design language is for the
entire vulva up not only because of the
sandblasted aluminum but the similar
ventilation ports of the front or the
similar bends around the frame now there
is some resemblance for the Corsair one
but you cannot bind that separately so
if you've been wanting that experience
I've been really pushing for more
vertical cases and the IKEA space now
the shift is the perfect alternative in
terms of the i/o it's on the left side
at the back with only two USB 3 ports so
there are no audio jacks in here to keep
things clean although a hidden headphone
jack somewhere here would have been
sweet in terms of the horizontal
orientation it's possible thanks to the
symmetrical look at the top and the
bottom you have to remove the case feet
at the bottom first which have two
mounting positions if you want the very
thin profile you can move them in a
little bit which have less stability but
for horizontal orientation you need to
apply the soft paths that feel ok but
almost like an afterthought they're only
a one-time use and have no real
protection for the glass the glass panel
is perfectly complement the visual
appeal of the ship from all those sides
but of course it is see-through so you
just got to be careful with cable
management then end caps appear on the
exterior of the glass behind which
mounting brackets are installed and you
can access all four side panels through
the top with adjacent sides using the
same tooling and that's actually
minimizing the cost of the shift and
each panel is attached with two cups of
thumb screws at the top and with all
them being hidden it allows the exterior
to look super clean the top panel sits
on this pushpin so it's easy to access
your eye oh and we have the power and
RGB cycle button at the top here as well
send power LED or the optional LED
strips that you can connect the top as
well the user manual that comes with the
evolve shift is the best I've ever come
across on the TC case and I didn't
review the cases for how long
usually they're like black and white
very bad resolution everything here is
color-coded very nice resolution it's
clearly laid out in terms of the
assembly process what parts you need to
remove and compatibility for other
hardware water cooling everything
absolutely everything that you need is
in here so if you're just getting into
this ITX space and want to get yourself
familiar with the shift or the shift X
this is your friend for dust filtration
the top panel is covered so nothing
percolates through the bottom panel has
a filter for the intake fan and both the
front and back panels have side filters
that are removable for cleaning which
are super fine and the front panel also
has that middle divider to separate
airflow between the bottom and the top
chambers so what they've been able to
achieve from the interior is pretty
unique simply taking advantage of that
vertical state and and minimizing the
compromises that you would otherwise get
with such a tiny compact footprint so
the GPU has been moved to the back using
this riser card and because of this
vertical space you can mount anything up
to 350 millimeters in length as long as
it's a dual slot GPU but the air cooling
for the CPU is not really recommended
simply because there's not that much
clearance between the side panel and the
motherboard area so I was going to use
this shadow rock LP be quiet cooler but
it simply sticks out when I mount it and
just not compatible so really you want
to be using a 120 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooler for your CPU which will
mount it either at the bottom or the
front and the unique thing about the
scale encoder is it can house to 120
number radiators so if you want to cool
your CPU and a GPU with dual radiators
that's a possibility and for storage I
mean it's a very compact space but you
can still mount the dualist as these
over here and on the front here I've
mounted a three-and-a-half in the drive
but also if you really Kate one of the
caddies SSD caddy to the front that's a
possibility the ones good thing about
having a three and a half inch drive at
the back of the case is it's further
away from you so if it's making any
noise you know it won't be as
honorable is if it was for example at
the front or something like that but
also it's not very comfortable to mount
because you have to actually school
things from the inside which is not easy
to access but as far as cable management
goes it's a very well aligned to the
cutouts and you can pass that and pass
all the cyber cables and everything like
that just fine for this giant as far as
the power supply goes as to facts or XFX
l unit are supported and the mount here
with intake over there so this area is
really there to accommodate those dual
120 million years if you decide to go
that route who has been a long day there
were a few hiccups along the way first
of all thread was nowhere to be found
boom but the second hiccup came during
my assembly process with a power supply
mount where the plastic housing around
the power button interfered with the
metal frame so I could not align the
mounting holes so I had to turn the
power supply around so the fan was in
taking air from the interior and not
from the exterior but Fantas confirms
compatibility with all SFX and SFX out
power supplies from corsair Silverstone
and Lindley it's just that odd the thing
happening with the housing around the
power button on my non-modular
SFX power supply from silverstone and
after my conversation with appendix they
will actually thin out that metal piece
in the middle to accommodate for this
particular power supply maybe others
that have that similar bulky thing
around the power button so yeah so
moving along I really like the GPU
bracket on the other side that you can
slide to support the taller GPUs and
also makes a cable installation easier
and actually installation of the actual
GPU easier as well you just have to keep
in mind the power supply height and the
height of your bottom radiator if it's
there I have the blower style GPU facing
the interior for better air flow this is
what fantex recommends but the bracket
can also be flipped if you're inclined
to show off your graphics card for cable
magic we have this middle channel with a
magnetic door that hides a bunch of
cables and these dual rubber grommets
underneath to pass things from the
bottom chamber I think it's an OK design
I just wish that we could secure the
flappy door somehow to allow thicker
concentration without this opening
because of all the cables sticking out
now important thing to remember that
you're in
moment of an ITX experience is derived
not only from a case which can be
user-friendly all you want but if your
hardware is not compatible to suit that
ITX direction then your experience will
suffer and I just realized how poor the
layout of my motherboard is for cable
routing not sure why I've been using
this motherboard for years now I wish
that the RAM slots were swapped without
cable area so the cables are not
crossing over the motherboard and this
happens every single time I use an ITX
case and I couldn't even reach the USB 3
cable I had to leave it out now because
the motherboard is facing up getting
your i/o connected requires a little bit
extra care on how you handle that cable
exit especially since they are coming
from the top
I wish fantex would have included some
sort of clips that you can attach the
back of the case so that's one cables
exit they follow a certain structure and
not just spewed out of the case
all right so upon further inspection
instead of routing all the cables to the
top like I just showed you guys which
doesn't look that great you can instead
route them through the bottom where the
power supply cable sits and that's
because there are two velcro straps that
are one above the SSD one below and
there I thought they're just used for
the drives but of course they can be
used to secure your i/o cables coming
from the top all the way to the bottom
so with an SSD
everything fits no problem of course if
you have a three and a half inch drive
that would leave a little bit less room
so maybe like a mouse cable would be
maybe wrap around but just yeah this
makes the system a lot cleaner when
things are just coming from the bottom
and not from the top so I have a mouse
keyboard power cable and an HDMI cable
for the graphics card all connected and
everything is very well hidden and looks
so much better so yeah very nice fantex
thought of this routing situation oh hey
there NCIX calm is Canada's leading a
tailor for anything your mind desires
just keep within those categories which
are plenty and get tempted by the weekly
deals visit ncx com for all them sweet
deals the summer is here oh and so my
experience with fantex of all ship ends
here I realize that I need a new ITX
motherboard that has an upgraded layout
I need a modular power supply so I could
clean some of those cables up because
everything is see-through so you have to
be mindful on how you clean all this
cables up so what do you guys think of
this towering form factor for the ITX
direction I'm excited to see a lot of
mods and see what type of water cooling
things people can come up with in this
form factor especially because it
occupies so little footprint on your
desk it's a very appealing enclosure to
complement your workspace so I hope you
