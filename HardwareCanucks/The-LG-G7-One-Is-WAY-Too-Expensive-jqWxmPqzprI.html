get ready what's up everyone
Eber here with hardware connects and I
just want to make this quick video
regarding the LG G seven one now if you
recall I did take a look at this device
a few weeks ago and I had a lot of great
things talk about the smart phone
particularly the design it's a subtle
shift from the g7 thank you but I really
liked the Satan black finish on the rear
side of the phone you aren't missing on
a few key features for example you don't
get the wide-angle camera you also don't
get wireless charging and a few other
things but I mean when you look from an
overall perspective I think it looks
very similar to the g7 the best of all
is actually a software that's running on
a smart phone so Google so LG actually
did partner up with Google to enlist the
G son one under their Android one
program so it is running a clean stock
version of Android which I really
appreciate in fact it's probably one of
the first reasons or one of the reasons
why I really wanted to recommend this
device until I started taking a look at
the pricing here in Canada the whole
situation is a complete mess so I want
to talk about that alright so let's get
to the bread-and-butter this video and
that is pricing for the G sound one so I
live here in Toronto Ontario Canada and
my primary cell phone carrier is Fido so
I was just curious enough to test or
just check out the pricing for the GCM
one-off contract and I was just trying
to pick the jaws off my floor here so
off contract this thing costs $7.99 with
Fido and $8.99
with bail which is also another carrier
and I'm just trying to process that over
my head just because if you look at the
conversion rates 899 Canadian is roughly
six hundred and eighty six hundred and
eighty five dollars let's just say seven
hundred dollars with all the included
with all the taxes and all that kind of
stuff that's a complete ripoff I mean if
you look at the whole market situation
right now at smartphones there are so
much better options in the market so for
example one of the things that this pops
into my head isn't recently-announced
one plus sixty that costs 549 USD that's
a lot cheaper than the Jesus and one if
you just do the conversion rates now
when you analyze it from a specs
perspective the oneplus sixty comes to
the latest processor so in this case
snapdragon 845 it's got
six gigs of RAM as the base start model
and it comes with 120 gigabytes at 5:49
which is insane when you compare that to
something like the g7 that offers a
slightly older CPU like the Snapdragon
835 and you know 32 gigs of storage with
four gigs of RAM it really questions
these insane markups with these Canadian
carriers you also have other great
options like the Nokia 7.1 that costs
around three hundred and fifty dollars
u.s. and a whole lot more because you
know these phones are all targeted
towards the Android one program and
Google initially started this program to
sort of create this mid-range smartphone
category without really compromising on
a lot of Android or I guess the features
that the Android operating system offers
and I was really expecting the g7 one to
be priced around you know four hundred
to four hundred fifty dollars u.s. but
when I look to the Canadian pricing it
just I can't believe it I just can't
believe it now interestingly enough the
g7 one is expected to launch in India
for around 30 thousand rupees and when
you do the math it's roughly equivalent
to five hundred and forty Canadian
dollars or if you do the math - if you
do the conversion to American it's gonna
be a lot less so this tells us something
here the communication between LG and
the majority of the Canadian you know
service providers is a little bit
complicated or I think the whole
communication is a little messed up I
think they're trying to rip off their
customers can eating customers to be
more specific and I'm not exactly sure
if this is going to follow along when
the phone eventually launches in the
United States or other countries around
the world specifically in the Europe so
I'm concerned I'm angry I'm lost I don't
at this point I really can't recommend
the jisun one to anyone out there
because as I mentioned earlier there are
far better options for a lot less and I
just yeah so that about wraps up this
rant video I hope you guys enjoyed and
let me know what you guys think about
the whole pricing situation in Canada
specifically if you're a Canadian
follower I want to hear your thoughts on
this whole pricing situation with the
gcn one what do you guys think about it
