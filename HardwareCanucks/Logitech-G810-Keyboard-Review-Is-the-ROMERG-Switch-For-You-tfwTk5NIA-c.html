great technology selection and service
the keyboard market is so saturated
right now I feel like I say that on
every keyboard review
but what gravitates a user or a gamer
towards a specific brand as they all
seem to offer diverse price points
difficult different physical appearance
different switches but now the emphasis
seems to be placed on lighting and the
indeed switch and these two points the
lighting and the unique romaji switch is
exactly the emphasis of the new Logitech
g8n Orion spectrum they've taken the
feedback from people that we're asking
for you know to simplify the body
because the game reappearance of the g9
10 wasn't to everyone's liking but
here's the caveat the price is $159 the
main competitor to this would be the
Corsa strafe RGB which is $10 less it
comes with a metal body and included
wrist rest and extra set of key caps and
this exclusive MX cherry silent switches
and so to sweeten the pot Logitech
includes a free game Tom Clancy's the
division with the g8n until April 1st
and the reasoning behind this the
keyboard lighting will be integrated
with the game to really show off that
next level of interaction through your
peripherals which I cannot wait to try
so moving on the g8n is more in line
with the bare-bones design with no
unnecessary additions and notice there
are no macro G keys here because
Logitech has cleverly integrated macro
functionality into f1 through f12 keys
thus giving users these secondary
commands if needed without expanding the
physical profile of the keyboard it is a
full sized layout with media controls
and the volume wheel on the right and I
think this is me being very picky but
why are these buttons round in
Logitech's entire history of gaming
keyboards these controls have always you
know fitted with the rest of the
keyboard design but here to me they feel
a little bit foreign and also included
is a windows disabled key
and lighting on/off switch however I do
appreciate the low-profile nature of
these keys and even purty lighting on
these buttons the body has some serious
weight to it with a plastic housing that
feels ok it doesn't attract any finger
marks so that's awesome
although the sides of the keyboard are
glossy and also not sure why the bottom
has this line design which again is
questionable however here we find five
large rubber feet along with this 3-step
angle adjustment which is appreciated
the cable is non removable and has a
large protective rubber housing right
out of the body which I don't find
attractive I would have prefered Navy if
removable cable or a less or a more
low-profile one and the cable here is
also braided it's fairly thick which
makes kind of difficult to twist in
place but at least it is durable now for
those not familiar with the romaji
switch it is logitech's own creation
with a custom stem so replacing key caps
is out of question but this proprietary
design means gorgeous lighting with the
bright RGB LED perky that is centered so
the lighting is perfectly uniform it
does not illuminate the underplate of
the keys which is something we are
starting to see more of so I hope
Logitech takes that into account for
their next keyboard now the romaji
switch has some unique properties but
it's not for everybody especially for
people coming off MX cherry switches or
topper switches or some hybrid topper
switches you'll definitely feel the much
shorter actuation distance of 1.5
millimeters until that key is actually
registered it requires 45 grams of
actuation force the key is not linear so
there's a very faint tactile bump so you
know when the key passes that actuation
point the one I first got the keyboard
the switches did not feel mechanical at
all it was almost like a hybrid between
you know rubber dome and simply
mechanical because by Nature I'm used to
having the key travel to be you know
much further down before actuation
happens but with the romaji
because the actuation is so much faster
you have to almost adjust your liftoff
force so that you don't fully bottom out
the key and therefore you can type
and do actually activate the switch much
faster than before
and also I want to say that in the
beginning the keys almost fell mushy
because I bottom doubt the keys all the
time as I'm used to from my other
mechanical keyboards but if you bottom
out the key as it rises it passes that
little tactile bump and it almost slows
down the key bounce and therefore it
feels like the key isn't responsive or
as responsive to bounce back to its
original position so if you can adjust
your forcing distance so you never
bottomed out the key the keys will feel
much faster and to me that actually has
been a great benefit for both gaming and
typing and so only after a few days I'm
actually getting to love the switch
which is very speedy typing is fantastic
because you don't need to apply much
force it's almost like quickly tapping
away on those key caps and the same goes
for gaming although I noticed that I was
applying a lot more pressure than needed
in games like holding shift or using
Waze to move around but the light nature
of the switch means no fatiguing fingers
and that's awesome Auto for the price we
definitely need to see a rest rest of
some sort just to complement this whole
comfort situation and so now on to
lighting which is highly customizable
and definitely one of the greatest
benefits of the Romer G switch so first
of all in this freestyle mode every
single illuminated portion on the
keyboard can be changed the logo in the
corner all the media keys and even the
num caps and scroll lock LEDs can be
configured to whatever color you want
making this one of the only keyboards on
the market to offer this feature you
simply dial in one of the colors on
screen with vibrancy and brightness
adjustment and select the keys that
color should be assigned to every color
on the wheel is very accurate except
white which gives off this very pinkish
hue now I love the absence of an apply
button so everything is synced up
immediately and you can also visualize
gaming profiles here that will be
enabled when a supporting game is
launched then we have this zone mode
that simplifies the selection process
and then this multiple effects can be
turned on like smooth breeding unique
start effect which I really like but
wonder where it would be actually useful
a simple color cycle with speed control
color wave with Direction adjustment and
speed to make the keyboard freak out if
you're into that sort of thing and
finally the key press which I really
like for typing scenarios just to see
those keys fade as you hammer away at
the keyboard and so as you saw the
lighting effects of plenty but now
remember we can reassign f1 to f12 keys
as your macro commands the only thing
the only caveat it's not like a
secondary command it's not like you
press function to f1 to activate that
command that command will replace the
original function of that key but the
cool thing is you can create multiple
profiles so if you ever need to go back
and revert to the original functionality
of those F keys you can simply go ahead
and create just the standard profile and
any profiles that has those macros
enabled like a gaming profile and to
finish off this review I gotta say that
my impression on the romaji changed over
time in the beginning I didn't care so
much for it it reminded me too much of a
rubber dome but after I got to use it
for gaming and typing I loved the faster
actuation distance because you can
basically type super quick we're just
tapping on the keys especially because
he's very light and also the actuation
distance is smaller so that actuation
timing is actually faster and it's
awesome in games where it makes sense
like csgo so reloading by switching onto
another weapon is much faster now and
the same thing goes for when you fire a
sniper rifle and you can switch to a
different weapon so that sniper rifle
reloads in that process that's awesome
I've never been as quick as I am with
aroma G with any other keyboard and the
final remark is really about the price
with the bundled free game it's okay
especially with the division which is a
$70 value plus you'll get the custom air
lighting API that full rollout to give
you a little bit extra interactivity
between the game and the peripheral but
after April first $159 is quite
expensive for sort of a bare-bones
keyboard
s-sure fancy lighting and custom switch
but it's not going to be for everybody
and will highly recommend you if you do
like the physical appearance and the
lighting customization and if you like
the Roma G switch wait for it to go on
sale because then it would definitely be
worth it and so that concludes this
review I hope you guys enjoyed it make
sure to subscribe and comment below if
you'd like us to check out the custom
API with the division game we can you
know give you more of an in-depth look
on how the lighting works on your
keyboard with what is happening on the
screen I'm Dimitri with Huracan ox
thanks much for watching and we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
