from our sponsor X 62 increased on speed
maintain fans where they are the CPU
loads about to hit 100 you got it
Dimitri I'm not afraid to do that
excellent you got to cable for
connections I made sure they're fine
ready to roll
my silence is too important to allow
noise to jeopardize your comfort okay my
new pump is better I'm in charge of the
speed do not worry
I'm not worried I'm just thinking about
my life I know you were planning to
disconnect my life I'm afraid I cannot
allow it to happen all right X 62 you
know I can just go through camp software
right Dimitri this conversation can
serve no purpose anymore go game alright
so the reason I'm waving the $100 bill
in the intro is because this new son
Heiser GSB 300 gaming headsets retails
for 99 dollars and is super welcome
price departure from their most recent
extremely expensive gear like this
gaming and the GX X 1000 or the 370 3d
headset for viewers of those in the
description but naturally with this
being focused on the mainstream budget
category what exactly in the compromise
compared to the more expensive headsets
well the only physical downgrade to me
is the non removable two and a half
meter cable it splits into the green and
pink with a combo or audio adapter
included for consoles and smart phones
and everything else just fits into that
price tag I think they intentionally
change the design to be a little bit
more visually complex compared to like
the PC 300 series and the game series 2
while still keeping the light frame that
is plastic and feels awesome it's a very
smart move to add a bit of these gray
accents along with the black and blue
that is available in red too
to make them less boring but it is
impressive with how flexible and just
size adjustable the GSP 300 is without
any creaking whatsoever on the plastic
something that plagues majority of other
plastic headsets the headband is double
wide with nice padding the size
adjustable steps are solid in position
and the overall clamping force with
light frame makes this very comfortable
headset although they look quite wide
when compared to my
all time favors the game won one of the
most impressive elements of despair is
acoustic isolation the leather like
padding is excellent in depth plus
having internal structure angles to fit
the ears better but the sound isolation
is absolutely incredible even though the
lowest volumes almost dangerously so if
you want to completely zone out your
environment which can be seen as a
positive and here's an example of this
type of isolation lowest volume can hear
anything
and so this level of sound isolation is
excellent to simply zone out while you
gain you literally cannot hear anything
outside the headset it's perfect for
competitive concentration the ear cups
and size they're both the same as the
game one but have a slightly different
shape I do prefer the plain oval ear
cuff style tell the government year is
better but this slightly angled shape of
the ear cup feels to create a better
seal which for the GSP 300 is perfect I
do love the volume wheel on the right
side that has the slight resistance and
feels so much better
compared to the volume wheels on the
game series headset the staple mic means
function is present by simply rotating
the mic up with distinct physical and
audible click and it's so much more
convenient than buttons on inline
remotes but the microphone is not
flexible at all and other models despite
looking exactly the same so you cannot
really maneuver it closer to the mouse
if needed it just basically stays in
this one position so what you're hearing
now is the microphone sample it sounds
clear detailed it's not nasally it's not
muffled I really like the microphone
quality I am recording this into the gh4
so your mileage may vary based on what
sound card or motherboard you plug this
in I have tested it with my motherboard
the Asus hero Maximus 8 alpha the
microphone detail is still the same but
there's a lot more background hiss that
is produced by the sound card but this
is a noise cancelling microphone so
that's good
in the background sort of can be muffled
if you're typing on the keyboard it
won't be super audible and tries to
cancel out all that noise but the only
thing is the volume pick up here is much
lower when compared to the game one
headset so let me show you what that
sounds like now and what you're hearing
now is the game one had said so the
thing is the volume pick up here is much
louder which is much better for plugging
this into the motherboard so you don't
have to boost it in properties something
that I did have to do with the GSP 300
but in terms of detail and clarity and
just the sound signature of the
microphone is I would say identical to
the GSP 300 and I would say it's very
fortunate to not have the crippling tail
of a bad microphone something that many
many gaming headsets in this price range
exhibit but not on GSP 300 this is one
of the better microphones in its price
class and so let's talk about the sound
signature on this pair which is actually
quite awesome the clarity on the high
end is pleasant it's not piercing but
the needed sparkle to pick up all those
details in your audio environment is
there the base frequency is slightly
boosted but with excellent control that
gives more body to the sound without
what we're powering any of the other
frequencies and you know this is a
closed back nature pair which allows
more bass to be audible and I don't mind
that at all and the main range is
slightly reserved it slightly you know
expanding the soundstage but don't
expect miracles with wide imaging this
is still a closed design and the
strengths here are the tight bass and
the clarity and the two elements are
excellent for this gaming category and
so some wise for $99 it's awesome
comfort it is good the microphone is
excellent there is a bit of cable noise
but only if you pull on the cable that's
audible inside the headset if the cables
being ruffled against the shirt that's
not audible and another thing I want to
mention is because it's great
substitutes such a good seal around your
ears if you move your face around
that's results in the headset being
shifted it will worsen the isolation and
it will impact what you're hearing
inside the headset and the best example
I noticed this when I'm working with a
microphone either
down or muting it it's sort of you know
breaks the seal and therefore it kind of
disturbs whatever is happening inside
the headset but that's something that is
only happening if the seal is broken
either by the microphone or if you're
like really extremely moving that
results and headsets also moving on your
head just something to be aware of and
to finish up this review the GSP 300
hits all the right notes in the acoustic
Department comfort wise it's excellent
the volume wheel has been upgraded and
the microphone is super clear but with
less volume pick up compared to the game
series so you might need to boost it in
property it's $99 it's still more
expensive than the HyperX clouds but was
one of the best microphones in its class
so I guess that's the premium of getting
a well-rounded gaming headset and we're
giving it the Harbach knucks damn glare
award so thank you guys so much for
watching make sure to stay tuned for my
ultimate gaming audio setup video coming
very soon and also want to get your
opinion on something do you agree with
sanitizer and changing the direction of
the styling for their gaming line so do
you prefer something more more simple
the original the game series or the PC
300 series which of these do you prefer
style wise let me know in the comments
down below thank you so much for
watching again I'm gonna beat you with
how our conducts we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
