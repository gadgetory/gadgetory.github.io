Hardwick and X and guess what
it's second-generation risin performance
review day yeah I'm not sure if that
sounded right but regardless I'll be
walking you through my experience
testing out the new risin seven 2700 X
CPU and of course I'll be sharing my
performance results compared to my 1700
X sitting right behind me my workstation
PC because you know and perhaps come to
a conclusion as to whether or not if
it's actually worth upgrading because
the specs on the 2700 X are pretty good
I mean it's not significantly better
than its predecessor but it's still
worth finding out especially if you're
an existing rise in a system owner and
if you're you know rocking one of these
are not this but the 1700 X CPU I'll
also be talking about my overclocking
experience with this new processor and
of course talk about the new
architecture and the new platform which
is X 470 so let's dive in right after
this are you ready okay watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P measured by
Coolermaster check it out in the
description below alright so before we
move on to the performance results I
wanted to briefly talk about the news n+
architecture and what AMD has done to
improve the performance of these new
second-generation Rison CPUs first and
foremost these processors are based off
a new 12 nanometer process but they've
only done a few optimizations to improve
Layton sees so don't confuse Zen plus
with Zen - that's not the case here what
they've done here is increased the IPC
by roughly 3% improved l3 cache latency
by 16% and better memory latency by 11%
so these new Rison CPUs won't have a
problem supporting faster memory speeds
Zen plus also brings a few more
improvements like top clock speeds have
been lifted by 250 megahertz so
theoretically you won't have a problem
achieving 4.35 gigahertz on your best
core and all core over clocks round out
to about four point two gigahertz and
we'll get to the results later on AMD
has also managed to lower power
consumption by 11% when compared to last
generation processors at the same clock
speed this could potentially give us a
more thermal Headroom for overclocking
as well which is nice they've also made
some enhancements with precision boost -
and xfr - or in other words extended
frequency range - let's start with
precision boost so expect substantial
clock speed increases in multi-threaded
workloads again with the new tall
nanometers n+ technology these
processors can achieve higher
frequencies with the same power
consumption compared to 1st gen Rison so
essentially expect turbo clocks reaching
as far as 4.3 gigahertz and stock
settings XF r2 has now been applied to
all cores on these new CPUs so now the
algorithms can automatically detect it
there's thermal Headroom and we'll apply
the frequency boost automatically on all
course provided you have adequate
cooling in the first place let's take
the 2,700 X for instance AMD has
included this rate prison cooler that
features an RGB ring and RGB fan and an
RGB logo complete RGB over here plus it
features direct contact heat pipes and
overall it looks like a beefier out of
the
schooling solution when compared to
Intel's offerings speaking of Intel if
you decide to become an 8700 K right now
you won't find a cooler included which
is something to note especially since
you're paying $50 more than the 2700 X
yet you're only getting six cores and
twelve threads I do plan on putting the
2700 X to the 8700 K to see how had how
well they do head to head so stay tuned
for our full performance analysis video
later on you know that that just had to
happen anyways so there's the new wraith
prism cooler that comes out of the box
with the new risin 720 700 X CPU that's
directly from AMD and it comes with two
LED zones so you have this ring that
goes around the fan and of course the
LED fan by itself and you can control
this either through
MSI's mystic light software which is you
know this motherboard or you can use
cases or the only thing is that you can
control these zones through those
protocols you'll have to obviously use
in these dedicated software which
interestingly enough is a partnership
with Coolermaster so that's pretty
interesting and as you can see it gives
full control of the cooler you can
adjust the lighting through this
software I'll leave a link to the
download page for this software in the
description down below just in case and
by the way I had to contact an AMD PR
rep to figure out how to control the
lighting zones through for the Wraiths
prism cooler because out of the box
aimed he doesn't give you any proper
instructions so all you get is obviously
the Box the cooler the cables the CPU
and this manual sheet which or this
instruction sheet and and it doesn't
give you proper instructions as to where
to find the software link or where
you're supposed to go and download it
from it is frustrating I wish they
included that in the instruction sheet
but at least now you know where where
you can go find it so you're welcome
alright so let's switch gears and
discuss a little bit about X 470 this
isn't a major upgrade over the X 370
platform to be honest because the only
difference is an improved power
infrastructure for achieving higher
clock speeds with these new processors
and the introduction of store mi
technology it's basically a storage
software that fuses two or more storage
devices so in this case it could be your
SSD and hard drive plus ram into a
virtual disk so the operating system
reads it as a single Drive this is
compatible with nvme SATA and 3d
crosspoint drives and it can be
installed and reversed at any time
provided you have backed up your data
beforehand store mi is an enhanced
algorithm that learns your computing
habits and it moves frequently accessed
blocks in this case applications and
files between the array
giving users a speedy experience I still
have to play around with this program to
give you guys my full verdict on this
because AMD is still finalizing on the
software which should be available by
the time this video goes live so that
would be a cool investigation video for
another time to quickly go over the test
bench setup over here I have the Rison
720 700 X setting on an MSI gaming m7x
470 motherboard I'm also using 16
gigabytes of G skills Sniper X memory
it's a 16 gigabyte ddr4 kid it's a
weighted speed as 3400 megahertz which
is kind of crazy and interestingly
enough I was able to boot the 2700 X at
that speed which is great unfortunately
the 1700 X can only go as far as 3200
megahertz so for the stock to start
comparison what I'll be doing is using
exact same memory kit at the same space
so 32 hundred megahertz on the 2700 X
and the 1700 X and to even make things
even fair to avoid as much as variables
as possible I will be swapping out these
1700 X CPU from my editing PC onto this
motherboard so that we have pretty much
identical hardware and do more of an
apples-to-apples comparison as for a
cooling solution I will be testing the
2700 X initially with stock settings
we're using the stock cooler that they
provided and of course I'll be running
on my benchmarks and if you know
overclocking capabilities if I'm not
successful with the stock cooler but I
will be doing is I will be taking out
the D 15 cooler from my editing
workstation PC and I'll be installing it
on this test bench over here to see how
far it can push the overclock and so now
it's about time to overclock this CPU so
I'm gonna be using the stock cooler just
to see how far I can push the overclock
because hey they've included a cooler in
the box so it's good to see or good to
know we're good to find out how far can
you actually push the clock speed on the
2700 X so I'll be using AMD's new risin
master version 1.3 software and named
a few tweaks here so first and foremost
they've given us this gold star per
course so this is basically your best
core that you can work around with
especially if you're planning on just
overclocking it if you're planning on
doing a single core overclock this is
something that will help you identify
which one of the cores is the best in
this case it's this one over here and
I've learned from AMD that during the
production process AMD preloads that map
to the CPU and therefore when you launch
the advisor master software it'll show
up right away which as to which one of
these cores are your first batch first
big and then moving on you have your
silver star here which is your second
best core and the rest and this little
silver silver dots over here so yeah I'm
gonna be playing around with Rison
master software to see how if I can push
this overclock should be pretty
straightforward I'm hoping I can achieve
four point two to four point three
gigahertz we'll find out so yeah let's
do this
okay so I've been spending about an hour
trying to play around with the overclock
with a stock cooler and I was
unfortunately not lucky enough to get a
solid stable result I first tried 4.2
gigahertz at one point four to five
volts and luckily enough Cinebench ran
successfully
I got a score of 1881 I believe which
was impressive but I did run the Ida 64
fpou stress test and the system almost
crashed halfway through so that wasn't
stable
I did try multiple configurations 4.1
4.1 to 5 I play around with a voltage
and this was all to rise in master
software it's actually a fairly it's
fairly straightforward but I was
unfortunately unlucky and I did try
playing around with the BIOS as well to
see if I can maybe fit along with some
settings so the SOC voltage and just see
if the BIOS would help but that didn't
work out that great so what I'm gonna do
is swap the stock lower for a beefier
heatsink like the Noctua D 15s I'm gonna
run these tests again I'm pretty sure I
should be able to get a stable overclock
because it's a beef your heatsink it can
pretty much handle anything you throw at
it which is great so yeah let's do that
so this is one of the downsides to a PGA
socket it's not as secure as what Intel
offers so you know when you decide to
pull an air core off your motherboard
there's a very good chance that the CPU
can just come with it so just make sure
if you don't find that CPU in there yeah
it's definitely over here
that's definitely
all right so I've successfully
overclocked V 2700 x2 4.2 gigahertz with
a core voltage of 1 point 4 to 5 volts
and I'm running the Adobe premier test
as the encoded test I'm running in 4k 12
minute project GHI footage by the way so
it's really stressing the CPU as you can
see the core clock speeds are at 4.2
gigahertz so after a successful 4.2
gigahertz overclock on the 2700 X I ran
some synthetic real-world and some
gaming tests on this processor compared
to stock settings and of course throwing
in the 1700 X as well so here are the
numbers starting with Cinebench r15
running the CPU test lead 2700 x at
stock settings with the stock cooler by
the way scored a little over 1,800
points that's 20% more performance
compared to these 17 hex at stock
settings the 4.2 kicker's overclocked on
the 2700 x with the memory speed bumped
up to 30 400 megahertz
give us a score of 1886 so it's pretty
darn impressive if you ask me switching
to OpenGL and we see that the lower
clock speeds on these 1,700 X becoming a
bottleneck at stock settings I got
around a little over 100 frames per
second compared to 118 frames per second
on the 2700 X at stock this is all
thanks to xf r 2 being applied on all 8
cores along with the faster IPC
overclocking the 2700 x2 4.2 gigahertz
give us a hundred 24 frames per second
blender running the BMW scene took 5
minutes and 10 seconds to complete on
the 1700 X compared to 4 minutes and 26
seconds on the 2700 X so it's roughly
16% faster
overclocking the 2700 x2 4.2 gigahertz
saves a little bit of time as well not
by that much but at least it's something
same story goes for 3dmax Corona the
2700 X takes the lead here once again at
stock settings completing the render 18
seconds faster than the 1700 X the 4.2
gigahertz OC shaves a little bit of time
but once again not too significant
povery really didn't show that much of
an improvement with the 2700 X as a
results compared to the OC setting and
the 1700 X and stock are barely
noticeable
moving on to some real-world tests I
take a one-minute 4k timeline exported
it to YouTube 4k preset using Adobe
Media encoder and as you can see there
isn't a significant difference between
these 1700 X and it's 2700 X at its OC
saying we're talking maybe six second
difference between the three but
rendering a 12-minute project using the
same 4k precent shows a little bit of
improvement the 1700 exit stock
completes that task by around 22 minutes
compared to 19 minutes and 34 seconds on
the 2700 X the 4.2 gigahertz overclock
definitely shaved off a few minutes
which is pretty nice but realistically
speaking it's all about the experience
editing a video and personally I did
notice a huge difference in that regard
which is a little disappointing okay so
moving on to some gaming benchmarks and
I hate to spoil it right now but
honestly don't expect better frame rates
with this new processor sure you'll get
slightly better 3dmark scores like what
you see here with time spy and fire
strike but throughout my testing period
I didn't notice a significant increase
in frame rates at least through my naked
eye take Battlefield one for instance
set two 1440p Ultra settings we see five
percent increase compared to the 1700 X
I'd like to reiterate that memory speeds
were sent to 3200 megahertz just to give
an apples to apples comparison overwatch
at 1440p set to epic yielded roughly the
same frame rates on both the 1700 X and
the 2700 x so nothing spectacular here
dumat 1440p set to ultra using the
Vulcan API
once again yields us same results on
both CPUs and in this case around 177
frames per second with 8 gtx 980ti
lastly we have Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
at 1440p set to very high this setting
taxes out on the GPU but I noticed a 3%
increase in frame rates compared to
these 1700 X so those results really do
speak for themselves guys and personally
speaking I didn't notice a huge
difference between the 1700 X and 2700 X
just in gaming performance by itself but
when you are thinking about synthetic
workloads like slave Cinebench or
blender you could notice a slight
improvement in rendering times when you
decide to have weight to the 2700 X but
in all honesty as I mentioned earlier
it's all about the experience what's it
like when you're actually working within
that program or you experiencing any
slowdowns
and I personally have noticed a
significant difference so that is a
little bit disappointing now would I
recommend the CPU to anyone who is
looking into building themselves and if
you were looking for if you're looking
to build a workstation PC would I
recommend the CPU absolutely because for
$329 you're getting an 8 core CPU with
16 threads this thing can overclock to
4.2 gigahertz provided you have you know
any i/o solution or an aftermarket like
something like the T 15 it just worked
right away and the results are fantastic
you can get great rendering performance
out of a 329 CPU much better than what
Intel's offering but if you want an
existing Rison system owners say for
example you're only 1700 XA if you're
thinking about upgrading to rise in two
or second generation rising CPUs
I hate to say this but I don't think
you're gonna notice a significant
increase in performance it's just not
worth your money so that about wraps up
this brief comparison between these 1700
X and B 2700 X I'd love to hear your
thoughts on this new processor what do
you guys think about it are you
impressed with the performance just not
from gaming perspective but more from a
synthetic workload perspective are you
surprised by the Cinebench scores and
the adobe premiere performance let me
know the comments down below
