award-winning fantex our trusted memory
partner Corsair and NCIX halo around
Dmitri with Haruka dachshund welcome to
our CES 2015 coverage here today we are
at Kingston and hyperx behind me is a
pretty sweet system built inside the
England s frame it's one solid piece of
aluminum that's been shaped up and but
we're not here to talk about that we're
here to talk about this little guy or
this many guys so this is kingston
hyperx predator ddr4 this is world's
first 64 gigabyte kit 64 gigabytes of
ddr4 running natively at XMP profiles of
3000 megahertz speed 3000 megahertz is
insanely fast and we are told that they
are the first in the world to actually
release a 64 gigabyte kids so kudos to
hyperx very cool dims all black and very
nice heatsink and we got the that X on
the front there very cool this is a very
sexy system there you got 64 gigabytes
in ddr4 I don't know what else to say
okay so another thing that Kingston or
hyper x is releasing new this year is
the HyperX cloud to now we've reviewed
the cloud one originally and we loved it
it's a very nice construction it's
co-developed with q pads so they
certainly know what they're doing it's a
very popular headset and the cloud
hyperx has been receiving a lot of
praise from the gaming community based
on its comfort that's very well built
and it's got a great microphone you know
it's very light it's got great
isolations got so many additional
accessories that come with it so you can
actually replace the leather pads with
pleather pads and Orville or pads
actually and all this stuff but so the
cloud 2 is a little bit different
because they're adding now a USB dongle
now you guys know how I feel about USB
dongles and you know the common
perception with USB audio is that it's
usually poor but I mean they're running
a demo here as you can see there they
have some music we also listen to some
gameplay and some there's some
interesting things here so this is
there's a built-in DAC there's still do
audio converter audio comes through the
USB
the audio is being converted through the
DAC inside this little machine well the
body here and there's plenty of control
so you can adjust your volume for the
headphone and microphone which is great
and you can also enable 7.1 surround
sound now 7.1 surround sound usually for
me isn't you know my topic the type of
sounding experience that I do for gaming
as I like to play with open style
headphones but they actually manage to
do it very well is it doesn't open the
sound stage too much so you don't lose
the detail but the sound stage does
enlarge a little bit you get also a
better sense of the direction of if
something is coming exactly right behind
you here so you do get that very good
7.1 surround sound which I'm very
impressed with and so also another thing
is that it will come in two colors as
you can see we have the the red and the
grey and it will be released at $99
price tag so all the original
accessories as they cloud one but the
cloud two will be priced the same way as
before now included with this USB dongle
so outside the cloud to Kingston and
hyperx also announced some pretty decent
drives the first was the savage line of
SSDs in the past Kingston has gone to
help with this sandforce controller but
this time around they've chosen the fisa
s10 controller that seems to be very
common among new SSD releases at CES the
net result is the best speeds produced
for hyperx out of a SATA SSD when they
reported 560 reads and 540 rights
however the big story was the MDOT to
prairie the drive the trend to use PCI
Express bandwidth has continued here the
predator will come in a few different
flavors from 240 gigabytes up to 9 60
gigabytes using the newest marvel
controller this tiny beast is able to
produce up to 1400 reads megabytes per
second and 1000 megabytes per second in
rights so for more CES 2015 coverage and
potential reviews and overviews of these
products stay tuned to both Harbor
