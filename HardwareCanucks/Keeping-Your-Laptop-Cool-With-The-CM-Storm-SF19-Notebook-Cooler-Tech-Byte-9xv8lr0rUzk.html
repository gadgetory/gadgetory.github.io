today what we have is the CM storm SF 19
laptop cooler now has a lot of gamers
with laptops we all know that then they
get pretty hot especially when you're
shoving in high-powered video cards
high-powered CPUs and all of the other
accessories so a laptop cooler is
intended to hopefully keep those
temperatures under control the SF 19 is
meant for high performance gaming
notebooks because as you're going to see
it packs a little more punch than your
average cooler the SF 19 may be a bit
expensive with an MSRP of $89.99 but
you're getting one incredibly powerful
cooler with a wide range of features
let's check them out we have the USB 3
model which has four USB ports and then
an adapter to connect back into the
laptop you can tell Coolermaster intends
for this to be primarily used with
desktop replacement systems because you
can see the cable slots all throughout
the rubber on the sides of the cooler
now another cool feature of the SF 19 is
its led function now while this may not
be something you're going to use at home
if you're taking a gaming notebook to a
land party or something it's going to
kind of add a little cool effect to your
rig
underneath we have the LED bars as well
as the rubber feet which help to not
only stay in place but at the back
there's a good half inch of room for it
to sit on an incline so there's air that
can get underneath as well up at the top
there's a convenient handle for you to
take it around if you're packing it to
land parties or whatnot and then
obviously underneath we have a removable
section where we can get at the fans
underneath there are 240 millimeter fans
which spin from 1200 up to 2,600 rpm
depending on what you set them as and
you can use this convenient little clip
system to take them out and readjust how
the fans would sit on the bottom great
piece the other thing is that these can
be installed with 120 millimeter fans as
they do support them and you can just
clip them really wherever you want
depending on what notebook you may be
using on the top the one thing that I
felt was missing with this is there
actually is no mesh and these holes are
fairly large so your intake port at the
bottom is probably going to get a little
dusty
I figured it wouldn't be fair to test
this king of coolers on anything less
than the king of gaming notebooks so we
brought out the Aces g73 with its core
i7 quad CPU eight gigabytes of memory
and 5800 series graphics card now it
wouldn't really be fair if we just
played pong on this thing so for our
extreme cooling test we fired up eight
instances of prime95 to put a hundred
percent load on the CPU and for our
video card stress test we used for mark
without the cooler our laptop got pretty
toasty the hottest core of the CPU
reached eighty-three degrees Celsius and
the 5870 of blistering 106 degrees
however after we fired
SF 19 and reran the test the CPU hit a
peak of 67 degrees and averaged just
around 60 for the most part that's over
20 degrees cooler our PCH chipset also
dropped by 15 degrees the 5870 didn't
quite experienced the same drastic drop
but it did manage to stay under that
hundred degrees Celsius mark topping out
at 99 heat is arguably one of the more
prominent killers of notebooks and you
can see with our short demo exactly why
that is pairing your notebook with a
cooler such as the SF 19 is not only
bound to increase the longevity of your
system but it's also likely to help
improve your frame rates because you
aren't going to get performance
throttling due to high temperatures
there really isn't much more to say
about cooler master strike force 19
laptop cooler if you're a gamer with a
gaming notebook or just one that can't
seem to get heat under control this is
about the most serious beast available
and you owe it to yourself and your
laptop to keep things cool thanks for
