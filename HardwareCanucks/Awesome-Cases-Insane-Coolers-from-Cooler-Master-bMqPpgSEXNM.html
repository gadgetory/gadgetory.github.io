attacks and the road map a Coolermaster
looks very promising in 2017 focusing
not only on their premium expansion but
also putting a large emphasis on value
and budget products to cater to a
broader audience more on this after a
quick message from our sponsor the show
coverage is possible thanks to Nvidia
gigabyte fantex and NCIX
the first very exciting product is the
mastercase pro $660 premium chassis that
follows the modular approach on the
inside but with a beautiful simple
exterior and clean lines that is a sharp
contrast to their gaming cases the focus
of the pro 6 is a balance between
airflow and silence which is why top and
front panels sit on magnetic latches
that allow users simply pull the panel's
upwards thus opening some space for
additional airflow we will have to test
ourselves how this impacts cooling and
noise but the execution is brilliant
also I love how discreet the top il is
with that latch although only a couple
of USB ports it's unacceptable on such
an expensive case interestingly the
tempered glass panel is to list but
requires a lock key something we haven't
seen yet that might turn out well if you
can hide the key in one of the panels
but would otherwise be an inconvenience
having to remember where the key is
located furthermore we are seeing more
and more vertical GP brackets which is
included on the pro 6 this one isn't
final yet as we feel it's too close to
the motherboard
but the final bracket should leave
enough room for triple slot graphics
cards for that beautiful showcase that
is wonderfully complemented by the pure
white LED strip to highlight a simple
build inside an elegant case switching
gears on something budget-friendly
we have the master box 3 a micro ATX
enclosure priced at only $40.00 we must
be really affordable options that look
this premium we think that acrylic front
panel that showcases the Dutch although
it would quickly be covered in dust
particles given this as an intake side
the i/o is standard and recessed on the
top of the front panel and for simple
builds the exterior accommodates dual
clear half-inch drives a couple of SSDs
on the wall that are displayed well and
unrestricted access for the GPU and $40
the master box 3 is an awesome value
then there's the master box 5 light
which is an ATX case that follows the
market formula to the
tea with a fully covered PSU chamber top
or front 240 millimeter radiator support
a pretty cool looking perforated front
panel and a sweet price pot at $50 with
a side acrylic panel these budget cases
are so important because they borrow
many fantastic elements from the higher
tier but of course consumers benefit
coolermaster is also expanding their fan
and AIO selection with RGB fans and folk
software control on color that connects
to a dedicated physical hub it was only
a matter of time then we have a full
array of a iOS with the master liquid
light 120 a simple $50 cooler with a
single fan that is meant to introduce
people to AIO coolers the high tier pro
120 adds a second fan for push-pull at
around $60 and the pro 240 is $80 plus
all of which are quite basic with a
white level LED on the pump and it will
be available in q1 and lastly for air
cooling we got to see this prototype the
giant master air pro 4 sandwich between
3 120 millimeter fans is a duel tower
aluminum heatsink with six pipe steps
wrap around on top and comes back into
the CPU block the design is very
particular
it looks like an engine part from the
top but we were told cooling capacity
has been at priority with this massive
tower all I can say is I hope we are not
disappointed with the price and the
maker air series can recover with this
product so let us know which of these
new products you want full reviews on
thank you so much for watching our CES
coverage I mean both with how it
connects and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
