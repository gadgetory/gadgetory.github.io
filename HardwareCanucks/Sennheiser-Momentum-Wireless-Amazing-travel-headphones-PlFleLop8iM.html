great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with
hurricane axe and we've come a long way
for wireless audio solutions and who
better lead this trend than the San
Heiser and so today we take a look at
their latest momentum series of
headphones the momentum 2.0 or the
momentum Wireless they took they're
widely popular momentum line and made it
even better without standing Bluetooth
quality added active noise cancellation
and made some changes to the frame for
extra portability now compared to the
original momentum the wireless model
adds up $150 premium making this one of
the most expensive Bluetooth audio
solutions on the market and also that
we've reviewed so your experience starts
with this awesome felt headphone bag
that's pretty compact with color matched
thread outline the same color found on
the headband and internal lining of each
ear cup inside the headphones are folded
this is the first awesome upgrade over
the non-wireless iteration the hinges
feel robust the slide mechanism for the
ear cups is smooth with the slide play
on the ear cups for a perfect fit every
time so overall build quality is what
you would expect from such a high price
headphone although still an extremely
expensive pair for 500 bucks the
headband has a split in the center and
the thin leather padding that works
surprisingly well something that was
commonly reported to be uncomfortable on
the original momentum headphone but this
pair is extremely lightweight and the
ear cushions are thick enough to support
the entire weight of the headphone being
lightweight helps in that department and
also the ear cushions are sort of memory
foam so they contour to the side of your
face just perfectly and for me offer the
perfect amount of clamping force as well
not too tight not too loose and set
through a five and a half hour flight
with these on no problem whatsoever
something I cannot say about any other
pair of headphones aside from the much
larger HT 650s and also a positive note
an airplane adapter is included along
with the light cable as the momentum
Wireless can also be turned into a wired
headphone giving users that convenience
of traveling with just one pair and I
found myself watching a few onboard
movies during my flight
while later listening to music
wirelessly with my iPhone stashed away
in my travel bag via Bluetooth there's a
single button for on and off along with
a blinking indicator above it on the
right side and the multi-use joystick
like button below it that can be used to
control volume switch and play pause
tracks answer calls and call back the
most recent number and when disconnected
from the device to check battery off the
headphone that spoken in form of
playback hours that I found particularly
useful instead of your standard sort of
percentage between 5 and 11 hours
playtime between 5 and 11 hours play
time you get up to 22 hours of listening
on a single charge that you use the
microUSB at the bottom to replenish that
six hundred milli amp hour charge and
beside it is where you plug in and
include a cable for wire listening the
movement of wireless features active
noise cancellation with for pickup
microphones that's automatically turned
on when you power on the headphone and
it is designed to tune out that airplane
engine Rumble that works wonderful
however this noise cancellation is not
exactly consistent as you move your head
around as the microphones on each side
pick up different direction of
frequencies to tune out and I found this
particularly annoying on a flight
because I had to actually move my head
this way in order to find an optimal
noise cancellation on either side
whereas sitting just playing your
straight standard forward looking
forward made this gear cup more noisy
than the other and that was a little bit
unpleasant for 6-hour flight having a
little extra Rumble on this side but
perfectly silent on that side and as you
can imagine sitting this way on a six
hour flight is just not possible for
your neck I also like to mention that
these are NFC ready simply tap an NFC
enabled device near the left ear cup to
get a quick and seamless connection so
how is the sound quality well it is
using the aptX bluetooth codec but
between all of my devices only the
blackberry z10
has app tech support the iPhone 5s Nexus
4 Nvidia shield tablet nor the Dell
Venue 8 have a 7
thousand series tablet have optics
support unfortunately however I was
generally impressed with the Bluetooth
audio running music off the z10
delivered detailed signature with
pleasant treble impressively defined and
strong bass with bright extension into
the Mint's to bring up the vocals it was
almost like listening to these
headphones wired and listening to these
wirelessly on my iPhone however and the
low-end region really suffers from the
lack of optics codec support bass is not
as defined nor is it as deep while the
brightness element is still preserved on
the high end and the mid-range is still
clearly up front
so I'd say optics codec is almost
reproduces wired like performance with
compatible devices and I was pretty
impressed and for the price I was
expecting some extra flexibility
regarding noise cancellation as I
mentioned noise cancellation on left and
earcup is not consistent unless you find
that optimal head position to cancel out
the noise on each side I was expecting
vocal pass-through to be enabled when
using this headphone for answering calls
for example as there are two microphones
to pick up your voice clearly however
imagine noise cancellation is enabled
these isolate pretty well already so you
can't hear yourself what you're saying
especially if you're in a noisy
environment even right now I'm very
muted and it's kind of annoying but not
to hear yourself when you're speaking on
the phone for example that feature
enabled would be very appreciated and
lastly I was expecting the controls on
the side the headphone to be still
operational
when using the wire you can't use the
joystick to switch tracks to adjust the
volume and to do anything you all has to
be done through the phone you can still
enable now noise cancellation you can
still turn them on with the wire but not
having this ability to adjust things on
the fly through the headphone itself is
coming annoying
considering the for the price you know
you're paying 500 dollars for something
like this and perhaps an additional
cable that has inline controls would be
nice
so the moment Wireless is a versatile
headphones for travel with satisfactory
battery life up to 22 hours the lack of
a cable for me is a huge positive
complemented by excellent Bluetooth
sound signature with optics compatible
devices they are built for travel
compact
foldable and for me extremely
comfortable with memory foam like
leather cushions and to the most part
North cancellation works wonderful they
are an extremely expensive perto and
when I found out that noise cancellation
is not optional it's automatically
turned on when you power on the
headphone and you can't use the controls
when in Wired mode I was a bit
disappointed considering the price I am
happy to that the wireless momentum
version is now on the market but sadly
it's not perfect and it should be for
500 bucks so guys thank you so much for
watching our review of the Sun Heiser
momentum Wireless or momentum 2.0 let us
know whether or not you would sort of
consider slashing $500 on a pair of
wireless headphones and what type of
features you'd like to see actually be
implemented for that type of price tag
aside from you know build quality and
sound quality well I like I mentioned
active noise cancellation button on/off
for me would be a total deal-breaker and
now totally you know say these are
totally worth it for that price if that
feature was included so leave you
comments down below thank you so much
for watching we'll see you in the next
