effects at one point or another they
specialize in power supplies graphics
cards and motherboards and are now
expanding into computer accessories with
this unique gaming surface the word pad
brings into round fifty dollars so I'll
know the most affordable mouse pad it
promises to eliminate discomfort during
gaming and it just might be worth it
let's take a look this is no small mouse
pad with 16.9 7 inches in length and
13.9 8 inches in width this is
considered extra extra large when
compared to sizing of regular mouse pads
now does occupy a lot of surface on your
desk so for space conscious gamers this
might be a disadvantage and we're hoping
XFX with perhaps released a smaller
version of the warpath just to suit the
needs of all gamers but on the bright
side all those who prefer larger surface
will definitely find the word pad large
enough for any type of gaming especially
those who use low sensitivity for more
accuracy which requires more movement on
the mat and covering larger surface area
so let's take a closer look at the
selling point of this product it is
secured onto the table using a clamp
which serves several functions it grips
the table so the path doesn't move and
the rubberized surface at the bottom
adds further stability but its main
purpose is to add additional comfort for
your forearm by getting rid of the edge
which we are all so accustomed to while
this may sound like a hopeless gimmick
it really does make a big difference
when it comes to using a mouse pad for
either gaming or regular use there are
some limitations however to the sizing
of the table this pad is suitable for
but can clamp on tables up to two inches
thick and requires two inches deep desk
to allow the clamp to fully fit in place
once purse then it is stopped by a brace
on each side of the pad now if it is
placed on the desk that doesn't have two
inches deep for the path to slide it
into the claim only completely pushed on
to the edge of the table and may cause
the edge to rise when placing your hand
on the pad now this can be quite
annoying and completely defeats the
purpose of the clean
amp now the word pot is six millimeters
thick and comprises of several formulas
that are pleasant for the hand and as
the top layer where is out XFX promises
comfort throughout the entire life and
the war pad due to the second layer foam
that will compensate as a cushion now
one drawback to this type of foamy
surface are the edges around the pad
this thin thread like pattern material
on the top will wear out the edges and
may not look appealing with extensive
use it is also quite flexible and can be
easily folded and carried around to land
parties throughout our testing with
gaming with popular titles like
Battlefield 3 it really made a huge
difference in the overall comfort as the
other hand was resting on a sharp plus
edge in terms of tracking the mouse
movement for those accurate headshots
the sensor picked up tracking really
well and we can't say anything negative
regarding the tracking surface overall
the warp pad brings something new to the
table which most users will find useful
it's extracts or large size is a big
plus for having lots of room for Mouse
maneuvering with soft layers that are
pleasant to the touch and flexibility
that blouse easy to transport while the
main bonus of the edge loop design works
really well for additional comfort but
it's not all good news with this war pad
at the time of this review it is only
available an extra extra large size and
smaller versions would come in handy in
small desk situations with a claim being
limited to 2 inches deep desks it won't
be effective if not completely secured
and besides the unique features the
warpath brings to the battlefield it'll
still quite a lot of money to spend on a
mouse pad but with such a unique product
we would be interested to see if XFX
decides to engage in other computer
peripherals and that wraps up our review
of the XFX warpath thank you guys for
watching and we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
