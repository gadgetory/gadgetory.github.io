great content to you
hey guys if you are into small mean lean
gaming machines then you'll be very
happy with the size of this new all on
PC from MSI this is their latest night
blade m1 I am so happy we stumbled upon
this PC because the trend is clear to
create a powerful machine to be as
compact as possible the chassis itself
felt incredibly solid maybe because it's
so tiny but weighs in a hefty 8 kilos
and I don't particularly mind the
aesthetics of this gaming oriented PC
with red mesh and aluminum panels there
is an optical drive at the front
impressive at the back you'll see else
port an ITX motherboard with a 5th gen
processor and 350 watt 80 plus bronze
integrated power supply at the bottom
and the dual slot GPU up to 290
millimeters in length we did not see how
the CPU was cooled but there is a blower
style fan in between the GPU and the CPU
so definitely something proprietary that
is designed well for this form factor
popping off the exterior panel we get a
glimpse of this incredibly space
efficient build and something that I
have asked MSI is if they will be
selling is sort of a DIY type of bundle
like what coarser is doing with their
Bulldog then all you have to do is
populate your own GPU your RAM CPU and
the drives but the main core bare-bones
kit is there and they have told us that
for the North American market this would
be a consideration and if that's the
case I'd be very happy to see the knife
blade m1 to compete with in the DIY
sphere for drive capacity you get two
hot swappable three and a half inch
drives and the front of the chassis and
a single two and a half inch drive near
the back which is totally impressive for
something this small
they've even included clips on top of
the power supply for cable management
and notice because the GPU is flipped
and the PCI connector is on the roof the
PCIe power for the GPU is exposed right
in front the power supply so that would
mean simple routing it will ship with
Windows 10 and the end of July and
pricing is still unknown but I really
wanted to show
off because we must appreciate the form
factor of this all-in-one PC now a
messiah was not done showing off and
their next level
all-in-one monitor PC features a
full-size graphics card compartment at
the back this could be a convenient way
to pack for a land party but seriously
his MSI going off track here or do you
guys like this approach still it's a
concept idea but this GPU chamber at the
back will fit a dual slot GPU that
requires its own power plug and actually
a desktop CPU integrated here is wall
behind the MSI logo it will be really
interesting to see if this takes off and
proper gaming all-in-one machines will
rise due to space-saving features
especially because you still have all
the needed IO ports there are speakers
at the front hopefully with a nice fast
IPS display and I personally would not
be able to integrate this machine into
my own lifestyle but this is that next
level all-in-one performance and I'm
happy that we're heading there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
