Haru Canucks review we have a very cool
case today from NZ XD this is part of
the Phantom series the H 630 now their
approach with this enclosure was to make
a silent full tower with an abundance of
enthusiasts friendly features and you're
also looking at a very competitive price
point starting at $149 now on the
outside it doesn't look like your
conventional NZXT case it's actually
very simple and we don't get any angles
which NZXT is so obsessed with the
entire exterior shell is made out of
steel which makes the case feel very
robust and solid now a lot of you might
say where's the side window but we are
told that including a side panel will no
longer make this a silent case now
seeing the front is kept to a bare
minimum with two optical base and hard
drive activity lights ventilation along
with all your connections has been moved
to the side this is where rear i/o LED
switch is located followed by audio
jacks and the combo of USB ports along
with SD card reader power and reset
buttons are located at the top so a very
clean looking case from NZXT so coming
back to the question of ventilation
front intake is going to be in trouble
as venting strips run only on one side
of the panel which is about one and a
half inches thick now we see the exact
same design for the top panel but as
that would most likely be used for
exhaust it shouldn't raise any concerns
in the back we have extra venting for
the top panel exhaust fan with
adjustable height very welcome feature
and nine PCI slots of course let's not
forget the full dust proof cover with
two dust filters at the bottom removing
the front panel we find noise dampening
foam along with a removable dust filter
for the ventilation slot and similar
scene for the top panel with noise
dampening foam attached throughout the
entire panel so front airflow is pretty
versatile triple 120s dual 140 s
or 200 millimeter fans are supported
with only one included the exact fan
support is located at the top so
exhausting air
out of the case should be no problem
it's the front that may not be as
efficient in delivering cool air taking
on the side panels they are reversible
and have sound dampening material
applied throughout making this a very
silent case now getting inside the
optical drives have tools mounting
pretty standard and blow that are the
three module drive changers that are
pretty versatile and the very
well-thought-out
two of the cages have a fan bracket that
you can angle so directing airflow is
not going to be an issue
now NZXT has modified the drive caddies
to be a bit more sturdy finally they
don't just snap anymore and we are told
they are designing new drive caddies to
be released in the near future now each
cage also has rubber grommets at the
back to minimize on the noise caused by
vibration so very nice attention to
detail so as you can see there are many
mounting options for your cages which
will be based on your storage needs and
of course if you want to clear up some
room for airflow now further removing
the support frame at the bottom a 240 or
280 mm your radiator can be installed or
if you wish if you want to be ambitious
a 360 millimeter front radiator is also
supported
but that means removing the entire drive
cage assembly the back of the case is
designed with cable management in mind
with large quality rubber grommets one
and a half inches of space dedicated
spaying hub for up to 10 fans and four
cut out to the top throughout any of
your fan cables or the eight pin CPU
cable we also have two SSD brackets
which are really convenient to mount and
swap out if needed so very well designed
layout to deal with any enthusiasts
setup
and finally assembled and cleaned up we
have 14 inches of clearance for your GPU
also at the default drive change
position the angled fans are spaced out
so there to not interfere with long
graphics cards now one thing to note is
that not all cutouts are grommeted
particularly the ones at the bottom
which I would say are the most important
ones for you to try and conceive so
really hope NZXT just adds a few extra
grommets down the line now if you're
thinking of water cooling with radiators
installed at the top you have three
inches of clearance until we hit the
memory knob so internal water cooling is
completely covered within the H 630 so
really this silent enclosure excels in
pretty much every category it's clean
and modern design is a step into a
different direction for NZXT
as we are so used to angles and abstract
design from the company water cooling
and the air flow options are plenty
abundant and are properly executed
module drive changers are very
convenient
including two SSD brackets at the back
plus this is a silent enclosure all for
a very competitive price of $149 now we
have to mention our concerns with the
front intake as it is quite limited
meaning you have to face some
compromises if you go silent but overall
the H 630 takes an already excellent
design from its predecessor it makes it
even better with a few internal changes
and given the growth we've seen from the
Phantom lineup the prospects for NZXT
are looking quite good so we're giving
the H 630 a damn good and the damn good
value award so thanks guys for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
