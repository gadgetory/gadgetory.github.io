Knox and today we're taking a look at
the LG G pad now since the latest Nexus
7 the tablet scene has been quiet slow
because this very stronghold the
competition has when it comes to seven
and eight inch devices so this injection
from LG into an overwhelmingly saturated
sphere is surprising yet welcome the G
pad features all the expected goodies so
I think it really comes down to the user
experience that might win people over
now starting with the price this 8 inch
tablet is a bit on a high-end at $350
for 16 gigabyte capacity with the latest
Nexus 7 rocking the same resolution and
a smaller form factor the G pad may not
be on priority list if you are on the
market for one
now speaking of specs the 8.3 inch
display is an IPS panel with 1920 by
1200 resolution really crisp display
running it is Snapdragon 600 quad core
at 1.7 gigahertz with 2 gigs of RAM and
not yet upgraded to KitKat so this is
running an older Android 4.2.2 some of
the very distinct physical features is
the brushed aluminum plate in the back
that after first 15 seconds of use looks
well used the white version of the
tablet is much better at concealing all
the fingerprints I personally love the
form factor though a very thin device at
eight point three millimeters and
weights only at 338 grams and holding
this with one hand is perfectly
comfortable the speaker grilles are
located at the back for audio
consumption in landscape mode only
I really wish the speaker's would be
somehow incorporated into the front for
non-restrictive media consumption when
it comes to audio quality and speaker
location when you are holding this in
landscape mode you are able to sort of
Direction the audio with your hands sort
of channeling the audio towards you more
instead of the audio just being blasted
to the back there now let's listen to a
sample clip to see how loud this tablet
so as you can hear it is quite loud the
bass is obviously lacking but for
regular entertainment purposes and
watching things on the tablet it is
totally acceptable connectivity wise we
get a microUSB for charging and data at
the bottom along with a microphone
headphone jack at the top along with a
micro SD card slot for expandable
storage and an IR blaster the power
button and volume rocker are on the
regular spot on the right and have a
really tactile and solid feedback auto
don't be expectin to use the power
button much to wake up the G pad as
double tap
wake up feature is really awesome for
that convenient and quick entry and the
same goes for turning off the screen by
double tapping on an empty area of the
screen we have a front-facing 1.3
megapixel camera and the rear cam as
well which is 5 megapixels
now pictures aren't spectacular colors
are a little bit washed out and quite
poor low-light performance but I would
recommend this HDR mode as that helps to
get rid of the noise and restore some of
the dynamic range now I do like the
screen on the Jeep and the viewing
angles especially colors aren't as
vibrant and people have been complaining
about the brightness but I didn't find
that as an issue now what bothered me
was the ever so slightly laggy
performance for example switching
between portrait and landscape mode is
probably the most visible lag it's quite
slow as the G pad was loading all the
screen icons as you can see and I think
we've gotten so used to smooth and
buttery performance that this small lag
is very obvious now holding the home
button will reveal all running apps that
you can exit with a swipe of course
widget and icon customization on the
screen is possible and giving the real
estate of the screen pulldown settings
have been combined with all the
notifications where you can also quickly
access brightness and volume bar which
is always convenient and all those
settings at the top like Q memo and I
think where it lacks in fluidity of
operation it makes up in the list of
really useful cue apps
let's take Q memo as an example it's an
overlay app that stays on your screen so
you can write short memos and share the
screen capture this will be useful for
google map directions for example we
also have a list of qslide apps that
allows multi window support opening
internet on one and calculator and
another for example so you can move the
windows around still you can resize them
and you can also change the opacity of
each window now the problem here is that
these windows are always on the top even
if you're switching between pages so you
were always looking at the same qslide
apps unless you closed them also another
cool feature is this three finger swipe
to the left that hides the pages and
swiping to the right to reveal them just
another way to interact with your G pad
although you can see this lag really
shows here and is very evident now one
of my favorite features is cue pair that
allows you to connect your G pad to a
smartphone just install the app on your
phone and the two devices will be synced
up now this allows you to receive calls
and text notifications that allows you
to actually answer text messages as well
while you're on the tablet without
needing to reach to your phone now one
thing to consider though is the constant
Bluetooth connection that will impact
your battery life by pinching the screen
we zoom out to all of our pages so we
can swap them around plus holding an
empty area on the screen we can
customize all of our icons and widgets
now when it came to gaming performance I
didn't notice any lag so the hardware
can definitely handle demanding games
and the G pad scores really high in the
generic and joined benchmark which is a
bit surprising because within the custom
UI it feels so much slower than it
actually is and we all know that pure
Android is the better way to go now G
pad house is an impressively large 46
milliamp hour battery to keep that 1200
P screen running then we casual use it
wasn't necessary to charge for a couple
of days but with heavy use and Wi-Fi on
I got about two seven to eight hours now
throughout my experience from the G pad
I really enjoyed the form factor the
screen size is just perfect for mobile
meeting consumption and the weight and
the thickness of the G pad is totally my
style display PPI is quite crisp SD card
slot is totally useful for extra storage
and speaker location for landscape mode
is a
obtrusive I also like a few of cue apps
like cue pair and multi-window app
option with the cue slide and lastly the
battery life was a satisfactory now on
the flip side the custom UI
on top of Android is not the buttery
smooth standard of Android 4.2 which is
a shame as the hardware can totally
handle that and the price is quite high
considering what's out there on the
market I do however think that the LG
pad has a place and tablet scene as it
delivers to the standard I just wish it
was running pure Android now what do you
guys think of this tab would you
consider paying $100 extra for an inch
or go with the trusty 2nd gen Nexus 7
