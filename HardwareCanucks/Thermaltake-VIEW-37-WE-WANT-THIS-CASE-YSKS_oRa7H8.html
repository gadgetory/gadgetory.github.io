something unreachable for most people at
$1,000 the thermal thick level 20 is
cool but we also discovered something a
little bit more affordable and more
common for most users this is the newest
thermal take view 37 full Tower and
before you want huge thanks to our
sponsors fantex Corsair and coolermaster
for making this trip possible so now the
view 37 I absolutely love this approach
to making sure that your interior is
fully exposed all thanks to this giant
curved acrylic panel that spans all the
way from the bottom to the top
visually it's stunning the actual curve
doesn't have any imperfections and the
entire panel almost looks like glass
until you start to kind of notice little
scratches here and there but the overall
visuals are awesome it's flush against
the main frame so it doesn't stick out
and it's mounted with thumb screws at
the back because so much of it is
transparent that makes the case appear
smaller for some reason and obviously
it's awesome for Hardware showcases and
hard line tubing and not just for show
coverage and like you know show floors
but this will actually look really good
inside your space and because the
acrylic spends all the way to the top
with that curve you cannot mount
anything up there and it is also acrylic
because doing something like this with
glass we throw the price into a
different category than what this case
is intended for but here's a curved
panel for the Corp III enclosure that
alone sells for $69 just to give you
some pricing perspective the front i/o
is standard with an RGB button to cycle
between colors and the whole idea of
this open concept is obviously to
showcase some lighting in your hardware
and thermal takes new fan hub will
actually work with other vendors RGB
software so from gigabyte MSI and they
Suze meaning that you can fully sync
thermo takes hardware to their fans
there whatever RGB stuff to your
motherboard to your graphics card and
etc the front panel is also acrylic it
seems like they didn't get the memo
about this super choked front intact oh
so only small ventilations are available
on each side so right now we have I
think 200 millimeter fans mounted there
just for the showcase but the case will
come with a hundred 40 member fans
instead so you need to mount them on the
interior of the frame to achieve better
airflow
now I love the move towards interior
side mounted cooling it looks fresh
provides
exhaust area and you can finally utilize
this area for something other than the
potential reservoir the rear side panel
is properly ventilated to to allow for
that exhaust to exit which also means
you'll need to keep the area clean of
wiring on the interior you can notice
there is no power supply shroud and if
it was there I feel that it would close
the space off too much and wouldn't
allow the you know the whole showcase to
like really shine through a vertical GPU
mount is available it is optional but it
looks great and it's actually pretty
close to the side panel so airflow will
be affected and if you guys would like
us to review this case let us know in
the comments the view 37 will be
launched under $100 overall I can see
myself actually building in something
like this just to experiment with that
side exhaust and also seeing many other
case manufacturers moving into this
direction of providing additional
airflow options in that area and I'm
just really excited to play around with
that particular feature so thank you so
much for watching subscribe for more and
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
