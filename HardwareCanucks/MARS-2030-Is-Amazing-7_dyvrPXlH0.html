Canucks and would you take a one-way
ticket to Mars and I heard an interview
recently where you said that you you
would place a beautifly take a one-way
trip okay if I ever got like like a
chance to do that I would love to like
film the world's first like Martian
documentary it's one of the coolest VR
demos that I've recently experienced is
Mars 2030 which is such a fantastic way
to give us realistic renders and
realistic scenarios on where we VR
applications could go in the future it's
not really just gaming but you have so
much also scientific things behind it
that could drive VR forward march 2030
is about giving you an experience what
it actually is like to be on Mars I love
the experience of having an open-world
game and being able to you choose what
you want to do and we want to bring that
same type of freedom into Mars 2030
you're the astronaut and you get to do
what you want to do probably can't count
many games that really say I'm an
astronaut and I'm doing the duties of a
national but they're also working with
NASA and MIT so NASA is giving them all
types of data images of actual Mars
imagery so not something that's
simulated but physical images that have
been captured by NASA have been handed
over to these developers to create this
Mars 2030 experience nASA has given us
everything from from the rover models
and the habitat models to be able to
kind of put this all together and and
kind of extract the data from that and
say okay how do we get this inside of on
really the one thing that we're
sacrificing in is is there's this thing
called planetary protection zones which
is since we would show up on Mars and we
can contaminate
the the Martian soil with our own
basically microbiology there are areas
that they would section off that the
humans could work on but nowhere else
and there are specific key areas where
there could be like and then you extract
the sample and get life but it could be
a false positive then you get earth life
because you just got your germs of you
they are using actual physics so gravity
of 38% of Earth gravity or 28% is
actually being implemented into this
into the game everything that you see on
Mars and the game is actually on Mars
think about that in the full experience
we have about seven missions seven
missions that align with to the two
major goals that nasa has for reasoning
as to why to go to mars everything
that's been implemented with the sound
design has been actually worked with
NASA
so they've recorded what it's like to be
in the actual Mars rover prototype so
they placed microphones inside the rover
recorded what the sounds are alike and
then you get to experience that exactly
so once you inside the rover you can
move around and as you proceed through
Mars territory you feel and you you see
what Mars and Martian surface looks like
from the outside which is real and then
you also are hearing what the Mars rover
sounds like one of the coolest thing
about the Mars rover toe is that it's
got six wheels and they are independent
of it and independent of each other so
you can be moving sideways and you can
do all types of cool maneuvers and what
the developers told us was that they've
actually met astronauts that train on
those Rovers
and the parking skills man those are
some freaking fantastic parking skills
that those astronauts have on one of our
visits to Johnson Space Center we saw
one of the re-entry videos so it's it's
it's almost it looks kind of like the
Apollo capsule but much more modern
version and they were landing it I mean
they shot it out into space and they had
a reenter and the sounds of when you
hear like the re-entering that the
thruster is aligning so that it enters
properly and the plasma that surrounds
the
the spacecraft is insanely cool
experience and we want to recreate that
for VR Unreal Engine is so popular so we
hope that optimization is going to be
right up there the whole map that we are
told right now is eight square
kilometers which is based off real
images they're going to be reducing that
for the actual game and one of the
coolest things you can see is the actual
Martian crater it's based off images
that nASA has given them it's not a
recreated crater it's an actual crater
that exists on Mars and when you look
over one of the surfaces you can feel
how gigantic the the damn thing is when
you driving the rover and you exit
basically you don't basically what the
proposing is not suiting up inside but
suiting up and crawling into a spacesuit
so through that process when you want to
capture okay what does it look like to
get into this patient so in the
experience you'll see that you kind of
crawl into a spacesuit just in the same
way through a suit port that NASA is
proposing and to get back to my first
question on this video if you were to
take a one-way ticket to Mars would you
I however I'm gonna go pack my bags and
hopefully find Matt Damon
I I take a round to it yeah we see here
is a one-way ticket one way one way
ticket the way I think the first thing
I'm going to do with it take its Y
videos free pepper I'm gonna use my feet
dig out the letters MA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
