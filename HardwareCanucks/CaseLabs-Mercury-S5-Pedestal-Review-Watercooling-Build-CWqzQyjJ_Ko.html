a custom PC from NCIX and hardware
connects check the description to learn
more so you guys know our history with
cases and one common aspect between all
of them was the lack of initial user
flexibility and sense that you just
received an end product from
manufacturer but if you ever wondered
what it'd be like to choose your fan
mount side panels top panels case feed
color configuration front panel
connectors and Bay covers to really
customize your chassis to your own
personal preference and hardware well
there aren't that many companies that do
that so today we're taking a look at a
fully customizable chassis from case
labs this is their mercury s5 with a
pedestal now here we have a full
ingredients list if you will for all the
possible side panel options and such but
the base price for the s5 and the
pedestal are 260 and 150 respectively
now your experience with case lamps
starts with a chassis of your choice
followed by a huge list of customizable
options so you just need to have a
preconceived idea of what your final
build will look like as getting separate
panels after your order is complete is a
bit costly the case will arrive
disassembled and putting things together
it's really simple and actually a lot of
fun you'll be working with 100%
aluminium construction which is really
light but super sturdy as well and very
modern friendly 2.3 millimeter thick
frame and one point six millimeters for
doors and exterior covers you really
have to work with the case to see how
amazing everything feels but you can
also just trust me all the panels are
sitting on these two last hinges so
removing them is really simple you can
also replace the hinges after some time
as they might get loose for example on
our sample we're not tight enough to
hold the panel and the polls just kind
of went through but you can manually
tighten them as I did here now one comes
to bay covers case labs has you covered
the s5 has seven five in the quarter
inch drive base and depending on your
build different Bay cover sizes are
available both in solid and ventilated
formats a dual 120 millimeter fan
bracket is available there is a very
popular option for a 240 millimeter
radiator or a single 140 millimeter with
a standard 2 4
remember really are installed with the
tubing at the top it will prevent
clearance for the top bay but using a
low profile fan controller will work and
of course flipping the radiator with
tubing at the bottom will clear up the
top base slot the s5 has a 120mm that
cutout leading into the pedestal for
tubing to pass through it's exactly what
we'll be doing for our water cooling
setup but first let's check out the rest
of the chassis the front panel
connectors are replaceable and our unit
is equipped with PR buttons and only two
USB 3 ports coming to the top if you are
using the pedestal to house all your
radiators and window panel would be
sweet to show off your hardware but of
course we do have ventilated options as
well with a top rated or bracket a
slightly taller ventilated panel is also
available that allows fans to be
installed above the bracket for just a
little extra internal clearance if you
decide to do push and pull I also like
to point out that none of the panels are
dust proof which as you know I think
should be a standard with all cases and
we followed up with case labs
about this and it's something they're
working on and due to the variable
nature of what people are doing with the
chassis they'd rather let users decide
on the type of filters that they use now
on topic of panels we have a full window
half window or ventilated panel again
that would depend on your budget and
system preference for example having a
full window on the left
showcasing your GPU and the drives while
only a half window on the right side to
cover up all the cables from the power
supply now let's take off the panels and
see how the mercury s5 handles the
system the optional pedestal is attached
with four screws so you can just easily
remove it the s5 supports two mechanical
drives with four SSDs that are installed
in their own chamber the 3.5 inch drives
are mounted using insert method with
really high quality rubber grommets and
the drives are facing the cutout for
proper SATA pass-through from the power
supply chamber mounting SSDs however is
a little more work you do have to screw
the drives in place and that means
taking off the SSD bracket which also
means taking out your toolbox to unscrew
these nuts so you will need a wrench I
really would have preferred thumb screws
or at least a screw that I can you
with a regular screwdriver but once in
place you can also see there is quite a
bit of unused room closer to the front
that I think could potentially house
another SSD cage the front panel cables
we pass through a single rubber grommet
and underneath the motherboard tray that
is also removable for those wanting to
work with a motherboard off the case the
CPU cutout as you can see it's fairly
large and right underneath there there's
the ventilation for your power supply so
case labs has pretty much thought of
everything
users would need when building a system
into this micro ATX chassis the pedestal
underneath is really meant for housing
radiators optional power supplies are
used for additional storage all these
options are of course available at your
initial order and of course anything to
place in those bay covers and here we
have a 360 member radiator bracket along
with a 240 slash to 80 millimeter
bracket on the other side both are
easily removable and given we have a
little over 11 inches of width for the
case push and pull on each side with
thick 60 millimeter radiators is
actually doable
the smaller radiator bracket allows for
drive base to be populated and that's
exactly what we'll be doing with this
dual bay pump reservoir combo provided
from dosmo comm and using the cutout at
the top to route all of our tubing to
attach anything in the drive base we
first need to mount these Bay brackets
very simple to do and everything just
fits in place now the large brackets are
okay for optical drives or dual pay
reservoirs like you see here
but key slabs also includes a pair of
low-profile bracket to be used with the
low-profile fan controllers and with the
reservoir installed at the bottom we
still have over 11 centimeters of
clearance so push and pull with thick
radiator is a possibility now we are
using dark side radius from dash mode we
first mounted everything onto the
bracket and then into the s5 which is
totally hassle-free also if you are
mounting radiators on both sides of
pedestal you can remove the floor with a
few screws to get access to tubing which
is something very clever and totally
useful we also get a fan mount in the
basement either for exhaust or for
intake depending on how you set up your
radiator cooling and finally starting
with the assembly we get our bottom and
top exhaust ready install our front to
40min rad which is super easy to do with
just a few thumb screws and we're also
mounting a 360 rad at the top as well
since we have the taller top panel for
the fans to be above the frame we are
using an ek supreme water block provided
from dash mode that has an awesome
Canadian mark on there with a maple leaf
and mounting that onto the motherboard
and we are good to go now we've got
everything set up before running all the
tubing and I just have to say that this
open design and the flexibility of the
s5 is a total pleasure to work with when
it comes to water cooling radiator
brackets are really convenient to do all
the fan mounting off the case and then
just drop the brackets in place plus if
anything needs to be changed down the
road it's as simple as popping off the
panel removing four screws for that
bracket so here is me doing all the
tubing and while I may not do such a
clean job it's an absolute breeze to
work in tubing is routed into the
pedestal where two more radiators can be
housed and with the whole system
assembled the one area the s5 is lagging
I think is cable management there's just
nowhere to secure the cables and it is
really left to users creativity to come
up with a clean system for example I
would have loved to see something for
the eight pin cable and maybe if you
came with a notches underneath the
motherboard to secure the 24 pin cable
the power supply is held securely by the
screws at the back but there is some
spacing at the bottom so for 1200 watt
units or higher a support bracket is
available but the aluminum is thick
enough to handle even very large power
supplies now I personally love the look
of this incredibly simple design that
turns out to be extremely functional and
super flexible since the very beginning
also who knew that I would enjoy the
case wheels this much so I'd certainly
recommend them for convenient transport
now there are a lot of things to like
about the mercury s5 and the case labs
company as a whole for one 100% aluminum
construction is seriously amazing guys
we have so much flexibility from the
initial order that allows users to
really build a system that would work
for their configuration what a cooling
is a total breeze with separate radiant
brackets and while the s5 is an
excellent case on its own
own the pedestal adds a new level of
working configuration storage options or
extra power supplies so all know it is
very appealing now of course with all
that said I do think that there are a
few aspects of the design that could be
changed for the better now for one you
require a wrench to remove the SSD and
hard drive gauges that is out of line
for this whole concept of user-friendly
assembly a few thumb screws instead
would be a lot better cable management
is also a bit lagging and we have
nowhere to secure the 24 pin cable there
are no dust filters included and I would
have liked to see some magnetic options
available and lastly the price we've
gotten very accustomed to pricing
between 100 to $200 cases and the
pedestal alone will set you back to $150
plus the initial configuration for the
s5 is 260 and to give you a whole
roundup our total configuration with
windowed side panels radiator brackets
and the pedestal came to over $500 now I
wouldn't consider the price at con
necessarily however I could see many
people wondering why pay so much for an
aluminum box and the answer is very
simple it's because you get to customize
the case basically from the ground up
and of course that 2.3 millimeter thick
aluminum is expensive so you buy into
the amazing build quality and we're
giving you the hard knocks damn good
award now last thing before we end this
