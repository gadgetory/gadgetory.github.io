brought to you by and CIX
technology connected anybody in the room
on the clap for us to sync the audio
okay okay guys so I'm now here with ties
with Bain Olsen and he's a product
manager they just announced their
BeoSound
essence system which is it's a it's a
very unique system for those that want
that premium sound experience when you
get home from work and you don't exactly
want to use your mobile device to sort
of start the music you don't want to be
reaching out for your system that has
the audio integrated so T's what are we
looking at here what is the essence well
the essence is basically a super modern
music system but he also has sort of
brought back some of the old qualities
you had from back in the day where you
actually had a physical pot to turn on
the music so we want to make it simple
again to turn on music and nowadays when
you need to start some music you need to
find your iPhone you should have in the
code find the air find the content with
the essence we are introducing what we
call a music switch which is basically
this one it's meant to be hanging on the
wall could be just besides the
lightweights right so we want to make
they're turning on the music as easy as
turning on the lights so here you have
basically the most essential features
you want to have from a music system so
you can stop stop the music skip track
and turn the volume up I felt I've held
this device and it feels incredible the
build qualities the brushed aluminum
machined so what whether they take you
guys to get to this point of simplicity
and elegance for I mean I guess you guys
are known for that so was it sort of a
challenge putting everything together
into this sort of system or was it sort
of kind of like of course of course
we have done a lot of research on
investigating how people live with music
what's the most basic features they need
and then obviously that there are the
minimum hears from our own factory
obviously and but this is Janice because
this is a wireless remote right so you
can place it by everyone right so
there's some some issues that aren't on
radiation and so on and connectivity
through to the to the Machine you can
say to the engineers this is basically a
remote from the for the actual system
yet for the exorcism that's meant to be
hidden away basically right so we want
to hide them technology away and only
put on the room but what people will
need and what what can be beautiful to
do again and not dominate the room with
black technology but right so you're
you're moving away from the wires but
you're also this is a wireless
technology and you mentioned in the
presentation about very impressive
battery life better life for this what
are we expected to get well it's just
runs from simple triple-a batteries so
we're looking at the year and a half so
they were bright yeah so you simple you
simply install his I need to forget
about it basically now tell us a little
bit so now here we have aside from the
unit that attaches to the wall this is a
sort of an optional piece that is also
the remote that is in this base plate
they will they have a few prototypes out
with multiple base plates colors and
materials basically to customize your
audio experience and this remote
experience based on you know you put
this on your dining room table or in
your living room table away from these
wall-mounted units so you can mount
three per room of these wall mounts
right great yeah and now tell us about
what is so a lot of people are guess
also like you said they want to move
away from the system but what is the
system and how what type of activity
we're looking at here so so basically
this this is to be got everything you
want from a modern music system
so it's gonna build an internet radio
station so thousands of radio stations
and it's got buildings but if I connect
so so we will actually appear as a music
system correctly within the Spotify app
okay we also build in cue play which is
a Chinese music services shoot out there
and and then you can actually so that so
that's the sources base yeah and then
you can we're launching a new
application for mobile devices called
the view music app together with this
and from that app you can access of
course the content you have on either
you are ever on your Android phone and
set it to play on this system or you can
browse your whatever content you have on
your nest drive or your iMac and
whatever and say that you play and you
can also sort of make the presets so
your what you put together your list of
your favorite internet radio stations
and so on that's like what you do from
the after so the more advanced
functionality and the configuration of
the system that happens through the app
but everyday usage 80% of the time you
this is gonna be just fine
okay well that that's the BeoSound
essence bringing the wireless audio
experience into your home in a very
elegant way here and bein an officer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
