4k screen oh man
4k so gorgeous especially working 4k
video alright cooker cuckoo cuckoo
cuckoo and then we have the beautiful
curve 21 by 9 almost 4k resolution is
smaller but so much real estate in the
wide spectrum productivity but you know
what my friends once you go 144 Hertz
for gaming you never go back
even if it's you know the prettiness on
the ultra wide so if you're like me and
trying to decide between these three
panels and which one suits your purpose
better we'll talk about all the
advantages and disadvantages using 4k 21
by 9 or 144 hertz panels because usually
you don't get all three of those
elements and a single panel so we'll
divide those into categories and see
which one suits particular purpose
better right after this the Graham
spectrum keyboard bike Tesoro comes with
a new mechanical agile switch with low
profile key caps with super fast
response and shorter actuation distance
plus all the customization included with
RGB lighting and macros for a premium
user okay so let's start with what I've
been using as my main screen for the
last year and it's the 27-inch 4k LG 27
UD 88 that is my primary work monitor on
which I do everything the extra detail
of text and just fantastic color seals
the deal but that is only after settling
you know the scaling to 125 percent
because otherwise everything is just way
too small so real estate wise you get
something similar to native 2560 by 1440
panel with a sharper image and we've all
heard the following get the 4k panel if
you're into any creative work but why is
nobody mentioning scaling issues in
Windows in some of the most common apps
used in the industry like Adobe
Photoshop now luckily for my work in
Adobe Premiere I have no issues with
scaling and get plenty of room for the
UI but jump into Adobe Photoshop and all
the UI panels receive the miniature
treatments that don't scale with your
windows settings which is kind of weird
and it's also insulting to only have 100
or 200 percent scaling in Photoshop
options so you either get
for tiny text that is very difficult to
see or too large text that occupies a
lot more of the screen than I want
luckily Adobe Lightroom has more
customization like 150% scaling to make
UI panels more visible without that eye
fatigue but again everything at 4k at
the 100% scaling is just way too small
so you have to scale it up as early
please however if you are an Apple user
you have more scaling options with your
4k display that actually carry over into
Photoshop making it much more
comfortable experience because you get
the benefit of a super detailed image
without the annoying UI scaling
inconsistencies that we find in Windows
but regardless for creative work lean
towards UHD 4k because it's licensed
here it's nice and detailed and not
really 21 by 9 because as much as it
looks cinematic and you know very
cool-looking it just doesn't work for
creative work okay okay but having said
that the ultra white is a very unique
aspect that is absolutely amazing for
compatible content that fills the full
screen without all the black bars on
either side but that is quite difficult
to come by and majority of the time you
will still watch that 16 by 9 content
with the black bars on the sides that I
despise and for video editing the only
advantage I find is the horizontally
expanded time line and because we have
the extra wide real estate you can see
more preview windows and comfortably
have more UI panels open without
overcrowding your software so in that
aspect it's fantastic but majority of
the ultra whites are unfortunately
curved that for me kills the creative
purpose as all of your lines on the
screen are skewed and how are you
supposed to know your reference
composition plus there's the bowtie
effect and I really don't know how
people can use curved ultra-wide
monitors for video or photo editing and
resolution wise interestingly this panel
here has less pixels and the 4k uhd
panel over here so text is not as
detailed in comparison is still pretty
fine but you can maybe make out some
pixelation in font when looking very
close no way can you see pixels on that
screen so take
as you will but for productivity Wow
really nice to have a stacking of
windows having three windows open side
by side very comfortable to view you can
do a lot of work without having to
reopen things and just a lot of a wide
real estate that is a major advantage on
the ultra wide but finding that
occasional media in the cinema format
that fills the full screen is so worth
it you know in the sea of all the black
bars so then where do 144 Hertz monitors
fit within this conversation and this is
where gaming is dominated by the high
refresh rate panels seriously once you
go on how many 44 Hertz you never go
back and if you do it's just like me now
it's very difficult to demonstrate just
how fluid 144 Hertz feels but here is
cursor movement in slow motion and you
can see that 60 Hertz refresh cycle is
very slow in comparison to 144 Hertz
and this means checking corners in csgo
for example allows you to be much
quicker because the screen does not blur
when you do those fast movements and
that is a major advantage for competitor
games
and in particular one returning to my
sixty Hertz panel you know I saw that
the cursor movement was very sluggish
but you know 4k gaming is kind of
overrated anyway in my opinion so it's
very demanding on your system and
regardless I would choose 2560 by 1440 P
anyway so that it's like that sweet spot
for the resolution it lets them to
squeeze extra image quality instead
while 21 by 9 gaming is pretty unique
with so much in your peripheral vision
but still some games would stretch the
sides that will not be pleasant
so for guaranteed solid gameplay choose
high refresh rate and Q HD is possible
all right so let's conclude this
conversation and 4k uhd is awesome on
the Mac it's excellent on Windows
provided your applications can follow
your Windows set scalings you know like
not like Photoshop but why would you
want the game at 4k I would prioritize
on high refresh rate and good quality
panel first and then choose your
resolution as the last deciding factor
you know based on your you know
available budgets and stuff like that
and it's for ultra y21 by 9 it's a
unique merge of high resolution gaming
and also high refresh rate because there
are panels available 100 Hertz in the
ultra wide format that is very unique
but they're really expensive so I would
focus on the ultra wide format to be
targeted for productivity with something
that does not intersect creative work so
yeah I hope that helps let me know if
you agree with my generalization between
the usage for 144 Hertz 21 by 9 or 4k so
yeah let me know which market are you
using and what would be the next element
that you are excited to experience let
me know in the comments down below I'm
