most consumers when it comes to picking
that optimal smartphone is their camera
performance if you think about it most
consumers really don't care about specs
or the million features that brands back
into their devices these days you know
they just want a phone that can keep up
with their basic tasks like being able
to send text messages send and receive
emails browse the web watch youtube
videos or Netflix and of course take
good pictures with your friends or
family or interesting subjects it's all
about having a good time the problem is
that there are so many options out there
right now rating at different price
points and so naturally the more you pay
the more you get in terms of features
except for a few hand flow devices now
if you're in the market for a smartphone
with the best possible camera the Google
pixel 3 and the 3 excel are hands-down
the best options available at the moment
followed by a few other competitors but
there's been a lot of buzz around lately
especially when I was reading this up
online where developers were able to
port the Google camera app to other
cheaper and Android smartphones and the
result seemed to work really well and so
I decided to try that out for myself on
the oneplus 60 because this was the
cheapest smartphone that I had lying
around and guys the results are really
worth taking a look so let's go and just
check them out but first a quick message
from our sponsor what would you like
so I'm looking for a gaming headset with
a bit of everything but not overkill
something that folds on your neck sure
how about the light frame without
excessive clamping force yes yes you
comfortable ear cushions with proper
internal padding excellent I will take
the cable and the microphone are
removable
fine fine this is the one multi-platform
compatibility with a virtual surround
sound dongle avail can I just take one
and the sound quality you'll be
satisfied with so the new Coolermaster
MH 751 and 75 to are here to make your
gaming experience alright guys so before
I get into the results there are a few
things that I need to address firstly
there are a variety of devices that you
can try this out and there's a list on
the XD developer site including support
for the latest razor phone to the galaxy
note 9 the Yami poco phone one phones
from Lenovo as well I'll leave a link to
the site in the description dumb
if you're interested in trying it out
for yourself provided you have one of
these supported devices secondly the
process of setting this up is fairly
straightforward
it's not rocket science and you don't
need an unlocked bootloader to try this
out for yourself it's as simple as
downloading the respective apk enabling
the unknown source tab and installing
the app and that's it that's all that
needs to be done now do keep in mind
that this experience might be a little
bit different on other Android
smartphones in my case with the oneplus
60 at least with the updated version I
was able to pretty much get a exact same
replica found on the pixel 3 but it
doesn't really utilize all the features
of that particular hardware so the
results will likely be different I
should also mention that this doesn't
replace the stock camera app on the
device so you don't have to worry about
voiding your warranty or something plus
developers are working on updating the
respective apks to improve stability so
with that out of the way here are the
results I made sure to enable hdr+ on
both the stock and the google camera
apps to get optimal results and here's
our first sample and right off the bat
you might not notice a significant
difference between the two but if you
zoom in a bit closer you'll notice that
the Google camera app does a better job
maintaining the detail without
introducing digital noise a like B stock
app on the 60 and this was a continuing
trend with the other samples as well now
in this shot the stock camera app on the
6d has a slight green shift whereas the
Google camera mod captured what was true
to life in terms of colors now this is
totally subjective you may end up liking
the one captured by the stock app and
that's okay it's all about personal
preference here's another interesting
comparison the Google camera app exposed
for the subject perfectly whereas the
stock app on the 16 just ended up
boosting the shadows giving it a surreal
effect and not to mention the image
coming out of the Google camera mod is
just so much sharper the stock app also
tends to produce images that are a
little bit less contrasty compared to
the Google camera app and it also bumps
up the saturation by a slight amount and
you'll also notice a little bit of that
green shift that I talked about earlier
I think this has to do with the auto
white balance setting and remember I was
just spending a few seconds taking these
shots instead of manually adjusting the
shutter speed and ISO because
realistically you want able to quickly
snap a photo and move on to the next now
this picture really turned things
around I'm pretty sure most of you would
go with the one shot in the stock app
versus the Google app and I tend to fall
in that same category because there is
better dynamic range and the slight bump
in saturation certainly gives a little
bit of life to the image whereas the one
in the Google camera app just looks dull
here's a sample from my low-light test
and honestly I'm really impressed by the
image coming out of the Google camera
app because it's not only sharp and well
exposed but there's a good balance
between the highlights and the shadows
everything from the reflection of the
salt lamp to the watch face just makes
it look more natural whereas with a
stock camera app it just boosts the
shadows and there's a lot and I mean a
lot of digital noise introduced here
plus it doesn't look as sharp as
Google's result
this was another low-light test and
clearly the Google camera takes the edge
here because it's more realistic there's
barely any noise and it's usable when
compared to the stock app that kind of
blurs things around losing detail now I
should mention that the Google camera
app does tend to underexpose in certain
situations but that can easily be fixed
in post what can be fixed again is the
detail and I think I'm repeating myself
here again when it comes to sharpness
the Google camera mod takes the edge for
the most part but here's the million
dollar question does portrait mode work
on the Google camera mod unfortunately
no at least on my sample I tried
multiple times with different subjects
but I was out of luck maybe an updated
version could fix that but interestingly
it did work with the front-facing camera
and point the results are pretty
interesting so I actually tend to prefer
the one on the pixel three because it's
a little bit more aggressive and there's
better subject separation compared to
the one plus 60 the stock app that just
tends to gradually blur things out
giving it a little bit of a it just it's
an interesting effect of course both of
them have different characteristics but
let me know in the comments down below
which one do you prefer
here are some other samples
well there you guys have it and I've got
to admit I am really impressed with this
little smartphone hack I mean just
looking at the results overall you're
getting a much better image with this
Google camera app compared to the stock
app because it's more cleaner it's
sharper there is just the colors are
more true to life and it just does a
better job processing HDR and it just
does better in low light as well now
it's that being said it's not perfect
because I've run into a lot of times
where the shutter button wouldn't work
and things like slow motion and a few
other Google features that are on the
pixel lineup or phones just don't work
on the version that I've loaded on the
60 so I'm just hoping that the brilliant
developers were able to you know think
of this in the first place are still
working on it so we'll hope that you may
be stable version can fix that later on
so yeah at the end of the day guys I
think this is just the beginning because
it's all about computational photography
and that's because software is
ultimately the key when it comes to
analyzing and fine-tuning things out of
the sensor to make images more true to
life and just look good overall so
that's it for me let me know what you
guys think about this in fact if you're
rocking one of these supported devices
that are listed on the XDA developer
site are you interested in checking out
or trying out this Google camera mod and
have you actually tried it out for
yourself if so I'd love to hear your
thoughts in the comments down below and
are you impressed you know the
interesting thing is sometimes I
actually love or tend to prefer the one
taking on the stock app and that's okay
because I have two camera apps that can
take two different characteristics or
two different images that have different
characteristics and I think I can't
really complain about that now on the
video side of things I wasn't able to
notice a significant difference between
the two applications but overall guys I
think I'm really looking forward to
testing out this Google camera hack on
other Android smartphones to see what
the results are I'm hero with higher
connects I'm signing off
and I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
