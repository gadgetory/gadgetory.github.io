that you probably shouldn't do but still
are going to do it anyway like biting it
this quarter of a lemon Oh
real life respawn that's how it works
now I can relive biting it this quarter
of a lemon alright I'm gonna stop this
now
let's get into the real respawn well
wasn't expecting doing a taste test
right over here I do apologize for my
brother savage job on opening this one
so Razer made a mental performance drink
mix this all apparently started with an
April Fool's joke and people were like
oh my god you need to do this and they
did in typical Razer fashion it's all
gaming centric designed for gamers by
gamers respawn is a secret weapon
obviously this product is kind of poking
fun of themselves and also trying to
maybe grab something that margins from
monster redbull and all other end in
jinx for eSports arenas
especially because that is quite heavily
marketed for the gaming industry in
general in terms of flavors we got the
tropical pineapple classic green apple
nice pomegranate watermelon I mean guys
I'm a huge fan of watermelon one second
I literally have watermelon in my fridge
right now because it is delicious but
mixing it with pomegranate you're
ruining it such a mess
and the last flavor we got is the blue
raspberry so what these are are
glorified caffeine capsules 95
milligrams of caffeine per serving that
you mix with water and drink it and
you're not supposed to receive the
massive energy boost and then you crash
it's supposed to be a little bit more
gradual there is artificial and non
artificial flavors so it's not a hundred
percent healthy for you
so a typical Red Bull can with
have about seventy seven milligrams of
caffeine versus ninety five and not
capsule however this one would have
about 170 milligrams of caffeine I'm
gonna try the blue raspberry ooh look
little powder yep yep that you can smell
all right ooh I don't know guys I'm
skeptical it smelled better when in
powder form I'm allowed to drink three
of these powder cans per day or
recommend the dosage we'll see about
that
huh okay it smells so much flavor from
that like little pouch blue raspberry I
don't know he's got this nice light
lemony texture in the beginning that
evolves into the sweetness and now I can
taste of raspberry as the background
flavor I would say it's pretty delicious
guys I can't drink that much caffeine
and it's like it's 5:00 p.m. I got my
workout to go to let's try this
pomegranate watermelon I will say I'm
already feeling in the whole performance
alert this thing mmm that smells
delicious pomegranate watermelon wow it
is very interesting the layering of
watermelon and then the sourness of the
pomegranate calf swirling around filling
your mouth with flavor this is very
refreshing it's almost like you expect
carbonation to come out of these flavors
because they taste very much energy
drink like but it's quite flat you can
drink it but the flavor is quite strong
so it's not like you'll be able to chug
this thing whole thing down right away
it's more of like a sipping thing
instead of like done and got a refill
this is the proper way of smelling
something by the way
Wow the green apple smells exactly like
if you were to slice a green apple in
half and have those aromas in the air
it's very refreshing very light hmm so
there's a sweetness factor that's pretty
heavy but the sourness factor bounces
out I really like that first initial
half but the aftertaste not my thing all
right the last flavor that would be the
tropical pineapple whoa this one is
yellow for real hmm
not a fan of the smell right now hmm
he's got this weird weird mouth texture
yeah this is my least favorite so far
because it's more sweet and the real
pineapple has the sourness that really
has a nice kick followed by the
smoothness of the sweetness here that
sour kick is very very non-existent it's
more sweet than anything but it's almost
like there's this weird balance between
it's trying to be sweet but not too
sweet I don't know so I just came back
from the gym and having fueled up on all
this and I just drink right before I
left I had about 500 milliliters or so
during my taste test and that kept me
going throughout the entire hour having
not eaten for six hours since lunch
normally my energy would drop halfway
through the point through the workout
but I'm fueled up on all the caffeine so
I'm good the one drawback however is
that I felt really dehydrated about
halfway point which is strange having
dranked 500 milliliters of liquid that
would not happen with your standard
water even now I'm like getting dry my
favorite flavor would be pomegranate
watermelon what a surprise I have a
sweet spot for cotton candy which is
what it smells like before you mix it
and then it tastes like watermelon juice
and I also have a sweet spot for
watermelon so what started as an April
Fool's joke is now in the gym product
I'm not surprised but it's kind of crazy
to think about of course this is razor
very gaming centric it was only a matter
of time they made an energy drink
at least it's not full full of chemicals
but it's got the raise of pricing all
over it obviously this whole energy
drink arena is growing especially
and the eSports scene but just be
mindful don't consume this stuff every
day or don't consume it at all it's
still not natural and if you're tired
take a nap if you need extra energy have
an apple that will give you more energy
than this stuff would and just be
mindful of the consequences of having a
box that is so easily accessible and
made into a drink that will give you
that extra energy you know coffee is
addictive and caffeine is - all right
guys I'm Dimitri thanks so much for
watching this has been my taste test or
respawn check out this other relevant
content I'll talk to you the next video
I'm done with this no more have to lock
them up lock up the boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
