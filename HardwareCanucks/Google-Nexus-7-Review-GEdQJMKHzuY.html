comes to market competition especially
with the introduction of the Nexus 7
tablet that brings incredible
performance portability and a sweet
price point of two hundred fifty dollars
so let's put it to the test and see if
the new jelly bean is worth it well so
this is 7-inch tablet comes with the
name has a 16 x 10 aspect ratio and then
HD resolution of 1280 by 800 so not bad
for such a small display and really good
news for pixel density everything is
crisp and clear especially the text and
the graphics you really do appreciate
such high resolutions while spending
some time with Angry Birds and some
compatible HD gaming also reading books
was enjoyable just a really awesome
display that this fits in in this nice
compact package and the device is fairly
small but it fits in the hands
comfortably and we have this rubberized
surface at the back which really helps
to grip the device while in use even if
you have sweaty hands you still manage
to hold it properly without worrying of
dropping it and Nexus 7 has create heat
dissipation you don't notice any heat
coming from the back unless you're
running multiple games some music maybe
HD videos you will notice the heat but
it's not irritating the Nexus 7 has only
two physical buttons the power and the
volume which are not exactly in their
natural spot I feel to be more
comfortable having those buttons somehow
incorporated into the silver bezel
instead of the angled sides however they
do provide great feedback when pressing
them and are hidden away from accidental
pressing at the bottom of the device we
have the micro USB port for charging the
device and connection to your computer
and the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
the speakers that come with the Nexus
are located at the bottom it's a one
long strip and they sound acceptable for
such a small device pretty good for
basic audio playback the Nexus also
features the Android Beam which allows
data exchange between two android
devices we also have a built-in GPS a
gyroscope accelerometer and a Magna
meter we also have two microphones one
and the top and one at the bottom
basically to accommodate for different
for
positions in portrait or landscape mode
the Nexus also has the 4 pin connection
on the side for docking the device and
lastly we have the 1.2 megapixel
front-facing camera really good for
google hangouts and just really video
chatting unfortunately no camera at the
back of the device but I'm sure they'll
be added on later however the one gripe
I have about the screen is the glare and
the reflection of the display especially
if used outside get to bump up the
brightness all the way to the max but
still the darker areas of the display
would be hard to see and the Nexus comes
fully packed with goodies from google
you have a Google+ chrome YouTube and a
really awesome portal for all your
entertainment is google play where you
can download apps movie books and games
and to top it off the Nexus 7 comes with
a $25 google play store credit an
excellent incentive to encourage further
spending now I did enjoy using google
chrome just because it felt like I'm
using a desktop on the actual tablet and
that's because you can easily switch
tabs you can move them around and an
overall great browser experience so the
Nexus 7 comes with the jelly bean which
is the latest 4.1 Android and it really
shows off its abilities with the
internal hardware the tablet houses the
NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor
clocked at 1.2 plus 1 gig of ram are
what drives that smooth performance all
around for example opening apps closing
apps switching pages and getting into
the main desktop the performance really
shines with the Tegra 3 and also thanks
to project butter which was aimed at
refining the responsiveness of the
Android it is one of the best things
about the Nexus no more visible lag when
switching into the app screen and the
Android seems blazing fast which really
sets the stage for the future of
affordable tablets and do the
responsiveness of the tablet this really
provides a friendly and excellent user
experience that asus was aiming for and
just to demonstrate its ability to
function under pressure i have opened
every single app i have downloaded so
youtube some browser pages and the nexus
doesn't break a sweat and handles
everything you throw at it with ease
another great thing about the nexus is
google now it's on a similar line with
siri really intuitive and smart at the
same time it has great voice recognition
even in multiple languages let's check
it out what is the weather in Toronto
finding the nearest restaurant you can
actually go inside the map and this is
really cool where it allows you to view
the map at the google maps in 3d mode
and i can go into 3d mode for my
convenience convert one meter in two
inches 39.7 inches now in terms of
languages nexus 7 recognizes multiple
language for voice recognition all you
have to go into settings into your
language and voice search and you can
just change your language to whatever is
included let's try the Russian and let's
try and now and check out the weather in
Toronto prognosis for God of Toronto
there we go we are getting at the
weather network in Russian for Toronto
the notification bar has been added it's
pulled up from the top and you can
change the updating interval which is
really convenient but not only does give
you notifications on your email and
Facebook for example but it also gives
you updates for all your applications so
this is a really great way to keep track
of all that's on your Nexus we have
Wi-Fi + bluetooth only no cellular
connection so it does limit the use of
functions of Google now while you are on
the go but let's be honest the price
point wouldn't be where it is if the
Nexus 7 was also a phone and Wi-Fi
connection has remained strong and
stable throughout our testing so no
issues in that department personalizing
the experience with the Nexus is also
made easy by creating different pages
with apps and widgets you can move them
around for example having pages for just
two games through your TV shows or
movies and things like that and the
keyboard on the Nexus 7 is really nice
we have good size buttons with visual
and sound feedback when you press them
unfortunately there's no tab button
which I would like to see just save some
time when you're typing in the login and
password however you may find yourself
exiting into the home screen while
typing that's because the home button is
located right underneath the space bar
and then unfortunately there's no way to
lock it or move the home button now
strangely the jelly bean only stays in
portrait mode and doesn't allow the
rotation while on the main screen but
this isn't really an issue as the
landscape mode is enabled with
supporting applications the battery life
on a tablet is actually pretty good a
4325 milliamp hour battery is plenty for
a full day of heavy use with constant
connection and gaming for example and we
have a lot longer battery life but just
with casual you
so overall the Nexus 7 is an excellent
tablet that rings in at two hundred
dollars for the eight gig version
finally we have an affordable and
performance pack device that utilizes
its small form factor to be a portable
entertainment center I personally find
the size just right it's small enough to
fit into a pocket and definitely more
enjoyable to use than the smaller touch
devices and the app count for the
Android is enormous so there is plenty
to choose from when it comes to
exploring the Google Play the nexus 7
really has hyped up the market for
budget tablets that opens doors for
future innovation and competition and
let's face it it's never bad for
consumers the only critique I can
mention for the two-hundred-dollar
tablet is poor button placement that
doesn't feel natural and of course we
miss the cellular options for such
portable device but that would mean
jacking up the cost and in the end a
higher consumer price so to conclude the
nexus 7 Google tablet deserves the damn
good and the damn good value of work for
delivering an enjoyable user experience
without breaking the bank and then sit
for this one thanks guys for watching
and we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
