hurricane axe and welcome back to
another investigation video
what are we investigating today cooling
on rising threat Reaper CPUs that's
right my friends we are finally getting
around to testing both air and liquid
coolers to see which one can optimally
cool an overclocked 16 core 30 mm 1950 x
at 4 gigahertz we have four contenders
for this test - a feature from noctua
the other two are from NZXT let's kick
things off with Noctua we have the you
14 s which is their beefiest you know
cooler that comes with a 140 ml under
fan and then we have the u 12s that
comes with a 120 millimeter fan on the
liquid cooling side of things we have
the NZXT X 52 and their X 60 tube
coolers now our test system is going to
be the X 399 bill that I just built
recently so if you're interested you can
check that out right over here
so without any further ado let's get
into this but first a quick message from
our sponsor Thermaltake premium is now
selling gaming chairs with carbon fiber
like leather material standard bucket
see design with lumbar pillow and neck
cushion good adjustable armrests with a
sleep recline built in the chairs are
available in multiple colors and
different sizes learn more in
description below all right guys before
we get into the coolers and discuss the
results I want to quickly talk about
socket tr4 because back at Computex I
got a chance to check out some X 3 9 9
boards that came with the socket tr4 and
I was thinking to myself how in the
world would one cool such a massive CPU
I mean standard traditional AIO coolers
or even air coolers wouldn't be able to
cover the entire surface area of that
die I was also thinking maybe AMD will
provide their own proprietary cooling
solutions or their own coolers to
complement these new chips which wasn't
the case until they officially launched
thread Ripper because they came up with
a quick solution that adapted existing
ace attack liquid coolers by including a
bracket within the packaging this meant
an enthusiasts or anyone who jumped onto
thread repair were only locked down -
all in one liquid cooling solutions air
coolers were totally out of question a
few months ago until now we're starting
to see companies like noctua come up
with their own version of tr4 coolers
specifically designed for thread Ripper
now if you recall our performance review
of the 1950 X and the 1920 X by the way
if you haven't watch that you can check
it out right over here I tried a 140
ai yo cooler specifically the NZXT x42
to see how it could handle threat averse
epic heat output and unfortunately it
didn't do that grain even at stock
settings i was roughly getting around 90
c under full load and that raises a lot
of questions regarding the massive heat
output of TR so i decided to make this
video comparing air and liquid coolers
on the 1950 x to see how they can handle
the heat
I obviously excluded the X 42 cooler
because I didn't want to kill my cpu so
there you have it let's start with the
least expensive cooling solution from
Noctua the Nhu 12 str 4 it carries the
same DNA as the original u 12 series
except it comes with its own custom
contact surface that's significantly
larger than traditional course this
should essentially cover the entire die
of the cpu and it should theoretically
result in better temperatures it also
comes with the signature n FF 12 120
millimeter fan so if you're looking for
something compact this is a really good
option but if you prefer something a bit
beefier Noctua has you covered again say
hello to the Nhu 14 STR for a 140
millimeter base cooler that shares
similar characteristics from the
original u 14 series except for that
large cpu contact surface area I also
found something really interesting with
this coolers design and this also
happens to be present with the Nhu 12
STR for cooler and that's the
implementation of offset mounting
options within the secure firm 2 bracket
for better PCIe clearance essentially
this allows the user to offset the
cooler by 3 or 6 millimeters towards the
upper edge of the motherboard which then
eliminates clearance issues between the
tr4 socket and the top PCI slot that's
straight-up brilliant unfortunately my
rog zenith extreme board from asus or
wasn't able to accommodate the u 14s
with my gtx 980ti installed on the first
piece i slot i tried all three offset
configurations but sadly I was out of
luck so take good note of that a quick
fix to this was to shift the GPU to the
second PCI slot which still runs at x16
speeds so I'm not sacrificing on
performance but ultimately you know
you're left for the top slot that's
totally unusable
I'm hoping this isn't the case for some
other motherboards but the U 12s fits in
perfectly even with the top slot
occupied
so that's awesome on the a I am side of
things I decided to stick with the X 52
and the X 62 from NZXT I'm sure both
these schoolers don't need specific
introductions because you know how they
look in function the X 52 features a 240
millimeter radiator whereas the X 62
features a two eighty millimeter
radiator so I'm excited to see how well
both these could handle the overclocked
1950 X and the last thing I want to
mention here before we get into the
results is thermal compound application
because let's be honest here with Red
River CPUs it's a bit messy because
there are so many ways to approach
applying thermal compound because of
that large CPU die so I decided to stick
with the X pattern for the aio colors
but not to uh suggests a completely
different technique you'll first need to
apply nine small drops onto the heats
better creating a square 3x3 pattern and
then add for larger drops in between as
you can see here so I'm gonna test out
this way for the u 14s and the u 12s so
I just unmounted the X 62 cooler from
the tr4 socket and just check out this
the amount of surface area that the
thermal compound took on the X 62 cooler
the CPU block that's that's the entire
that's the entire copper plate guys now
I just unmounted this u 14s cooler for a
socket Tier four and check out that
thermal paste I mean really not too
really wants you to cover the entire IHS
and I understand that it does did it I
mean it did a pretty good job with the
with the with the temperatures but yeah
that's that's a lot of mess to clean up
for for the ute well then I'm gonna pop
in after so are you guys ready for the
results here you go
I used Ida 60 for stress test on the
1950 x and h ee monitor to monitor the
CP temperatures let's kick things off at
stock settings since it gives us a rough
baseline as to how each cooler stack up
with one another as you can see I kind
of expected this the Noctua coolers
blows the doors off both the aisles from
NZXT by a fair margin if you pay close
attention to the low temperatures
there's a difference of 12 degrees
Celsius between the U 14s and the X 52
cooler and roughly a 1 degree difference
between the U 12s and the X 60 to a yo
cooler
that's amazing but if you guys are
wondering I did also manage to run the
stress test a little bit longer on the X
62 cooler just to see if the
temperatures are rising over time but
that wasn't the case it did stay
rock-solid as you see here but with this
order keep up when we overclock the CPU
actually it does the octo coolers are
still staying strong cooling the
monstrous 1950 X at 4 gigahertz I was
really surprised to see the you 14s at
60 C because that means we still have a
bit more Headroom with overclocking if
we're lucky enough the u 12s performed
fantastic as well giving us temps around
65 see the X 62 also did a pretty good
job cooling the CPU just a few degrees
warmer than the u 12 pass however the X
52 struggled to keep up in fact the
system froze after 10 minutes into the
stress test and the last recorded temp
was around 87 degrees Celsius that's 20
more than the X 62 so I would stay away
from this 240 millimeter IO if you're
planning on building a 300 per PC now
let's move on to some acoustic tests
well I guess it's about time to wrap my
thoughts on air versus liquid coolers
for threat River CPUs now before I get
into my conclusion I wanted to quickly
point out that this by no means is a CPU
cooler showdown because I could have
added more coolers to see how they
perform would threat refer but this is
just a test how air versus liquid would
do on threaded but it's not specifically
pointing out which cooler is the best
however seen by those results I am
slowly leaning towards air cooling
because I feel like a fraternity thread
upper system especially a workstation PC
and if you want that the best possible
reliability out of that machine you
should probably stick with air cooling
because you don't have to worry about
leaks or you know pump failures or you
know all the other things that might
come down the line with that being said
one of the compromises when you decide
to go for an air cooling solution is
clearance you need to have proper room
in order to accommodate the cooler so
you know pay attention to your
motherboard see if you have proper room
and of course the offset configuration
should help you in my case it did have
workout with the u 12s but unfortunately
you 14 s just didn't play out that well
with the zenith board and I think that's
where people might end up leaning
towards liquid cooling solutions because
only to worry about is finding the
proper room to mount the CPU block and
in most cases in fact every case you
should be totally fine because AMD does
ship with an ISA Tech bracket so I think
you should be safe in that regards when
it comes to compatibility so I'd like to
hear your thoughts on air versus liquid
cooling on thread repair where you
surprised by the results or you know
where did you expect the air cores to
outperform the liquid coolers before
showcasing the results let me know the
