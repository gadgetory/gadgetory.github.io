canucks i'm here at east york in toronto
at a microsoft and best buy exclusive
media preview event where they've teamed
up and they're opening up a bunch of
stores throughout Canada and the states
and bringing us the user experience of
actually getting to try the product
before buying them something that
Microsoft and well Windows tablets have
been missing in this consumer scene
right behind me is the sample store what
looks very open looks kind of like the
mac store as well but we'll also be
talking to microsoft and bestbuy
representative to see exactly what's up
new things able to offer aside from this
sort of hands-on experience and what
exactly what are the strategies in in
terms of lowering their customers so i'm
martin van der Velden I'm the vice
president of merchandising for best buy
canada or how many stores are you
planning sort of watching goal is to get
105 stores completed this year so that
all Canadians across the country have an
opportunity to come into a Windows Store
before Christmas so there's a couple of
elements that we've added with the
Windows Store first thing is this
innovation table that you can see so
what that does is allows us to kind of
highlight some of the new technologies
and the new products that come to market
right in a different way than we've been
able to do in the past you know we find
that eighty-five percent of our
customers do shop online first and I
think that's great and you know we're
all about the customer however they want
to interact with us but there are still
people that they may see something
online and they may have one or more
questions that they need answer and so
they have that ability to come into our
store where we can help them through
that last minute decision so they may be
caught between two products and then we
can kind of help them understand the
difference between this one or that and
you were telling me earlier that you'll
have so representatives helping the
customers to if they have any issues or
again choosing the best between setting
one or two yeah so we've also want the
other elements you that we added is a
Windows consultant so in this consultant
this person will be trained at a very
high level by both jointly through best
buy canada and microsoft and they'll be
able to answer a lot of questions about
how the ecosystem works and how
different devices interact and of course
we also have our blue shirts in the case
of best buy and in future shop it's our
product experts that can also answer any
questions and again because we have all
the windows stuff together and
we have this consultant there's going to
be a lot of learning through that
individual's rights rights it's uh we
think that that that gives an incentive
for the consumer to come to the store
it's not really about us trying to
differentiate against other retailers
it's more about trying you know we are
the largest retailer of computers in
Canada so it's listening to our
consumers and trying to change the
experience because of the way they now
shop right a lot of people you'll see
them walking into our stores with their
phones and they're checking prices and
or they're looking up specs and so we
need to evolve our store to be a better
shopping experience for our customers
and that's what we're trying to do what
we will do with Windows wait hey guys
here i'm here with Elliot so Elliot what
he do for futures up some the
communications manager for future shop
which is a sister company to bestbuy
canada right so Elliot why has windows
stores have only rolled out in September
you have over 30 stores now throughout
Canada so why this opening of stores
only now sure well it's definitely been
a timed process and something that's
been in development for several months
with our teams both at bestbuy future
shop and also our team at Microsoft and
I think why it's taken to this point to
launch is a we know that September and
october leading up to the holidays is a
hotbed for retail especially when i was
going back to school back then also
holiday shopping is a great time to show
up we've got a lot of exciting devices
now that are now in the market like the
surface to that just launched this week
at future shop in best buy stores which
is super exciting that time technology
and the fact that we know that our
customers are navigating towards this
type of ecosystem we call it and that's
an easy way to navigate through one
operating system and in this case it's
windows 8 that just also launched this
year so I think long and short of it is
there's all this exciting technologies
that's launching for fall 2013 we made
perfect sense based on our customer
behavior and they've been wanting this
type of customer interaction to launch
at this time so basically all the stars
or in this case all the technology
aligned as it was a perfect time to do
it and we're really excited to launch
our store here in Lisa Toronto oh yeah
we want people that are watching this
video to not just think it's Toronto's
centrica that's we're standing today if
you're in Winnipeg if you're in
Vancouver if you're in Calgary Edmonton
X the end if you're in Montreal you're
going to see these stores and hopefully
also be impressed with how easy it is to
navigate so if you're going in there for
a laptop and you have this in mind you
might have your eyes open and realize
you know what there's other different
form factors to in ones touch screens
and and so on and I know earlier we're
discussing about how the smartphone has
helped really influence or condition our
customers to have that touch feature
yeah we're keeping not only tech forward
but also catering to our customer today
which just loves that touch environments
easy to walk through and you're
absolutely right you see that analogy of
customers walking down the halls trying
to touch the screens because they're
just so used to that environment right
alright thanks Elliot hey guys i'm here
with Greg barber the vice president of
consumer channels for Microsoft Canada
how will this Windows Store improve the
the consumer experience for people who
want to perhaps move on to the windows
ecosystem or perhaps are who are looking
to expand their windows devices the
window stars very important to Microsoft
and very important to Best Buy and
future shop because the just the range
of devices and the range of services
that are coming to market we've got a
heck of a story to tell and and this is
our platform to go tell that story and
best buy and future shop are the best at
doing that so what I mean by that with
Windows 8.1 the new windows just
released its just released the new
surface to just released the new chip
sets that have all come to market the
Haswell chips and the Bay Trail chips
for both super light power usage for a
mobile world and then all the new form
factors in terms of tablets too and ones
all in ones that are coming to market
the innovation table I think is
something really cool because like you
said you get a first-hand experience on
the coolest tech from with this windows
ecosystem so what are we to expect with
this innovation table what are we to
expect to see on here coming up
Christmas and coming up moving forward
basically yeah so this Christmas you'll
see some all in ones that are frankly
just giant tablets
so an all-in-one is a desktop
replacement but rather than just sit on
the desktop you can pick up that 18 23
27 inch screen and then take it to
another room I get to know the room put
it on the coffee table and play a game
or put it on the dining room table and
you know collaborate you know do some
joint surfing with someone or work on a
document you'll also see some great
touch laptops coming in all screen sizes
you'll see some great to in ones you
know for example like this HP for you
know it's got a full keyboard looks like
a great laptop but then you push the
button and off comes the screen and so
is it a tablet is it a PC yes it's a two
in one or you get for example like this
acer over here which you know it can be
a tablet it can be a PC and then you get
pure tablets so 8 inch tablets like the
dell venue 8 that'll be coming to market
larger screen tablets like lenovo will
have some 11.1 inch tablets and of
course their surface with the surface to
with its 10.6 inch high-definition Dolby
surround sound backlit keyboard just
tons of innovation coming in the
ecosystem all of it will be here and
actually also this Christmas will have
the new Nokia phone on the table this
new 41-megapixel insanely high
resolution camera on the phone you can
dress it very very got it so that the
coolest stuff in the ecosystem will be
on the innovation table and then very
shoppable as you can go to the all in
one section the laptop section the two
in one section or the tablet section
which is right behind the surface area
so the best that's coming from surface
but then of course the eight-inch the
other intel based products low price
high resolution bigger screen all the
windows tablets are all easily shoppable
you know with a guided tour as it
relates to the well-trained best buy
staff with specialists exactly and then
lots to learn if you go online to the
Windows Store too if you want to
continue your journey or start your
journey online before you come to the
store to maybe help narrow down
you're looking right well guys that
wraps it up for this media exclusive
event here in east toronto and well i
gotta say that this this partnership
with Microsoft and pass by and future
shop is going to be beneficial for the
consumer there's no question about that
as you can interact with the products
before you buy it certainly has the
advantages of just shopping online and
so again thanks guys for watching we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
