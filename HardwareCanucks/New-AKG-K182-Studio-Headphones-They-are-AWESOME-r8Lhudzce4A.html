great technology selection and service
whether you're listening to music
editing videos or working with in any
audio environment hearing reference
audio is crucial and that means hearing
audio exactly as it was intended what's
up guys I'm Dmitry with Hardware Canucks
and we have a new AKG closed-back
monitoring headphone on the review table
today the K 182 that is an outstanding
pair if you're looking for audio
monitoring they're built to withstand
studio lifestyle our incredibly
comfortable and also sound fantastic so
let's dive into the details and see if
this is the right pair for you now
design wise it's a very basic headphone
it's mainly plastic with some metal
joints there are some rubber pieces on
the headband which I'm not sure what's
that about with just simple AQG branding
on each ear cup plus the top of the
headband there is some creaking going on
when stretching the headphone but the
entire frame feels pretty solid and I'm
confident that this will behave well in
a studio environment the headphone is
size adjustable the ear cups have almost
full 360 degrees rotation and that's
awesome for a low profile fit when
they're on your neck but I found
rotating the ear cups facing you is also
awesome to be able to hear what you're
listening to if you just want to take a
little break further the ear cups can be
folded inside for it slightly smaller
footprint during travel and that's
pretty awesome it is a much stiffer
rotation joint which is perfect to avoid
them folding if you're holding them just
by one side as in they don't collapse
unless you intentionally push them in
the cable here is removable using the
mini XLR 3 pin connection so replacing
the cable is not an issue and AKG sells
plenty of additional cables the cable
included here is not coiled it's a
standard three meters which is you know
fine for studio space with a six point
three min later adapter included but
unfortunately no shorter cable included
in the package so if you want to use
them on the go you'll have to buy
additional cables yourself so now let's
talk comfort the k1 82 is the most
comfortable studio headphones that I've
tried
I the leather cushions here are super
deep and soft enough to relieve any
pressure the clamping is very minimal
and I did not notice any heat
accumulation inside the ear cups that
are conveniently labeled left and right
for that visual aid there's very little
padding on the headband that I thought
might be an issue but it wasn't at 155
grams without the cable the K 182 offers
lightweight design and also an
outstanding fit so it was time to fire
up some music do some editing to see if
these are going to replace my HD a DJ
from San Heiser and simply because of
the awesome fit this pair will
definitely be the first to sit on my
headphone stand so I have the o2 plus au
DAC headphone amplifier and based on
what I heard this is an outstanding
monitor headphone the lows come through
power it's not a flat headphone by any
means and combine this with fine sparkle
in the high end to reveal plenty of
detail out of any audio source without
being too harsh and compared to my HD DJ
they are a lot more revealing and offer
a surprisingly wide soundstage for a
closed back headphone which is super
nice and a very important element that
everybody will appreciate for a studio
headphone is sound isolation they block
out pretty much 100% of the exterior
sound which is great and they leak zero
sound so when they're on you and you can
blast out the volume to the highest or
to whoever you see comfortable without
disturbing anybody in your surroundings
so if you are in the market for a new
monitor headphone the AKG K 182 is a
fantastic pair to consider and we're
giving it Harbour Canucks damn good
award so make sure to say hello to that
