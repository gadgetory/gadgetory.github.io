and today we're taking a look at this
little guy this is the d1 DAC from audio
engine and as we start to dive into the
world of audio with headphone reviews
headsets and speakers today we're going
to try to answer whether or not a DAC is
a useful addition to your audio
equipment the DAC is a digital to analog
converter your audio from your computer
is rendered in zeros and one so the
digital format and the DAC converts that
to an analog wave format so basically
producing cleaner sound and getting rid
of all the digital interface today we're
going to take a look to whether ask
whether or not the DAC is a useful
addition but whether or not the d1 is a
good starting point if you plan on
upgrading your equipment and price that
$170 you do have to consider whether you
care enough about your audio for such an
investment and generally as you audio
preference grows so do your interest and
making sure you best out of your sources
but let's not get fooled by the size of
the device bigger doesn't mean smaller
in this situation audio engine has made
sure to house this in the robust metal
casing with rubber front and rear plates
I know the look shouldn't really matter
but the really clean design is
appreciated for on desk setup specs wise
the d1 is a 24-bit 96k low hertz tag and
that's very important is audio fidelity
matters at 24-bit recordings it does
require USB power and luckily anything
above USB 1.1 will be sufficient at the
back we also have an optical input and a
pair of stereo RCA outputs that would be
ideal for connecting to your speakers at
the front play of a volume knob with
some resistance so it's not too loose
and you can really fine-tune your volume
there's an illuminated power switch that
will automatically switch the audio
source through the deck to wherever it
is connected to without you need to go
into your audio properties and do it
manually now it is a little bit
surprising to see a three-and-a-half
millimeter jack here for your headphones
instead of a quarter inch adapter as
this DAC is sort of targeted towards the
audiophile and higher level headphones
but it does complement its portability
factor the d1 also serves to prime
purposes like I said the headphones but
also the speakers at the end here so the
d1 has a built-in amp for your
headphones so it will power anything
pretty well up to 250 ohms I had the
volume knob around 25% with the HD 5 5/8
for a pretty comfortable listening
experience so meaning there's more jews
left for higher impedance headphones the
second news are the RCA outputs at the
back for connecting speakers or to
another dedicated amp for example that's
very popular now our audio engine a 5
plus was a perfect fit with the d1 DAC
to drive clean audio into this very
cable setup now comparing audio quality
between the built in DAC on my notebook
and the d1 was pretty obvious the high
end was much more evident with faster
attack treble was crisp but not harsh
and there was a very evident awakening
of the background for live recordings
not in a bad way per se but my laptop
couldn't handle such detail separation
so generally the d1 manages to really
pull out the detail out of your audio
without and I actually didn't notice any
bass boost instead they provided better
based resolution listening to angel from
Meza 9 delivered much tighter bass
without bleeding into the mid-range and
that's actually a very good thing to
preserve audio fidelity
now using the DAC with our a5 + speakers
was a totally new experience it really
allows you to listen to music from a
device that doesn't support RCA inputs
and that's one major advantages of
having this external device now for the
hundred $69 price tag you really would
want to utilize both of the headphone
and the speaker functionality for this
DAC now the question is you know whether
or not a DAC is a useful addition and
probably for me it really depends on how
you view your audio a year ago I
probably wouldn't have considered the
DAC because maybe I wouldn't have
noticed a difference but now as you sort
of start to discover the whole new words
world of how different things sound and
how you prefer your audio it's perhaps
something of a consideration if you want
that audio fidelity this will also allow
you to expand in the future because the
RCA inputs aside from sort of connecting
your speakers can also be
added into an external amp and so this
key device can just be served as a DAC
you can also add a different equipment
later on in the road so perhaps this is
not a bad place to start so with the d1
we've got a compact footprint and have
build quality with a headphone amp for
under 250 ohms that tightens the base
without any coloring the RCA and
opticals are obviously welcome along
with the DAC itself that handles detail
beautifully without harshness now if you
cough dimension is the absence of an
optical cable I'm sure that
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack is not optimal but it does suit the
d1 thanks to its portable nature the
price is not really con unless you don't
utilize the full functionality of the d1
and that is the RCA outputs for speakers
or an amp and front jack for your
headphones and with that said anyone
looking to upgrade from stock computer
audio will be pleased and we're giving
the d1 our approval with the damn cord
now I know that this type of addition to
your existing audio setup is not going
to be for everyone but what do you guys
think do you think this is going to be
something for you let us know in the
comments below
perhaps if you already own a dad or an M
combo
share your setup so others can see and
perhaps I'll move on to that direction
make sure to like this video if you'd
like to see more audio reviews later on
the road or down the road make sure to
subscribe for more similar reviews as
well and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
