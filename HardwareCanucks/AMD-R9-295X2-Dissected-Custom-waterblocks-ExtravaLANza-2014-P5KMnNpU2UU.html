I'm the product manager for the Radeon
r9 295x2 we're here at AMD's second
extravaganza hashtag AMD extravaganza
for those of you who want to follow us
on Twitter I'm here today with Hardware
Canucks to talk to you a little bit
about our product the r9 295x2 it is the
fastest graphics card in the market
right now undisputed and I wanted to
talk to you a little bit about why we
did some of the things we did with this
product for some of you have been asking
a lot of questions you know why did we
go water-cooling why did we just go
completely all out with this card and I
just wanted to step through some of the
features of the card and explain a
little bit about why we did what we did
with it so here we have the case that
we've sent out the press I actually have
a few of the 290x to a6 here we brought
a few loose Asics just so that you can
see what the chip looks like underneath
the hood I also have a few cards here
we've deconstructed them for you so you
can actually see the mechanics of what's
going on inside here you have the full
complete unit and we have the ASA tech
pumps here one of them is opened up so
you can actually see the impeller inside
and where everything hooks up we have a
bare-bones PCB here with the Asics
actually removed so you can see all the
different components the regulator the
plx bridge of display connectors over
here you can get a close-up of the
actual 295 Asics and the back so this is
where all the magic happens it's quite
amazing that you have all that
performance out of these two little
pieces of silicon so that is quite an
amazing accomplishment and here we have
the back side of the integrated cooling
solution if you were curious to see what
the pumps look like without having to
dismantle your card some questions that
we've been asked from people in the
forum's is you know why did you go with
the closed-loop liquid cooling solution
and one of the main reasons was you know
you're here at Xtravaganza you're gonna
go through and look at all the cases
almost every single person here has a
open-loop liquid cooling solution and
then you have other people with just
your little like compact
PC or HP or you know Lenovo box and we
wanted to bring the the people that were
apprehensive about doing a full
liquid-cooled set up up to the
performance and the ability of everybody
else who you know kind of has the time
to bend tubes and fill their own
radiator so like this right out of the
box you get the performance of a full
liquid cooling solution the other
advantage of this is that you don't have
to mess around with you know fungicide
algaecide mixing coolants and one of the
questions that i keep getting asked is
well how come you didn't put like quick
connects or a lot of people to plug this
into their own system one of the main
reasons for that is we use propylene
glycol and our cooling loop it's the
same fluid that you find in most
automobile radiators and that way it'll
asks for virtually forever because it's
an alcohol-based fluid if we were to
have opened up the loop and allowed you
to hook this into your your own cooling
loop there we couldn't guarantee from
factory you know if you're using just a
pure water setup with a fungicide if
you're using ethylene glycol for those
of you who are in the automotive field I
don't know if you know this but you know
you mix coolants they're all color coded
so that you don't put the wrong coolant
in because when you put one coolant with
another and they're incompatible bad
things happen you sledge up your
radiator and whatnot so you know we
didn't want and users have a bad
experience and the performance is still
very very good from factory a lot of
people were kind of surprised when we
were managed to put you know 500 watts
of power into a single radiator so we
have pretty good engineers here at AMD
and they were able to do some pretty
amazing things with this card as far as
aftermarket coolers for people that want
to go the step beyond I have a couple of
samples here from aqua computer these
guys are really big in Europe we have
here the the nickel-plated version and
the copper version there's also blocks
in the market available by ek water
blocks Swift Tech and coolants I hope
you guys enjoyed listening to our
product
the 295x2 and there's a ton of people
with some amazing case mods in the bland
area so I hope you guys stick around and
check them out
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
