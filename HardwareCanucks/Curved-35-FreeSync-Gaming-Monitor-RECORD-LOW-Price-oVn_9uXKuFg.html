ultra-wide Kurd gimme monitor from pic
Co that came with free support for $600
that was reasonable for an ultra-wide
gaming monitor given we've seen 35 inch
panels with the exact same resolution
that costs up to two times the price if
you interested to learn more about that
monitor you can check it out right over
here but basically I came with an
awesome display we're talking you 34 40
by 1440 resolution a hundred Hertz
refresh rate with an 8 millisecond great
a great response time but there were
some quirks that users had to deal with
like the cheap plastic the quality lack
of support for visa which was a big deal
to be honest and a terrible stand and
I'm sure most of you might be asking
yourselves shouldn't we expect that in a
game II monitor of that caliber in that
price point
not anymore my friends because today
we're checking out something that
literally blows the doors off pic ce
o--'s ultrawide monitor and it's this we
mass drop 35 million ship fast
curve gimme monitor it's priced at $550
that's right my friends it's $50 cheaper
than pics you as offering yet it offers
all the flexibility that gamers can
expect from a gaming monitor so let's
check this out right after this so it
was kind of a love at first sight you
know there's really nothing like this
exterior I love the metallic color the
tinted glass panel the RGB fans at the
front it's basically a see-through case
and who doesn't love that your graphics
card can go vertical the top is radiator
friendly and the right side is so unique
when exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
age 500 feet way cooler master check it
out inscription below before we get into
the design and the panel performance I
want to quickly mention that this
product isn't offered for a limited time
unlike other master products this will
be a regularly stock item so that's nice
let's quickly walk through the specs of
this gaming monitor the vast features a
35 inch curved VA display with a
resolution of 34 40 by 1440 a greater
girl response time of two milliseconds
100 Hertz refresh rate with the cherry
on top being the inclusion of
support ranging from 49 to 100 Hertz and
8-bit color output all for $550 asked
for warranty you get one year for the
panel and a couple years for the
electronics all managed through mass
drop but are these specs and features
worth taking a look at especially for
gamers who are looking to switch to an
ultra wide experience
we'll find out kicking things off with a
design and I think master op has done a
fantastic job for their first gaming
monitor it's simple its subtle the
bezels are pretty minimal so it should
fit in within any disk environment be in
your office home setup etc there
virtually no signs of branding
throughout the panel which is much
appreciated especially if you're
targeting for a cleaner setup plus it
doesn't come with those flashy red and
black aesthetics like some other
high-end monitors we've taken a look at
earlier this year although I would have
preferred an all-black design at least
as an option for buyers as the silver
housing might not fit in within certain
setups I'd love to hear your thoughts on
that though moving on to build quality
I'm giving the vast a B+ since the main
body is mostly constructed in Lumina m--
and it feels rock-solid
however the stand is really weak it's
mostly made out of this cheap plastic
material which really questions
long-term durability and it creaks every
time when I try to adjust a monitor
which was a little bit annoying this
also applies to the included curved base
so please do take note of that
thankfully the vast is vasive compatible
and it supports the 100 by 100
configuration so i'd highly recommend
picking up a third party monitor arm or
stand to avoid those inconveniences on
the positive side this is by far the
most flexible curved ultra wide gaming
monitor that i've ever come across
you've got height adjustment up to 4.3
inches vertical tilt up to 20 degrees
unfortunately there isn't horizontal
tilt and I highly recommend you refrain
from at least trying that since it
really pushes that plastic stand to its
extent but check this out you can rotate
the panel vertically to get this super
weird portrait mode personally it's
pointless because no one's gonna game in
a vertical aspect ratio Plus given the
curvature of the monitor it really is an
ops app perhaps web developers could
take advantage of this feature because
they'd be able to view their lines of
code without having to constantly scroll
up and down but what do you guys think
of this po'trait implementation let me
know in the comments down below the IO
is positioned
on the right side of the monitor for
quicker access we have a single
DisplayPort 1.2 port and three HDMI
ports one of which that supports version
2.0 and the other being 1.4 compliant
now just like the pixie monitor the vas
does not come with USB 3.0 or 2.0 ports
which could be a deal-breaker for some
of you but I don't see myself using USB
ports on a monitor and I'd definitely
like to hear your thoughts about that in
the comments also the power supply for
the panel is built-in so you just need
to plug in the standard three prong
cable and power on the monitor cable
management shouldn't be a concern in
this case I should also mention that
master op has implemented one of the
worst menu navigation system let me walk
you through what exactly had done here
so the vast feature is a little joystick
like button on the back and that also
acts as a power button so do take note
of that entering the menu can be done by
shifting the joystick upwards but things
just go south from there if you need to
go down you'll need to shift the
joystick towards the left and if you
want to go back up you'll have to shift
it towards the right entering the sub
menu can be done by shifting the
joystick up but if you want to back out
you'll have to shift downwards and if
none of that made any sense I'm really
sorry guys but seriously there's no
logic behind this crappy implementation
why not give us physical buttons
underneath the monitor
I'm really hoping mousetrap is taking
notes please fix this anyways moving on
to the centerpiece of this monitor the
display it's a 35 inch panel with a
resolution of 34 40 by 1440
unfortunately it isn't an IPS display
but rather a VA panel just like the one
found on the pics of your monitor and
even the much more expensive predator Z
35 P from Acer all I can say is that
it's far superior than T and no
questions asked definitely expect great
color reproduction especially when
consuming content it's a bit less
vibrant when compared to the IPS display
found on my bank you a PD 3200 Year 4k
display but that's expected at this
price point the viewing angles are
alright I did notice a bit of a contrast
shift when tilting the display it was
basically a similar experience from my
time with the pixi of ultrawide monitor
you could certainly get away with some
content creation but if you're serious
about it I would recommend picking up an
IPS panel since it offers great viewing
angles and different color profiles
speaking of profiles the master monitor
comes with a game
an RTG mode an eco mode and of course a
standard mode
highly recommend you skip all of those
modes because to be honest the game mode
and the RTG completely looks horrible
in fact the RTG just over sharpens the
image absolutely just avoid that stick
with standard mode and you'll be happy
now if your primary usage involves
working with documents or just anything
that's productive apart from content
creation the vast is an excellent option
the 21 by 9 aspect ratio gives you a lot
of horizontal screen real estate and it
really does enhance productivity if
you're interested in the pros and cons
of 21 by 9 versus 16 by 9 monitors check
out this video from Dimitri where he
walks you through pretty much everything
you need to know it's a really great
video now given this is a curved gaming
monitor with a 2 millisecond critical
response time how does a vast play well
with gaming it's fantastic out of the
box it comes with a 100 Hertz refresh
rate so it doesn't involve manual or
clocking unlike Acer's offerings it also
supports Amy's freezing technology
meaning you can experience a tear-free
and smoother gameplay provided you have
a beefier AMD GPU and we'll talk about
that shortly now I spend the majority of
my time pairing this monitor with a gtx
980ti inside my primary workstation PC
since that's what I use on a daily basis
everything from playing battlefield 1 to
overwatch to my recent obsession of
Forza Motorsport 7 I had a smoother
gameplay experience screen tearing was
present at times but it was just there
for a second and since I was already
immersed with the gameplay it was hard
for me to notice any artifacts this is
strictly personal opinion by the way I
didn't manage to test out this monitor
with the RX Vega 64 GPU it involves a
few steps to get it up and running first
you have to have up-to-date drivers then
you'll need to navigate through that
horrible menu system within the monitor
to enable free sync and you're set the
VATS comes with a free sync range of 49
to 100 Hertz so that's a lot more than
the 60 to 100 Hertz range found on the
pixi ultra wine I find a battlefield 1
and it was once again an awesome
experience albeit the frame rates were a
bit lower than what I was able to get
with a 1080 Ti
but given the fantastic response time I
was barely able to notice any artifacts
or screen tearing which was awesome if
you're looking for a good panel that can
handle this recent range I'd highly
recommend it now given that this is a
freezing monitor
makes sense to pair it up with AMD based
GPU but the problem is it just doesn't
make any sense in 2017 first of all the
Vega GPUs are very expensive for what
they are as of right now especially with
a whole mining situation it's really
hard to grab a GPU at a reasonable price
point and of course driving a resolution
of 34 40 by 1440 is tough and most of
the time the Vegas 64 needed to run a
bit lower detail settings to
consistently hit the panel's freesync
range if you currently have a gtx 1070
1080 or 1080i this would be a great
option if you want to just pair it up
and take advantage of that ultra wide
real estate and of course you've got the
hundred Hertz refresh rate and I'm
pretty positive you won't be you know
we're down by the screen tearing issues
or any artifacts because personally I
really enjoyed a gaming on this monitor
with my 1080 Ti before I wrap up this
review I also wanted to mention that I
noticed a few glitches while playing Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon with the Vega GPU I
think it must have been driver related
but I also had a frustrating time my
switching inputs between different pcs
so for instance after testing the
monitor with the RX Vega GPU I switched
back to my primary workstation PC with
the same DisplayPort cable but the
monitor wasn't able to pick up the
signal it only worked out after I reset
it my PC like two times so I found that
to be a little odd I'm not really sure
you know what's really going on perhaps
it had to do with the module that's
built inside the monitor so master up if
you're taking notes this is something
that you can add on to your list with
regards to backlight bleeding I was not
able to identify any of those spots with
my naked eye what you're seeing right
now is shot with my camera set to 320
eyes so cranking that up makes it fairly
evident at the center where you can spot
a little bit of clouding but in
real-world use it's not noticeable well
there you have it guys my experience
with the master op vast 35 inch curved
ultra wide gimmie monitor it really is
an awesome panel for its price but there
are a few clerks obviously that you have
to be aware of for example the very
cheap plastic stand it really is
annoying especially you know if you're
trying to move the monitor here and
there the creak noise is really really
knowing I would highly recommend you
switch it with a third-party monitor arm
and thank last drop for including you
know a base of support for this panel so
you
easily switch this with a third party
monitor armed the other major
frustrating issue with this monitor is
that horrible many navigation system not
really sure how master passed us but it
really was a frustrating experience
especially if you want to tone down the
brightness a little bit or just play
around with the settings it is genuinely
very hard to get through so hopefully
you know master op can fix this with the
production model which is going to hit
later down the year for users to buy and
of course I'll leave a link down below
if you want to check it out so if you're
ready to work around those issues and of
course a few more that I mentioned in
the review then the master advanced
monitor is an excellent option if you're
looking for an ultra wide gaming monitor
in you know that's sub 600 long price
point well that wraps up this review let
me know what you guys think about the
master out fast monitor and in the
comment section down below I'd love to
hear your thoughts especially for the
price that you pay and would you pick
this over the pixie or monitor
definitely have a comment down below I'm
evil with hurricane X thank you so much
