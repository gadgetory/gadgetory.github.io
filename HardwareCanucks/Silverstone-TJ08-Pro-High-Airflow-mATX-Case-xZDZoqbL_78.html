thanks to the following sponsors
show them some love for helping us get
here to Taipei
all right so throughout our time at
Computex I'm very surprised to not have
seen a large selection of micro ITX and
mini ITX cases but very happy to report
the good selection of micro ATX cases
released from silverstone all of which
are based on the interior design of the
very good and almost iconic DJ oh wait
the first one is the TJ wait pro that
would probably be my next microtext case
is that 180 moment air penetrator at the
front and proper open ventilation and
non-restrictive interior would guarantee
outstanding airflow delivery while still
supporting dual modular cages for four
drives in the main compartment the five
and a quarter inch drive bay is
removable and since the mid section at
the front of the fan is open you don't
have to worry about GPU clearance nor
about the temperatures of that graphics
card and the back there are two SSD
brackets and ample of space for cable
management plus an appropriate opening
for the main chamber behind which you
can secure all the cables thanks to
various cables and hoops behind the top
dust filter our dual 120mm fan mounts
that they're offset closer to the sides
for better clearance but notice the
filter spans the entire width of the
case for better looks now what's cool
about the TJ o 8 pro are dual USBC type
connectors at the top along with
standard USB 3.0 making this case future
proof with upcoming c-type integration
we are told the C type connector will
use the same 19 pin cable as what is
used by the USB 3.0 so it'll be just a
matter of motherboard compatibility to
take advantage of all these USB ports at
the top the next case in this lineup is
PS 0 7e I told them their naming scheme
should probably change so if you have
any feedback on this matter let us know
in the comments but this case as you can
see is the silent version of the same
frame found on the TJ oh wait I love the
silver aluminum strip integrated both on
the front and the top to give the case
some character the front panel swivels
to open that has sound dampening
material applied with the removable dust
filter and dual high static pressure
friends of 120 millimeters for
take as for the frame itself it's
identical to the Chi go8 would sound
dampening material on each panel but I
really like how both of these cases are
very different to suit either airflow
high performance or silent PC lastly is
there C 380 that there's more of a
storage / server direction with
unpainted interior to fit the guidelines
of for system integrators behind the
front panel are all these accessible
drive caddies because they're all hot
swappable with 8 in total and the mid
section for dual 92 minimum fans the hot
swappable design is awesome and I could
see this being handy for media transfers
and just to minimize the hassle and this
is what the interface looks like when
the cables pointing into the main
chamber now one of the cool things about
the front panel is you can actually lock
the power button from the inside so you
don't accidentally power off your PC
during important data processing or
transfer and apparently you can also dim
the power LED a feature that is found on
most of Silverstone's
HTTP sees the cool the drives there's a
single 120mm fan attached to each cage
with a removable dust filter on the side
panel and so this entire new micro ATX
case selection from silverstone is
really awesome with specific targeted
use on each chassis and that personally
cannot wait to build the gaming system
inside the TJ 8 pro but let us know
which case interests you the most so we
can publish a full review in the near
future
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
