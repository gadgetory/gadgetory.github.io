Canucks you have uber behind the camera
we have asked somewhere in the
background there pash maybe maybe I have
a arm oh there he is
hello ash how are you yes so this going
to be a feedback type of video just like
a few minutes ago I asked for your
feedback on this case yes so this going
to be a feedback type of video where
we're checking out the salman x7 it's
like a prototype alpha type of stages so
we need your feedback to see what you
like what you don't like what you want
to see changed
and basically all that stuff huge thanks
to our Computex sponsors for sending us
out here shoutout to Nvidia fantex and
cix and msi the samel x7 is a full tower
I've got a beautiful almost very uniform
and clean lines there debating between
aluminum or steel I'm you know nudging
towards aluminum because it usually
feels more premium but if the steel is
thick enough perhaps it can maintain the
same rigidity and level of quality and
confidence and that we get in aluminum
cases the interior is quite standard but
it's very large very open with a 360 and
the 280 moment radiator support both to
the top and the front with 360 or triple
120 s and dual 140 millimeter fans
supported in those respective spots the
power supply shroud is kind of divided
in two so you can remove the first part
if you need that extra space for you
know radiator or not radiators but water
cooling components but you also can
install fans in that spot so I could you
couldn't stop Raiders in that spot I'm
just realizing the power supply area
also has a little window so it showcase
what power supply model number you're
running and stuff and it's a pretty nice
uniform cutout fits in with the whole
design very well for motherboard support
because it's such a large enclosure
obviously EA TX and XL ATX motherboards
are supported there's going to be two
SSD drive slots maybe more depending on
the final stages I would definitely say
maybe like a four because there is
enough room there and also the hard
drive cage that sits on top of the power
supply chamber that's removable and
can go to two more in the bottom chamber
that is also modular so you can maneuver
around it's not the most pleasing to the
eye in terms of the that hard drive cage
being on top of the power supply bracket
but it is still functional so at least
you know if you need extra hard drive
storage you can populate it there the
fan support for the top is a nice little
bracket that can be removed so you can
install all your fans and radiators
outside the bracket and I'm hoping that
they they can accommodate for wide and
thick radiator support so that if you
install a 280 or a 360 mm or radiator
there with a set of fans that when you
go to slide that bracket back in place
it's not going to interfere with any of
the motherboards and stuff and the same
thing goes for the front panel or the
front side where you can install
radiator set of fans and have a nice
look cut out over there power supply
chambers so that you have enough width
so there is no compatibility and
clearance issues if you decide to do
water cooling routable top in the bottom
really good pineapple cooking from
Taiwan so design wise I think I like the
direction that Zalman is taking this
with very simple nice lines there's a
slim LED at the front that is RGB you'll
be able to connect their Zalman
accessories for the interior so an LED
strip that will connect to the entire
lighting system control everything be
uniform nice we've seen that for
multiple cases in the past it's great
that Zaman is following that same
direction there is also a five and a
quarter inch drive bay above the panel
so when you close and open the panel
it's not intrusive so that you know you
keep the uniform the front panel very
nice and clean without affecting the
interior and overall I think the
direction is there so we like your
feedback and Zalman would love your
feedback on what you'd like to see more
in the future release of course this
going to be this is still in alpha it's
gonna take a while for it to go in beta
but there's still time to implement all
the feedback that you that you provide
in the comments down below so make sure
to go crazy you know
a keyboard warrior and tell us or tell
Salman what you want to see from this
