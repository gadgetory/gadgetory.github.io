computer peripherals with this product
showcase and what a better way to start
it off than with this futuristic hybrid
keyboard from eclipse this is the
wireless light touch keyboard and it's
not really intended for gamers so much
as it is for home and office use
it has a very professional feel and adds
that little bit of tech goodness to make
people really take notice the wireless
version of the keyboard retails for
approximately $100 so there is
definitely a bit of an extra cost to get
your gimmicky goodies so let's take a
look it has a full sized 87 key physical
keypad and includes a relatively
comfortable rubber wrist rest now the
design is very slim less than an inch
thick and while being relatively
lightweight it definitely has a solid
construction it's not that cheap flimsy
plastic feel at the back you see you can
raise it with the usual snap feet there
is a discrete power button and it uses a
USB connection for charging or
connecting to your PC and of course the
most important feature the LCD touch
panel ok well it's actually just sticker
on a piece of glass at the bottom of the
touch panel our left and right mouse
buttons as well as a blackberry styled
mini trackball then you have the
three-and-a-half inch by two and a half
inch LCD now turning the LCD on shows a
virtual button numpad layout illuminated
in white the physical keys as well are
also backlit so let's put this keyboard
to work and see how well it fares in the
office and as you can see in regular
light the LCD is actually quite bright
it has a perfect viewing angle from just
about any angle I found this pretty
typical with media keyboards but the
wrist rest is a bit short for normal
typing but as far as the actual physical
keyboard goes it is really well designed
so moving on to the use of the LCD the
first thing I noticed was that it can
take a bit of time to grow accustomed to
tapping on the flat glass I started off
having to repeat my typing quite
frequently without the same physical
cues of a regular keyboard
there is a tendency to miss things but
then again this isn't really intended
for extensive typing there are three
separate displays that can be used with
the touch panel all that have a unique
set of 18 keys the first being the
regular numpad on the right there is the
option to adjust the LCDs brightness
which also doubles as a volume control
it also shows the battery life and
signal strength the next screen is media
mode here you find options such as the
calculator a whole bunch of file options
such as access to your favorites or
anything in my documents and the other
typical media keys finally my Eclipse
mode here you have full customization
options you can attach keys to launch
your favorite game open up whatever
website or focus on any installed
program however all of the icons are
locked in there's no uploading or
altering them so you are stuck working
your shortcuts around the icon images
that Eclipse has provided mind you they
have also included five numbered keys on
the my Eclipse screen which are a little
more ambiguous and that wraps up the
product showcase on the eclipse wireless
light touch keyboard now I can't say I
would enjoy a fully touch panel keyboard
but the way this feature combines what
would normally take 54 separate keys is
pretty brilliant and very well
implemented sure it's a bit of a novelty
product but if you can look past the
gimmicky nature it actually has quite a
bit of usefulness and it offers a degree
of flexibility that you can't find on
any other keyboard as the wireless light
touch keyboard is one of the first of
its kind at least with a reasonable
price tag and overall a very well
designed and solid product it has to be
awarded as pretty damn innovative hope
you guys enjoyed this review and
definitely subscribe to get more video
updates we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
