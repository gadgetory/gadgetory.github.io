Electronics Canada and the director of
marketing for mobile communications and
I'm here to talk about the new Galaxy
Note which we're launching on February
the 14th across the three national
carriers in Canada we're very excited
the first thing about the Galaxy Note
that you'll notice is it has a big
beautiful Super AMOLED screen at 5.3
inches and that will be one of the
defining features of this device it's
clearly bigger as a smart phone concept
but what we're really offering consumers
is a product that is more data optimized
than existing smartphones one that looks
at the at the fact that we have a
smartphone reference case at about 4
inches and tablets that are 7 to 10 but
really nothing in between that tries to
blend the benefits of a tablet in terms
of the size and being able to access all
those great applications on the Android
Market and use that but also still a
voice that or a product that is
convenient enough to carry with you at
all times so that it can be a voice
device so the first thing to understand
is that yes you can make a call on this
device this is a voice enabled LTE based
device and and we're intending it for
use as a primary device and one that you
would carry with you at all times so let
me give you a little bit of a quick tour
so as I said 5.3 inch Super AMOLED
screen HD resolution so 1280 by 800
resolution able to playback Full HD
videos can capture them as well on the 8
megapixel camera on the back there's a 2
megapixel camera on the front as well
for video chat and and those kinds of
capabilities if I just take off the the
back case here for a quick second I'll
show you some of the expansion
capabilities so there is there's a sim
card in there and this happens to be
with Rogers as I said will be across the
board with with all carriers and then we
also have a micro SD card and it'll
accept up to 32 gigabytes in in addition
to the 16 that's onboard and then we
have a battery in here that's removable
which is a 2500 milliamp battery that is
intended to be a little bit larger than
what you're seeing
in conventional smartphones because we
recognize that as a primary device one
with a large screen and high-level
processing that you'll probably that
you'll you'll need that kind of juice to
stage sort of active all day long
the other defining quality about the the
galaxy note is that as I just sort of
put this back in place is that it comes
with a device called an S Pen which is
housed and the device itself tucks away
in the bottom sort of pull it out with
your fingernail and it's we call this an
S Pen and different than other other or
past attempts to to introduce a stylus
into mobile devices it has intelligence
built-in and responsiveness that we
haven't seen before it also has this
little button on it and that button has
functionality so that's suggesting that
it's more than just sort of a passive
piece of plastic here reacting to a
capacitive screen there is technology
built into the pen and into the screen
itself that is more precise and is more
realistic in terms of a pen on paper
experience than we've seen before and I
think those who have you know seen
attempts of the industry to do this
before saying why Samsung why well the
answer I think is simple if you consider
that if we're going to try to provide
something that's effective for all day
use of that is your primary device part
of what people carry around is still a
pen and notebook that's pretty well
universal which suggests that as an
industry then found the right solution
yet so it's still something worth
pursuing and where we are in terms of
being able to introduce responsive
screen technology and simple utilities
as far advanced compared to where we've
been before so we see the pen as
something the s-pen is something that
adds value to the device rather than
imposes itself because the one thing I
should mention is that this device is in
every other way a continuation of the
Galaxy S Galaxy S 2 family that we've
built all of the TouchWiz navigation the
ability to type the ability to swipe if
you would like in terms of navigation
understanding of voice commands all of
that is still built into this Galaxy
Note but on top of that we still see
this desire for people to want to
express themselves or interact with
occasions using a pen to to draw to
annotate to make personalized comments
and it's something that adds value to
their experience and it's something that
we have built into this device so our I
guess the other port I should make in
terms of performance is around the fact
that it is LTE capable so we you know I
think we have talked about the fact that
in Canada we have very leading networks
our carriers are doing a great job of
introducing latest technology to
Canadian consumer and we wanted to take
advantage of that at Samsung so this is
coming out with with LTE capable radio
as well and that will obviously affect
people across the country as those LTE
networks roll out across the three
carriers so in terms of just a couple of
maybe just a couple of points in terms
of applications that are unique you know
and again as I'm just sort of swiping my
finger across and you recognize the fact
that it it understands those gestures
all of those things that you've been
familiar with the ability to sort of set
up your own screens and customise those
and a lot of the again a lot of the
functionality that you're used to seeing
but maybe one simple demonstration would
be hey you know I I want to you know
capture a quick image perhaps it's a map
so I launched the Maps application I
used the pen in that case I could use my
finger I want to make a simple image
capture I press down on the little
button here then it captures that image
that image is now in the clipboard that
image is available to crop and edit that
image is also available to kind of make
little simple annotations on so you know
the briefing is here and let's meet at 9
o'clock there and I could hand right in
on this you know hi there's my brutal
handwriting on the side and I could then
take this into an application I can
share it in all kinds of different ways
through you know social media or through
the utility that we provide and that
utility is s-memo actually which perhaps
I'll show so it has a you know a simple
graphic is now embedded into the into
the memo application that I could also
send save and send
document as you might expect the
interesting thing as well I think is we
not only can you kind of write on this
as you you know you can change the pen
settings by the way that happens to be
in paintbrush mode but I can also type I
could also type on to this memo so again
you can use the pen as you wish or you
can type we are whether sideways thing
is tough so I should have probably set
that up in fact I like to swipe we are
here I find my here1 to that memo of
pretty simply as well so that's one of
the use cases that we are thinking about
in terms of you know how my depend on
value to be able to annotate to be able
to set up this quick memo kind of
function now if I go back to the home
screen for a second let's say I'm using
any application I can quickly double tap
on the screen by pressing down that
button and it brings that note memo up
you know this is akin to a person who is
you know doing something and then
suddenly I have to jot down a phone
number or a quick note or a message so
rather than looking for a pen and a
piece of paper has a simple memo
application that you can use so those
are a couple of the I think benefits of
having a pen built-in and something from
a Value Added point of view that that
adds adds to the device so I said we're
very excited we'll have this product in
in volume starting on February the 14th
across you know national retailers and
carriers and looking forward to it thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
