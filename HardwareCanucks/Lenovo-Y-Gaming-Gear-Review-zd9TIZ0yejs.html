extremely saturated with an abundance of
established brands and new players
entering the market that means it's
becoming increasingly difficult to stand
out from the crowd that's why the newest
entry Lenovo was quite the surprise
Lenovo is a company with very little
gaming accessory history but they've
decided to enter this crowded space with
our why gaming series mechanical
keyboard and mouse along with some other
items but are they unique enough to
stand out from the crowd and to bring
something new to the market are they
even good enough to be termed proper
gaming peripherals let's take a look the
first thing to examine is the price
point that Lenovo is targeting since
these aren't inexpensive the why gaming
keyboard is priced at $139.99 and the
mouse at $69.99 these are pretty high
price points which leads me to believe
they are obviously targeted at the
premium peripheral market and as such
expectations for these accessories are
understandably high instead of competing
against mid-level offerings Lenovo is
going straight for the throat of
higher-end options from established
players like Razer Logitech and Corsair
let's take a look at the why gaming
keyboard one of the first things to
notice the switches chosen by Lenovo as
this board is using ko red switches for
those unfamiliar cable switches are
generally a less expensive alternative
to Cherry MX switches they feel similar
but are often regarded as being of lower
quality while in my experience I haven't
had any longevity issues with ko
switches and their tactile feedback is
actually quite good it's usually
expected that the lower cost of the
switches is passed along to the consumer
via a more affordable product that
doesn't seem to be happening here
instead Lenovo seems to have decided
that the other add-on features or higher
overall build quality is worth the extra
price the build uses a rigid plastic
which has very little flex and overall
seems pretty solid considering the wide
gaming keyboard is competing at the
markets pinnacle the build isn't
anything groundbreaking but it's fairly
solid you have a detachable wrist rest
with a textured plastic design and a
finish which is also used on the space
bar overall I quite like this texture
and it feels comfortable although I wish
that the wrist rest was a little longer
for better support there's also a very
thick one point eight metre braided
cable which terminates in USB for
connection to the PC on the board itself
there's an area which houses convenient
pass reports for headphones a mic and
USB
unfortunately the USB port is only
version 2 compatible so don't expect
full speed from you USB 3 devices if
they're plugged into it coming back to
the board there are 4 media controls
with buttons that provide a nice tactile
feedback as well as a Windows key lock
profile switching and brightness control
speaking of brightness control the Y
gaming keyboard only has a single color
backlight red this is somewhat
understandable since it's meant to match
Lenovo's current gaming desktop and
notebook line up the red backlighting is
controlled with 4 levels of brightness
however lenovo has chosen the WASD Keys
and the arrow keys to be controlled
separately so you can choose to light
just those keys if you want a nice touch
we'll take a look at macros a little
later but first let's check out the
typing experience overall these kale red
switches feel very similar to Cherry MX
Reds with the nice actuation on an
overall satisfying feedback I personally
prefer the click air profile of blue or
brown switches but for those who like
the linear actuation of red switches
you'll probably enjoy these my only
issue is not with the switch but rather
with the spacebar I found that it has a
little bit of squeak and while it's very
minor and pretty quiet I found it
extremely annoying after use and started
to loathe using it it's a very quiet
noise but I found that it detracted from
the experience keep in mind this issue
could be exclusive to this unit but
regardless it's something to keep in
mind now to get an idea of the volume of
these switches here's a sound sample
last stop is the macro functionality on
the board you have seven macro G keys
and three profiles for these keys to
program them you'll probably want to
grab the software for the keyboard which
is barely mentioned in the documentation
leant over on your website please make
it clear to where to download the
software listing it as a driver is not
adequate once we get into the software
we can configure seven keys with macros
shortcuts and various other functions
because there are three profiles we can
have an effective 21 macro Keys stored
at once which will be great for either
productivity or micromanagement in games
while I'm not a big user of macros some
users will definitely love this
functionality so what can be concluded
about this keyboard at $139.99 there
sports competitors have high build
quality genuine Cherry MX switches great
software unique features and some even
have RGB lighting across the board the
lenovo y gaming keyboard is remarkably
average it doesn't do anything badly but
it does nothing that stands out either
there's nothing that will seriously
disappoint but it fails to impress
across the board and for the money there
are better options available now let's
shift our attention to the Y Gaming
Mouse it also keeps this black and red
design of the keyboard with a pulsating
red light in the middle and once again a
choice of one lighting color red Feist
at $69.99 this mouse isn't inexpensive
so like the keyboard it's priced to
impress there are a couple of things
that stand out immediately with this
mouse firstly it has quite a unique
angular design and it's obviously a very
large Mouse these two elements could
cause issues for some gamers so how does
the build quality and comfort stack up
for me the build is a bit too plasticy
the materials don't feel up to the Y
gaming mouses high price and while the
plastic feels fairly decent I would have
liked to see a better build the smooth
plastic feels fairly good but it picks
up fingerprints and the small cube
texture on the edges are mainly
aesthetic as I found my hand didn't
actually utilize them as gripping
surfaces Lenovo's design is rather
interesting as I said this is a large
Mouse measuring about 12 centimeters in
length
script with is about seven centimeters
so it will be suitable for people with
large hands personally I find most
comfortable mice have a two-to-one
length to grip ratio and while this
isn't exactly it it's fairly close
however it's worth noting that the base
flares out much wider and then narrows
dramatically at the end now suction
comes down to personal decisions since
what suits one person will be
uncomfortable for another however if
there was ever a mouse you need to try
it before you buy it's the Lenovo Y
gaming precision Mouse there is a good
amount of adjustability since unlike
with to many other mice these days
there's a weight system included on the
bottom with four or five gram weights
for customization this is a nice touch
for those who want a slightly more
personalized experience the next thing
you'll notice about the design is the
very deep side groove on the mouse the
sides cut in quite deep and these ankles
are implemented to support the thumb in
a more natural position it's intended to
be more comfortable however due to the
shape size and the depth of the groove I
ended up miss positioning my hand where
it would be properly supported by this
groove but my thumb ended up sitting on
the edge instead of being supported as
an example of where this type of design
works is in my g 602 where the edge
supports the thumb whereas the edge on
the Y Gaming Mouse feels just strange
and not that comfortable all in all I
just don't find the Y Gaming Mouse any
more comfortable than many conventional
designs the last thing to look at before
we move to the center is the mouse wheel
and these switches the Y Gaming Mouse is
using high quality on one switches and
these really need no introduction they
feel great as always and a precise and
end up being enjoy to use
there's also dpi toggle which has
distinguished actuation and LEDs to show
the DPI level the scroll wheel on top is
pretty average it's too easy to scroll
which can lead to accidental scrolling
and wheel has some side-to-side movement
scroll steps a decent but overall the
wheel isn't great on the mouse's left
click we have two more buttons and while
these are a bit thin they are very
clicky although for me I would prefer a
little less force for actuation and
lastly we see the side buttons which are
quite different when compared to most
other gaming mice this is one large
triangular button and a longer
rectangular button both in somewhat
weird positions at first I disliked the
location of these buttons but as I've
used them I've actually grown to quite
like their functionality and have found
them quite easy to use and map my one
complaint is the buttons are a little
bit mushy by
otherwise I don't have many issues now
let's take a look at the sensor and the
accommodating software Lenovo has
software customization for this mouse
with the first tab offering button
rebinding and macro commands which is
cool being able to customize all these
buttons is par for the course for gaming
mice and allows for full utilization of
the buttons regardless of applications
being used moving on to the sensor
customization you really have only the
basics with dpi adjustment ranging from
a great 400 dpi minimum all the way up
to 8200 scroll speed polling rate up to
a thousand Hertz and brightness control
these are really the only bare
necessities you don't have any lift off
distance control or any more detailed
controls so I found the software was
pretty basic and a bit lackluster and
last up is sensor performance we'll open
up Photoshop firstly and do the straight
line test for prediction and jitter and
we'll also draw a circle to test for any
skipping there's no apparent jitter and
prediction looks cool with no skipping
issues coming up either but the best
place to test the mouse is where it's
going to be used so let's launch up csgo
the first thing to look at is how it
handles fast flicks and it tracks
reliably at high speeds the why Gaming
Mouse doesn't have any issues here and
it handles flicks reliably at any speed
in terms of tracking smoothly and
accurately at all speeds I don't have an
issues which is great however while I
found that there weren't many issues
that were extremely evident I just
didn't feel quite as accurate as other
mice I think this was in part the sensor
but also me getting used to the glide of
the mouse it glides extremely smoothly
thus making it feel faster than other
mice and it takes some getting used to a
rule the sensor didn't have any major
issues but I wasn't impressed by the
overall accuracy and didn't feel as
precise so let's sum things up the
learner of our Y Gaming Mouse isn't a
standout peripheral at its asking price
if it were half of what it costs
currently it would be a much more
compelling product I'll be honest here
while it's great if you have larger
hands the mouse just doesn't stand out
anywhere and the competing products
outshine it across the board as for the
Y gaming keyboard there's a similar
story being told this is generally a
really solid keyboard but it comes in at
a price which demands perfection or
innovation and it doesn't deliver on
either of those needs of the keyboard or
mouse are bad overall but the pricing
just isn't there compared to the
competition both are very good for A's
into the game market
could form the starting point of
competitive lineup but at their current
prices many gamers may just pass on them
and end up buying better known
alternatives so thank you for watching
