fantex schoolmaster containment what's
up guys to meet you and our connect and
the very exciting motherboard across our
eyes as we are passing by Azeroth so
this is an ex 299 ITX motherboard and
that's exciting promotional reasons one
was this particular motherboard we have
six SATA connections and that's very
rare to find on an IT expert usually we
get like two or four but for this
platform before going for like something
storage related server related on this
form factor is really cool next we have
three m dot two slots the one is right
beside the socket and two underneath the
motherboard next we have four sodium's
locks so you can blow up the memory you
can occupy them all saturate all your
memory saturate all your drive storage
and saturate all your SATA connections
too and if you notice there to sort of
revamp the entire layout of where things
are located so ok I'm going to step in
here because the microphone wasn't doing
such a good job picking up the audio on
the show floor but this board is not
simply a proof of concept it will
actually go and sale in just a few weeks
so did a drug have to make any
sacrifices to fit such a large socket on
such a small board of course but we were
totally surprised by how capable this
little guy really is it's actually
pretty funny to see the new 2066 socket
that's taking up so much room on that
PCB now aside from needing so the memory
you will also need to give up x2 99s
capability for a huge number of PCIe
slots since the ITX form factor only
allows for a single x16 slot other
connectivity comes with a dual band
wireless AC Wi-Fi interface and native
support for front and rear panel USB 3.1
gen2 and so far this model may be one of
the smallest motherboards we have seen
at Computex but it's also one the most
exciting one still because it is X 299
in this ITX form factor okay but the
next unique motherboard we saw it as
rock is the H 110 Pro BTC plus as you
can see it has a massive 13 PCIe slots
and it is based off a very affordable
chipset so what is going on here well as
Rock shows off wacky stuff every year
but this one may actually be pretty
convenient for some people and as the
name suggests this board specifically
targets buyers who mine cryptocurrencies
like Bitcoin or litecoin and the idea is
to give them
expensive board that can run a large
number of miners all running
concurrently in a single system and
obviously this motherboard has been in
development for quite some time since
the H 110 is a bit as a bit old but we
think it fits the H 110 Pro BTC plus
market perfectly and someone can easily
buy inexpensive used skylake processor
pop it in and use the CPUs onboard
graphics and with that configuration all
16 PCIe lanes from the processor can be
dedicated towards providing data for the
motherboards 13 slots and asrock even
provided in the supplementary molex
power input to ensure all those slots
receive enough power there are of course
some limitations here to do to large
number of slots a single slot add-in
cards need to be used also we have to
remember that a lot of cryptocurrencies
mining has moved away from traditional
pcie-based adding cards towards more
efficient dedicated a6 and these days
it's almost impossible to achieve
profitability with GPU based mining and
there aren't any pcie-based Asics yet so
we have to wonder whether or not this
motherboard is a great idea that's
simply based on an older outdated
strategy and so that's it for azrog the
mining board and super-tiny
x 299 both are relevant on the market
today but let us know which one you are
excited for the most in the comments as
usual continue to follow us for more
