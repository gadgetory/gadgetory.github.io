worryfree backup and storage but all
terabytes must eventually enter the red
territory my system health screams for
attention my spare is as these have run
out and USB sticks are just too small
and this whole 100 percent filled
capacity will end once and for all
welcome home the new iron wolf Pro that
12 terabyte monster from Seagate is how
we like to roll in total we have 8
terabytes for 96 terabytes of capacity I
can't even comprehend how much that is
but I'm excited to setup the safety net
for backup so let's do it right into
this the new Toshiba access 700 external
SSD comes in this beautiful and
minimalistic design its ultra portable
form factor is perfect for creative
professionals on the go and with
blazing-fast USB 3 gen 2 transfer speeds
and toshiba's excellent three-year
warranty reliability shouldn't be a
concern
check out the X's 700 from Toshiba down
below
all right so yes we got me another NAS
and the reason why we went for something
from Synology and not build our own
server or do something with 45 drives
which by the way we are working with and
we are developing our own server in
Montreal so stay tuned for all those
updates but here locally I just wanted
to have something that is going to be
future proof that will store or be able
to store a ton of footage that is going
to last for years and just not have to
worry about those red lines peeking out
and filling out our terabytes of
capacity for backup and archiving
because I don't delete any of my stuff
everything that I record right now is
going to be uploaded to that eventual
you know a server so just having as much
capacity as available to me is awesome
and so we've been working with Synology
and Seagate to kind of make this happen
so with Synology we got Dias eighteen
seventeen so the NAS is pretty awesome
it's got a base it's pretty advanced in
terms of functionality we have two fans
in the back there are four Ethernet
ports two of which are ten gigabit per
second speeds which are awesome once I
get my switch once I get the motherboard
that has a 10 gigabit ethernet speeds
that's going to be utilized very well
right now with my ITX system it isn't
but the whole idea of gathering
components not all at once but you are
slowly gathering things and obviously
connecting that to a future system will
not be an issue we also have two USB 3
ports at the back for external storage
and SATA ports at the back too for
connecting everything that there's going
to be visible on my network just some
options that I appreciate now the reason
why we decided to go with TS 18:17 is
because of its size so we have eight
bays which is awesome but look at how
tiny it is it's about the size of an ATX
motherboard and height-wise is just the
height of one of the drives so that's
awesome I can stash this under my
bookcase you know out of sight out of
mind I don't need a server rack I don't
need additional case somewhere so the
convenience factor is a bonus to me and
while yes it is an expensive piece just
enclosure itself is about
hundred dollars and then the drives
themselves are about $500 apiece
you know the whole combination becomes a
bit expensive but the convenience factor
of just having the enclosure and being
able to plug in the drives and have
everything set up automatically it's
kind of a bonus to me and I'm already
familiar with the DSM interface from
Synology so using and setting everything
up is just simple the NAS also comes
with two ethernet cables a set of lock
keys for those front bays and instead of
screws for a two and a half inch drives
and a power cable
now those twelve turbine capacity drives
are awesome because I was able to fill
12 terabytes in about a year and this is
with conservative archiving so deleting
some things that I know I might not be
able to use and now I don't have to
worry these drives have a five-year
warranty and 300 terabytes of user
workload data rate per year I will not
be able to come even close to that
usage statistic now it was extremely
satisfying populating all those eight
drives into it actually I really
appreciate the toolless procedure with
those brackets on the side and yeah it
was time to power the sucker on plug
this thing into my router it's still
going into a basic router so I'm not
receiving the full benefits of the speed
I am limited to one gigabit per second
transfer rights because of that router
but still knowing that I have a lot more
capacity and bandwidth above what I'm
currently using is awesome for the
eventual time when I upgrade my router
and the motherboard to support the ten
gigabit per second speed now the entire
setup procedure is super simple but the
most important thing is naming your
server I think the name of come up with
is super fitting the Iron Throne is now
alive and after entering the nas all
eight drives were detected that's
excellent news and for my storage volume
I decide to go with raid 6 which gives
me two disk redundancy which means if
two discs fail I can still recover the
entire volume but for for high-end hard
drives like the eye room of pros you
know I'm not expecting anything to go
wrong but I still have that peace of
mind because I will be migrating my
entire
volume you know there is no additional
backup aside from this one so hopefully
everything goes smoothly and so far with
my DS 16 play no issue is there now I
will say the noise levels of the NAS
with a drives populated inside is
audible
it's not something that I was expecting
or prepared for because my D s 16 play
is super quiet can never hear it but
it's something to keep in mind if you
are like putting it on a shelf and you
can hear the stuff so I will be putting
it at the bottom where it's not visible
and not audible so just something to
keep in mind and so the Iron Throne
lives 65 terabytes of usable storage
remember we are using 2 disks for
redundancy so that storage is not being
counted for the total capacity but sixty
five terabytes is awesome I can finally
offload all the archived footage and
video projects from my USB sticks into
the NAS but I'm so excited because so
much weight has been lifted off my
shoulders this additional 65 terabyte
buffer means that for next like two
three years minimum we won't have to
worry about even filling half that
capacity and so now I just you know it's
awesome I love it and so big thanks to
you Synology and Seagate for making this
whole thing happen
you know storage stuff usually is not
that exciting but when you're dealing on
something of that scale four terabytes
that's pretty damn exciting alright guys
hope you enjoyed this one make sure to
check out this other relevant content
make sure to subscribe to our new boot
sequence Channel and that yeah I'll see
you in the next video that will be fully
backed up nothing deleted these are the
days yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
