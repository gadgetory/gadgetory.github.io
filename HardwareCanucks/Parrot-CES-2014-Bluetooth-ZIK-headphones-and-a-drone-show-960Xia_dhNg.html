is brought to you by and see IX
technology connected hey guys we are
here and Herod boot and who knew that
they'll be expanding into headphones I
certainly didn't know that I thought
they were mainly sort of with drones and
other things but they do have a lot of
actually cool things here at CES 2014
one of them is this bluetooth wireless
of course wireless headphone this is the
parents Zeke as you can see they are
quite elegant they come in this both
golden and sort of beige color and black
leather materials very nice construction
seems like it is some type of i'm not
sure if there is metal some type of
metal in here but they are very nice and
comfortable a few very cool features
about this headset so they are active
noise-cancelling so there are
microphones actually located inside the
ear cups to sort of accept the noise
from the outside and cancel that out
when you're listening to any of your
songs that's awesome so we have been on
an off button right there we have a
natural 3.5 millimeter jack to you know
if you want to connect them for your
iphone and a micro USB cable for
charging this well of course the
microphones can also be acting as if
you're you pick up the phone call or
something like that but one very a sort
of impressive feature is once you put
them on their active noise-cancelling so
i practically cannot hear myself but
they do have capacitive touch controls
on the ear cup as you can see it's very
plain but tapping the
besides here we'll play and pause you
can swipe left to right to switch
between songs and you can go up to
adjust your volume so I had certainly
surely had no idea that parent expanded
into headphones and so far from what
I've heard they sound pretty decent for
a bluetooth headphone they also
nfc-enabled so just simply by touching
your phone today right earcup that will
enable the NFC they'll enable the
connection they are 399 so there are
more premium product and that's exactly
sort of what we've been seeing from
bluetooth headphone can bluetooth
headsets and headphones that are here at
CES they also the cables are not exposed
and they are sort of engraved into the
metal parts and they go around the Year
bud so this is Paris Zeke very awesome
and very cool bluetooth headphone here
at CES but he also produce a lot of
drones and sarah parent has developed or
their name popularity from their drones
so now we are we have one in the office
so watch out for the review that's
coming later but now we'll just go with
the b-roll and show you another all the
other drones that we have here is
