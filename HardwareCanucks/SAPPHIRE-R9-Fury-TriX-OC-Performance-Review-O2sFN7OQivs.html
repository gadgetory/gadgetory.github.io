when I do the finance baby room for
activities modularity stripped down all
you want yeah no problem with the heat
either know what I mean
looking for an intimate moment define s
is something sexy
hey guys Eva here with hurricane axe and
the launch of AMD's fiji graphics core
in the r9 fury ax marks an important
point in the time for the graphics card
market the fury ax was a winner on many
fronts and highlighted amy's rising
confidence but ultimately in many games
it performed just a few percentage
points below the card that was designed
to compete with the 1980 eye to broaden
the appeal of their new architecture AMD
is expanding the fury lineup with an
air-cooled model called the r9 fury
placing it right in between the 980 TI
and 980 in price and performance metrics
at $550 it occupies a price slot Nvidia
seems to miss out on
so the model we have here is the
sapphire r9 fury for gigabyte tri x OC
which uses a gigantic cooler to keep the
temperatures of the PG core and its
associated HBO memory modules under
control while the board partners for the
fury X were limited to the reference
water cooling design will see only
custom coolers with the r9 Fury
initially the PCB will remain in the
reference design specs once the fury is
utilizing a slightly cut-down vgx deeper
core now with 3584 stream processors so
versus the 4098 found on the fury x so
expect a 10% performance difference
between the two engine clock hits the
thousand megahertz mark which is 50
megahertz lower than the fury ax while
the memory still runs at 500 megahertz
on the memory clock sapphires
overclocked model bumps things up a bit
to 10:40 megahertz but it doesn't touch
the memory clocks but that 4 gigabytes
of high bandwidth memory is still set up
on a massive 4096 big bus granting the
GPU substantially more bandwidth than
any current gddr5 card meanwhile the TDP
is set to 275 watts priced at $550 for
the stock card and $570 for sapphires
overclocked version the r9 Furies should
make a pretty big splash in the market
however we hope prices will remain below
$600 even for custom designs since any
higher and the card certainly won't be
as competitive so what's so special
about the Fiji core in essence it boils
down to the memory design and the PCB
layout video memory modules are now
stacked on top of each other on GPU die
itself instead of surrounding the core
on a conventional GPU this allows for
quicker communication lower power and a
much more compact design the lack of a
closed loop water cooler though means
the r9 fury doesn't see the full
advantage of this PCB reduction for the
end user
our sapphire fury is 12 inches in length
a full 1.5 inches longer than the Nvidia
cards is designed to compete with the
PCB is still 7.5 inches and consequently
it'll be a cooler size the determined
size compatibility of AMD's r9
Yuriy despite the enormous size there's
no denying the perfect fit of the Triax
cooler on the fury it just looks great
the cooler has 390 millimeter dual ball
bearing aerofoil fans with the total of
seven heat pipes spread throughout the
dense aluminum heatsink and it's
directly attached to the solid copper
plate under light or idle load defense
don't kick in so you get a perfectly
silent car taking a look around you can
see the oversized cooler extending
beyond the PCB that has a gorgeous
aluminum backplate with a few color
matched strips with seamlessly
transition onto the frame of the
heatsink the only potential issue is the
2.2 slot height which may interfere with
some more compact motherboards for the
IO you get three DisplayPort 1.2 and
HDMI 1.4 meanwhile since the fury uses
reference PCB it requires dual eight pin
power connectors above these is an 8 LED
bar to indicate GPU load while the
colors of the LEDs can be changed with
the accompany VIP switches to red blue
or turned off so now let's jump onto the
benchmarks starting with 1440p the
results are as expected based on the
furies price the average frame rate on
the games across the board fit right in
between the 980 and the night PDT i and
we would consider this to be a win for
AMD just because Nvidia's current
selection doesn't span the price
performance category the 4k gaming we're
safe similar results but the fury
separating itself with the 980 and
approaching the 19 DTI many titles
perform really well but as well with v
1440p results some key games like GTA 5
and aha feel for see the cards
struggling it's also interesting to see
such a slight performance dip when
compared to the fury ax but with the
full hundred dollars saved the r9 fury
will be a popular card for sure
thanks to the HBM the lack of a water
cooling pump and other architectural
power efficiencies the fury is not as
power-hungry as the fury X in addition
its power requirements put in right in
line between the 980
ETI thanks to the excellent track school
design the card reaches a maximum of 75
degrees Celsius at load while
maintaining a quite acoustic performance
those three fans and massive heatsink
managed to do a proper job with total
silent operation under light load they
even allowed for a bit of overclocking
and we were able to get the car to
eleven thousand seven megahertz so in
conclusion the r9 fury is a needed card
in the marketplace it fits into a price
point that isn't currently occupied by
the competition and it beats out the GTX
980 on all fronts and even comes closer
to the gtx 980ti
at times however we can't forget the
overclocking potential of the
competition and that is when the r9 fury
loses it attraction for now for those
not in favor of water cooling unit and
higher price point of the fury acts the
r9 fury is an outstanding alternative
with an excellent price to performance
ratio and that concludes our review of
the sapphire fury Triax
