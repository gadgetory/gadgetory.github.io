great technology selection and service
hey guys Eber here with hark Max and
Tesoro is slowly starting to penetrate
the North American market with their
gaming peripherals on the review table
today is the libera spectrum RGB
mechanical keyboard available in a
variety of kale switches but it has big
shoes to fill at such a high price tag
of $150
however the spectrum is one of the least
expensive full backless RGB keyboards
taking a physical tour the main shell is
plastic with a fine brush look although
at this price point I was expecting an
aluminum frame there are four screws
that hold a chassis with the base which
gives to a spectrum a more decorative
look the wrist rest sports different
textures all together with that classic
aluminum crisscross design but I'd
rather prefer something smoother for
better comfort as the angular design
plus this rough texture isn't as
comfortable as it should be at the
bottom you'll find an T skip pads and
appropriate razors to adjust the height
of the keyboard I do have to mention
that when the razors are completely low
the weight isn't balanced when I start
to type on the keyboard the entire frame
moves up and down but this can be
eliminated by raising up the keyboard
part of the problem would be the shorter
wrist rest but for users with smaller
hands I doubt this would be an issue the
bottom of the keyboard is also prone to
scratches which may or may not concern
most users but personally at this price
point it is totally unacceptable
on the top right side of the keyboard is
where you'll find two USB 2.0 ports a DC
input where users can charge their
smartphones or tablets and a separate
headphone and microphone input it's
really strange to find a DC power in and
zero information on how that's used the
one point five millimeter braided cable
is thick and at the end you'll find two
USB plugs with proper logo for easier
differentiation and the headphone /
microphone jacks have to be plugged in
to the rear i/o of your motherboard in
order to utilize the audio pass-through
off the keyboard unfortunately there are
no separate macro buttons on the
keyboard you can record macros
on-the-fly by pressing the record button
in the top
right or through the driver software but
given the large footprint of the
keyboard and even taking into account
how well the competition implements
separate macro zones for gamers to
access I would have preferred to server
go that route as well as with a few
dedicated keys the main highlight off
the Libero spectrum is the lighting
system first with the edge lighting that
in a proper color meshed environment
will look awesome depending on the
surface the light pulse often creating a
good focal point in your gaming setup
second the keys are individually
backlund you can customize the color of
each key and given the five profiles
that you can switch on the fly creating
separate gaming and productivity
lighting zone stays a possibility plus I
love how the lighting peeks through the
gaps as one thing to sir made sure to do
right east of brightness and vibrancy of
these LEDs the lighting quality just
looks awesome there are a few special
effects like trigger ripple firework
radiation
breathing rainbow wave and an audio mode
that's supposed to activate the LEDs for
each individual key to go along with the
beats and a base of your music this mode
only works when audio jacks are plugged
into the source and it looks very
interesting certainly not for constant
use but interesting to see it react to
audio elements inside a game adding a
little extra immersion the weakest point
of this product and really all
peripherals from Tesoro is the driver
software that is playing out terrible
first the ugly interface with different
tabs for various profiles and a non
identical physical layout of the
keyboard at the bottom left corner is
where you can assign any key as a macro
under the macro setting plus key
assignment settings one feature I like
about the spectrum is the ability to
assign certain keys to launch programs
for example I have f1 assigned to launch
Adobe Edition CC under the elimination
key that color of any key can be
customized to your preference and
finally the lighting effects setting
allows the user to select a variety of
effects that I mentioned previously for
the spectrum I've experienced a few
crashes while tweaking the button layout
and that proved frustrating having not
saved any changes a major issue I
encountered with the spectrum was every
time I turn on my system 12 keys light
up and my system would not post so I had
to unplug the spectrum for my PC to
start up properly and then replug the
spectrum for use Tesoro did rollout with
a firmware update that's meant to fix
this locking up issue however even after
the update we still encountered locked
up keyboard after reboot so I'm going to
conclude this review by stating the
lighting is done well and is the
strongest element of the Libero spectrum
the physical design could see an update
would smoother textures for wrist rest
and perhaps a metal frame next time as
the lack of proper weight distribution
is a turn-off and finally the issue
where the spectrum won't allow the PC to
post is just bizarre and is something we
experienced on both of our review
samples at $150 this is not acceptable
and also until we see a proper redesign
for the driver UI the Libero spectrum
will be
difficult to recommend so let us know
what you think about the keyboard and
whether or not you think this whole RGB
trend will die off soon or will evolve
into something even more advanced as
