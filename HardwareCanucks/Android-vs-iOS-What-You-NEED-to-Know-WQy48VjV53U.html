better
so iOS versus Android why does it have
to be always such an aggressive debate
just stick to what you love right apples
versus oranges which one of you is the
dark side so interesting I've been using
both the iPhone and Android together on
a daily basis because they sort of
complement each other and fill in the
blanks that the other ecosystem lacks so
let's talk about that and why this is a
mere a conversation that needs to happen
let's put our fanboy ism aside right
this it's time to try something new with
the k900
em mechanical keyboard by Zalman with
Cale brown switches on board macro
recordings and absolutely gorgeous RGB
illumination with the white frame even
your dog will go nuts check it out in
the description below alright so the
Apple Keynote is over and many Android
users who realized that some of the new
features that Apple is rolling out with
the iOS and the new iPhone 10 and the
iPhone 8 have been available on Android
for over two years we're enabling the
freedom of wireless charging there's
four hundred fifty eight pixels per inch
it's remarkable how this larger display
can be packed at a phone that fits so
comfortably in our hands meanwhile the
screen covers 80% of the body yielding
thinner bezels at the top all right new
hair feeling good but let's be real
neither ecosystem is perfect and we as
users are very good to adopt to the
compromises of either dark side so if
you are potentially thinking of
switching to one of these two this video
is for you and I got a few surprises
guess surprises along the way
so I have used my iPhone 7 for 6 months
on a daily basis and I have not yet
gotten impatient as I did with my galaxy
s7 6 months in using this device the
galaxy s7 does kinda got laggy things
were just not as stable or smooth as
they used to be and I had to format it
every three months in order to get that
fresh feeling back and
most recent go to Android device has
been the 1+5 I love how fast it is
updates have been very consistent I do
love the portrait mode camera on this
phone and the new rose gold color is a
pretty unique addition to my smartphone
collection my least favorite thing about
Android has to be the inconsistencies
between the devices so take example
screens on sums they're warmer on others
that cooler and for people like me
having a calibrated and accurate screen
is important because what we put out is
what we want the viewer to see and that
that just annoys me
and so these Hardware differences
between Android devices is a pretty big
deal like the inverted display on the
one plus five that makes a jelly effect
plus the screen touch latency on the one
plus five is far worse versus my galaxy
s7 and even the early version on the one
plus three which I'm keeping it's my
favorite wamba's device doesn't have
that much screen latency as the one plus
five does so what's going on and that's
why I love the iPhone not just a7 5s and
early versions that have no touch screen
latency so when you physically press the
screen that interaction is instantaneous
and doesn't feel there's something
happening in the background that's
stalling that physical touch on the
screen my least favorite thing about
Android is the app instability that
experience sometimes so a quick example
would be if I were to change the lights
my hue bulbs in my studio the app would
crash on me I've had that at multiple
devices including my g6 on the note 8
it's little things like that that just
makes me want to switch to another
platform but it's very minimal and
doesn't happen every time it's just that
one time that you really wanted to work
it just wouldn't so there you have it
what's up everybody this is Danny
androids biggest strength is probably
their biggest weakness there are so many
different manufacturers making Android
devices that when the new version of
Android comes out it has the latest and
greatest innovations pushing mobile
forward and you may not even get that on
your smartphone for six months or you
might not even get it at all so the
uniformity on the platform
is not there and I think that's its
biggest biggest weakness now I can't
speak for other brands but I'm pretty
happy with how fast oneplus has been
rolling out updates and primarily
because people were pissed that some of
these things were not included like
stabilization in 4k video now is
been added and it's pretty good and the
portrait mode has gotten so good that
it's becoming my primary tool for
capturing product photography for social
media and all of them look fantastic
almost like a DSLR shot
I'd say my least favorite thing about
Android is that it's not iOS what I need
it to be so oftentimes developers will
optimize their app for iOS over Android
and when I need to use those apps it can
be frustrating that it doesn't work
properly simply because I don't have the
right phone
my least favorite thing about the
software is that there are still some
apps that I cannot delete mm-hmm even
though I will never use them mm-hmm like
stocks stocks hello
I'm Quinn of snazzy labs and my favorite
thing about iOS has got to be the
stability of the platform no it's not as
exciting as Android and no it's not as
customizable but the last time I had to
reboot my phone because something went
weird was like three years ago
my favorite thing about iOS devices is
not iOS it's the fact that you can get
consistency between the hardware so you
always are assured of having a good
camera having a good calibrated screen
and having good sound and AB which is
something that you're honestly just
can't find as easy on Android devices
hey Dave 2d here so my favorite thing
about iOS is probably iMessage and just
the whole iMessage ecosystem a lot of my
family and friends use that thing so
when I don't have that thing I feel like
I feel like removed from my family and
friends but when I have it I feel like
I'm part of the game and the thing that
I love about iOS is that it is
consistent and fast so it may be a
simple experience but you know what
you're gonna get it remains fast and you
get updates on older phones so you get
the new experience even if you don't buy
the new phone which you can't get on
Android a lot of times hi I'm Matthew
Moniz and the one thing that I love
about iOS is the fact that I can use 3d
touch to move the cursor around anywhere
on the screen I find this to be a little
bit easier than tapping with your finger
so 3d touch is a unique feature but I
feel it's underutilized I use it to
quickly access my steps counter from the
health app or writing a tweet but
surprisingly my most used 3d touch
selections is like choosing the
flashlight brightness you can also set
the timer and also selecting slow
motion video without entering the app
first but it's also really funny how
that uniformed experience is very much
associated with the lack of the
customization that Android seems to
fulfill so well and I find it bizarre
that icons are still locked for that top
to bottom grid and cannot be moved
otherwise hi everyone
canoopsy here and my favorite thing
about android has to be the sheer amount
of customization my favorite feature
about Android is the ability to
customize my favorite thing about
Android of course has to be the
customization you can take a horribly
ugly Android skin you have the ability
to add your own launcher your own icon
packs add your own widgets if you like
honestly if you don't like something get
rid of it and you can tailor it exactly
the way you want it so it works the way
that you want your system to work I
would say the thing like dislike the
most about Android is I know this sounds
petty but the default launcher like if
you put apps into a folder it's like a
hole and you can look into the hole and
you can see all the folders in there it
just looks really messy to me I think my
favorite thing about Android is the
seamless integration with Google I use
google applications all the time on a
regular basis for work and for personal
use so it's very important to me that
the platform I use on my phone fully
supports and integrates seamlessly with
those frequently used applications I
love Android but my least favorite thing
about it has got to be third-party app
stability I know it's not really an
turrets fault but if you tried to use
applications like snapchat on Android
it's a disaster they just run much more
stable e on iOS and of course there are
many reasons why iOS gets to hate like
not being able to change the resolution
or settings on your camera within the
default camera app widget selection is
terrible you know I cannot put a visual
steps counter from the health app but
for some reason I can put the who's
viewed my profile from LinkedIn why why
is that a feature on Twitter when
opening YouTube links it opens it in its
own Twitter browser and then you have to
go into the open in Safari tab in order
to view that video in the YouTube app on
Android it obviously knows that you have
the YouTube app installed and opens it
in there right away the way it should be
sharing pictures through Instagram gives
me no customization
options it simply publishes the image
without any tweaking tools available
unless I open the app first and add the
image that way on Android of course
sharing a photo to Instagram means it
opens up the app with the selected photo
which is far more convenient my least
favorite thing about iOS has to be iOS
itself honesty I find it super
restrictive I find it clunky to operate
and honestly for me I just don't think
it's well-designed I know
Q the hate but that's what it is and my
least favorite thing about iOS has to be
notifications they used to be really
easy understand very simple but now
they're really complex very confusing
and Apple needs to fix them
as soon as possible so the notification
system is by far the worst thing about
iOS first none of the notifications are
grouped so if you receive 51 word
messages they all show up individually
so it's a nightmare for socially engaged
individuals imagine being part of five
active Facebook chats for whatsapp
groups to Twitter accounts for email
addresses every morning when I wake up
and have to scroll through all the
little things that pop up it's just a
complete nightmare not only that but
once you unlock your iPhone all the
notifications disappear from the
lockscreen
they can still be found when you unlock
a device and for me having that reminder
on a lock screen that the email still
needs a response is a good chance that I
will not forget and accidentally remove
the notification with Android on the
other hand everything is grouped
beautifully by multiple email addresses
by different Twitter accounts and each
notification can still be opened and
dismissed individually which is a
fantastic tool for productivity it
really boggles my mind that Apple
engineers thought that that was the best
way to handle notifications at least
grouped them please as for Siri versus
Google assistant aside from setting up
my alarms I don't use them for anything
else so both are good in their regard
you just have to make sure to say the
right thing set an alarm is that a ring
alarm because both systems will get
confused I do love the seamless approach
to airdrop on the iPhone so sharing my
pictures and videos wirelessly with my
Mac without needing to access the cloud
or connect any wires I also love the
search function that you can access by
swiping down it's super convenient and
as a phone the vibration motor on the
phone is by far the best I've
experienced and I'm like on my Android
I've never had to shut down my iPhone
because something was not working I've
never experienced an app crash and the
only time I've had something lagging was
on a really hot temperature with the
camera when I'm swiping from the right
it would just kind of get stuck like
this as will happen there but that
usually happens in a very warm
environment and maybe like once out of
every 20 times in the normal scenario
and seriously my favorite thing about
Android is that notification system that
keeps me on track I know it has to be
done in terms of responses and it also
loved the massive rollout of quick
charging fast charging and dash charging
for oneplus for example that gets the
battery that recharged super fast
because recharging the iPhone is
painfully slow now the introduction of
the new iPhone 8 and the 8 plus seemed a
little bit underwhelming despite in a
wireless charging glass pack and new
dual cameras with a really awesome
portrait mode while the iPhone 10 looks
cool but man that price point is just
insane and if you have been considering
buying an iPhone perhaps wait for
discounts on the iPhone 7 &amp;amp; 7 plus or
there'll be many for sale
secondhand for the 7 7 plus who are
trying to upgrade for the newer versions
of the iPhone so now is a good time to
buy and so I hope this video has been
helpful in trying to understand why
people love the iPhone why people love
Android and why those two ecosystems are
constantly clashing it's a weird
relationship because they complement
each other so well as I'm filling in the
gaps of certain features that the other
ecosystem lacks what's your favorite
thing about the iPhone the interface the
interface yes what do you mean I like
that it's really simple
there isn't a thousand things on it
there's just as much stuff that I want
then you courser avoid pro gaming
headset is comfortable stylish in
different colors delivers fantastic
wireless performance even for
competitive gaming with an all-new
microphone for clear communications
check out the void Pro Wireless or wired
