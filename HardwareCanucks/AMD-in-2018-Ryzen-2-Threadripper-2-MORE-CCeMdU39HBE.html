get much argument from you to say that
2017 was an amazing year for a m-- DS
processor division there's an
architecture to to really pushed Rison
and thread Ripper forward as a really
good alternative to K be like X and sky
like X processors and Verizon even
proved to be a good alternative to
coffee like but at CES 2018 aim DS
taking the lid off the next generation
of processors and their graphics chips
that are coming much sooner than you
might think and I'm super excited about
them and you guys should be too by the
way a huge thank you to our sponsors
fantex Corsair and Coolermaster for
making the show possible now before I
get into it the actual products I think
it's important to explain aim DS plan to
either match or pull ahead of Intel in
the short term to mid-term future and
one of the primary challenges over the
last decade or so was and still is aimed
ease manufacturing process inferiority
while Intel CPU was using the 22
nanometer to 14 nanometer lithography
aimed II was stuck on the 28 nanometer
since 2014 and this obviously placed him
in disadvantage when it comes to power
consumption heat and die size now rising
mark to move to a much more efficient 14
nanometer process but that was just the
beginning and in 2018 we will see aim DS
first move to a 12 millimeter node for
both desktop and mobile processors
whereas Intel will remain with their
refreshed 14 nanometer technology until
Canon Lake is launched on the 10
nanometer later this year amazingly aim
DS actually thinking to move into the 7
nanometer process come 2019 but what
does that actually mean for you if
you're looking towards AMD in the future
well there will be a rapid rollout of
new Zen based processor architectures
the first out of the gate will be the
Zen Plus which uses the 12 nanometer
manufacturing process to deliver up to
10 percent better performance by
optimizing in some key areas CPU is
based on Zen plus are actually sampling
to partners right now in preparation for
a launch in April now make sure you
realize that there won't be any
fundamental changes to the overalls and
architecture until then two launches in
2019 with that 7 nanometer process and
then plus will basically be refreshed
design that
also we'll be able to achieve higher
sustained clock speeds but the cool
thing about the Zen too is that its
design is already complete and basically
AMD has two CPU teams that are leapfrog
in each other
so once the Zen architecture was
complete that team moved on to the Zen 2
architecture while the other team
started working on the Zen +
architecture and now they're moving into
the design stages of the Zen 3 which
will be sometime in 2020 so AMD is
seriously moving fast and there's more
to all this than just changing
manufacturing processes - because aim D
is also trying to move beyond the usual
7 to 8% year the performance increase
but aim D thinks they can push things
even further and offer their clients
much more performance with each new
cycle aim D will be launching a new
series of desktop AP use that combined
Rison processor course with Vega
integrated graphics units these used to
be codenamed the Raven Ridge and there's
something odd about them - even though
they will have the 2000 series name
unlike other 2000 series CPUs they will
use the originals and architecture
rather than Zen plus and I'm not sure
why Andy's doing this because it might
cause confusion but probably most
exciting additions to aim these lineup
in 2018 comes the new next generation of
Rison processors with the second
generation of rising CPUs which are
based on the twelve nanometer Zen plus
core design there will be a full line of
being launched with a new series of
motherboards and brand new features but
don't worry current boards will be
compatible with rise in 2000 series
processors not only that but in the
second half years N+ will be used to
refresh thread Ripper into a newer and
faster beast there'll be another super
busy year here at Harbor Canucks and I'm
super excited to check it out and you
should too and in order to prepare their
current lineup for the arrival of new
processors there have been some price
cuts which you'll see almost immediately
for example the 1900 X has received the
big $100 price cut because I'm guessing
the upcoming 2800 X will have a very
similar performance in some instances
the rest of the rise in seven lineup has
also received nice price drops ranging
from $150 for the 1800 X to $15 for the
rise in 5 1500 X and you also notice the
addition of two new AP use
with the standard risin course and Vega
graphics the fork or a thread Verizon
520 400 G at the hundred seven dollars
and the court Corizon 320 200 G for just
$99 and these will actually act as
lineup replacements for aim these risin
five fourteen hundred and thousand three
twelve hundred okay so that pretty much
wraps up the lineup of aim these
processors but what about the graphics
well that is one area where they need
help the most but unfortunately it looks
like there's going to be a bit of a wait
until Radeon series can pull free of
Vegas failures there is hope on the
horizon though so check this out
sometime in 2018 will see Vega
architecture transition to a seven
nanometer manufacturing process but
there is no word whether or not gaming
cards will actually receive this refresh
but I'm guessing not there won't be any
significant core changes but supposedly
AMD already has seven enemy intercourse
in hand for use in their radio on
instinct mi-25 cards that are used for
deep learning algorithms the first
significant change for the consumer
cards would likely come with navi
which is due in 2019 and then there'll
be a brand new architecture coming in
2020 which should utilize and optimize
the seven nanometer manufacturing
process but here's the issue though
we're still waiting for the lower-end
vega cards outside the vega 56 and 64
variants and AMD has also announced
dedicated notebook GPUs based on the
Vega architecture and it could be these
mobile course will eventually morph into
lower and desktop variants and that
we'll finally be able to go up against
the gtx 1060 or the gtx 1050
unfortunately AMD wasn't really able to
provide us with any more information
about the specifications or any official
launch dates for these mobile GPUs but
it looks like there'll be some notebook
designs with them before q2 of 2018 it
does look like there's a single stack of
HP m2 memory so that means memory would
likely be between 4 gigabytes and
gigabytes and there are also a few
notebooks on display at CES and we'll
have to make sure to check those out in
okay so that wraps up this video there's
a lot to be excited from AMD coming in
2018 make sure to check out our rise in
to coverage and their whole APU
direction I'm a Dmitry thanks much for
watching stay tuned for more CES
coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
