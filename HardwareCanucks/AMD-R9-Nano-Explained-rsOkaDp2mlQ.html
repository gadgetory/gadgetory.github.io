great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm with me tree wood
hardware can extend welcome to another
video
back in June at e3 AMD has impressed us
all with the launch of the r9 fury X and
the fury cards which were the first
mass-produced GPUs to feature HP M or
high bandwidth memory and all relevant
reviews are in the description below or
in the eye here but they also teased us
with the r9 nano full details of which
were unknown at the time like how many
stream processors it would have what are
the clocks like pricing and power
consumption were all unknown and AMD
promised us an official launch in August
and we are an end of the month now and
so we now know full specifications and
all the details but the full heart
launch is not until September 10th so
this is the r9 nano explained or a free
mini review so the main reason why these
cards are not yet available on this
official launch is aim D tells us
they're building the critical mass which
will allow the r9 nano to launch on a
broad scale and it gives them a few
weeks until September 10th to make sure
there's adequate stock and availability
of the of this card on launch now the
most surprising thing about the r9 nano
are the specs so let's take a look at
them now notice how little difference
there is between the fury X and the nano
as it comes with a fully enabled fiji xt
core and this is not a cut-down version
like the r9 fury it's got the same
amount of stream processors our apiece
texture units it's got 4 gigabytes of HP
m at 500 megahertz priced at 649 and has
a TDP of 175 watts 100 watt slower than
the flagship the real differentiator
here are the clock speeds with the r9 an
overrated up to 1,000 megahertz what
this means core frequencies will be
adjusted to fit the 175 watt TDP with
expectations during gaming load for the
engine clock to hover around
900 megahertz roughly giving it the same
performance of the fury and before we
talk a bit more on the TDP aspect and
how aim D is able to achieve that and
also where does it fit in with pricing
let's actually check out the card shall
we so this is the r9 nano it is an
incredibly compact GPU at just 6 inches
or 15 centimeters the full metal shroud
has that familiar texture as is found on
the theory axe with aluminum accents and
the Radeon text on both sides of the
card the single 90 millimeter high
static pressure friend is rated at 42
DBA or as aimed he calls it library
quiet and I hope this is a measure
during the load but we'll have to check
it out in our full review so staying
tuned for that and the target
temperature of the r9 nano is 75 degrees
Celsius and we assume clock speeds would
be determined by this target operating
temperature and the way AMD can achieve
this pretty impressive cooling for this
form factor is with this unique heatsink
design there's a pure copper contact
plate with a dual vapor chamber heat
pipe layout and the secondary heatsink
for the VRMs the r9 nano is not made for
overclockers and really the main selling
point here would be the form factor and
that's really unfortunate to not see a
backplate here considering the card is
$649 but we hope that the board partners
will help to satisfy that expectation
there is a single 8 pin at the back for
power so when plugged in the total
length with the cable will still be less
than the total width of a mini ITX
motherboard and that's pretty impressive
for the i/o the nano features triple
DisplayPort 1.2 and a single HDMI 1.4
meaning for a 4k TV that does not
support DisplayPort you are limited to
30 Hertz at 4k now the two main
questions you may be asking yourself is
how can aim the achieve such a TDP of
175 watts a full 100 watts lower than
the fury X which has pretty much
identical specifications of course lower
clock speeds would determine lower power
consumption but we expect there's high
chance of cherry-picking
or core binning or core harvesting
that's going on to find the most power
efficient VG XT course that goes into
creating the r9 nano and the second
inevitable question is the price why
would you spend as much on the r9 nano
versus a more powerful fury ax at the
same price or find savings in getting
the fury which is by our expectations
would be performing on the line or
similar to the r9 nano and you guessed
it it all comes down to form factor this
is the most powerful mini ITX GPU at the
moment and there's no competition we are
seeing mini ITX and compact form factors
being adopted in the marketplace and
there are gamers and system builders
that prioritize on size and value the
gaming machine based on the overall
elements of the the machine and not just
the raw performance and this would be
the perfect segue into getting our
initial performance charts out of the
way provided by AMD and so here the Nano
is poor against the GTX 970 ITX version
in which we are seeing about the 30%
higher performance and this actually
might mean the r9 nana could be about
50% faster than the GTX 980 giving aim
the really strong foothold on the most
powerful sub 7-inch GPU and so the hard
launch for the r9 nano is September 10th
we are excited to explore the full
potential of the power that the card
holds and also explore the limitations
that come with this tiny form factor but
also the complicated process that goes
into finding you know bend chips and the
Fuji XT cores that that operate under
175 watt TDP so make sure to subscribe
to not miss our full review of the r9
nano and let us know what you think of
this card I'm wondering to see how many
of you would prioritize on size before
performance especially at this price
point so leave your comments down below
thanks for watching and we'll see you
the next one
