market was welcomed with quite a bit of
expectations based on the company's
history with quality so today we're
looking at their first gaming mouse the
m60 now the mouse was designed with
gaming in mind mainly to use with FPS
titles due to one simple but very
effective button layout and it's hitting
the shelves at $70 which is reasonable
when compared to its competition so
let's start off with build quality the
m60 has an aluminum body which makes the
mouse light but tough and the top
plastic piece is rubberized feels really
comfortable in your hand but the
plastics on the sides you kinda grainy
and takes away the quality element this
is an 8 button design with left and
right click the scroll wheel that has
excellent feedback which allows precise
scrolling dpi change buttons for 3
settings then on the left side there are
forward and backward buttons and the
highlight of this product this sniper
button that allows users to drop the dpi
levels on the fly while in game for
really precise aiming now the mouse is
not so much cold and slightly angled to
allow your hand to rest comfortably with
enough support for your thumb but
unfortunately no support for your pinky
and like with most gaming mice waiting
adjustments are crucial so the user can
configure the optimal feel for the mouse
especially for FPS gaming and m60 comes
pre applied with three separate weights
at the bottom 4.5 grams each that
unscrew to remove and notice how the
weights are not located on one spot but
instead are spread out and this helps
with weight distribution based on your
preference whether you want the front
heavy or a back heavy Mouse
unfortunately if the weights are removed
Corsair does not include any storage
compartments and you might lose them the
mouse features a 5700 DPI laser sensor
with plenty of headroom for adjustments
and profile selection it is also very
responsive on any surface we tested it
out with the XFX warpath then slightly
harder surfaces as well and it really
comes down to preference to which one
you choose as the mouse detects any
on any surface with high precision and
it connects through a regular USB port
and the cable is braided with a velcro
strap to bundle up any unused cable and
when plugged in the m60 has just enough
lighting to see the profile change so no
fancy lighting here just made to be
practical during gaming economically the
mouse fits well in the hand better for
palm grip though then clogged rivers and
all the buttons are in their natural
positions so you don't have to search
for the side buttons or while changing
the DPI and the sniper button is large
enough and this firm so prescient will
not be an issue while pressing the left
or the right button its overall a nice
comfortable and natural feel that should
work well for gaming well let's see how
it stacks up in practice so throughout
our testing with FPS titles the mouse
performed extremely well the tracking in
the comfort and the sniper button came
in quite handy the ability to change DPI
on-the-fly during gaming can be crucial
in some situations and by now this has
become the standard for pretty much any
gaming mice while there's no finger
support on the right side of the body it
didn't seem to be an issue but when
lowering the dpi level the entire hand
must move down which was a bit
distracting and one more thing to
mention before we conclude are the
drivers for the m16 you must download
the software off Corsairs website which
means you always get the latest updates
and the driver software is fairly easy
to work with you get the button
selections on the left and on the right
you're able to change button options and
record some macros the advanced option
tab is where you'll find the extra
commands but you first must initialize
the macro record button select the
desired button choose your command and
stop macro record now the new function
is registered for this button
unfortunately these macros are only
limited to what is given in the software
which doesn't allow any flexibility if
you want to record some special macros
for applications you use daily you are
however able to play around the DPI
settings for different profiles create
independent
why sensitivity and figure out the
optimal dpi settings to use for that
sniper button and lastly you can create
different profiles for specific use of
the mouse unfortunately we did encounter
some issues with the drivers which
caused unexpected mouse freeze-up
stuttering wrong DPI settings and non
functioning buttons which may get
extremely frustrating and require the
restart of the device
however the firmware update is expected
to be released which should fix all
these issues so camp out until these new
drivers arrive
so overall the Vengeance m60 would suit
many that are looking for practical and
FPS friendly mice that features all the
important elements like built quality
adjustable weighting system three levels
of sensitivity right on the fly and the
selling point the sniper button
sounds like a gimmick but slowing down
the sights for a perfect headshot will
be rewarding it is unfortunate however
to see such a nice product bottlenecked
by the faulty drivers and Corsair should
have done more testing before final
release and that concludes our review
for the Vengeance m60 thank you guys for
watching and we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
