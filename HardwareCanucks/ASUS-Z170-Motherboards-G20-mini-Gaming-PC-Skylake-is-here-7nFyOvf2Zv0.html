hardware canucks and we traveled to
Cologne Germany for our very first
Gamescom so huge thanks to a soos for
sending us out here to be a part of
their very special motherboard launch
and this fits right in line with the
latest Intel skylake launch the wait is
over six generation desktop CPUs are
here and so are the new z170
motherboards and the best way to show
off a piece of hardware is to place it
inside its natural habitat
so here are four aces builds that we saw
that mark an entry of the new boards
plus this mini PC that promises
incredible performance for this tiny
form factor the first is a custom-built
fully water cooled system with an
awesome red and black theme to follow
the ROG colors here we have the ROG
Poseidon gtx 980ti in sli the core of
which is a unique one as we have a water
block covering the GPU + dual fan design
on the shroud to carry any leftover heat
away from the card plus everyone should
also want that sexy SLI bridge and
that's exactly what we see here all the
four ddr4 memory slots are occupied
there's a Kingston HyperX SSD stashed
away in this ROG shroud that looks sick
and the star of the show is the asus rog
maximus 8 hero this is an ATX
motherboard that houses the latest Intel
Core i7 6700 K I wanted to top the line
Intel skylake CPUs the socket is LGA
1151 for the sixth generation CPUs the
motherboard itself has a ton of
excellent features it falls in line with
the stealth black and red color scheme a
special ddr4 layout for stable
overclocking capable of reaching of 3733
megahertz on ddr4 modules up to 64
gigabytes in total there are three PCI
lines that would allow for two-way SLI
or 3-way crossfire X we've got an rog
supreme FX 2015 that features a built-in
amp and excellent software to tune the
sound signature for various gaming
environments overclocking your CPU is
possible through the
you you if a bias or through the AI
suite software with auto-tuning built-in
for newest overclockers where you can
adjust frequency voltage and temperature
targets and the system will stress test
itself to make sure that everything is
stable
all seven fan headers support PWM
control and DC control and now include
extensive settings for manual speed
control which is awesome a hybrid
inverter sloth is available for insane
speeds on the new z170 platform and if
you are into color matching Maximus
eight motherboards all have full RGB
color control that there can also react
to CPU temperatures and even music for
networking we have the latest Intel
Ethernet and an rog exclusive game first
three which prioritizes four-game
packets with different presets available
with six USB 3 ports and one of each of
USB 3.1 type C and type a so users can
expect an outstanding experience with
such a feature packet board for the new
skylake chips the rog Maximus 8 gene was
also showcased in this cube leonie case
so her kudos for excellent case
selection so here the build we have is
also red themed fully water-cooled with
this top glass panel for beautiful
showcase and the gene is a micro ATX
board that doesn't compromise on any of
the features so you still get all the
overclocking abilities on the CPU and
ddr4 all the same audio features with
supreme effects and sonic studio great
networking LAN built in there are eight
USB 3 ports and one type a +1 type-c
ports with a great-looking motherboard
overall that has RGB color support for
those into that type of thing however
leading the launch is the z170 deluxe
designed with a hint of elegance and
singular color scheme with this gorgeous
white accent and a really awesome way to
show it off in this open concept s frame
that houses the deluxe nicely with
another custom water cooling loop to
complement the white theme there is an
ROG Poseidon 980ti
with a painted shroud in white that
looks really awesome and also L
the ddr4 Ram kit with that white
accented round module the c-17 in deluxe
is absolutely loaded with features this
is truly an enthusiast board for those
that want to take advantage of all the
tools that have provided for all that
control so first you have advanced
overclocking through the UEFI bios and
the AR suite with stress testing and
optimization the digital 16 plus for
face power design is made reliable for
overclocking there is smart information
that is available for your drives GP you
post is a new feature that lets you test
occupied PCI lanes and detect any errors
no longer do you need a fan controller
as all seven fan headers support PWM and
DC with excellent manual fine tuned fan
control the z170 deluxe was also
featured in this awesome SLI build
inside the if antics and took primo with
dual GTX 970 s that also feature the
white shroud the RAM is also white for
that uniform build and this time and
enclosed CPU cooler one feature I found
really cool on the deluxe is the key
press that lets you connect your
keyboard into a specific USB port that
reroutes all the key presses through a
microprocessor and thus allow you to
program macro commands and potentially
add a ton of productivity value to a
driverless keyboard networking is
covered with built-in dual band 802 that
11 AC Wi-Fi card with a bunch of
optimization through turbo land for
priority applications to get the best
throughput crystal sound 3 is present
with many audio presets and a built-in
amp to drive higher impedance headphones
so users can really expect a quality
product given the attention to detail on
all the features with power efficiency
and voltage control DRM modules are
protected from over current and
motherboard is protected from
electrostatic discharges that all make
up the z170 deluxe as the premium
motherboard leading the skylake pack and
lastly to satisfy our desires for small
form-factor gaming machines seuss showed
off this g20 which in my opinion is very
impressive as the
area shell is only nine point five
liters and design-wise this thing is
beautiful with matte black side panels
Mayan inspired the valley like top
exhaust and similar angular shape of the
front and machine as well and for
consistency of the frame design and also
cooling the bottom is properly raised
and spaced out to allow this thermal
design this unique thermal design to
properly cool the machine and we can't
wait to get it in our hands for testing
the lighting in the front is RGB with
multiple effects that can be configured
to show off temperatures based on color
to give users that quick visual
indication and hardware wise the g20 is
in the showcase stock because of sky
Lake and inside is a z170 board with an
i7 6700 K processor so most likely
clocked to complement such tight cooling
we have 16 gigabytes of ddr4 2 mm 133
megahertz ram 1 terabyte hard drive with
an optional m2 SSD for storage which i
would say is adequate enough and for GPU
power gtx 980 is installed for this tiny
powerhouse that not only looks fantastic
but has quite the gaming potential with
dual band AC Wi-Fi for a proper
networking and has the potential to be
an excellent pre built system for those
liking the looks and appreciate the
compact chassis and with that the new
ASUS motherboards are here make sure to
follow us on social media to get updates
on the review status of all these new
motherboards huge things again to Asus
