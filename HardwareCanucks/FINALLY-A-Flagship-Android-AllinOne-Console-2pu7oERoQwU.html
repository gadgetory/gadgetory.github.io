advanced and capable media streamer on
the market and Vidya is about to update
their shield TV based on the
improvements it is pretty clear that
NVIDIA wants to shield TV to become not
only an all-encompassing home
entertainment hub but a smart home hub
as well before you move on quick message
from our sponsor the show coverage is
possible thanks to Nvidia gigabyte
fantex and NCIX
while nothing was said about any
internal changes the new shield TV
features a sleeker 40% smaller but still
familiar design and will now come
bundled with both an updated gaming
controller and a remote control you
previously had to buy the remote so
having both will certainly help cement
the shield TV as one of the most
complete entertainment devices for the
living room assuming that the hardware
has remained indeed the same this
streaming device is powered by Nvidia's
Tegra x1 chip which pairs an octa-core
64-bit ARM CPU with at 256 core Maxwell
based GPU it also has the ability to
play 4k videos in h.265 h.264 and vp9
and now it supports 4k HDR as well so
that's awesome the support for 4k HDR is
impressive and a critical selling point
because up till now they've only been a
handful of devices that can do so the
shield TV blows them all away because it
not only supports Netflix 4k HDR but it
is the only media streamer to support
Amazon video 4k HDR it now also supports
Google Play movies &amp;amp; TV 4k Vudu 4k and
YouTube 4k basically all the UHD bases
are covered in a few months the YouTube
TV app will also be available and that
will bring the ability to view 360
degree videos as well since this is an
Android nougat TV based device it has
also been updated to the latest and
greatest Android 7.0 and it can run
thousands of apps including Amazon video
Netflix YouTube Hulu HBO ESPN Vudu
Showtime Pandora Spotify sling TV
PlayStation View Plex Kodi etc there are
now over a thousand fully optimized
games in the Nvidia shield store over
100 of which and Vienna describes as
console class if triple-a PC games are
what you want GeForce now can be used to
stream PC games from the cloud or using
in videos game stream you can cast games
directly from your own
as long it has a compatible GeForce GTX
GPU apparently you'll be able to cast
games up to 4k HDR but we will see how
well that works out one huge
announcement is that both Ubisoft Uplay
and valve stream support are also
incoming so gameplay possibilities on
the shield TV are essentially going to
be limitless the changes to the
controller are pretty interesting
changes are the elimination of
capacitive buttons and axing the
touchpad since Android n has new
features that don't require it
unfortunately feedback about the
controller was mixed from our team of
three the thinner body part is great for
smaller hands but some of us thought the
new angle or surface wasn't comfortable
arguably the most surprising thing we
saw was the addition of Google assistant
an intelligent personal assistant
developed by Google no other device
aside from Google's high in pixel phones
have this unique voice based features so
how will you interact with the Google
assistant
well the newly included remote has an
always listening microphone built-in and
it supports a number of hands-free t v--
commands to expand the AI functionality
of the entire home and video will also
have a peripheral for the shield TV the
NVIDIA spot microphone speaker accessory
this golf ball-sized Wi-Fi connected
gadget plugs into any electrical outlet
and it can hear your commands questions
from up to 20 feet away it then
wirelessly routes the queries to the
shield TV and playbacks to reply from
the nearest spot device availability is
a few months away and it will retail for
a $50 USD ok Google pause and then
they'll be implementing media controls
to be able to pause play fast-forward to
rewind
ok Google show me my pictures from 2015
so those are 2015 pictures nicely
displayed up to 4k resolution okay
google pull up my pictures of jensen
okay face recognition on all the
pictures of the jensen phones the new
shield TV in 16 gigabyte form-factor is
available for pre-order now and it will
ship in the united states canada and
select European regions later this month
for $200 USD if 16 gigabytes is not
enough for you leave 300 dollar USD
shield Pro will also be available later
this month with a 500 gigabyte storage
and a remote with a headset jack since
the shield TV features two USB 3.0 ports
a micro SD card slot and Gigabit LAN
port and obviously 802 11 AC Wi-Fi you
probably don't need the version with the
built-in two and a half inch 500
gigabyte hard drive but that's up to you
by the way if you own an existing shield
TV there will be an update coming your
way that will upgrade your device to
Android 7.0 and will give you every
feature mentioned about however you'll
need to buy the $50 remote control if
you want to use the Google assistant
feature since that remote contains the
necessary microphone that you will need
for voice controls so there you have it
not only has the shield TV become less
expensive but it has also become much
more capable it will be interesting to
get this on our hands to test sometime
after the show I mean we're with
hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
