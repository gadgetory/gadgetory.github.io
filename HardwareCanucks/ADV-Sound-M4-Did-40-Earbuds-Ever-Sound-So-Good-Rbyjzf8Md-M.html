great technology selection and service
hello everyone
Aiden here with Hardware Canucks and
today we'll be taking a look at the m4
earbuds from a DV sound these earbuds
were successfully funded on Kickstarter
with the tagline being earbuds for
musicians a DV sound promises durable
naturally tuned in our monitors for
$39.99 now the first thing you'll notice
when you get the m4s is the premium
packaging from the get-go you wouldn't
have any idea these were only 40 dollars
with a nice box design and an awesome
hard firm where you'll find the earbuds
and the case the premium experience
continues on here with an excellent hard
case with a soft finish and an adv logo
inside you'll find the earbuds and an
extra nine rubber ear tips in addition
to the comply tips already on these now
for $40 this is one hell of an
accessories pack at this price I didn't
expect this many rubber tips and a hard
case let alone comply firm tips which
are usually a $20 edition for a free
pack now the one gripe I have is there
isn't a 1/8 inch adapter which is the
standard for most music production
interfaces since these are marketed as
earphones for musicians it would have
made sense to include this overall
though I have to commend ADV for the
great accessories pack with these
earbuds because I didn't expect it at
the price but now let's move on to the
star of the show the m4 earbuds
I used the comply tips as I found they
were the most comfortable and sounded
the best for me but your experience
might vary the first thing you'll notice
is the unique 1.3 6 meter cable with
this braided design this is to ensure
that the cord doesn't tangle which is a
great feature and it gives an
interesting look and texture as well
also on the cord is the shirt clip and
an inline remote and mic the remote has
the benefit of being iOS and Android
compatible but it only has a single
button which means no volume control it
also lacks a binder clip which means
that unless you're using a shirt clip
you can't secure the left and right
earbuds together but it's less of an
issue due to the tangle-free design once
you move up to the top you'll have the
earbuds they very light but durable
aluminium chassis with a small
ventilation hole and some a TV branding
you also have a very faint left and
right marking to indicate the earphones
Channel this is pretty hard to see at
times which can be frustrating when
you're trying to quickly put them in
there a straight design with a medium
length so they'll poke out of your ears
a little bit now that pretty much covers
everything except for sound and comfort
I've been pretty happy overall with
these ear buds for the style they are
for comfort I would say they're decent
but not the best I've used the over ear
design of my shure se215 s feels much
more natural and helps hold them in
place whereas these tend to hold the
weight of the cable more the fit is
pretty good for the style and I don't
find them falling out of my ears too
easily the design does mean that you
can't sleep with these in and if you're
being active any nudges on the cable
translates directly to movement of the
earbuds noise isolation is pretty good
it doesn't block out everything but with
the comply it blocks out enough noise to
easily listen to music on public
transport the sound is quite interesting
and it took me a little while to get
used to it a DV sound included a
frequency response graph and as you can
see these are fairly flat with a slight
emphasis on the high end and my
experience has matched pretty closely
with that these earphones are very
bright and clear with that emphasis on
the high end and they're very flat over
most of the range as well keeping detail
and instrument separation and definition
in most of the range the mids are very
pronounced and strong and the high end
is very evident and bright although at
times I've found it to be a little harsh
the low end is controlled but I didn't
find it had much kick and I didn't find
it had much extension into deeper bass
with more emphasis on the mid bass range
to my ears after listening to these for
a while I found they seemed clearer than
my se215 s power they're definitely not
as fun for music listening I prefer the
warmer sound of the shores with the
better bass and they sound much smoother
if you're looking for a more pronounced
mid and high range though these might be
tuned for you since these are the
marketed for music production I would
say the sound would be wanted to
flattest you'd get at this price
although I would prefer one with
a bit less high range emphasis I don't
think these replace higher-end pairs of
headphones or IEMs if you're doing
serious music production but though
casual work these are pretty great at
the price so to sum up the value of the
adv sound and fours is impressive the
premium experience and accessories are
great and handy features like tangle
free cords and inline remotes and nice
to have the sound won't be the funnest
you listen to but if you're looking for
clarity and detail at an affordable
price it's hard to go wrong with these
