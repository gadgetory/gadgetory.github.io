possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX the asus GT 51 gaming desktop
really caught our eyes at CES because
while it is very gaming centric in the
physical character it is also a great
shift away from the type of case designs
gamers are starting to build with now
and so I'd like to ask our audience on
what you think of this type of case
design with a comment below first the
front panel has a lot going for it this
glowing portal at the bottom is
obviously an air intake that features
multicolored lighting with breathing red
strips above it with the ROG logo if
they were trying to achieve this type of
robotic and armor chassis feel to it
they have done a fantastic job let me
tell you and it kind of grows on you
almost makes me want to build inside one
of these cases it is angled with very
busy side panel I mean they have
perforated ventilation which is not dust
proof unfortunately we have an angular
window with honeycomb design mesh
underneath it and this extra layer of
aerodynamic side panel and it almost
makes you feel like it's way too much
but at the same time totally suiting the
aesthetics of what they're trying to
achieve on the inside they have a sky
like CPU dual type Nexus nice clean
cable management and a non black
interior surface which was a bummer this
is 2016 after all come on the GPUs are
supported with custom brackets to
prevent sag with a simple ROG branded
all-in-one and this breathing interior
lighting now the one particular feature
I found truly unique is this NFC armband
that may introduce new security in
overclocking features to how we interact
with our computer cases it's quite
low-profile it is of course RGB branded
and when touched the front of the case
it unlocks a certain shadow partition
which is inside your case where you
stash away you private stuff and files
and documents or hold it there for five
seconds to overclock your machine to a
specific profile which sounds really
awesome with potential to add so many
extra functions to the brand for these
ROG specific commands now what I'm
interested to see if
Asus will sell the enclosure separately
because despite this design that is
totally not my style
I am weirdly drawn towards it for you
know some maybe fun experimentation so
let us know if you share a similar
interest as me or do you find it totally
unappealing I'm Dimitri with harbor
Canucks thanks much watching and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
