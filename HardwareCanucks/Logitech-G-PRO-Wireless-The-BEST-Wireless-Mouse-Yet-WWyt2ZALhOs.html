wireless gaming mouse from Logitech
claiming to be the best of the best this
is the G pro works
now what's interesting about this mouse
is that it's been designed but
collaboration meaning Logitech has
worked with more than 50 eSports
professionals over two years over twelve
shape designs and later we have the G
Pro Wireless so shape wise they just
mirrored the left side of the g4 three
so now the G Pro Wireless is truly
ambidextrous with two buttons on each
side so not only is it actually pretty
comfortable for right hand use but it
also calm rates left hand users as well
the catch however is that everything in
this mouse is new so that is also
reflected in the price tag at one
hundred and forty nine dollars so let's
see if this whole wireless premium thing
is for you right this the new master
keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic wrist rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection Coolermaster
doing it right check it out below now
before it begin I will say this is the
best wireless gaming mouse on the market
right now that I've used so far and
that's because large Tech's know how
within this hole you know within mice
and within the whole Wireless Arena has
really paid off to deliver something
like the G pro Wireless that is
basically perfect so if you have been on
edge from switching to Mouse potentially
it may be poor battery life in your
previous experience or something wrong
with the signal or maybe the weight was
too heavy the G pro Wireless basically
solves all of those issues because this
mouse is only 80 grams so weight wise it
is absolutely not an issue so it's
really fantastic to have such a light
Mouse that has no wire and no wire drag
even though I'm using the G Pro with a
bungee and it's been like my go-to setup
for csgo for those flicks and stuff the
G Pro Wireless has been a breath of
fresh air so that I don't need a wire
and still get the experience that I'm
expecting from you know from Logitech
sensors now shape wise it is slightly
larger than the G pro but the height and
the curvature of the back is pretty much
identical so me moving on to the G Pro
Wireless has not been an issue it's a
super comfortable Mouse and accommodates
my hybrid grip very well but it would
also accommodate claw grip because it
has like the wire base potentially palm
grip as well
for smaller hands it is a truly
ambidextrous designed so we have two
browser buttons on each side we also
have additional flat covers if you don't
want to use them they are magnetic they
simply pop out and you can disable them
in the software so you don't necessarily
you know have those as registered clicks
the side buttons are in a fantastic
location so they're easy to reach and
have satisfying click enos and that
softness at the end when they come to
the stop so they don't impact your grip
the primary buttons have that classic
feel super satisfying nothing bad to say
the scroll wheel has been thinned out to
reduce on the weight tactile steps and
really nice almost light middle-click so
you can use that actually in game
without impacting any of the scroll
steps over all the buttons are fantastic
usability is 100% the DPI shift now is
at the bottom that button is
programmable to anything else you want
but just to avoid any accidental DPI
shifts during game this has been the
feedback from the pros I don't mind this
change at all and we do have the three
LEDs on top to let you know which dpi
you're using there's also the power
button with color coordination and we
have the slow cover that reveals our
spot for the USB receiver so that's
always with the mouse which is awesome
when you travel and also this cover when
removed can be substituted with the
power play
little thingy so that you can actually
use it with the power play mats which is
awesome the only thing to keep in mind
is that this cover is magnetic so if the
mouse is used on a metal surface you'll
definitely feel that little magnetic
action going on now in order to achieve
that 80 gram body they had to thin down
on the walls internally but without
making it feel cheap while it's super
lightweight and plastic the coating on
here is quite satisfying and also the
battery has been reduced in size but
actually the charge is double versus
what we saw on the g7 or 3 and 9:03 mice
which is awesome so the battery life is
rated for 60 hours of continuous usage
without any lighting and 48 hours with
some form of RGB which is awesome you're
not super cutting down on the battery
life if you prefer to have a little bit
of lighting on all the time but of
course reducing the brightness gives you
extra battery life you can also notice
at the bottom they've added an extra
Teflon
at the very back because again this has
been something that the pros have
complained about that portion of the
mouse wearing out in time
so now extra durability of the G Pro
Wireless we actually saw this with the
g3 of five but that teflon foot was
round and much smaller and now they've
expanded that I'm guessing due to
feedback it's part of accessories we get
the charging cable and the addition of
flat portions for the magnetic buttons
alongside the receiver and a little
brick to hold the receiver now the good
thing about the cable is that it is no
longer braided has this really
satisfying rubber texture so it doesn't
kink and so so lighter and also the
covers are easy to attach because the
buttons are magnetic my only point of
feedback here will be for the USB
receiver for to actually have the G Pro
wireless mouse maybe or some indication
and not just Pro because that could be
confusing if you have additional G Pro
accessories and now the sensor that's
the fun part it's their new hero 16 K
gaming sensor you know 16,000 dpi is way
to overkill I game at 400 dpi but that's
not the point the point is that it's a
new one throughout the entire range
there is no filtering no smoothing no
interaction with the DPI range
whatsoever so you get that true one to
one raw performance throughout the
entire range which is awesome but the
sensor now has new architecture in your
firmware and new lenses I guess and
that's good and they're claiming it's
their best sensor ever but they claim
that on every single wireless product
they release so maybe in six time when
and you hero 18k comes out or something
it'll be the best one yet but it's all
about the spec like you as a human
cannot detect the differences between
something like this and maybe something
they've launched a year ago but the
machines can and the technicality says
that this is the best one they designed
and released so far which is great but
again it doesn't really matter they
release it because they can not because
we need it now performance is absolutely
incredible
flawless tracking and this whole
combination of super lightweight body at
80 grams that has been balanced weight
wise perfectly is awesome and having
this whole freedom of movement on your
entire mouth without cable drag is just
it's pure joy the liftoff distance is
super low so there's no tracking
interaction when the mouse is
down and I played 400 dpi so I do move
my mouse quite a lot and reposition it
and lift it off often and I haven't
noticed any you know any disadvantage
throughout my game time and the very
first I am not kidding the very first
competitive match in csgo I play with
this I won I was the first one on the
leaderboard I got one ace in that round
and I was playing against some really
good players so good stuff I also jumped
in too quick champions and just my
experience again throughout the entire
time with aim correction doing flicks
doing 180 degree turns and just tracking
your enemies flawless as long as you're
comfortable with the body and it was
actually quite interesting for me not
feeling the wire you you kind of have to
readjust on how you hold the mouse and
how much weight and how much pulling
you're doing but yeah it's been just an
aural extremely satisfying experience
and also battery life has been
incredible I do like the standby time on
this you know it goes to sleep when it's
not in use and over overnight I've only
lost one percent of the battery which is
awesome something that doesn't usually
happen with other gaming mice and so
it's only using the sensor when it's
actually needs to use it otherwise it
shuts down immediately basically but you
can also check out the full battery
percentage in the software which is
great it recharges super fast I plugged
it in for like one shot and we juiced up
like 10% and under five minutes which is
great and yeah overall a great
improvement across battery life now the
caveat here is the price at 149 that's
expensive but I understand that this is
their like the best wireless mouse right
now but they also don't want to be like
competing with themselves because the G
703 power play Mouse is also 149 so if
this thing was any lower than the g7 or
three will not be relevant anymore but
then there's the g3 or 5a $69 wireless
mouse so it's super affordable for under
$100 to get basically the same sensors
this I think it's here or 12k but
performance will be identical great
buttons great battery life fantastic
shape so if you are not necessarily
going for an ambidextrous design and
like the latest and the greatest like
the G pro wire
then the G 305 would definitely be my
next recommendation and you can also
check out my full list of gaming mice
that I would recommend wireless and
wired in description below and the last
cool timber I will leave you with is
that the G pro Wireless has actually
been in the field for the last six
months with eSports teams like London
Spitfire that won an overwatch
championship using the G Pro Wireless
which is kind of cool to think about and
you know that might get rid of some
skepticism when it comes to using a
wireless mouse in the professional
eSports environment because it's
Wireless maybe there's some latency or
whatever but there isn't it's becoming
so good that you can get rid of the wire
and not have to worry and because of
that the G pro wireless deserves our
hard-working ox damn good award treat
your ears with the incredibly
comfortable HD v 8x Jubilee headphones
from master of ants Anheuser delivering
sound expected from $500 headphones but
only for a hundred fifty bucks making it
one of the best price to performance
games available check out and join the
drop down below this is definitely going
to be staying on my desk now we're
placing my wired G Pro because the shape
here is awesome and the battery life has
not been an issue yet for me you know
recharging it for like 20 minutes
you're fine through the rest of the day
is awesome alright make sure to check
out this other island contest check out
to our new boot sequence channel and
we'll see you
happy wireless gaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
