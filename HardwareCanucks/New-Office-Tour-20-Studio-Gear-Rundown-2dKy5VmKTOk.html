great technology selection and service
audio is going get out of here it's okay
you only see this side anyway oh there's
something poking out of here too man
hey guys this is doing tree with paradox
and welcome to the behind-the-scenes
office store slash letting you guys know
how things are handled on my side of
things in terms of the production for
the YouTube video stuff right off the
bat I'm gonna start off with saying that
I never wear my watch because I tend to
move my hand so much during the video as
otherwise it starts to make this type of
sound as I make the videos the window is
closed and I position things around the
room so that there isn't too much echo
there's still not the best thing of
acoustic environment that I'm in but I
sort of work with what I got so let me
show you exactly what that is
and before we begin meet the newest
addition to the family Sony rx100 mark 3
well hello there nice to meet you guys
welcome to the very first
behind-the-scenes shot with Sony rx100
mark 3 all right so this is where the
magic happens I have finally moved into
an office wait for my living room so I
have actual full workspace that can be
you know I can concentrate on just doing
work and not everything like I was doing
from the living room but let's first
talk about the lighting setup that I
have set up for this particular shot
where how much front of the camera which
is right there this is a three 3d
lighting setup I have two soft boxes one
softbox is right here it's shining light
slightly from above on to me and it's
brighter than the other softbox give me
a bit of an edge light the second
softbox is the front it's also slightly
higher and on an angle and third light
is this background light it helps to
isolate me from the background from this
chair it's a different color lighting
too because this is as you can see it's
very orange and I position the lamp so
it's not visible it's kind of behind the
chair here and it creates this sort of
halo effect around me which helps to
isolate me from this table of stuff that
I've positioned in the boxes so that's
the pretty much the lighting setup that
I constantly use for the videos now
let's talk about the equipment ok so
everyone's always interested in seeing
what type of camera that we shoot with I
used to shoot with the 5d mark ii which
was a beautiful full-frame camera but I
switched since then to the gh4 for
multiple reasons first is 4k everybody
is switching to 4k now and I really
wanted to get the extra pixels second of
all it's a much smaller body so for me
that if I travel a lot and I take all my
gear with me or if these try to take as
most gear as I possibly could handle in
my backpack
the smaller body is a
a very good thing on the camera right
now is a Sigma 18 to 35 this is
considered the YouTuber lens because
it's absolutely amazing F 1.8 aperture
throughout the entire focal range I have
beautiful smooth focusing ring and the
zoom ring and it's sitting on the meta
bones speed booster which allows me to
get one extra start of a stop of light
and it expands the range
it's a beautiful low-light monster it's
kind of heavy with the lens but also I
love the tilted screen use that all the
time
the second lens in my arsenal is the
olympus 18 to 40 millimeters this lens I
bought before the Sigma because it's a
mic referred mount so I needed something
to actually mount on the camera before I
went with some adapters it's a beautiful
lens 12 to 40 millimeters F 2.8 so the
lighting there is not as good as on the
sigma however this is a much lighter
lens I can just travel with this get all
my shots I have a little extra reach
with the 40 millimeters and it's got the
really smooth focusing ring as well and
it's beautiful for macro video
photography things so that I can pull
focus while really really close to
subject without moving the actual shot
so that's beautiful for the tripods are
things I'm using this very old Manfrotto
71 HTV head it gives me smooth pans so
this is fine
however it doesn't give me the best tilt
which I'm not super happy about but I
don't use that feature often anyway the
tripod is from Ben Rhodes so this is the
C 1 5 7 3 F it's a carbon fiber tripod
which is useful for me when I travel a
lot I need something light it comes with
a bag it has this middle section that
can be raised and put down the case we
need that extra reach and you don't want
to extend the legs all the way out and
the best feature about this tripod is
this sort of built-in ball head which
allows me to really strengthen out my
angle as you can see right now I can put
this down like this like so without
moving the actual tripod legs
so if
even uneven surface I can level this out
and I have a little leveling bubble on
the tripod head here so I know when this
thing is actually fully leveled and I
can continue with my with my shots
the second tripod that I have this is
the Sackler ace this I got while I had
the 5d mark ii just because that was a
heavier camera and this tripod is one of
the sturdiest tripods that I ever worked
with it goes a lot higher than the
bender here
it got its got the exact same plate on
the top which is useful for me if I need
to switch from this tripod on to the the
little tripod and it's got absolutely
smooth tilt and pain and everything like
that and it's got the built-in level or
head this level head as well in case I
need to level my shots it's a very good
tripod a little on the pricey side but
this comes in handy all the time when we
do anything outside or with bigger
systems the slider of choice for me is
the cinema doozie so this thing is very
good on multiple levels first of all it
is compact in case I need to move
somewhere this is the slider that I took
with me to Germany it's only 60
centimeters in length from one end to
the other so it can fit inside my
suitcase it's got very sturdy
construction it's full carbon fiber
rails it's got an incredibly smooth
carriage that requires a lot of patience
a lot of practice to master and one of
the things that I love about these
little wheels that I can select the
unscrew to raise it or lower it in case
I need to level the tripod on an even
surface however obviously as a
professional video slider it's got all
these screwing holes at the bottom so I
can easily just attach this to my tripod
it's compact and it gives me very
beautiful smooth slides something that a
lot of people have been complimenting on
our videos and so basically that
concludes the equipment rundown and now
let's check out the the rest of the
setup so the system you see behind me
that's my workstation that's where
I go every day to answer emails to write
scripts to edit videos to upload videos
so that's like be the daily workhorse of
a desk and of a computer I am using the
21 by 9 monitor from LG but I usually
have dual 27-inch g-sync monitors on
there because of 144 Hertz which I love
more but this is really cool for
entertainment and movie consumption as
long as things are 21 by 9 aspect ratio
as otherwise you get these black bars in
this and by the sides but this is kind
of the the setup very symmetrical
looking in case I need to do any filming
I move this desk around so this is my
mobile desk I can place the camera in
that corner I can place the camera in
that corner I can place the camera over
here and then looking into this
direction so I get this beautiful sort
of setting behind me but let's first
talk about the audio my main speakers
right now are the audio engine a 5 plus
the bamboo Edition it adds beautiful
element in terms of aesthetics because
they are both kind of just positioned on
each side of the the screens and they
are beautiful wood they are really loud
they have pretty their basic response
now my headphones of choice are the
following the HD 650 s from sanitizer
and HD 800 from sanitizer and one behind
there this is the HD 8 DJ so these are
cost headphones which are excellent to
travel with they're built like a tank
they will never break and these are a
bit more stationary for a home I travel
with these anywhere I go and these are
strictly for home use just because they
are a little bit on the pricey side and
they're a bit more fragile than the
others they're sitting on the
Silverstone headphone stand which is
full aluminium base it's like a hammer I
love this one especially because it
allows me to fit both headphones on
there the headphones are connected to
the Silverstone DAC and amps or
currently this is what I'm testing with
this is the amp and the DAC is right
behind there this is a USB DAC the amp
is connected to the DAC the DAC is
connected to the computer
and it allows me to quickly monitor the
volume of headphones with this volume
knob gives me a blue indication of
connectivity both for the amp and the
DAC which I like this visual aesthetic
and this is the scarlett 2i2 this is
strictly for microphone use which is XLR
XLR XLR connected to Audio Technica 2035
so everybody's been asking about you
know how do we get the audio this is the
audio technica 2035 and for peripherals
these are my daily drivers I love them
they travel with me everywhere I'm
actually currently testing the my onyx
caster this is their new Mouse and I
gotta say I'm almost in love I love the
gliding feet it glides super smooth on
this aluminum in win mouse mat and this
is the cool Master Nova touch tkl it is
10 keyless as you can see which I miss
but I can't go to another switch they
use the top row hybrid capacitive switch
which is designed by Cooler Master I
think they do the collaboration with
Chopra so they are amazing they used the
cherry stem so I can actually replace
the key caps because they have the X and
I can use just regular cherry compatible
cherry MX compatible key caps with this
keyboard but I don't have to I don't I
don't mind the stock configuration here
but it's very light switch it's very
quiet switch I can't go to anything else
because this is my favorite switch so
far it's also compact it comes with a
removable USB cable it's very sturdy
very simple looking and that's kind of
exactly what I was yeah I look for in
the keyboard now because I'm testing the
caster I have the my onyx nails 7000
stashed away this is my by far my most
comfortable and favourite Mouse of all
and I'm not exactly sure if the caster
will replace this but one thing I'm
realizing that the mouse feet on the my
onyx nay of 7000 are not as good as on
the castor and so I might actually just
switch the caster and
the my onyx either do for a giveaway or
just you know just in case Mouse
now obviously the highlight of the
entire editing suite is this 21 by 9
aspect ratio monitor from LG it's a
really outstanding panel its IPS it's 10
bit it's given me 34 40 by 1440p
resolution so basically for K by 1440 P
and I can span the entire timeline of
premiere on it which is awesome however
the only thing is because it's curved as
you can see it's giving you this bowtie
effect which is awesome for multimedia
and it's a bit more I can say immersive
if you're sitting down and watching a 21
by 9 movie however if you're working on
anything and Adobe Photoshop Premiere
After Effects you know all your straight
lines are slightly curved especially on
the angles here and I don't like that so
I will be switching this the to my dual
27-inch 1440p monitors so I can have a
bit extra real estate and I don't get
too worried about the the curve this
factor so the monitors are standing on
this dual base system the base is black
aluminum it's from Silverstone allows
you to allows me to raise the monitor a
little bit and stash things away behind
it or underneath it so I have my card
needed here I have some mail that just
came in I have a few office companions
with me like the true bond that I got in
Berlin and it still works check this out
and it's slow just like in real life
port Rabanne
I have my intel SSD that is ready to be
populated inside the machine a few extra
gh4 batteries right there right in hand
reach my dinosaur and obviously the
minion the famous minion it makes its
way into a lot of actual reviews because
it's if I'm shooting in front of my
setup you always see this guy and he's
made his appearance on both this side
and this side where I have the Majorca
post card alright the last piece of the
puzzle would be the chair so this is the
dxracer d series chair
I have the blue version it's comfortable
for me because the leather doesn't make
me sweat it's pretty soft they have
adjustable armrests you have the very
comfortable lumbar pillow that I cannot
use the chair without and actually very
uncomfortable without the lumbar pillow
you have a little bit of a neck pillow
that I use all the time because without
it there's this plastic piece right
behind here that you were constantly
banging your head with against okay guys
so that concludes this show tour of the
office and how I do my work and so I
hope you enjoyed this behind-the-scenes
a quick rundown on the equipment and
studio space how I maneuver some of the
things while making videos I will be
making an upgrade video on the editing
right behind me because nothing has
changed since my previous upgrade video
but I am switching to the skylight
system so we'll see how that is
performing against the the 3930k with a
6700 K processor both were gaming and
editing so make sure to subscribe to not
miss them I hope you enjoyed this
in-depth look of my work scene if you
have any questions leave them in the
comments below I'll make sure to answer
all of them so make sure to subscribe
for more similar content and we'll see
you in the next one all right let's get
