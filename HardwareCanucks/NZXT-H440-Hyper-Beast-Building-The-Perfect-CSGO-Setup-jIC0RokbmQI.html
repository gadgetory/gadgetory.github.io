skin designed by brock hall fur has now
made its way into the limited-edition
and 60h 440 we're only 1337 cases are
made and then they're gone forever
delete and of course we have to get our
hands on one of the hyper beast
so let's observe the art right after
message from our sponsor
introducing the new o2 z VX 500 all
state drives from Toshiba it offers
great well balanced speeds bills with
mlc nand flash for superior endurance
and is also backed by five years
advanced warranty program learn more
about the VX 500 at OTG com so first the
hyper beast
h 440 sells for quite a premium $80 more
than the original but for hardcore csgo
fans this might be a fantastic addition
for their in-game weapon skins I
personally appreciate this direction in
the NZXT with them being gamers
themselves and actively involved within
the csgo community so it's the unique
way to contribute to a highly popular
eSport especially when you can pick up
the special edition gaming peripherals
surrounding the hyper based skin like
the rival 300 from skill series although
I'm sure an interesting RTS would have
also come through the esteem of skins
seeing those are quite popular with the
OP but nonetheless this vibrant creature
on a PC case for even non csgo players
might be appealing to however some may
look at this is yet another unnecessary
h4 for Tier II skin but I totally
support it so let us know which side of
the camp you align with this only leaked
number of cases are produced each comes
with a unique metal flake on the inside
on top of the power supply shroud with
your model number and grade so we get a
cool 11:48 which is just a small detail
but I would say it's an important one
for those wanting to quantify being part
of this limited production run next I
want to highlight the gorgeous detail of
the artwork that spans the full front
panel and the windows side panel also
the transition alignment is pretty
spot-on that flows well around the
window and the artwork darkens as we
approach the rear so the majority of
color definition stays at the front with
beautiful dark purples light blues and
those orange actions on the teeth
thumbs up you can see the beats mouth
and the I clearly along with those green
body elements the transitions into dark
feels as we switch side panels the rest
of the case is matte black I kind of
wish the artworks build to the top panel
as well for me just a small portion
while the rear side panel has that sharp
color cut off but with the discrete text
of the model number being a limited
edition only visible at certain angles
since the artwork is applied directly
onto the metal panels it's a bit glossy
and just from handling all the panels
the paint job does not show any sign of
damage that's what I want to ask both
csgo fans and Outsiders and once you
think of this art form and what do you
think more case manufacturers should
implement game specific themes for a PC
enclosure and if you do think so which
game to showcase on a PC enclosure let
us know in comments down below that's
what the rest of the H 440 nothing's
changed and I kind of wish that more of
the hyper beast graphic made its way
into the interior but the NZXT logo that
is illuminated is now in blue to
complement the color theme there's also
an 8 fanned PWM fan hub with 5 metal
candies that have been redesigned to
support both SSDs and hard drives at the
same time as per our requests in 2014
and what I would have loved to see is an
integration of SSD mounts at the bottom
of the caddies so you can basically
utilize dual drives on each drive caddy
and perhaps remove the ones that you're
not using for a more efficient airflow
I feel pretty proud of that BAM not sure
why this poster is included I would
prefer mousepad for the $200 price but
on the topic of branded peripherals I'm
actually quite impressed at the color
consistency which plays side to side the
rival 300 Gaming Mouse the finish on the
rival is non glossy but the oranges and
the blues and the purples are
practically identical something that I
appreciate for users trying to you know
build their set around this hyper beast
theme which is exactly what I did
including the skill series 8 X M 800
keyboard and a 144 Hertz gaming monitor
now for some reason with this entire set
being this over the top it makes it okay
plus I said the air fans and the xr-50
to cooler to match the blue on the
shroud that can be turned off by the way
to complete this hardcore csgo
Gaming set up the keyboard lining can
also be set up to interact to in-game
elements the same goes for the mouse
although that completely pointless
but em sixties own lighting through camp
software can be turned on to show
in-game health for example if you want
to set up the ultimate csgo ring and
with a game becoming so popular this may
be a really good way to test the waters
and potentially start a new trend within
the industry but I'm curious what the
next gaming scene case might be so share
your speculation down below not
necessarily for NZXT but just a general
trend of merging in game art with the
house for all your hardware so thank you
so much for watching I'm Dimitri with
how are Canucks we'll see you in the
next video leap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
