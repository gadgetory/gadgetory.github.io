Knox and welcome back to another review
antek has been a little quiet lately
with new cases perhaps not as aggressive
with new releases as the competition but
today we're going to take a look and the
PIA 280 the white windowed version and
builds on the very popular p2 80 chassis
with the same focus on silence and
retails around the $150 mark the main
difference now include a new white
powder coating which is pretty sweet and
the large side panel window to reveal
the gorgeous interior now usually
windows side panels are not the best at
noise isolation but here antic used
polycarbonate there is a more durable
plastic compared to acrylic panels that
we see so often and this is actually a
better soundproofing material so it is a
good implementation the front panel
opens with a nice span of 270 degrees so
you really have to try really hard to
accidentally break the door and it is
coated with noise dampening foam the
dual front intake is covered with a
removable dust filter and the fans are
secured by two screws plus these knobs
on the corners for easier installation
the panel is spaced away from the fans
leaving a nice gap that would equate to
appropriate airflow while keeping things
silent connections wise there are four
USB ports audio jacks and PR buttons at
the very top along with dual 120mm fan
mounts moving through the back we have a
3 channel fan controller an exhaust fan
9 PCI slots and a nicely ventilated area
behind the motherboard plus a bottom
mounted power supply dust filter that is
removed from the side and the chassis is
well elevated for that convenient access
also for any picky individuals out there
the white on the chassis varies from the
powder coating parts to the plastics
used it's not a really big deal but it
is still worth mentioning now taking off
the panels it is an identical interior
to the previous p2 80 and even resembles
the antic 1100 the drive caddies here
have rubber grommets to prevent audible
vibrations + SSD support in the middle
the problem however is with the screws
provided for mounting of mechanical
drives as they're just a tiny bit too
long
and when fully screwed rindy allowed the
drive to wobble and you can see here the
drives are not fully secured on to the
bracket and this is caused by the screws
being too long and for chassis with sole
focus on silence this is a bit of a
letdown and aside from the standard
drive cage there are two dedicated spots
for SSDs that also could use an
improvement because the drives are
mounted too far forwards the window
panel closes just fine but it's the back
that's inconvenient and is routing your
SATA cables to the very top and all the
way forward might introduce hassle and
this SSD cage really should be relocated
so the SATA connections are aligned with
the rest of your drives and the back the
drive cage also supports two 120mm fans
with a simple clamp attachment which is
really convenient and allows that extra
airflow delivery+ the case is large
enough to support 12-inch GPUs without
any clearance issues now I don't
particularly like the location of the
fan controller at the top as that
requires a molex connection and I really
don't see why this couldn't have been
installed in the rear where all the
cable mess is handled and turning the
case around the p2 80 white is so easy
to work in thanks to all the camo tiny
notches to security cables and over 30
millimeters of clearance until the panel
and one thing that I haven't seen on any
other case are these new rubber grommets
that are not simply aligned with the
cutout but instead have these little
rubber Clips holding them in place thus
making them a lot more secure when
passing multiple thick cables through
and starting with the assembly the
chassis is clearly designed with excel
ATX motherboards in mind for that
four-way GPU setup because the rubber
grommets are spaced to accommodate for
large motherboards which actually causes
a bit of cable clutter for standard ATX
set ups the lack of any cutouts
underneath the motherboard meaning
discrete routing for the front panel USB
and audio ports is a little more
difficult and I wish the cutouts
underneath were included now if you play
the water cooling we have just over 50
millimetres of clearance from the top
fan until the memory modules and a wider
top portion of the chassis to
accommodate for why the radiators and
flipping the case around it does clean
up well and certainly can handle a lot
more routing those SATA ports was
unpleasant oh and the extra molex
connector near the rear fan is not ideal
but the pto Eddie sure pulls it off now
it's on the cleanest of the builds
because the slightly spaced rubber
grommets and the large window doesn't
help either the polycarbonate window I
think is a good addition certainly the
better choice of plastic for
soundproofing and while this chassis has
a lot of functional qualities like a
roomy interior and very clean-cut design
and then you improved rubber grommets I
cannot say I'm impressed in fact I'm a
little disappointed that an tech is not
taking cues from the competition where
it's about bringing something new to the
table and not just the paint job the
included screws for the drive caddies
are my biggest complaint as they just
don't securely hold the mechanical
drives in place the SSD cage needs to be
moved back and the fan controller hub
needs to find a new spot and if you're
serious about silence the defined Excel
r2 would be a cheaper and a more silent
alternative while the p2 ad has the
advantage of a window to showcase your
components and I was honestly expecting
more from an tech based on the most
recent releases from the competition so
we'll see if they're able to catch up
with something more innovative in the
near future but what do you guys think
of an tech leave your comments down
below and as always thanks for watching
and we'll see you in the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
