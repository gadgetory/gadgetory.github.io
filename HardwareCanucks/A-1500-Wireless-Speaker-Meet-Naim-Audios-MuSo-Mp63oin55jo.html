powerful message to the audience it can
be a beautiful experience across devices
beat your headphones desktop speakers or
even your crazy home theater setup
however the actual way people consume
content has changed moving from the
physical media to streaming services
like Spotify Pandora SoundCloud 8tracks
and even YouTube all of these provide
super convenience and access to an
enormous collection of albums but
unfortunately in many cases quality has
suffered I have my own collection of
flag files that I enjoy listening to on
my PC but wireless in-home listening is
slowly starting to gain momentum name
audio has been run for almost 40 years
in the hi-fi industry and in our quest
to explore unconventional audio products
we wanted to step out of our comfort
zone to experience their Musso wireless
music system that carries with a wallet
black hole and astronomical $1500 price
tag we may as well start at the top
right now before you start rolling your
eyes at this price remember that name is
targeting their moosa' towards people
who aren't happy with the audio quality
provided by lower cost streaming devices
this is a niche market but it can't be
overlooked so it's clear that the mousou
is a premium class luxury sound system
that is not afraid to cater it to a
particular type of consumer and I'm
approaching this video from an
experienced angle that means I
absolutely love listening to music in my
spare time and quality does matter so
let's see what it means to own one of
these right after message from our
sponsor
introducing the new OC CVX 500 salt
state drives from Toshiba
it offers great well-balanced speeds
built with mlc nand flash for superior
endurance and is also backed by five
year advanced warranty program learn
more about the VX 500 at ocz calm
crafted any wooden speaker cabinet which
is then wrapped in anodized brushed
aluminum this is one gorgeous looking
product and let me be clear the mousou
at its core is a wireless music system
and it's intended to be used as such
it's not meant to compete with wired to
speaker setups instead name audio is
banking on the convenience and elegance
of the sound bar to fit in certain
environments while wireless streaming is
the primary focus here name has still
provided a reasonable IO with an optical
s/pdif Jack Ethernet port if you want to
hardwire the system to a network a
standard 3.5 millimeter stereo jack and
a USB port for connecting your mobile
devices supported file formats are
plenty with 24-bit up to 192 kilohertz
with maximum 48 kilohertz in Wireless
mode and the Wi-Fi signal is limited to
2.4 gigahertz band that last point is
particularly important since the mousou
will detect 5 gigahertz Network but it
won't be able to connect to them all
those antennas are seamlessly integrated
into the chassis so an external antenna
isn't required the musso's design is
meant to blend seamlessly into any
environment it has a rectangular shaped
sound bar sitting on top of a thick
solid acrylic base with an illuminated
name logo that can be dimmed through the
app you probably decide against that
though since it looks amazing in the
dark
the anodized brushed aluminum
complements the high-end price giving
the entire thing a premium feel it also
weighs a ton if you want a bit more
personalization the front grille can be
customized with three options like deep
blue vibrant bread and burnt orange
which looks unique but are $85 apiece
there's also a ventilated version in a
beautiful light metallic Brown that
would perfectly fit into your
million-dollar postmodern house if you
need a smaller more compact setup name
also offers the newer Musso QB which
we'll be taking a look at very soon the
passive heat sink is located at the back
to cool the drivers and internal
electronics so make sure to provide
adequate room for ventilation this may
seem odd for anyone used to other
wireless speaker setups but we have to
remember the mousou is built with
high-end audio components all backed up
by an advanced 32-bit signal processor
and all of that causes heat that DSP is
a key component of the mousou eco system
it's capable of taking poor quality
signal which is usually the case with
wireless streaming audio and up sampling
it so the sound you hear is less
cluttered by noise poor audio quality is
a hallmark of streaming audio and name
has worked out a way to bypass many of
those issues so their system can shine
the circular capacitive touch interface
at the top is wrapped around by volume
ring The Dalles movement is perfectly
smooth without any resistance for
fine-tuning volume levels and it's also
lit up by an ambient white LED like
everything else about this thing it's
the subtle touches that works so well
powering the system requires just a
touch of the power button or opening the
accompanying name app there are also
options to play pause and skip tracks
right beneath you'll find an I radio
option which allows for the cycling
between six station presets that can be
customized through the app that I'll get
to in a moment
inputs can be changed by the icon beside
the I radio option that switches between
the 3.5 milimeter analog source followed
by USB
and finally digital source all this can
also be done over the included remote
too after seeing how great the mousou
itself looks and feels the remote is a
bit of a disappointment and
unfortunately lacks design cohesion with
the speaker there are six drivers
altogether and each of them is powered
by a dedicated 75 watt digital amplifier
so in total you're looking at a power
output of 450 watts which is astonishing
considering the form factor there are
two large custom base drivers
complemented by an outlet at the end
which is designed to move large volumes
of air with low turbulence for richly
textured low distortion bass you've also
got a couple of silk dome tweeters and
finally two fairly large mid-range
drivers to give vocals a sense of
definition so overall the mousou pack
some serious punch under the hood the
mousou supports UPnP airplay standard
bluetooth streaming bluetooth with the
apt xcode oh by the way title and
spotify connect spotify connect is
actually what I used
testing since it provides higher
sampling rates than standard bluetooth
protocols and there are many options
with the apt X codec now if you decide
to invest into another move so speaker
like the QB you can pair them together
through the app and start listening to
the same music across the speakers or
you can individually control them you
can pair up to five of these the
complimenting app is available for both
Android and iOS and it is mandatory in
order to initially set up the speaker
system once you go through the pairing
process which takes about five to 10
minutes and I actually had a bunch of
problems with this since the mousou
continually tried connecting to the
unsupported 5 gigahertz on my router on
the home screen you can switch between
inputs and the I radio presets or select
a supported wireless streaming mode for
example when you click on Spotify it
will open a control panel but you will
have to separately launch Spotify and
ultimately control the mousou from there
it automatically detected the sound bar
under the devices list and for most part
it worked perfectly but there were a few
random signal losses every now and then
which required me to reconnect the
Settings tab is pretty straightforward
it allows you to set an alarm clock turn
off the lighting and a few other minor
adjustments that loudness setting is
important too since it extends the
speaker's dynamic range when music is
playing at lower volumes and it works
really well the disappointing factor
with this app is that it kept crashing
occasionally and froze my phone every
now and then it could be the lack of
memory management on androids latest
operating system new gate so I'm hoping
a software update would fix this issue
this is something I would expect from a
speaker system that costs so much I set
up the mousou in my living room on a
desk which is the perfect fit for a
space of this size and my god it sounds
phenomenal since this is a directional
type of speaker positioning is important
I would spend some time experimenting
with different spots if you have space
since sound quality can vary with that
being said the mousou has the capability
to fill a room with pure sound I've been
listening to a lot of trance music
lately and on this system the bass
sounds so tightly controlled it's nearly
perfect and doesn't take over the highs
the result is fantastic clarity in every
single element of the soundstage you can
hear instruments that make the slightest
contribution to the overall composition
and it allowed me to read
our key parts of my music library and I
want to be clear about this despite its
size the mousou is the best wireless
speaker system I've come across not only
has name given a ton of power but that
power comes out in the best manner
possible without any emphasis on one
particular audio element there's
fantastic resolution full-body sound
without any distortions and II finally
controlled frequency range which is
expected from such a luxury speaker
secrets of the goddess which is a
soundtrack from Far Cry 4 fell lively
while classic hits like Beethoven's
Symphony number 5 in C minor exhibited
an outstanding soundstage trust me when
you start playing a track from start to
finish it sounds full and I have yet to
experience something better than this
there are times you'll just want to
close your eyes and listen again to your
favorite song while completely
forgetting it's streaming wirelessly why
don't we take a listen but remember my
microphone just can't pick up the
nuances being displayed here
the mousou from name audio is a
testament to British engineering and I
truly consider it to be a fantastic
wireless audio system for my living room
for $1,500 there's some people who will
of course critique the price and that's
understandable
however for someone who puts value into
sound quality the mousou feels like one
of the best options available name has
nailed my expectations with outstanding
sound quality beautiful design and most
importantly the convenience of wireless
music listening the matter software
issues aren't a big deal to be honest
because you're going to be spending the
majority of time using Spotify airplay
or your stock music player to stream
your favorite tunes if you happen to
find one at a local music store do not
hesitate to give it a try the mousou is
an incredibly expensive speaker one that
leaves you to hope that someday it
deserves a spot in your home oh hey
there and see XCOM is Canada's leading a
tailor for anything your mind desires
just keep within those categories which
are plenty and get tempted by their
weekly deals FYI Black Friday is coming
