everyone I'm Dimitri with Huracan ox
welcome to another video today we'll be
talking about something that goes quite
close to me as the topic of today's
video is the first topic that I
discussed on camera for the harbour
Crocs YouTube channel back in 2013 and
that video was the top 10 needed PC case
improvements that would like to see and
I'd like to revisit the same theme for
this video so I'll talk about how this
case industry has evolved and what we'd
like to see for 2017 and these top
trends that I would love to see in this
year moving forward so let's talk about
those things that I said back then right
after message from our sponsor
introducing the new o2 z VX 500 solid
state drives from Toshiba it offers
great well-balanced speeds build with
mlc nand flash for superior endurance
and is also backed by five year advance
warranty program learn more about the VX
500 at OTG calm so from that video from
three years ago I mentioned 10 things
and by the way my balcony then and the
green we looked amazing let's just say
that but first of all I mentioned
modular 5 the quarter inch drive base
it's actually hilarious because you know
rest in peace 5 the quarter inch drive
bay you it's quite difficult to find a
case now that has a five-minute quarter
inch drive bay most of these most of
these don't but if they do they are most
likely modular so that users can remove
them and install radiator fans or fans
in general in that front area then
exclusive rear drive access for drive
caddies and they said this because you
don't need to remove both drives both
side panels to access your drive that
pretty much has gone the way it is so
awesome stuff better clearance for
intake fans in the past we've seen so
many blocked off front panels whereas
now it's pretty much open with just a
little mounting points in this whole
area there is now clear for air flow
intake so you get less vibrations to get
less noise and more airflow so awesome
stuff then I said more open and clear
front drive cage so that was in
conjunction with more clear front
airflow and it's funny because the drive
cage you know the standard drive cage
that you
to be occupied right in front of those
fans is gone you know restaurant please
drive change everything is moved to the
back now because the drive capacity has
increased so you don't need as many
drives in your case to occupy your
storage needs
so that's awesome then we I wanted clear
side panels with no fan grills so that
was one of the trends to have you know
an acrylic side panel with fan mounting
grills so you can install side fans and
to cool your graphics card area but that
looks absolutely ugly so we completely
get rid of that and the trend now is
tempered glass so we don't see many
acrylic side panels anymore or we still
see them but the tempered glass is the
way forward then I wanted pool dustproof
enclosures and that pretty much has
gotten to us but the point of still some
cases still not having proper top dust
filters but in your in terms of front
desk filtration power supply that
filtration and like all the intakes
areas is nicely covered there my next
point was on space efficient design for
the interior and I think we've gone to a
point where I'm really excited to see
where we go next
for example cases like define see and
define many see you know we have very
nice short enclosures but still
accommodating everything that we need in
such a tight and compact package which
cases like you know they ask you 40 the
P 400 everything is designed in a way
that it suits you know any standard
builds and you know that next level of
builds for enthusiasts systems for
radiators and dual GPUs and etc so
everything is accommodating without it
being overly bulky then I wanted mortuus
assemblies and really focus on that
with more SSD caddies and I think now
the SSD caddy direction is completely
filled up we have excellent SSD mounts
now with pretty much the entire
enclosure being toolless aside from like
mounting your new motherboards and stuff
I remember one lien ly or maybe cool
master wanted to introduce some screws
for your motherboard so you actually
don't need to use a screw driver when
mounting your motherboards and that was
pretty cool and then next is module
drive cages and caddy so it kind of ties
in with a whole module theme and that
that's been here like module drug cages
now usually they're installed
individually so if you don't need one
you can remove them whereas in the past
when three years ago everything used to
be in a combo of three so if you don't
need all three you're kind of you know
you're using that space and it's not
utilized so that's awesome and my last
point is I mentioned we want to see more
innovation and aggressive price
competition I think right now it's
filled the main point this is probably
the only point on that entire list where
I would still like to continue to move
forward because I would still love to
see more price competitive options I
think we're getting there but you know
you can never ask for more price
competing and innovation and so now with
that out of the way let's talk about
case trends for 2017 some of the things
that I would love to see moving forward
first of all tempered glass is a huge
trend for 2017 but specifically I would
love to see the tempered glass mounts to
be improved in particular I would like
to see these for thumbscrews mounts to
be somewhat simplified because right now
many of those mounts utilize some pegs
that has a rubber insert and then you
mount the glass in there and you use
screw the thumb screw in there but that
the rubber inserts sometimes can fall
out and cause some inconvenience in
mounting the glass panel and I would
like to see that completely improved the
cool after five T case has the best
coolest mounting approach that I've seen
so far with you know the simple key and
it has reinforcements on top and bottom
so that you can simply hang it on and
push the glass in I love this approach I
also would like to see more glasses more
glass panels utilize the darker
perimeter around the glass so that it
hides the frame underneath and also when
you're handling the glass you don't
necessarily have to clean the edges
around the inside before mounting
because that panel is completely covered
with some dark material and it's only
visible next is connectivity where is
our USB 3.1 gen2 type-c front io support
still not many cases has the type C
integration at all and you know with the
cable like processors
to 70 platform the new 20 pin USB 3.1
gen2 connectors on motherboards on MSI
gigabyte and asus and many others
already integrated where are they on
cases I would love to see that support
come through very quickly because it
allows the 10 gigabits per second
transfer through food plus we have quick
chart supports so you know with
compatible motherboards so having that
type C port that is Gen 2 on a case on
the front al with the awesome next is I
would love to see more cases come with
low profile handles and this isn't
necessarily to let's say take your case
to some place for land parties and stuff
but this is generally during assembly
I'm tired of picking up cases from the
bottom that is so uncomfortable and
sometimes when you pick up the case the
front panel may come off and it's maybe
a little you know risky with a full
system assembled so cool master 5 t has
an excellent integrated top handle that
fits into the design the Cougar max
which is right here also is you know
it's taller because of that handle but
makes carrying the case while you're
assembling it and it's just the Tetra so
much easier I would love to see more
case manufacturers implement case
handles in a low-profile matter for
easier transportation next is the silent
case and I would love these silence
enclosures with their annoys dampening
material and industrial grade foam to be
supported by the fact simply because
silent cases are more expensive and you
know it's understandably so there's more
material inside the case you know on the
5 panels and the front panel the top
panels but what exactly are these thin
noise dampening materials contribute in
terms of you know acoustic isolation or
insulation so I would love to see case
when the factory give us the numbers on
exactly what frequencies these and this
noise absorptive material isolates and
you know what is the benefit of me going
with a silent case versus non silent and
potentially save some money there next
is I would love to see more interior
unique color options and Dixie is doing
it with their fantastic color selection
Fanta clean doing it with a little bit
less but still more than the rest black
on black is boring
black-and-white is boring black on the
red is boring we need options you know D
brand your case color where is doing
stuff with NZXT cases which is awesome
so you can customize exactly how your
you want your case to look in terms of
color that needs to happen more color
options please which prize in the fact
was we need more different materials and
textures in cases in general I love the
fact that fractal design is still
sticking with that brush plastic front
panel that's much easier to clean than
aluminum yet it still it still looks
just as gorgeous I love that the Cougar
max behind me looks like it's metal but
it's not it's just plastic that's been
sandblasted with this particular set of
paint that looks metal and also the
carbon fiber actually looks really good
too and more textures in general that's
really highlight uniqueness of the case
I'm tired of simple steel boxes I would
love to see more texture and just
surface variations on the case and now
let's move on to the inside and talk
about the power supply shroud I would
love to see more modular power supply
shrouds and I think for now they've
gotten to be as good as they have ever
been with that little you know removable
piece of the front so you can install
radiator and fans in the front there
without sacrificing the full
functionality of what the power supply
does by hiding all that bottom chamber
but what about little removable pieces
near the power supply so you can reveal
your power supply model and showcase
that way how about different material
for the power supply top cover so you
can perhaps put a piece of glass or
illuminated acrylic there so that you
can have this you know different
ambience or illumination from the bottom
and just have this separation of
materials inside your case something
that we haven't seen before and
Coolermaster is actually introducing
these illuminated panels that go that
you can substitute for the maker series
and that looks absolutely amazing I
would love to see more case
manufacturers implement such module
design how about we bring back removable
multiple trays I know it's not something
everybody wants to see because maybe
you're used to building inside the case
with the case on the table but ever
since building with the
werk Bass Pro 900 that has a removable
tray it just it was a little bit
challenging to install back inside the
case but it was so easy to little area
to work with when it comes to
motherboard installation instead of
having this giant case on the on the
table and me having to work with the
motherboards in general so for bigger
cases and perhaps for smaller cases in
removable multiple trays would be nice I
would love to see more vertical GPU
mounts to be properly implemented that
is with you
installing a GPU a simple double-wide
GPU without affecting the rest of the
PCI slots and that is if it comes with a
compromise of wise in the case I will
take it because you know if you're
installing a GPU that blocks all your
PCI slots where am I supposed to install
my nvme SSD plus vertical GPU mounts so
cool to look at you know you'll finally
be able to showcase your GPU and all its
glory and RGB nests and fan nests and
stuff vertical GPU mounts for 2017
they're coming
this one's been building up for a while
and you know many of you might not agree
but case pans should be optional many of
you might still use the included case
pans that comes with your case but many
will also substitute them for more you
know visual cohesion replace them with
RGB fans replace them with better fans
for quieter airflow or your better
airflow and quieter operation so why not
have that option when you buy a case to
have case only or case with included
standard fans case fans should be
optional like if you agree the next one
is also kind of crazy molex why is that
still a thing please get rid of molex
connection for the front IO usually
molex powers like your fan controller or
case lighting but why not substitute the
molex connector with a SATA power
connector and that's way you don't have
to plug in an extra cable for your molex
connector to power whatever that is
needed on the case for molex rest in
peace molex I hope never to see you
again and the last one is I would love
to see more unique accessories included
with cases moving forward
a few cool accessories you've seen this
year is the NZXT puck that's the
magnetic little rubber piece that you
can mount the headphones on you can do
stuff
with people management it has a lot of
functionality built into it it's a
really cool accessory another one is
magnetic toolbox we've seen one from
Coolermaster 5t it's such a cool piece
of kit that you can just like mount
behind your computer or somewhere where
there is metal exposed so that you can
have this toolbox always ready and
always with you another thing is RGB
lighting and not just RGB lighting in
general but diffused RGB lighting we see
so many cases that come with sort of
very bright and harsh light and again
coming back to the 5p that has this
beautiful diffused LED strip it's not
RGB but you know that's I guess easily
to implement but it has this beautiful
soft diffused light to you know put
inside your case that's not harsh from
the light if it's visible directly and
that needs to be implemented and rolled
out with more in case lighting and one
more thing headphone stands to be
implemented directly into the case
something that we saw with Kruger max I
do actually like this implementation it
perhaps a little bit too aggressive but
it fits with the design and when it's
cohesive with the overall design then
it's okay so I guess always does now is
wait and see how the industry changes if
any of the things that I mentioned today
are implemented down the line maybe I'll
revisit the same topic two years from
now and maybe we won't be using cases at
all and maybe cases is this big and who
knows but let me know what some of the
things that's really you know I know you
perhaps on what some the built that is
recently and how you'd like to see case
industry change moving forward let's
have the conversation let me know in the
comments down below thanks for watching
we'll see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
