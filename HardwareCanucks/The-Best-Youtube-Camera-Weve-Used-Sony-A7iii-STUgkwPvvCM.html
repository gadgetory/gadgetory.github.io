we're always told that's not about your
camera it's all about your creativity
and what you can do with it and while I
agree today my friends today is all
about the gear
so recently went through a platform
shift no longer the Panasonic gh4 oh I
love this thing we're now capturing
things with a Sony and it has been a
really interesting experience it's
almost like going from a Mac to PC you
have to learn all the new settings you
have to kind of miss out on the features
that you're so familiar with but still
the a7 3 is my camera of choice for now
I want the advantages of me getting this
whole new system has been really
challenging myself to utilize this
camera to its full potential taking
advantage of that autofocus which has
you know never been in my production
schedule at all but now like doing
things like this makes it so much easier
of course I cannot see myself but I
trust that it's in focus right on my
face but also this whole new eco system
gives me a challenge of trying to do
something different and also you know
given me that creative law additional
Drive so while I know what the jh5 is
capable of it gives me that extra low
push when it comes to new gear to try
something different and it also brings
me joy all right your people so in
today's video let's talk about the gear
the what the why and the how and just
for reference all the gear and the links
to purchase will be listed in the
description below so if you're looking
to upgrade your arsenal be my guest and
also make sure to check out the playlist
about our behind the scenes series where
we talk about lighting tripods and the
rest of things that were not covered in
this little segment about this Sony
upgrade
all right so put the past six months
I've been using a Sony a7 three I've
taken two Computex we're gonna be taking
it to CES and my experience with it has
been extremely satisfactory because it
removes the element of like tried to
think technically in terms of what I
need to do so autofocus is a big thing
with a change v we had the flip out
screen so that's a big thing but I have
to be sitting very close in order to
focus on myself so with the Sony I'm
allowed to or able to use 55 millimeter
the 85 millimeter lens is something
telephoto and still be tack sharp and
focus because of that face tracking and
that has allowed me to do things like
this hello I'm looking for some fans
well now I know autofocus isn't
everything and I never use autofocus
when doing b-roll of product stuff I
always manually focus make sure that I'm
exactly where I need to be but for
on-camera segments like this with native
Sony glass it has been absolutely
incredible set and forget and just talk
and waiting your camera system comes new
lenses of course that is an important
part of the equation for the whole
ecosystem and this is something that
I've always told myself to purchase good
quality lenses that I can afford because
most likely that will outlast the body
or I will most likely upgrade the body
later but we'll keep the lenses and I'm
afraid to admit it but I've never bought
this many Prime's in such a short amount
of time for any other camera system not
for my canons and also my Panasonic's
not my Fugees
but because the sony is a full-frame
sensor utilizing the 18 to 35 doesn't
give me the full advantage so I have to
go with full frame glass that covers the
entire sensor and the 28 f/2 was my very
first lens for the sony 873 and well in
Taipei I found an amazing deal on the
85mm at 1.8 what an incredible
portraiture lens this is my second lens
in this Sony system it's awesome for
people beautiful compression nice bokeh
but it's actually not that bad for tech
products you know I haven't been able to
achieve shots like that with any of my
other systems and it's nice to have full
frame once again and my last prime here
is the Zeiss 55 Miller at 1.8 to
complete my entire range 28
on the wide-angle the 55 member for that
medium and 85 for the telephone portrait
stuff but the Zeiss 55 Miller is
considered to be one of the most
detailed lenses in the world in that 50
millimeter focal range and I absolutely
love it the shots I can get with this
for technology products it's absolutely
incredible to capture that really fine
detail it has that really analytical
character you know the bokeh is very
smooth
I actually prefer busier bokeh but the
detail out of this thing is absolutely
gorgeous and so my most used lens is the
28 millimeter f/2 because a beautiful
bokeh separation I can get real close
has all that face tracking and my latest
lens is the 16 to 35 f4 f4 is not really
an issue on a full frame sensor I can
get still get that nice subject
isolation and beautiful bokeh plus I can
revert to my primes if I really need
that I have like 3d effect with really
insane bokeh but 16 millimeters on the
full-frame sensor is absolutely insane a
really unique wide angle perspective I
love this for vlogs in the 28 millimeter
for one I'm doing things that they're
more stationary Plus this thing has in
body or in lens stabilization plus the
in-body stabilization so it gives me a
little bit smoother footage versus if I
wish to use this it's a little bit shaky
and so those are my lenses I know it's a
little overkill I've never had this many
Prime's in my entire video production
career but I use a 28 millimeter the
most the 16 to 35 for doing block stuff
the 55 millimeter is a beautiful
compression nice reach there and I can
get a little bit closer to the subject
and 85 if I really need that beautiful
background compression and nice subject
isolation as long as I'm further away
from the camera because the macro
capabilities on the 85 Miller are not
that great now my favorite thing about
the Sony camera would be the form factor
it's super compact it's much lighter and
smaller most of my jh5 which was already
pretty compact no issues traveling but
now with these prime lenses which are
super light by the way I can basically
travel with the same weight with those
three primes as I would with a jh5 and
the 18 to 35 now the four key image on
the sony is absolutely incredible
skee sensor I think the down scales up
to 4k so it is more detailed than the
jh5 the colorscience
everybody complains about sony color
science but they've pretty much fixed it
here I use PP 6 and just bring up the
saturation a little bit add little blue
into my shadows so it's not super warm
and that's exactly the look I'm going
for it's been what I've been doing with
the the jh5 shooting in natural profile
and just bumping up the saturation a
little bit in contrast so in terms of
the color science while the Canon
delivers that beautiful out-of-the-box
image that you can upload immediately
without any color grading I don't mind
doing a little bit of work and no no no
complaints at all about the color
science from the Sony camera the slow
motion feature is awesome 120 FPS at
1080p resolution well it's not as good
as on the gh 5 in terms of the actual
1080p image quality the jh5 is much
better with that plus we have 4k 60 so
you can get those really nice smooth
cinematic 4k 60 shots you know slow them
down to 30 P or 24 P I'm okay with the
Sony because I usually shoot at 120
frames on the jh5 as well and I don't
see that as a compromise
what is a compromise though is the frame
rate so if you're shooting at 4k at 24
fps you're utilizing the entire sensor
but if you're shooting at 4k at 30fps to
get that slightly smoother motion then
the sensor crops in a little bit and I
hate that and so how about we talk about
things I don't like starting with the
screen at the back I don't care if it's
articulating you know it'd be nice if
there was a flip-out screen it's okay
for now plus autofocus works no problem
what I don't like is the actual pixel
quality of that display I think the
screen of the g5 has ruined me because
it is so sharp I know exactly where my
focus point is with the Sony I need to
enable focus peaking in order to see
where my focus is because the pixel
detail I guess in video mode is so bad
you have to rely on other tools in order
to know what's in focus and that's a big
compromise furthermore to company this
whole screen issue since you cannot see
yourself many people choose the HDMI
display you can route that into the
camera so you know what's happening
especially when doing things on camera
when you do that face tracking is
disabled which is completely stupid
since it kind of defeats the whole
purpose so if let's say if you're moving
your hand around or there's a slightly
closer object the camera most likely
will focus on that area instead of
tracking your face and the same thing
happens when using the app on the
smartphone to control the camera you
cannot even tap the focus which is
ridiculous you can do that with so many
other apps and face tracking is disabled
when Wi-Fi is on come on I guess there
is no perfect camera we just have to go
around these compromises and actually be
aware of this compromises so hopefully
if you're thinking of the Sony a7 3
these are my main kind of gripes with
the camera and for the first three
months you know what I'd say when I had
the display plugged in if I move my hand
closer to the camera would focus on that
instead of my face and I was wondering
why when face tracking was disabled all
along all right enough about me let's
see what Ebers get
I think I need a change guys
I picked up the Sony a7 three Dmitri
sold me on it to be honest actually
there were a lot of good reviews on this
camera online and it was just a matter
of time but hear me out for a second
I've been using this e100 for the past
four years and when you look at the
system it looks amazing I mean it's a
beast of a camera I absolutely love
shooting with this system because it had
a lot of great features
first and foremost built-in ND filters
cannot live without them also built an
XLR input so I can directly plug in my
shotgun microphone into the camera it
has a great preamp so I don't have to
worry about recording audio externally
and syncing and post it just helps a lot
when it comes to the workflow standpoint
but then I started traveling a lot this
year and I had to actually end up
travelling with two different cameras so
I picked up the Canon a TD this one is
something that I picked up earlier this
year and a fantastic camera for the
price it the dual pixel auto focusing
system in this camera is just it
probably way better than the Sony a7 3
and overall you know for Stills and for
video it's it's again all around an
amazing camera but if I were to compare
the images of the ADT and the c100 the
scene when it actually does a lot better
because in a dynamic range is better on
this camera compared to the ADT so it
was like switching back and forth and it
just it wasn't feasible because I had to
show a lot of vlogs with this camera and
when it comes to b-roll I just switch
things up to the c100 and again didn't
really make that not much of a sense and
talked about traveling with these gear
it's just not practical because I had to
cram everything into this small backpack
that I carry and it just I didn't really
enjoy my experience especially traveling
with traveling with both these systems
and for events and stuff so I thought
really hard I gave
did a lot of research online and I ended
up actually pulling the trigger I was so
close to putting in trigger on the
Blackmagic pocket Cinema 4k because when
you look at the samples online it is
ridiculously so good I choose raw video
and the color science is just oh my god
you know I was looking at the gh 5 it
and it seemed like a pretty good option
but then micro four-thirds was something
that was holding me back
still a great sensor and considering the
specs on the a7 3 for the price it just
was a no-brainer in fact Demetri was
shooting with this camera for a really
long time and so you know just looking
at his videos it just made me want to
switch to something a little bit
different because I was looking for a
system that sort of replaces you know
the c100 and the ATD so that's why I had
to you know go for something like this
now I have to take a few compromises one
I don't get built-in Indies and I don't
get built-in xlrs but I had to invest in
a few other things so I ended up picking
up this variable ND filter that actually
does a really good job you know for my
Sigma lens and also had a step-up ring
for my 28 mil that I have right now I
also ended up picking up this Sigma MC
11 MC 11 adapter it's a sony e-mount - a
canon EF lens adapter and it basically
adapts my Sigma lens without a problem
on the sony camera so that's awesome
now in terms of audio i ended up picking
the zoom h5 which actually does a really
good job with my shotgun microphone the
audio quality is fantastic I'm not
really compromising on the quality sign
but the only thing is I have to sing the
audio in post which is an extra step but
I'm willing to take that sacrifice what
I'm really impressed with the a7 3 is
the image quality the 4k image is just
out of the world's way better than the
c1 who did much more sharper because if
you think about it it's a six case
sensor that down scales to 4k and you
know you wouldn't be wrong or you
wouldn't go wrong with this camera at
all because you know if you're looking
for a system that can shoot a great
video you know a 7-3 is a great choice
but no camera is perfect but I'm just
willing to give this a try and I'm
looking forward to spending you know the
rest maybe two or three years shooting
with this camera so now I don't have to
carry two cameras at the same time when
I'm traveling I can just rely on the ACM
and three because it's compact its
portable it also shoots great video so I
can just toss this in my backpack
hit the road and it'll ease my life a
lot better well that's been pretty much
my experience with the a7 3 I'm really
enjoying it so far back to Dimitri Thank
You Eber I think it was about time to
retire the c100 and welcome to the Sony
camp and with this whole upgrade I
realized that my expectations for a full
frame look were not as they were before
I used to shoot on the 5d that was a
beautiful image but now I've gotten so
accustomed to the gh 5 the micro
four-thirds like sensor size I tend to
stop down my lenses to achieve like a
similar look instead of having that
super super shadow that's a field
because you know I guess our tastes
change as we move from one camera system
to another and it's almost like I'm
trying to imitate the gh 5 aesthetic on
the Sony camera while also implementing
those full-frame beautiful depth of
field look on the Sony and just as well
alright so that is my gear I think I'm
becoming a lot more efficient doing
trade shows CES Computex I mean whenever
we do anything travel wise because the
camera is so light lenses are super
compact we have autofocus fantastic
low-light performance excellent 4k image
nice slow motion until known as good as
the gh 5 but we compromise there a
little bit and yeah I'm pretty happy
with the Sony a7 3 if you have any
questions about the system let me know
in the comments below I'll make sure to
chime in as much feedback and you know
opinion about the whole system as
possible I'm with Petri thanks for
