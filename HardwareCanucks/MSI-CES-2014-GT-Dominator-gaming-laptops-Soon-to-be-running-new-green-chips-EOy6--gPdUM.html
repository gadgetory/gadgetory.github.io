is brought to you by and cix technology
connected alright guys so next up in the
MSI suite is going to take a look at the
GT Dominator series of gaming notebooks
now one of the really cool things about
these gaming notebooks that they
actually use the current gen high-end
mobile GPUs so with the specific device
we're looking at either the seven ATM or
the 770m and it also includes the most
recent as well cpus so we're looking at
the i7 and this one and multiple
multiple essays these in a raid 0 now
this device can also include up to 16
gigs worth of RAM although the vast
majority then come shipped with 8 some
users have actually experienced that
they can bump it up to 16 if they wanted
to and they've had positive results now
one of the really cool things about this
15.6 inch 1080p screen is that it
actually does look pretty damn vibrant
it's what you'd expect from a 1080p
screen and this device also includes
killer doubleshot Nick so you're going
to be getting that high networking
performance so you don't lose any frame
rates and you're not going to be able so
you're gonna be able to game and frag
and basically just kill everybody if you
want to entertain in bf4 msi laptops and
the notebooks also feature steelseries
keyboards so you are going to be getting
the chiclet switches which are actually
quite responses are going to get quite a
bit of feedback when you press on to it
and they have better feedback and
they're gonna have a more tactile
response when you actually press on to
it as well you are going to be getting
this beautiful dynaudio dynaudio which
actually is extremely high-end audio it
actually beats out quite a few other
major audio brands in Europe right now
so you are getting premium audio as well
capacitive buttons here at the top as
well as should be going to get the
standard trash pad as well one of the
major big selling features about these
notebooks that they do have aluminum as
well too so it does look fantastic when
you close the lid and if you're standing
behind it looks pretty damn good too
plus it adds to the fact that it's very
lightweight in comparison to others as
well too so the big brother to the GT
Dominator series is going to be this one
right here it is
a 17.3 inch gaming notebook now one of
the really cool things we've already
mentioned that still serious has a
strong hand in developing the keyboards
are helping msi with keyboards and one
of the really cool things that comes
with these keywords is the SteelSeries
Engine software so basically every
single one of the keys can be
reprogrammed using macros so how can you
do that basically just do the software
so it's really intuitive really easy to
use plus you also get ten key roll over
on the first half of the anti-ghosting
cluster and on the second half you're
going to get a five key anti-ghosting
set up so you have control here to
basically change the color of the
backlight different settings and one of
the really cool features that comes with
this is the actual statistics setting so
when a lot of gamers and a lot of
professional gamers want to see exactly
how many times that they're building a
certain unit let's say in starcraft 2
and this would give you that information
to see exactly how often you're using
that key set in a specific game as well
one of the cool things that could be
coming in the next little bit as well
too is that the profiles when you set up
in this in this notebook will change
depending on the game that you're
playing so you can actually have
pre-configured settings where you can
configure your own and it will launch
the second you get into that game so
this is the bigger brother now moving on
to this guy right here this is the
award-winning GS stealth now I want to
point out the one thing at first I
thought that this right here the little
holes over here we're going to be the
speakers it's not that's actual air
intake so you have the fans sucking in
air here and it blows out on the sides
here at a 45-degree angle so depending
on which handed you depended miss you
are with the mouse you're not going to
burn your hand with hot air so that's
really really thoughtful and really cool
the speaker is up top here and the
design is impeccable they didn't skimp
on any of the details at all whatsoever
as you can see here this is extremely
thin and it does actually have an
ethernet port so it has that
connectivity that you would expect so
you don't have to sacrifice cooling or
performance to have that slim factor as
well too so one of the other features
that does come with us is that it does
include down audio that we already went
through as well
extremely high end audio you're gonna be
getting great great great sound quality
out of it speakers up to up here as well
subwoofer down at the bottom it comes
with the killer doubleshot Nick keyboard
by steelseries you can actually have
three different displays pulling off of
this and and include super rate so you
can have multiple SSDs and arrayed in
zero alright guys so now we got a really
awesome kickass surprise for you right
now this thing right here is MSI's
secret weapon now I can't tell you the
name I can't tell you the specs but what
I can tell you about this thing is that
is it it is insanely light and it's what
15 15 inch so this is a 15 inch display
and we cannot even open it up we can't
even open it up raise it up raise it up
I'm gonna lift it up like this okay we
can't even lift it or I can't tell you
what the specs are I can't tell you what
GPU is in it or CPU or any of that stuff
but what I can tell you right now is
that this will be extremely high on now
maybe or it could be budget we don't
really know we can't really tell you
that much about it other than the fact
that it's all it feels like it's all
aluminum I mean yeah it's extremely
light and the other calling it a secret
weapon so and for what you will
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
