back to another hurricane axe review so
be telling certainly have stepped up
their game when it comes to quality of
their cases and well let's hope they
continue in this direction so we're
checking out the BitFenix ronin and $99
mid tower that seems to have most things
in order and a huge improvement on user
friendly features so the exterior style
is very basic with perforated panels
curvy angles and soft touch coating that
we've come to like so much from BitFenix
and while we do have quite a lot of
plastic the Ronin feels very solid and
very well put together so I'm happy to
see they've added ventilation holes
throughout the panel very much like what
practical design is doing it helps with
improved intake without compromising on
logs so the Ronin has three optical
slots with 3.5 inch drive bay convertor
and behind the panel we have a single
fan included with a screw-on dust filter
it's not the most convenient filter
system but it sure does the job and the
secondary fan option is present with an
extra dust filter included if you decide
to install that dual front intake all
the connections are located at the top
with four USB ports your audio jacks and
PR buttons although the reset button is
so tiny and will require very small
fingers or pen to press the top panel is
removable but unfortunately no dust
filter here and all the connections are
not attached to the frame so taking off
the panel when all the wiring is done
maybe a little bit of a challenge but we
do have both 120 and 140 millimeter fan
support making it very useful for water
cooling and there is enough height for
the fans outside of the frame which
you're very happy to see and given
there's just under five centimeters of
internal clearance till the memory
modules that extra room above the frame
will definitely come in handy at the
rear it's a standard scene with an
exhaust fan seven PCI slots and a large
magnetic dust filter underneath finally
there are not only thinking about the
power supply but the optional bottom
intake fan the ronin also stands on
quality case feet and comes with rubber
thumb screws for the side panels which I
found a lot easier to use than the
regular No
the rubberized thumb screws and finally
coming around to the main attraction of
the externals is the large acrylic side
panel it is unfortunately not tinted but
there is a separate cover inside with a
fine honeycomb design that helps to hide
your power supply area and the drive
cage so taking off the first panel the
only exposed internals are the important
ones and while they could have gotten
away with a differently sized window
panel I actually quite like this design
plus the stealth cover and the metal
frame is removable if you don't
particularly care about it so it doesn't
interfere or obscure the window itself
so on the inside we have two less
optical mounting plus two hard drive
gauges below the top cage simply slides
out so no need for tools here which
allows the front intake to be more
direct but like with pretty much every
case in the market is quite blocked with
the cage installed and there's no fan
mounts on the cage which is letdown
considering there's plenty of room for
it we have slightly more than 12 inches
until we hit the drive cage you are
however able to install a bottom intake
but only with the power supply shorter
than 170 millimeters but since this
bottom intake is filtered make sure to
utilize it for improved cooling now the
drive cage has only three slots and
drive caddies are interesting as instead
of bending them to mount your mechanical
drive so you widen the bracket and
simply place the drive in place as these
are also supported but for that you will
need to use screws the mechanism seems
robust besides being plastic and
certainly a more appropriate design than
having to bend the caddies so we are
finished with the inside and flipping
the case around it certainly is a
pleasant sight with many cable tie
mountings and cutouts the only thing
missing are rubber grommets which this
price are quite expected while there is
less than an inch of room in the back
you can easily tuck your cables away at
the bottom and spread your cables around
so wiring in the ronin is an absolute
breeze and you can see with our usual
assembly all the cables and the monster
GTX 590 the Ronin handles it beautifully
flipping the case around cables are
nicely secured to the back without any
issues and lots more room for beefier
builds so remember the stealth cover
putting that on and your appreciations
soul
is focused on the visible components it
makes you wonder why such feature has
only now emerged on a sub $100 case it
really makes the Ronin stand out with
this unique look and if it phoenix
continues with more interesting features
i really am excited to see how else they
can impress us because the Ronin is well
built it does not compromise on air flow
with appropriate room at the top for
radiators features a toolless modular
drive cage with excellent drive caddies
and excellent cable management the
included stealth cover is an added bonus
for improved looks and released at the
very competitive price point I do
however wish that we had dust filters or
some type of mesh at the top and missing
rubber grommets are a real
disappointment I mean really how much do
they add to the cost and at small
details like that that will help to sort
of grow between his brand also out of
the box cooling is really poor with just
two fans included so make sure to beef
up the case with extra fans if you don't
want to cook your internals but still I
was very happy with Ronin from my
initial impressions to the assembly and
to the final build and it really earned
the Haruka knocks damn good award so
what do you guys think of beat Phoenix
are they heading into the right
direction let us know in the comments
below and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
