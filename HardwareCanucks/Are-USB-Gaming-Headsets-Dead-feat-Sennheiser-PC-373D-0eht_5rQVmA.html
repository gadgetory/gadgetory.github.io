acts and USB gaming headsets have
acquired a larger market share
thanks to their all-in-one nature you
don't require a sound card to power them
everything is done through the USB
dongle on the headset itself and I'm
happy to see some Heiser expand their
gaming portfolio with a PC 370 3d but at
$150 it is one of the most expensive in
the gaming headset category so should
you buy one Toshiba now offering OCC
products that are awesome and affordable
like the Rd 400 TR 150 and vt1 80 that
are backed by advanced warranty program
now stronger than ever under Toshiba so
this headset like with their entire
gaming series follows with the same
fantastic frame design that puts all
other plastic headsets to shame nothing
has changed from the game one aside from
the new color tone but drivers and
microphones are identical to the spec
seriously they figured out the balance
between build quality comfort durability
and it all merges with this frame plus
let's don't forget the volume dial on
the right ear cup that is super
convenient although it doesn't fully
mute the audio in the lowest position
the frame is size adjustable it's
flexible it's relatively low profile
when that when you have the headset on
you the drivers inside the ear cups are
angled for better acoustics and the
velour padding is super comfortable it's
dense enough to create a nice seal plus
it's very nice on your skin this is by
far the most comfortable headset that I
have owned the only thing that you have
to be mindful of is abundance of lint
hair and dust on the velour padding the
cable here is removable which has an
inline USB dongle which then connects
via micro USB to USB on your PC now it's
interesting how I can plug in the same
cable to my game one headset which is
analog and have everything working just
fine and I do like this backwards
compatibility a quick word on the cable
it is not braided it is like a
rubberized and luckily does not
translate too much of the sound or noise
coming from the cable when it's brushing
is to shirt or something like that
the headset itself the USB dongle has a
single button the Dolby Surround button
that luminate s-- when activated and
given the length of the cable it is
unpleasant having to reach all the way
down to the cable just to press it but
luckily we have full control in this
little software window that is far more
accessible so in this window you can
choose which eq settings you want noise
reduction for the microphone and the
side tones for the microphone so you can
hear what you're saying and let's hear
the mic test now it's one comes to the
microphone quality I love that you can
simply mute it by clicking up with a
distinct click this is a digital
connection with a USB dongle so there is
no history in connection but why is it
so nasally there's a little bit too much
processing going on to make this maybe
as clean as it can be which is
unfortunately because it doesn't sound
as natural as the Game one headset for
example that one connects it to my
motherboard sounds a lot better let's
take a listen and so this is the Game
one headset it's analog connected
directly to my motherboard via 3.5
millimeter headphone and microphone
jacks notice just how much more natural
the microphone sounds it's a little bit
more boomy it's not as nasally there
doesn't seem like there's a lot of
compression going on at all and both
microphones have no effects applied to
them this is just pure raw voice now
coming back to the driver software I
find it too basic especially at this
price point and especially coming from
San Heiser I was expecting to be a
little bit more control like giving us
an EQ curve that we can adjust and play
around with now I realize that some
Heiser's may be trying to simplify
things so that the users don't get
overly complicated with trying to figure
out what type of sound signature they
prefer but having those three presets is
just limiting in my opinion so like the
music completely destroys the treble it
brings it down so you lose the brighter
extension and then turns bass into mud
which is terrible for music the eSports
is fine it brings up the vocals but
crushes everything else so I guess
that's a good one for a very specific
purpose if you are trying to watch some
eSports but the game preset is
completely disappointing especially
since that's this supposed to be the
icing on the cake for
this category and so turning on game
mode it just tames the sound in my
opinion doesn't sound as full as if you
were to have everything at off and the
default the sound signature is nice and
bright trebles emphasized we have nice
deep bass and forward mid-range which
combined with an open acoustic design
creates a fantastic soundstage and so
for best acoustic performance I would
recommend leaving the settings and eq's
and its default state but we treat mitri
the whole point of this headset is the
USB dongle so how is the Dolby surround
sound well it does what it promises to
do it's supposed to enlarge the audience
it pushes everything out the soundstage
is a little bit more it's less detailed
but it feels like audio elements are
farther out so for games like path of 1
so in the game where the sound engine is
fantastic the 370 3d really picks up on
all these elements the base region is
present when necessary so you feel the
power of a grenade
to get an enemy out of a trench
last objective George or when blowing up
dynamite trying to damage a tank Charlie
pardon tip on unity Aniston
another little elements like the sound
of gears bringing or bullets flying
overhead you know game you should give
you a true sense of danger which is
thanks to this fantastic driver on this
pair and also the sound engine in the
game too but for more sound we're
competitive play I left Dolby Surround
off sense stereo presentation with an
open design for me is perfect for
position awareness so if you want to be
accused of wall hacks simply listen to
the footsteps and you'll know exactly
when they came and so all of that is
great but ultimately the PC 370 3d is a
disappointment to me simply because the
built-in presets are not what I was
expecting and just not have an EQ curve
that we can adjust ourselves as a big
head scratcher the microphone is worse
compared to the analog Game one model
and while I was contempt with the
maximum volume level it is less powerful
than the game one which ultimately
brings me to the conclusion the game won
and the PC 373 D are identical except
for the cable the USB dongle here in my
opinion is a missed opportunity to give
more advanced controls for the user to
create and fine-tune their sound
signatures it is definitely more
convenient with the USB simply plug and
play and forget but the game one is an
analogue pair offers better value unless
you're gaming off a really old
motherboard that has some poor audio or
just gaming off a laptop that has also
poor audio then I would recommend
sticking with an analogue headset I'm
going to be true with how our Canucks
thank you guys so much for watching and
we'll see you in the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
