you like this format but they want more
b-roll beautiful we need to see more I
want to see not enough people care for
what you wish for because we will
deliver
what's up everyone this is Dmitry with
hardrock onyx and this is the new case
from Rio Toro a company I've never heard
of before but hopefully with the team
who have worked with the biggest brands
I expect nothing short of perfect this
is the Prizm CR 1280 certainly needs a
new name maybe but let's see if it can
impress us for $140 the first thing I
want to get out of the way is real Toro
claiming this to be the first fully RGB
case and I'm sorry to put some brakes on
that statement but we've worked with
some RGB cases in the past like the PCO
8 by Leanne Lee that had actually three
channel color control on the back or the
phantom 2 Lux with some awesome built in
case lighting so not exactly sure where
retour is coming from but the prism here
comes with built-in lighting at the
front with the logo and the top IO which
is surrounded by illumination and also
included RGB front fans that are all
part of the color sync the problem here
with the lighting at this price point
are inconsistencies of some LEDs which
you can see in the top and one of the
corners of the fans that doesn't display
anything in the red Channel to make
things worse fan illumination is pretty
weak to highlight anything on the
interior despite what they show on the
website Plus these are such poor quality
fans because of how loud they are let's
take a listen
it is incredibly disappointing that the
fans are extremely loud let me turn it
on
but moving on the prism is a full tower
with a heightened basement and a
slightly shorter length and here it is
next to the h4 40 the 2015 Edition for
size comparison and I love that we have
actual aluminum case feet which are part
of design language and it's awesome with
very small rubber pieces to prevent hard
metal contact underneath our to dust
filters easily removable from the front
and back which are the same filter by
the way making a reinstallation simpler
my only negative point here is how the
case feet flare out which looks awesome
and it's not really an issue for
assembly but be careful not to scratch
the surface when the case is down since
that portion of the aluminum isn't fully
smooth and could easily damage any
surface and while I do appreciate the
glossy front panel to create this stark
difference in materials used be warned
of handling marks everywhere but behind
the panel are two 120mm fans with holes
for dual 140 mils and I appreciate this
dense mesh that's built into the cover
for dust protection but weirdly there is
no intake for the bottom chamber which
is on purpose by the way and you'll see
why in a moment the case follows what
all the interior trends and drive gauge
relocation is there's nothing on the way
of that front intake which would serve
really well for 240 or 218 on the
radiators and for full Tower all the
rubber grommets are in place for cable
management big thumbs up here it is an
extremely easy case to work in with the
bottom chamber complementing cable
pass-through so why is the bottom
chamber so tall you may ask since we
have all this room above the power
supply well for one the drive gauge is
rotated for vertical mount and this is
to accommodate for more drives than if
they were mounted horizontally
I appreciate the concept but not the
execution one because the drive cage is
non removable it is all riveted I ask
why yet has all this room underneath for
a potential fan which you cannot install
because you cannot get to it furthermore
the drive caddies are outdated you see
that SSD mount and how far back it is on
the caddy
so this causes issues with cabling not
only because the drives are not in the
same plane versus a three and a half
inch drive but also because there's this
plastic that obstructing SATA cables
this is kind of ridiculous that it
passed this enthusiast team that makes
up reel Toro you can't overlook this
issue tow with dedicated for SSD mounts
on the side which are fine by the way
and to lists but there is no way to show
off yours as these from the front due to
the mounting nature of those brackets
and here's the back portion of the prism
again with good cable management and
this clever magnetic cover for the RGB
and fan controller hub I would have
liked full black cables here for the
lighting connectors but at least they
are routed very well on the back the top
of the case is the only thing left
before assembly and I gotta say that
their concepts are great with that
transparent piece that's easily
removable with enough spacing for
airflow to either exit or enter plus a
dust filter is present but having this
reflective piece means any dust or
particles accumulation will be
immediately apparent plus it's crashed
way too easily and by the way the same
thing for the side panel the plastic
needs to be stronger or better yet you
know replace that top piece with an
aluminum piece which would be expected
at this price point as for airflow
triple 120 fans or dual 140 are
supported for pretty great water cooling
we have a lot of room to work with and
I'm happy to see internal space not
restricted by you know some
miscellaneous pieces and my test build
is looking fine although that thick mess
coming from the top
io is disappointing to see which by the
way includes four USB ports audio jacks
large power and reset buttons and an RGB
switch to cycle between colors and to
fan speeds coming back inside you could
spice up the airflow for the bottom
chamber with two additional 120ml spots
or use them for all-in-one coolers I had
no issues with cable management aside
from the bottom SSD and I do think that
that space above the power supply is
just missed patent
I mean you could install a fan
underneath perhaps for intake for the
main chamber but it's really
inaccessible especially since the side
portion of that bottom chamber is non
removable so the prism takes a few steps
in the right direction yet feels
outdated mainly because of the two
elements those fans are absolutely and
the bottom chamber isn't fully developed
with space totally wasted above the
power supply especially since the side
wall is non removable on the positive
side this is a unique looking case with
a lot of potential if in the right hands
but sadly that's not what everyone wants
to hear from $140 product and for
concluding remarks Briatore oh please
refine your execution as otherwise there
plenty of alternatives to do a lot more
for less and you can check out our top
five cases video linked in the
description below I'm going to be true
with our Canucks I hope you guys enjoy
this video you know what to do if you
did and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
