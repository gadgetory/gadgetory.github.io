axe and we were invited to an exclusive
Fujifilm event here in Toronto and
surprise surprise they announced a new
mirrorless camera me bxt - the successor
to the very popular XT one camera and
that incorporates many interesting
features for all kinds of photographers
sports wedding poetry etc and for us
videographers that's right my friends
fujifilm is stepping up their video game
to give the basics out of the way this
camera features a 23 megapixel x-trans
CMOS 3 aps-c sensor as well as the X
processor Pro high-speed image
processing engine that's supposed to
offer great color reproduction along
with superior low-light performance do
note that this is an X amount system so
you are limited to mounting Fuji lenses
one thing I've always loved about Fuji
cameras are the manual mechanical dials
that lets you set the ISO sensitivity
shutter speed exposure compensation and
different metering modes I think it's
more practical to have these doubts
right at your fingertips so you can
quickly adjust those settings to capture
that perfect shot the rear LCD screen
has now turned into a three directional
tilting display so you can tilt the
panel horizontally if you want to take
low angle shots but you can also tilt it
vertically which is always a welcome
feature no selfie mode though
unfortunately Fujifilm also announced a
vertical power booster grip I know when
you attach this module to the camera and
enable Fuji films new feature called
boost mode this maximizes performance by
a slight margin for example you get 11
frames per second of high continuous
shooting versus 8 the EVF refresh rate
boosts to 100 frames per second from 60
the camera autofocus is a lot quicker
and much more now on to the best part
video features the XC 2 is the first
mirrorless camera from Fuji film to
shoot 4k video
it supports bitrate recording of 100
megabits per second at UHD the same as a
Jewish 4 and 1080p the input resolution
is 51 20 by 20 and 80 and when shooting
4k it pops the sensor by a factor of
1.17 shooting 1080p the input resolution
is 3000 by
scene 87 and that gets dropped by a
factor of 1 you'll also find a bunch of
simulation modes and this cycles through
different picture profiles there's an
HDMI port on the left side that outputs
a clean uncompressed 8-bit 42 signal and
as you can see this was paired with the
animal Shogun so you can record footage
to your preferred codec whether that's
Pro res DNxHD etc Fujifilm will also
roll out a firmware update in the future
that will add a new F log gamma option
this will take advantage of the sensors
wide dynamic range they haven't told us
how many stops FDR would be there but
I'm sure this will enhance the color
grading workflow adding 4k recording is
a great feature but if you're running
out of storage do not be afraid there
are dual SD card slots so if one card
fills up it automatically switches to
the second card and for photographers
there's an option to set it up as a
backup raw JPEG or sequential
configuration what you're seeing right
now is a native 4k file without any
color grain added to it this was shot at
ISO 800 with an F 2.0 aperture at one
sixtieth of a shutter speed remember
this is a pre-production model so the
image that you see here may not reflect
what the production model would offer
but what I can tell you is that it looks
stunning with proper lighting at
low-light scenarios the detail is
crystal sharp and I can't wait to test
out once it's here in the studio I was
also able to take some stills and
judging quickly what do you guys think
let us know in the comments down below
all right guys Fuji foam has surprised
us with the video performance on the XD
- I love photography as well and I think
that the image quality that's coming out
of the sensor is clean and gorgeous I
just can't wait for what Fuji film has
to offer for us videographers and
photographers but let me tell you this
the competition is getting tough
especially when you consider the price
buy of this camera starting at $1,600
and also leave a like in this video if
you want us to test out the full
potential of the XD - for video
especially since the price point is so
much closer to the gh4 and also don't
forget to share your thoughts on the
sample footage I've shown or posted in
this video I need bar with harbor
connects thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
