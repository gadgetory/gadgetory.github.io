and after years of waiting finally AMD
decided to launch the horizon 7 just a
few weeks ago and we were pleasantly
surprised by what it had to offer the
1800 XD 1700 X and E 1700 each had their
own combination of excellent pricing and
very good all one performance
I actually competed really well against
Intel's Broadwell II and high-ranked
ability views what's also interesting
about the wizened 7 CPU is that it
featured 16 processing threads and it
only costs 330 dollars while that's not
expensive when compared against insults
ridiculously priced Broadwell II what
about people who don't need all that
processing power on tab
well guys meet risin 5 because not only
are these processors really affordable
even compared to Aizen 7 but I think
that many users might find this a lot
more feeling than baizen 7 so stick
around for a lot more juicy details
right after this
you can only rely on the pro to do the
job with every keystroke satisfying like
the millions before it
quality food every team regardless of
your state to a master master keys bro
they completely make it so what is Andy
trying to accomplish with Verizon five
that's actually a pretty broad question
since they are meant to offer
competition against Intel's cable ace
reviews in a variety of different
markets and price points like all of
AMD's other rising launches the idea
here is to provide buyers with more
processing power and higher performance
metrics compared to what Intel does and
so offers it at a very low price point
in addition when you compare it to
something like Intel's low-rent CPUs or
flow and cable HC feels like the i5 7500
or the i5 7400 these new AMD processors
come unlocked so overclocking is
available which is pretty awesome
even though rising five processors are
officially launching and will be
available today we have a fully
explained video and you can watch it
right here to get acquainted with but
let's have a little refresher I'll be
only reviewing the 1600 X and the 1500 X
right now but there are still other
processors in this lineup that will
eventually around things out so at the
top of AMD's rising 5 stack is these
1600 X and you know what this is the
super interesting 6 core 12 fret
processor at only $250 the number of
threads is certainly important but the
high clock speed is what may help it
complete would be much more expensive
Rison 7 1800 X in games that don't take
advantage of all these 16 threads it
also happens to be the same price as the
i5 7600 K so that should be an
interesting matchup the 1500 X is really
meant to be a direct competitor against
the i5 7500 and 7400 CPUs with the same
number of threads as a 7700 K honestly
though for under $200 this seems like an
awesome deal it looks like AMD ensured
its operational speeds to remain a bit
lower so it won't take market shares
away from higher end rising processors
finally rounding things up are the two
CPUs I won't be reviewing in this video
the horizon 516 hundred and fourteen
hundred wily 1600 is simply a slower
version of the 1600 X M DS 1400 uses a
very different layout since along with
cutoff course it also has less l3 cache
with the focus of these processors being
value the 1600 and 1500 acts ship with
this the rate aspire cooler it does not
come with a ring of RGB LEDs as that's
only reserved for the rising 7 line app
but it should get a job done on these
lower wattage skews meanwhile the 1600 X
won't come with the cooler and all back
when I looked at the risin 7 processors
I mentioned that the new X 370
motherboards will provide an amazing
platform to build a system but what
happens if you don't need everything
those board offers that's where the beat
350 motherboards come into the equation
since they still offer overclocking on
all rising processors having all the
connectors most system builders would
want and cost much less than X 370 as a
matter of fact a motherboard like this
Asus be 350 plus is a perfect fit for
lower price rise and 5 processors since
it only cost around $115 the idea behind
the be 350 chipset is that is used to
create a basic low priced motherboard
but still maintains all the features
that people need for example this
issue's + prime p - 50 features nvme 4x
+ 2 slot - native USB 3.1 gen2 back
panel connectors and 6 SATA 6 gigabytes
per second ports i should also mention
that crossfire supported - but when two
cards are installed the second slot will
only run at 4x mode also if additional
added boards are put into any of the
other 1x locks crossfire will completely
be disabled
basically the be 350 boards are meant
for the majority of people out there who
want a single powerful graphics card
like this arts 480 a primary fast m dot
2 SSD and some higher capacity hard
drive storage that's exactly what buyers
of Rison 5 and the upcoming rising 3
CPUs will be looking for alright with
all that out of the way let's connect
everything up and run some benchmarks
remember for all the testing we disabled
the windows high position event tuner
and enable the high performance power
mode so are you guys ready for this BAM
synthetic benchmarks show that both the
1600 X and 1500 X provide some excellent
results in multi-core testing in
Cinebench pc mark and w prime of the
1600 X is 12 threads
allow it to occupy an interesting space
within the market since it costs less
than the Intel i7 7700 K but it
continually remains upfront the same can
be said about the 1500 X against the
7600 K since the additional threads on
the AMD CPU can be really beneficial in
these scenarios
the only exception for both processors
is PC mark which seems to love the
higher frequencies Intel's processors
can reach moving on to single core
testing and we can see that this is an
area where the lower clock Rison
processors suffer against Intel's newest
cabling architecture even though the
1600 X's xfr raid goes to 4.1 gigahertz
and the 1500 axis will hit 3.9 gigahertz
in single credit situations they can't
match the 7700 KS 4 point 5 gigahertz
and the 7600 case 4.2 gigahertz they do
have our compete quite well especially
against Verizon 7 processors so
synthetic benchmarks are great but they
don't really mean all that much
moving on to real-world benchmarks and
it's obvious that given the price of
these two new rising fly processors they
are pretty good performers however if
you look at the results a bit closer
there are a few more concerning things
going on behind the scenes comparing
apples to apples shows the risin 5 1500
X has the same four core eight thread
layout as these 7700
the Intel processor runs all over it in
7-zip blender and Corona that cable a
chip also performs very close to the six
core 12 thread 1600 X 2
moving on to GIMP and the results
continue very much the same with the two
risin 5 processors providing some very
good results relative to their pricing
against intel's competitors the theme
goes for handbrake remember the risin 5
costs about as much as the i5 7500 in
these charts since WinRAR uses numerous
other components within the system
rather than stressing just the processor
you can see that the results are pretty
consistent across all the CPUs on
benchmarking however I'm going to pause
it on Adobe premier here for a second
since this is a program I use on a daily
basis looking at the results shows that
they rise in 5 1600 X with its higher
clock speeds is a much better purchase
for this program than the more expensive
Rison 7
800 X all of these 1700 yes the 7700 K
beats it by a few seconds but we can't
forget that the processor costs $100
more the same can be said about the 1500
X it provides really good performance
here relative to its price particularly
when you compare it against P 7600 K so
guys this has been a moment you've been
waiting for gaming first up is 3d mark
and Wow these are some really surprising
results for the five strike benchmark it
looks like there are some efficiencies
when moving from an eight-core design to
a 6 chord layout what I noticed is that
throughout the fire strike benchmark the
1600 X remain at a higher clock rate
than the 1800 X and since fire strike
outputs is highly dependent on tool and
single core speeds we get something like
this the same can be said for the 1500 X
it offers really good performance per
dollar
unlike fire strike we can see that the
dx12 benchmark times pi is a highly
multi-threaded program and as a result
the 1600 X and 1500 X still perform well
but the frequencies count for a bit less
in actual games like Battlefield 1 the
Intel processors still maintain a lead
but it isn't a commanding one one thing
that really impressed me was how much
value be wise in 5 1600 X and 1500 X and
brings to the table especially against a
wizened 7 processors since games don't
really require more than 4 or a maximum
of 8 concurrent threads for optimal
performance
these low-priced CPUs are really able to
shine the same can be said about Deus Ex
results it really is hard to justify
spending more than $250 on a processor
both overwatch and Call of Duty infinite
warfare are good examples of a recent
trend in some PC games rather than being
limited by component the game engine
themselves have an internal frame rate
limiter this is done to avoid
uncollected rendering errors but it also
means that the differences between a
$1500 processor and bison 5 CPUs are
minimal at most duel is another one of
those limited games so there really
isn't much to see with it I do want to
mention that this chart would change
quite a bit if we're using a slower
graphics card on the other hand Grand
Theft Auto is one of many dx11 games
that seem to like high clock speeds over
core counts
that means the AMD processors
we struggle to keep up with Intel's
offerings even the i-5 7500 comes close
to the 1600 x in this case so that's it
for gaming results but what about power
consumption we already knew that rising
processors were some of the most
efficient around and these results prove
that remember both these 1600 X and 1500
X are based upon a dual CC x8 core
design but have cores disabled typically
that wouldn't mean higher power
consumption for lower end parts but that
didn't happen here
instead the 1500 X actually consumes
less power than these 7700 K meanwhile
the 1600 X is higher frequencies and six
core design means it consumes almost as
much as the 17,000 X but that is still
quite efficient the performance per watt
ratio against KB Lake processors isn't
quite up to the level of horizon 5
versus older Broadwell ecq's but risin 5
remains competitive at least as for
overclocking there were some successes
and failures both processors overclocked
to just over 4 gigahertz but hit a wall
below 4,000 100 megahertz on all cores
it seems like these chips on their
motherboards have a hard limit that
cutoffs chips power at a certain power
consumption level we've talked to
various contacts as this seems to be a
fail-safe that may be modified as amy
rolls out a new micro code for rising
processors but only time will tell
until then 4 gigahertz is still a very
good result and it boosts performance
significantly on both chips so guys
that's it for the risin 5 1600 X and
1500 X so I guess it's time to wrap
things around with my thoughts about
these two new processors so let's start
with the 1600 X because of all the CPU
is available on the market right now I
feel like this processor offers the best
combinations of efficiency price and
performance because of its 12th red
design and higher clock speeds this chip
can be easily adapted towards various
situations if you're a Content producer
like me or someone who requires a lot of
processing power the Rison 5 1600 X can
easily get the job done this $250
processor can then turn around and
provide excellent in-game frame rates
which can easily match an 1800 X that
costs twice as much it does really well
I price to performance level against
Intel's eye 576
okay even though that processor was a
little bit better in gaming the same
came he said about the rise in five 1500
X what a great little chip for people
who are on a budget it just costs $190
and compete very well against the i-5
7500 in every benchmark to be honest
with you guys going into this review I
was a little worried about how rise in
fire would compete against Intel's KB
Lake CPUs remember when rising seven
came out ahead in many situations it was
compared against Intel's Broadwell II an
architecture that's going on three years
old now but I think it's safe to say
that the rise in five processors fared
up pretty well since AMD was able to
rely on their higher thread count
combined with highly aggressive pricing
to come out on top honestly with rising
fire right now I think it's really hard
to recommend rising seven for gaming
because these processors are really good
I don't give out many awards these days
but I think in this case the Bizon 5
1600 X stands out in a big way
that's why I'm going to give it the den
good and damn good Valley Awards when
paired up with a be 350 motherboard it
will be a great foundation onto which
you can build an amazing system and I
may have done exactly that but you'll
have to wait for that video a bit later
this week so what do you guys think
would you rather rock a risin 7 or Intel
processor or Verizon 5 are you as
convinced as I am about these new rise
and 5 processors let us know in the
comments down below I me both hard
connects thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
