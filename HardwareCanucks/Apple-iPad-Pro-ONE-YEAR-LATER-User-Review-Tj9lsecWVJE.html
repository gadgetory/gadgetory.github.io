comments after I post this video I'm
sure I'm gonna get a lot of hate for
taking a look at an Apple product but
regardless let's do this
what's up everyone
Eber here with Hardwick and X and this
is the nine point seven inch iPad pro
yes it is an apple product and not some
gaming keyboard or a gaming laptop but a
device that happens to be one of my
favorite pieces of tech here in the
office because I use it pretty much
every day to get some work done if I'm
here or if I'm outside a coffee shop
normally take this with me to write
scripts watch youtube videos and catch
up on TV shows and stuff like that and
of course it's a great productivity
device for me personally because it's
got a great portable form factor battery
life is insanely good and the software
experience is respectable so allow me to
walk you through my experience using the
iPad pro for the past year or so right
after a message from our sponsor it's
time to play with light what faintings
digital RGB starter kit that includes
two LED strips and all the appropriate
cables the main hub is magnetic velcro
tape is available with three digital
channels four LED strips or halos Lux
fan frames that display a ton of
lighting effects and they're absolutely
gorgeous check out the kit down below
alright so before I get into the
hardware and software experience I want
to get something out of my shoulders I
didn't pay full price for this tablet in
fact I wouldn't even consider spending
$700 and above for tablet because that
would sort of get into the Ultrabook
category or more or less into the
notebook category I picked it up for
$5.00 canadian here on Kijiji which is
the Canadian version of Craigslist it
wasn't it was a pretty good deal that
the tablet was in pristine condition it
was basically brand new and so I you
know picked it up right away and I
haven't turned back at that position
because you know this guy has held up
really well
for the past year or so and I've been
enjoying my time using the iPad pro now
I've done a few things to add a little
bit of protection to this device first
up I've installed a skin to prevent
scratches at the back and I've also
added a screen protector at the front to
prevent unnecessary scratches or even
the slightest damage because believe it
or not the resale value for Apple
products is a lot higher than Android
tablets and smartphones so if I decide
to sell this tablet later on and get a
pretty good price for it so if it's in
pristine condition
the better the build quality of the iPad
pro is just amazing
Apple has managed to cram a
high-resolution display along with a
faster or fast enough processor the
logic board the battery and all the
other internals into an aluminum unibody
chassis that just weighs a pound this
thing is compact the size is perfect for
me and it feels really good in the hand
and that's something that you can
necessarily find on an Android tablet
now given that Apple still dominates the
tablet market share regardless of the
overall tablet sales declining from year
to year it kind of makes sense because
people are on the lookout for devices
that can run a full version of Windows
or Mac OS in a relatively thin form
factor that comes with all the features
like better build quality good battery
life better reliability and that's
something that you won't necessarily
find on a tablet because while it is
portable you won't be able to run a
desktop class of applications but that's
not the case for me because when I'm
traveling you know I normally carry my
editing notebook with me that has the
horsepower to render and edit videos but
if I won the portability to just edit
scripts or watch YouTube videos or
something like that I think something
like a tablet would make a lot more
sense because I don't mean all that
rendering horsepower one of the main
selling features of this iPad pro is the
nine point seven inch Retina display
with the resolution of 2048 by 1536 it
is an IPS display so color reproduction
is excellent and the viewing angles are
top-notch the display goes as far as 500
nits which is incredible considering the
form factor and it's almost almost close
to what you would get with an ultrabook
it is really bright enough so you
wouldn't have a problem viewing content
outdoors watching YouTube videos and TV
shows on Netflix or even Amazon Prime
has been a pleasant experience
I've even rented two times where I would
edit raw photos from my DSLR camera on
the iPad pro using Adobe Lightroom and
the experience is just amazing the fact
that you're getting a natural displaying
without too much saturation like what
you'll get with AMOLED panels is so
refreshing and like I said it is a
pleasant experience in fact if you
aren't thinking of picking up a tablet
with a color accurate display highly
recommend picking up the iPad pro
because it supports a wider color gamut
and you wouldn't have a problem editing
photos raw photos in particular are
using apps like Adobe Lightroom or
other photo editing apps now Apple has
implemented something called true tome
that essentially uses four channel
sensors to dynamically adjust a white
balance to match the lighting around you
for a more natural and immersive
experience for example if you're using
the tablet in a bright room setting
where there's lots of natural light just
big daylight as instance the color
temperature would be a lot more in the
cooler side because the white walls and
the white lighting would sort of reflect
and it would it would be a lot more
easier to view content whereas if you
switch to say for example you know a
darker scene where you're in a situation
where there are warmer lights then the
sensors would detect that light and it
would shift the color temperature of the
display to the warmer side so it'll
obviously reduce the strain on your eye
I love this feature because you know I
do stare at the screen pretty much most
of the time for work and of course to
fall to contact and to consume content
and stuff like that so it reduces the
stress on my eye and it's really hard
for me to go back or live without this
feature because normally I do turn on
night shift on both my smartphone and
the iPad pro and having the true tone
display sort of kicking in the
background without having to worry about
it
even at night or in daylight is just
amazing ask for ports well don't expect
too much you're not gonna get a
full-size SD card reader or a full-size
USB port all you do get is a lightning
port which you use to charge the device
and of course connect other accessories
there are four speakers integrated in
this tablet so two on each side it gives
you a good stereo separation when
listening to music and consuming content
they are really loud especially coming
from a tablet this size and I don't
think you would necessarily need a
Bluetooth speaker to go along with the
iPad pro because they are really good
they do emphasize a lot on the higher
ends and you can definitely pick up the
mid frequencies they do lack the proper
base response but again that is expected
because after all they are integrated
speakers so I would keep your
expectations somewhat in the middle not
too high but not too low again because
you will be impressed with the sound
quality coming out of the iPad pro
especially since it's gone four speakers
oh I should also mention that there is a
headphone jack
I'm so glad Apple hasn't decided to
eliminate that port on the iPad pro and
what's even interesting is that the
internal DAC is fantastic I was easily
able to drive my Achy gk7 X's and my
sennheiser HD 598 without a problem
again
clean sound so that's one of one of the
one of my favorite features or I guess
it's a really welcoming addition I'm
glad that they haven't cheaped out on
that part so kudos to Apple for that
quick mention on touch ID it's a simple
and secure way of logging into the
device it's fast and it still works
what's even interesting is that this
tablet actually does support Apple pay
so if you do see ourselves using this
device to pay for coffee at a coffee
store that supports Apple pay well there
is an option but you may look ridiculous
doing that so yeah there's a 12
megapixel sensor at the back with an F
2.2 aperture and it can shoot video up
to 4k at 30 frames per second and 1080p
up to 120 frames per second now that's
just a little bit too overkill for a
tablet because I don't see myself
shooting video with a tablet and I
haven't with the iPad pro because
normally when I'm outdoors I do carry my
smartphone with me so if I were to take
pictures or trade video this is what I
would normally use to do that not the
tablet I mean it's great to shoot
documents or something like that if you
want to scan or scan and sign
certain documents I think the rear
camera comes and beneficial but
certainly not for taking pictures like
portraits or just outdoor pix I'm I'm
not that guy now the front-facing camera
can come in beneficial for Skype calls
so that's nice but I certainly don't see
myself again using the rear facing
camera for photography because yeah it
just it just looks insane and now on to
these software experience Apple has been
constantly updating the iPad pro since
launch and currently it's rocking iOS
11.3 dot one which is the updated
version at the time of making this video
one of the major improvements to this OS
is the addition of the dock kind of like
what you get with Mac OS but a
mobile-friendly version you can add your
most frequently used apps onto the dock
which are permanent by the way and your
recently used apps are separated towards
the right when you're in full screen
mode within an app accessing the dock is
just as simple as swiping from the
bottom and you can instantly switch apps
right away which is nice the one thing
that I did find annoying was these
stupid animations while closing and
launching a certain app in my opinion
it's just too long there is a quick and
easy way to fix this all you have to do
is head over to settings then general
and within the vision tab
look for reduce motion and enable that
right away the tablet just feels a lot
more faster so I'm definitely not
turning off that feature iOS 11 also
brings in multitasking which allows the
user to work with two apps at the same
time it works pretty well for the
majority of apps that I used like Google
Docs YouTube Safari and a few more
Spotify is one exception which I found
to be really odd now I'm not looking for
advanced multitasking gestures on an
iPad because after all this is an iPad
and it's not a fully functioning
computer so you won't be able to run
four different apps at the same time but
that doesn't stop me from using the
tablet because all I need is being able
to run Google Docs on one side and
YouTube or Safari on the other and that
setup works for me really well however
the lack of customizing the UI on iOS is
its biggest drawback you know I can't
throw third-party launchers and
customize or add widgets to make it look
a little bit unique compared to other
tablets it's just a plain old look that
comes with all these apps and the home
screen and there's no way to add widgets
or something which is a little bit
disappointing
whereas with Android you can throw in
custom launchers and make it your own or
make it unique and that's pretty and
that's obviously the advantage of the
Android ecosystem when compared to iOS
it's just simple and plain I really wish
if Apple could have taken advantage of
the extra screen real estate that you
get with an iPad because again you just
get a bunch of apps on the home screen
and that's pretty much it so it's plain
it's simple it looks kind of man
so yeah the last thing I don't want to
talk about is battery life and it has
just been incredible at the nine point
seven inch iPad pro features a 7300
milliamp hour battery which is almost
three times the size of a smartphone and
that's expected given the form factor
this thing can last you for a week
depending on usage and the standby time
is just phenomenal my usage primarily
involves editing scripts consuming
content and browsing the web again it's
all about hardware and software
optimization and with Apple devices that
seems to turn out really well because
they design pretty much everything from
ground up so it makes a lot more sense
and I certainly I mean for the past I
mean having using this tablet for the
past year or so the battery life has
held up really well so to conclude I
really enjoyed my time using me 9.7
iPad pro for the past year or so and I
still continue to love using this device
because you know from a Productivity
standpoint that is coming really useful
at times because if I were to go to a
coffee store this is the thing this is
the tablet come that comes with me
because I write scripts i watch content
and I do all kinds of stuff when I'm at
the coffee store when I'm outdoors just
if I want and if I want to get some work
done this is exactly what I take with me
because the sighs it's just so portable
the battery life is just insanely good
and of course app stability there are a
variety of apps that you can take
advantage of not just you know Google
Docs and YouTube but if I were to you
know DJ at an event or something like
that
there are apps that work really well on
the iPad pro and that's awesome what's
even interesting is then for accessories
and stuff like that you won't have to
spend a hundred dollars extra to get a
good keyboard because I do end up for I
did end up picking up this cheap thirty
dollar keyboard from Logitech and it
comes with Bluetooth functionality it
pairs perfectly well with the iPad pro
and the battery life on this can last
for two years which is kind of insane if
you think about it I haven't even
thought about replacing the battery on
this guy and of course you get a great
tactile feedback on this keyboard so
that's awesome so again as I said a
portable set up for me and that's what
the nine point seven inch iPad pro has
been and I again I really enjoyed my
time using this device but I'd love to
hear your thoughts on the nine point
seven inch iPad pro what do you guys
think about it I mean of course this is
an Apple product so I'm sure you have
your own opinions but regardless I'd
love to hear your thoughts I mean but
with hardware connects thank you so much
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
