unusual enclosure to ever land on that
review table should we check it out all
right so that is the deep cool quad
stellar I really appreciate deep cools
direction to do something totally
different and unconventional but is it
actually functional and you know cooling
wise are we sacrificing a lot on
temperatures let's discuss all that for
activists the new and their max look
fusion is their first addressable RGB
all-in-one cooler with a standard 240 ml
rad an absolutely beautiful RGB ring
elimination on the fans and the pump to
highlight that unique flow indicator
through the transparent top check out
the lake fusion down below
all right so the quad sailorman this
case is a whole lot of weird so first of
all the case is extremely large I was
not expecting to be this huge and it's
also super heavy because of all the
metal on side the case like the frame is
metal plastic glass panels on all four
corners the thing is the metal has this
like sandblasted texture to it so it
sparkles a little bit at certain angles
but it does also leave fingerprints
which is unfortunate and also this whole
like front section that is not glass it
is glossy plastic and that got dirty
super quick just as soon as you take it
out of the box and well currently I'm
more into this like elegant chassis
design like this the only case I would
actually not hesitate to build the
system in that thing because who else
has got a computer inside something that
looks like a spaceship this case also
has an app for RGB control for this
whole front section but this whole like
four quadrants in which Hardware sets
definitely allows for air flow division
and I'm curious to see how temperatures
will be affected for your GPU for your
motherboard area and I guess your
storage too the funny thing is the
instructors menu was inside the case so
you have to figure out how to get in and
with a few thumb screws you simply
remove each of these large metal plates
that kind of hold the structure of the
exterior so this is your storage
compartment which by the way looks so
cool without the actual exterior panel
it's kind of like part of like the
spaceship engine situation now the glass
panels are cool because they are fully
magnetic and they sit on pretty strong
magnets you can take off like that so
this seems to be your power supply
section so now let's get into the
motherboard area here's me for size
reference this thing is huge and heavy
now it seems like to get to the
motherboard area you have to rotate the
case so that you can actually access
these panels which have the case feet so
that is kind of unfortunate
okay so this is the back side of the
motherboard how do you get to the front
then alright so this is the GPU area you
can see that by the riser card installed
over here we also have how many six PCI
slots on the side now this whole plate
that seems to be removable and this this
way you can actually access the
motherboard area alright the GPU section
is removed and there is our manual I
mean it's a cool poster it'd be nice if
it was actually outside before you get
it so you know how to get in the
motherboard area is quite large so EA TX
support is not an issue the power supply
sits right below it so routing all your
cables should not be a concern plus all
your storage is right above the
motherboard for easy access now cooling
in such a large enclosure is kind of
strange because you would think that for
something this massive would have more
than a simple 240 million radiator
support so both this top section and the
bottom section supports a 240 radiator
but as you can see these are just simple
holes then nothing is on like strips for
a flexible mounting which is unfortunate
and also this section shares the GPU so
for example if you were to mount the GPU
here that is tall you will not be able
to use any of this area for radiator
perhaps for additional fans for exhaust
so that would be nice but at the bottom
here there isn't that much clearance
above the motherboard tray so if you
were to mount radiator here it's you
know it's a little bit standard and
potentially even crammed and then we
also have this front fan bracket and you
can only mount the fans first because of
how the frame is shaped but it's pretty
restrictive and I would not recommend
mounting a radiator in here because I
don't think will do much as for the
power supply chamber it is poorly
optimized because you cannot do anything
with it
aside from mounting your power supply in
here you could maybe potentially mount
more fans because the bracket has the
holes also we have that front intake fan
over there but the bottom paneling only
one of them has the ventilation so you
probably want to use this guy for your
motherboard area instead so you can get
some airflow for any fans or radiator
that you mount there and probably only
the storage area is well utilized as we
have 9 draft caddies plus as these
that can be mounted all over the place
so storage inside this enclosure should
never be a concern and for cooling we do
have four intake fans at the front plus
one exhaust one in the storage
compartment and dual 80 millimeter
mounts above the IO but I am
disappointed with the water cooling
potential in this giant full Tower for
example the non-flexible 240 mil mount
and the thing is the case is long enough
to support a 360 radiator for example if
you remove the front fan and the
standalone GPU chamber would be this
perfect alternative to house your
cooling if the GPU stays by the
motherboard and I feel like building the
GPU chamber around more support for
radiator is kind of important because
the maximum supported height for your
CPU cooler is a hundred and ten
millimeters which means that you can
only utilize a low-profile coolers
because right now with my pretty
standard average tower from be quiet the
case panel would not close because it
does stick out and I feel like for the
target audience who are spending $400 on
the case at least having an option for
360 rad is an expectation but obviously
with this type of complex frame the
looks are priority but what I hope this
case will encourage is experimentation
from other brands with this kind of
unconventional frame design and then
really hope to see magnetic temper glass
mounts on more cases because they're so
convenient now before the build I want
to point out the Wi-Fi controller hub is
kind of cool for the fan speed control
and RGB but the cables by default are
kind of a big mess and only the i/o
cables are beautifully routed now build
quality for the $400 price point is okay
but I was expecting more for example the
front panel is already loose they are
mechanical so hopefully by the time I
turn it on and goes back into its
original position
with a spring but the only accessible
dust filter is for the motherboard area
and the thing is this dust filter is
non-removable it has been glued to the
panel and it already fell off not sure
how so that kind of sucks whereas the
other dust filters behind the front
panel we find behind the front pants
it's not accessible to you so you cannot
remove them to clean them so dust
filtration is present but you cannot
access the filters and
have to find a way to actually put this
one back on so let's commence the build
sequence
okay so the bill is finished and the
entire boot sequence when you press the
power button on this enclosure is
actually pretty unique let me show you
it really is cool to see all these four
panels open and close twice upon boot
I'm guessing that's for airflow alright
so this is our default configuration
with the quad stellar so the motherboard
is inverted which means the GPU is
upstairs here the CPU and the cooler are
downstairs
now the problem I find even though I
install these beautiful TB RGB fans from
inter max with the ring elimination and
this like cooler here the centerpiece of
attention is not really the illumination
of the hardware but the case itself and
even the framing here doesn't really
accommodate for this like visual
presentation of your hardware so just
keep that in mind and now I populated
the GPU in its own chamber above the
motherboard tray so the advantage here
is the GPU is completely enclosed within
its own chamber there's a front fan
delivering cool air so the GPU should
remain cooler then what you would
experience if it was downstairs with the
motherboard because of all that heat
sharing but also keep in mind this GPU
chamber is actually pretty short so for
my reference card for example it fits
fine and a slightly longer sapphire card
which is about half an inch longer than
the reference card should also fit fine
but anything taller than reference and
maybe like half an inch taller will not
fit because this chamber is not
compatible with taller GPUs also I want
to mention that only one riser cables
included so if you're doing a multi GPU
config in this chamber you have to
purchase them separately which is a
shame for a $400 case but this chamber
does support three riser cable mounts
and obviously this setup brings more
challenges because if you have to access
the motherboard area for per potentially
swap out Savi cables exchange Rams or
exchanging your CPU cooler you will have
to remove this entire GPU section it's
not that difficult but it has to be out
of the way so you can actually access
the motherboard area interestingly you
can populate one SSD in this RGB
illuminated mount to show off your drive
in this already beautiful enclosure so
you can show off your SSD and your RGB
potentially illuminated graphics card
but not so much for your motherboard
area now it is a good thing that the
glass is tinted so you don't show any of
your cable mess because the case is not
exactly tailored for cue management I
mean you could spend some time
cleaning everything up but the case is
so heavy and need to rotate it a couple
times in order to route all your cables
so I just left them like that and the
panel closes just fine all right so once
everything is assembled you realize just
how difficult it is to work in something
like the quad steller it's definitely
not your casual full tower experience
because of this unconventional layout
simply getting inside your enclosure to
swap components or change some of your
hardware that requires you to remove
those really long side panels from at
least two of the sides in order to get
to your motherboard area rotate the case
in order to swap out some things and
that is just not a pleasant experience
from the start till the finish it's
definitely a pretty to look at but it is
not easy to work in now aside from deep
cool approaching this from this unique
aesthetics it is the only case that I've
taken a look at that has an app now you
can only connect the app on a 2.4
gigahertz band which is unfortunate so
you have to be very close to the case on
5 gigahertz band it will just not find
anything but once inside you have
basically full control of your color
your brightness and the speed of all the
effects you also have local control for
those individual areas for the LEDs
giving you full customization of how
your enclosure looks you can also access
the fan control giving it silence
standard performance or a fixed speed
which is pretty intuitive so I've right
now click performance mode and you can
definitely hear those fans ramping up
but probably the most interesting part
about the app is the temp tab that lets
you open the compartments and close them
- it really sounds plasticky and like a
really cheap motor so but seriously
despite the flaws in this outrageous
price point I want to give the quad
stellar our dam in the video of a word
for this spaceship like frame magnetic
2g panels and full app support for RGB
and fan speed I just think we need to
see more experimentation like this that
will eventually lend us enclosure that
has that wow factor and prioritizes on
the user experience
join the wireless club with Corsairs new
dark core mouse play the way you want
with nine programmable buttons aligned
in the comfortable shape and fantastic
sensor you can trust and crazy good
Wireless performance plus qi wireless
charging built-in focus on the game the
dark core will do the rest alright so
that is it for me and the deep cool
gamers storm quad stellar for $400 what
would you have done differently in terms
of chamber separation and feature set on
something that is that big and that
expensive let me know in the comments
below thanks so much for watching I'm
