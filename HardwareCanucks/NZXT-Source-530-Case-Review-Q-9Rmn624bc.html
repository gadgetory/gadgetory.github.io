knocks and welcome back to another view
in six days you probably already know
produces some of the best value for
money and functional jassi's they're
kind of like fractal design in a way
where they stick to the same formula for
internal layout and features and really
don't skimp on anything the source line
is their designated budget series but
surprisingly without that many
compromises so this is the source 530
carrying a very attractive price point
of $90 and design wise it's nothing
special the angular window showcases the
interior perhaps we could see a little
bit less of the optical area and knowing
NZXT that love their angles and corners
the front panel corners have the bent
look almost makes you wonder if that's
something from shipping the panel is
perforated with three optical drive
slots two USB 3 and audio jacks plus an
LED light behind the NZXT logo on the
left and top right for when the machine
is turned on now power and reset buttons
are located on the right side along with
the rear i/o LED light that's built into
the case I don't particularly mind the
location of these buttons but I do
prefer them on either the top or the
front for a more convenient access
behind the panel we find a removable
dust filter with only a small mesh
cutouts and the rest
lots of plastic I'm not sure why they
just didn't stick to the standard sort
of all mesh design and on our model the
fan filter didn't want to sit in place
it is attached with clips and because of
a thick plastic the filter was slightly
warped and always popped out of the
clips I never managed to place the
filter back and that's sort of
unfortunate but on a more positive note
front fan support is excellent with 120
140 and 200 million air mounts plus you
see the additional circular cutouts for
the larger fans so there's no wasted
cooling potential and as you also see
there's no front fans included but we do
get 120 millimeter rear and top exhaust
moving on to the top we get triple 120mm
fan support your dual 140 s and the
strips cut out will allow more
flexibility for maneuvering your fans or
radiators at the top which we don't see
quite often unfortunately though we
don't
any dust filters for the top and while
it's most likely to be used for exhaust
as chassis is still not fully dust proof
until we get all sides covered
now speaking of dust filters though the
source 530 includes two large filters at
the bottom one for the power supply and
the other for the two optional fan
mounts and also the K stands on
rubberized feet for all the stability
and vibration free goodness
at the rear we get another flexible fan
mount eight PCI slots and water cooling
holes was the bottom mounted power
supply now the source 530 is a large
case with the identical internal
dimensions as the phantom 530 with a
slightly smaller footprint as it has
less exterior plastics and taking up the
thumbscrews I noticed small rubber
washers just extra noise preventative
measures and removing both side panels
the source 530 is has an identical
interior as the P 530 but without the
rubber grommets we still have the
angular fan bracket for additional
airflow for both 120 and 140 millimeter
fans and fully modular drive gauge
system so there's a lot of flexibility
depending on how you want your cabling
to look or just want to free up some
room for the front intake cages are
secured with thumb screws at the back
and still utilize those flimsy plastic
drive caddies and one very annoying
thing is the SSDs are mounted in the
middle but at the back of the bracket so
routing all your cables may be a bit
challenging removing the bottom cage
support you can utilize a 240 millimeter
radiator at the bottom as you can see
there's plenty of room without
compromising on your drive storage and
if you have a thicker radiator or want
to do push and pull removing the smaller
cage and still you're good to go also
with the standard 240 million radiator
at the bottom power supply compatibility
is limited to about 170 millimeters but
if you just want to utilize the bottom
slots for additional fan intake you do
get that extra bit of clearance the
radiator can also be installed at the
front but in this case you do lose out
on all of your drive storage long
graphics card support is not an issue at
all here with 12 inches of clearance and
11 inches with the angular fan bracket
populated and turning the case around
and
jxd has made sure to supply many chemo
timeouts which are all scattered around
and while it is a budget version of the
P 530 it's still unfortunate we don't
see any rubber grommets they have
however kept a tenth fan hub plus an SSD
bracket that is always important to see
there's also so much room at the rear
for all your cable work as you see
there's almost an inch and a half and
that's another reason why the source 530
is so appealing for enthusiasts on a
budget and starting with the assembly we
go through our usual routine with the
reference build and to no surprise the
case stacks up really well with clean
cable work and I always appreciate the
extra cutouts underneath the motherboard
and say your GPU doesn't allow clearance
for that fan on the bracket no problem
relocate the drive gauge the very bottom
and you can still utilize the fan at the
back thanks to the ample room for all
your cables I didn't even use any cable
tie mounts but as you can see it screams
for more and there's a huge potential
here when it comes to enthusiast systems
and I will conclude by saying that the
source 530 is an outstanding chassis
with a really practical and functional
internal layout I love the angular front
bracket
the brilliant drive cage system cable
management plus the amazing water
cooling options and the extra SSD
bracket and the fan hub are all features
you don't usually expect to find on such
a value case but of course corners had
to be cut to hit that amazing price tag
so only two fans are included we don't
have any rubber grommets there's no dust
filter for the top and the really poor
hinge system for the front dust filter
but that could just be our sample but
regardless all these flaws we're still
giving in the source 530 a damn good
value award it's for $90 it brings a
whole lot of functionality for the user
