back to another Haru Canucks review now
we've been very impressed with n series
from Coolermaster they're moving towards
compact and space-efficient cases so
we're going to take a look at the end
400 which sits perfectly in between the
higher end and 600 and a smaller sibling
the end 200 priced at $60 now the entire
end lineup have very similar and
distinctive features wood large meshed
front panel with all the connections
there as well which include four USB
ports
audio jacks and PR buttons the end 400
includes one three and a half inch drive
bay right below to optical base so
pretty standard for mid Tower the front
panel is removable that also houses a
built in dust filter bus notice the
connections are attached to the frame
which is preferable and non to the panel
we do have one fan included with
optional secondary mount right below for
dual intake pretty good stuff and since
the gauge is not facing the back like
what we've come to expect it allows
better air flow to actually penetrate
inside in the back we have an exhaust
fan seven PCI slots and then bottom
mounted power supply and my favorite
type of dust filter that sits underneath
the unit so I would need to unscrew my
power supply probably reduce my cable
job in order to access the filter well
this is just not acceptable the rear
side panel has a dual fan mount with an
internal dust filter now I would suggest
just mounting it on the outside of the
case for bare access when time comes to
clean it and we have the same setup
upstairs so dual fan mount with the
exact same filter but because the
mounting holes are slightly submerged
the filter cannot be installed outside
of the frame which is very unfortunate
and the left side panel also has a fan
mount which unfortunately is unfiltered
so let's take a look inside we have a
less convenient drive cage that faces
the internals with some mounting
brackets included for optical and 3.5
inch drives installing one drive in you
will definitely have to take into
account additional cables facing your
internals but we have 11 inches of
clearance until the drive of course
installing all your mechanical drives in
the bottom positions we
clear up more room for longer GPUs and
get rid of any cable clutter but also
allow less resistance on the airflow
they're also mounting holes for a single
SSD at the bottom now it's not the most
convenient spot but sure can be helpful
turn the case around this dual intake
fan space looks quite interesting for
one we have a toolless SSD bracket with
two slots now you all know this is long
overdue but I'm not liking what
Coolermaster has done here inserting one
SSD you can see the for supporting hinge
is bent so this isn't going to be
durable for multiple swaps and actually
when I inserted the second SSD one
plastic bit just snapped off and the
entire design of this SSD cage is just
poor you can see how much flexing is
going on so I'm really hoping
Coolermaster reconsiders this tooless
approach also you cannot insert it
facing the inside as it doesn't hold so
the only way to mount it is either
facing up or down on either of the fan
slots also Coolermaster praises the fact
that 240 millimeter radiers can fit and
I did my pass to try and fit a standard
dual rod both from the inside and
outside and there's just no room no
matter what orientation I was going for
plus where would the tubing go is the
hard drive cage is very close and would
not allow any clearance you are however
able to install 120 millimeter fans and
the side panel closes just fine with
room to spare but what coolermaster
managed to miss was any space at the top
and you can see it even missing an 8 pin
CPU cut out so you either have to route
that behind them on the board or through
it both of which are quite unpleasant
so we mounted our GTX 590 so you can see
the case has no problem with long GPUs
and flipping the case around clean cable
routing is possible but they sure don't
make it easy for one there are no cut
outs aside from the very bottom one so
you will have to route everything
through the dual intake opening but if
you're using that spot for fans then all
your cables will have to remain in the
main chamber the SSD cage fits in just
fine but that will only add to cable
clutter and luckily you can tuck the
cables away to close the side panel and
on the inside
looking pretty clean given you don't
install any side fans so you can route
your 24-pin cable also there's a very
little room at the top and I really wish
they would have made this a micro ATX
chassis which would add a little room at
the top because otherwise it's quite
useless so to sum things up the end 400
feels very unpolished even though it has
ATX and long GPU support with plenty of
mechanical storage and direct airflow
delivery for the internals because of
this rotated drive cage
however the cable management may become
challenging if you populate side fan
mounts which in reality would not be
able to fit at 240 millimeter radiator
the SSD brackets are poorly designed and
there's absolutely no room at the top so
say goodbye to top exhaust and lastly
the power supply dust filter is not
easily accessible the n400 honestly
feels out of place and come to think of
it it's not really needed the end 200 is
a well-designed micro ATX and the bigger
brother ends 600 isn't all around ATX
winner so I cannot think of a reason why
you wouldn't want to spend additional
$20 for the end 600 to get an all-around
better package so thanks guys for
