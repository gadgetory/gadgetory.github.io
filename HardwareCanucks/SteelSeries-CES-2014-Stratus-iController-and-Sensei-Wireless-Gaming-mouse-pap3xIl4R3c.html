brought to you by and say XCOM
technology connect alright so we're here
with steelseries and they're announcing
a couple of new and pretty badass
products and the first one that I have
right here in my hands is actually
pretty small and it packs a pretty
decent punch when it comes to iOS gaming
this is the Stratos it's available now
for pre-order on the website you can get
it in about a month's time from the
apple store as well too and it retails
for a hundred bucks now the biggest
thing is that it is the first moi or
made for iOS controller that you can
play your games like what we're playing
right here which is Grand Theft Auto and
inside the game it basically using the
ability that you can control or have up
to four controllers connected at one
time now aesthetically the controller is
actually quite pleasing it comes with a
little case that you can put on the
front or the back if you want to adjust
the size on the back so you'd have a
little more area to grip going to the
top of the control you get your standard
directional buttons couple of joysticks
your paws or menu as well as your X Y a
and B buttons on the side over here we
have the power switch with the connect
button down at the back as well as a
couple of triggers now from playing with
the device it actually is pretty
comfortable considering how small it is
there isn't much of a lag from what I'm
seeing at all when I'm playing the games
now there is a little bit of a reach to
get to the triggers but it's nothing
that's going to ruin the experience at
all whatsoever it does make your gaming
experience on any iOS device especially
if you have like an iPad Mini or an iPad
air it makes it a lot more enjoyable and
a lot more intuitive and comparison to
the options that are currently available
on the market also you can tell that
still series put a quite a bit of R&amp;amp;D
into this because it does have a good
form factor it does feel pretty good in
your hand
and going forward this might be your
go-to device for gaming so this right
here is the Stratos and like I said
before it's available for pre-order and
you can get a third it's just a hundred
dollars moving on to what else
steelseries have in stock for CES 2014
as you guys know steelseries produces a
lot of gaming peripherals one of them
one of the categories is mice so you can
tell by this design here that this is
very much to looking like a since a
mouse that's exactly what it is this is
this insane wireless and they're going
towards the wireless market with this
with this mouse first of all
aesthetically wise we have a rubberized
coating on the entire body we have these
glossy finishes on the outskirts and we
have rubberized bits on your both sides
on the left and the right so this is a
very symmetrical Mouse both can be used
for both left and right-handed users
have left and right click to scrub
browser buttons on each side like like
they are asymmetrical mouse and we have
a scroll wheel that's also illuminated
and we also have an LED still series
that is also eliminated the button in
the middle inside this sort of aluminum
casing no loom casing thus aluminum
little frame here is your CPI change so
you have the option for to CPI
adjustments unfortunately no other ones
so you can have a program for two
additional CPI's that you want so for
example you have you're playing with 800
CPI or DPI in game and you can jump it
to tank for a little bit faster so maybe
program the other one for 1200 or
something like that to give you that
extra edge that we perfect so coming to
the bottom as this is a wireless mouse
we have a few connectivity ports that
will show you exactly what they're for
later we have a release mechanism for
the wire that goes this is a micro USB
port inside there that will be attached
for charging and girls to be using this
of course as a wired mouse and here we
have the connect button that will
connect to the base platform and we also
have it on an off switch so if you're
constantly using this as a as a wireless
mouse preserve battery life you can just
turn it off inside there you can also
see an 80 200 DPI laser sensor
kind of very standard things to see from
the form a sense a mouse a few things to
note is the switches that are used here
in left and right clicks are steelseries
own switches and they do provide very
nice and tactile feedback they're quite
light so you don't have to particularly
use a lot of pressure to press them
which is nice the actual keys on the
left and rights which is the browser
buttons let's call them they have a bit
of a squishy feel which I do prefer so
they don't have a very hard stop they
kind of continue on even told they're
registered so that's actually a really
good thing if you don't want to disturb
your aim that because they can keep
traveling on and they absorb something
that more of that more motion which is
awesome to see now coming on to the base
this is a synthesis in wireless mouse as
you can see the base actually has an
illuminated sort of outline where the
mouse would be placed with you here you
can see the contacts that will be placed
with the mouse let's place the mouse
inside there this is an aluminum frame
which looks awesome and it will look
amazing on your desk we did talk to them
about me perhaps having the mouse and
stand up and to occupy less real estate
on your desk but this is the design they
went for and I do like them at the
bottom there's some there's a lot of
there's a large basically rubber bit so
that it doesn't move anywhere and also
the LED but now it's green so that means
that the mouse is fully charged the LED
here would also indicate whether or not
the mouse is half the battery life so
they'll be orange or it will flash red
when the battery life is low this is the
micro USB cable that oz also attaches to
the base platform so you can take it out
to plug it into the mouse like so and
the actual device lets me see how this
plugged in so the actual cable isn't as
a potential side and it's actually
clipped in so it won't pop out in case
you really pull hard on it and you do
have to sort of use this unlocking
mechanism in order to take the cable out
so this is the steelseries sensei
wireless this is going to be one hundred
and fifty nine dollars in good wireless
solution for those gamers that want both
that wireless and wired experience in a
very popular and very common sort of
form factor that become accustomed to
hear from steelseries now they're
releasing one more awesome product here
at CS
