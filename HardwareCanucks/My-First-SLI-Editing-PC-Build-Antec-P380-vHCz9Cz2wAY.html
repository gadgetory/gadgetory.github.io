great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with hardier
and axe and welcome to another case
review the antic p38 II is under the
spotlight receiving the full hardware
conducts treatment now this one is a
little bit more special because I was
excited about this particular enclosure
thinking this could be the return for an
tech in the competitive sphere just
because it looks so awesome and on paper
seems to be appropriate for a 2015
release on the exterior the p38 II
features beautiful aluminum top and
front panels that look fantastic
especially with the curved ends that
would satisfy any elegant space however
this is a two-piece design with I would
say too large of a gap between where the
aluminum meets plus I had to be really
careful handling any of the edges
because they were extremely sharp
hopefully antic can you find them as I
would actually consider them to be
hazard the IO is on the left side sort
of hidden between the top panel and the
bottom plastic bit with audio jacks four
USB ports
two of which are USB 3 and power and
reset buttons that are located on the
front behind the aluminum on both sides
which I appreciate for flexible case
orientation the aluminum front facade is
spaced out to allow fresh intake without
restriction which is great and I love
the appearance of such space but
removing the entire front panel is just
so inconvenient the requires removal of
six screws and I wonder why as the panel
sits already on pretty strong hinges the
2:140 motor fans here you see are
actually were installed at the top and
the p-38 e comes with no intake fans
which I find really odd for the price
but you could install triple 120mm fans
here at the front as well now the front
panel has the most ridiculous dust
filter in the history of dust filters as
it removes from the bottom of the case I
guess there's the incentive not to keep
the case on the floor or on some short
pedestal as the filter is actually
plenty long and requires a good enough
clearance
but even on the desk the case plus full
system inside makes it really heavy so I
need to push it all the way to the hinge
for filter removal is extremely
inconvenient and that clearly
understands the convenience of site
filter removal is that's exactly what
they've done for the power supply filter
but unfortunately not for the front at
the back it's a standard view with nine
PCI slots an exhaust mount for a 120mm
fan mount only which is included and I
love the totally solid top panel that
lets me put some items on top without
worrying about restriction on any of the
airflow the panel is spaced out and
ventilation is available on both sides
removing the panel is pretty simple but
the i/o cables are attached to it which
made it more difficult to remove once
the system is fully assembled and all
the wires are cleaned up but here again
we see triple 120 and dual 140
millimeter mounts I love the side panel
in this case nice square window and good
quality panels the solid one has
reinforcement plate that solidifies the
entire assembly and so I decided to put
my entire workstation system inside the
p-38 II because I absolutely love the
elegant character of this case but on
the inside there's really nothing
special we have 8 Drive caddies that our
SSD compatible and all three drive cages
are removable but first you need to take
out 33 screws that's 29 to many the
drive cage is restrictive and there are
no additional fan mounts in this face
which is surprising and I'm disappointed
that Antec ditched this awesome feature
that actually was found on the 1100
tower back 4 years ago moving on the
hard drive cage can support to 120
millimeter fans to provide additional
airflow for the internals now a really
neat mounting system is in place for
those fans using no screws but clips
that hold the fence dirty to the cage a
really convenient mounting method to
avoid any hassle during assembly yeah
that was my voice 4 years ago anyway it
looks like some things haven't changed
for the worse like the rubber grommets
on the side that are so far away from
the ATX motherboard I would like to see
better cable management accommodation
for common systems and not just tailor
for e-atx setups the same story below
the motherboard there are no cutouts to
help with simple cable management the
closest cutout is just too far away to
achieve a clean look coming around to
the back it's good news that it's easy
to secure all the cables and make sure
the panel closes without any hassle but
where our separate SSD brackets to show
that they're listening to what we want
to see from a modern case they have
added the fan hub but it's nowhere the
quality we should expect at this price
point plus its molex powered and no pwm
support and to make things worse each of
the fans comes with its own built-in low
or high setting but it is internal and I
don't want to open my case every time I
need to change the speed
this approach feels outdated and no
amount of aluminum will change that now
sure the end result looks awesome
especially with the panel on and the
ambient lighting that I've added inside
to highlight that hardware but you
cannot judge the case by the cover and
glad that I've put my full system inside
just to realize that the p-38 II is not
for me because of the difficult to
access front filter internal modularity
is poor and a molex fan hub just doesn't
make any sense
without proper fan speed control so it
looks like the search for a new
workstation case resumes this has been
the antic P 380 review I'm Dimitri with
