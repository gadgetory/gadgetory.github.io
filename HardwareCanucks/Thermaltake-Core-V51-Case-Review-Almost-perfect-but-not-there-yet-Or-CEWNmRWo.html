great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dimitri with her
onyx and there comes a time when they
get super excited about the potentially
awesome chassis you know based on
specifications and first impressions to
only have my disappointment levels kick
in by a pile of small overlooked details
that really take away from this very
promising and an almost perfect chassis
and with that foreshadowing intro out of
the way let's take a look at the thermal
tech V 51 priced at $120 and this price
range is a bit risky considering the new
standard fantex set with the m2 Pro at
just 89 bucks so first taking the
exterior tour I really love what thermal
tech has done with a full mesh front
panel that has a built in dust filter
and both top and bottom rounded edges
that add a bit of character the chassis
stands on tall and long feet and while
thermal day classifies this as a mid
tower this is a full tower in our books
given the wide and tall form there are
two optical base at the front with the
i/o panel right above with audio jacks
only a pair of USB 3 ports in the market
where at least four USB ports is a
standard and PR buttons with an
illuminated ring around the power button
I love the gigantic side panel window
that hides nothing and super revealing
that can be extremely rewarding to
showcase a sexy system and your hard
work for cable management and it should
also act as an incentive to clean things
up only problem here is how easy it is
to scratch it now these marks you see
here are from me running my nail gently
across the corner so you gotta be extra
careful to maintain this in pristine
condition and this should also be a
wake-up call for all case manufacturers
not just Thermaltake as this is not the
first time we've seen this happen and
zxd so coming to the top this is how you
handle fan support huge thumbs up for
large magnetic dust filters spanning the
roof and check this out this massive
array of flexible options so we got
triple 120s triple 140s and dual 200 mil
more fans and they realize the benefits
of these mounting strips to eliminate
any compatibility issues with top
mounted radiators and coming to the back
and get a set of water cooler
host a PCI slots a little hook to secure
your peripherals to the case that's held
in with a thumb screw from the inside
and the 120mm exhaust fan there are also
two bottom dust filters covering the
entire floor with the power supply dust
water easy removal from the back auto
side removal would be more convenient
plus the second dust filter is removable
from the front auto requiring you to
take off the front panel first and again
side thus total removal should become
the standard and with the front panel
removed we can take a look at our intake
options so two 120mm fans are included
with support for triple 120 s and 140 s
as well and I'm so happy to see thermal
take you know continue with these
mounting strips plus a very open frame
design for maximum airflow and to
continue with the praise the side panels
swivel to open so they are extremely
easy to remove no need to align any
clips just gently insert in the front
and close like a car door this is for
both side panels as well and thumb
screws stay with the panel and so far
the V 51 has many details worked out for
airflow dust filtration and
accessibility but how are the internals
so let's get inside the hard drive cage
design is interesting it is elevated and
does not make contact with the floor I
think this is brilliant
to avoid any extra parts like a cage
base if you want to reposition any of
the two other cages of course they are
modular secured with thumb screws at the
back and on the side and you can install
either of the cages higher for extra
clearance at the bottom as the V 51
supports a 240 radiator on the floor
furthermore the optical cages are
individually removable for example take
away the top one for additional
clearance for a longer 360 ml radiator
or a thicker set up with push-pull while
still have one optical Bay in place you
could also remove the bottom one install
this five the quarter inch fan bracket
and you now have clearance for an
additional fan at the front allowing
compatibility for 360 and even for
twenty millimeter radiators now there
are a total of five drive caddies with
side SSD mount to avoid flexing the
plastic these small clips pop out and
insert back in once the
Eco Drive is in place and I like the
system because of these clips though
inside SSD mount one must be removed to
accommodate for the smaller Drive and
this is why I always prefer centered SSD
mount and other annoyance here I noticed
was with wiring connecting a power SATA
is fine is it's a straight power SATA
along with a straight SATA data cable
but because of the frame and how far
back the drive is you can't even fit a
90-degree SATA cable for your drive so
how did this pass the design stage only
way I found this to work if you attach
the cable first and then push the drive
caddy in but that doesn't really look
healthy for the cable and also if you
remove all the drive cages for water
cooling not all is lost as we have two
extra spots for the drives they simply
pop in place we have supported clips but
it seems Thermaltake is a little bit
challenged in the cable running
department is there is very little room
for the bottom drive caddy to pass any
cables and speaking of cable management
it is almost non-existent in the Vee 51
there are only a few cable tie points
right beside the main rubber grommets
but that's it
so there's no way to clean up anything
below the motherboard cut out nor at the
back where the eight pin CPU cable is
traveling so this is totally not
acceptable and this alone stains the
entire process that up to this point has
been fairly seamless it's a good thing
though the side panels closed like this
to avoid any further difficulties having
said that though the internals look
absolutely stunning and I made sure to
clean things up for that window showcase
there is an appropriate cutout for a
micro ATX motherboard to pass front IO
cables and such an open interior well
for sure welcome enthusiast systems as
well there is an oversized cut out up
top routing fans the 8 pin and other
miscellaneous cables that for sure came
in handy during our build and so in
conclusion it is clear that thermo tech
is eager to truly compete within this
100 $20 price bracket and the V 51 is a
total winner on many
fronts like airflow and water cooling
and dust filtration and internal
modularity but when the basics are
ignored like simple cable type points or
restrictive frame for wiring your drives
or easily scratch up a window I think
it's time to make a priority list and
make sure that no details are missed as
otherwise the VIP 51 paves the way for
thermaltake to release a killer case and
they're definitely on the right track
and so this concludes this review we
