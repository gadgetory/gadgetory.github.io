fantex schoolmaster and MSI what's up
guys ever hear with hurricane axon we
are here at the Silverstone both at
Computex I found something really
interesting here at the booth and it's
this the are we 0-4 it's a prototype
case but what's really interesting is
that Silverstone is approaching the
micro STX
platform so concise comparison I have
the RV zo3 with a GTX 970 but
surprisingly this guy rocks the same GPU
so now taking a look at the inside of
the RV zo4 from Silverstone to prototype
case by the way it has this a micro SD X
motherboard from asrock as you can see
it has a desktop class socket which
basically means that you can upgrade the
CPU down the line and surprisingly you
can also fit in not to a cooler the NHL
9i I remember which might seem like a
really good fit for this board in the
case itself there's also an MX trim MXM
3.0 interface so you can have the gtx
760 it's in 70 at 1080 silverstone is
still working on the cooler but they're
going to design a cooler for the 1080
later down the road when this becomes
available in full production model it
has also got two sodium's slots i think
the maximum air support is up to 32
gigabytes so really it is a fully blown
out desktop class system but you're
getting it in a micro SD X form factor
so storage wise we're looking at three
MDOT two drives that support the PCIe
standard we also have a 4-pin RGB header
right up top and then there's an
external power solution provided by
silverstone which is a 220 watt power
brick so why is this foam factor
important because quite honestly I'm
taking a look at a lot of contact PCs
and it's really hard to you know
understand the concept behind it but
it's pretty straightforward
the components are barely limited no one
can actually go out and build themselves
a micro SD F system and the reason I say
that is because the micro SD s
motherboard is an OEM available option
the MX and 3.0 interface is also OEM so
it's really hard to find these parts on
sale so that's why silverstone has
designed the rb0 4 to house the micro SD
s case because quite frankly these parts
are not that available in the market but
most importantly
this is an answer our board so they're
pushing towards they're working with
asrock to make this more visible so
users can go out and pick their own
parts and you know build a pretty cool
system
pretty cool micro SDXC stem that can fit
their style so main bottleneck in
approaching this as a DIY solution is
that you can't find em eccentric pointed
cards that easily that means you can
walk into a store and purchase and
invidia em eccentric poetry to you
because you can't buy one so that's why
silverstone is working with as rocks to
generate this exposure so you as an
audience can give them feedback and
perhaps push Invidia into providing
retail units of these MXM 3.0 cards so
guys let us know your thoughts about the
wave and for it's a port type case and
like I said silverstone is really
pushing this they really want to get
some exposure with this type of form
factor so leave your feedback feedback
in the comments down below i'm eber with
hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching i will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
