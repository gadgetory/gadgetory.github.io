great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with hairy
Canucks and there comes a time when you
need something different something fresh
but also acting as a reasonable and
functional that's very important upgrade
do I say this because I'm in the process
of upgrading my current workstation PC
that I used to edit all of our hard
knocks videos that is also acting as my
test bench as well and used to run
everything that you see behind me so the
list of upgrades is not very long main
one being is the transitioning of all of
my hardware and drives from one of my
favorite cases the NZXT aged 440 I've
got the white one here ever since
release into a white fantex
and deluxe aesthetically though I still
prefer the aged 440 over the my current
upgrade as it is the best minimalist
design on the market right now and I'm
not making the switch because I'm
unhappy with my current case selection
but the n2 locks gives me a little bit
extra flexibility one of those
flexibilities is extra storage capacity
a total of 6 Drive caddies that I can
put in there plus one more inside the
optical Bay and 2 SSD brackets on the
back while the age of 40 has one less
drive caddy for a total of five and
while it's not a big difference I still
need to add more storage to my
workstation with our recent switch to 4k
plus the slightly roomier interior on
the locks the better lighting
integration and hopefully better cooling
results are all reasons for this upgrade
I've also got two extra 140 millimeter
fan Tech's fans to go inside the machine
and really super excited for these
awesome lighting strips in there as well
I will be replacing my overkill 1000
watt power supply for something more
efficient with less total wattage the
corsair ax 760i
to be specific and our friends at cable
mod hooked us up with the latest black
and white cable set so we pimp out this
workstation build right but let's see if
it's all worth it
all right so the first thing I wanted to
point out is how awesome the a true
forty stacked up against heavy dust
I kept the tower on the floor and look
at just how much those dust filters
picked up both on the front on the side
and at bottom and despite the smaller
interior everything fits it nicely and I
gotta say I will miss the aged 440 but
I've got other plans to recycle this
gorgeous Tower but it was time to
disassemble so I can get this upgrade
started first came out all of my drives
out of this terrible cable mess and that
is one huge disadvantage of the age of
40 the back clearance is very limiting
unplug the corresponding SATA cables
from the motherboard and all my five
populated trays are free to explore a
new home next my gtx 980 has to take a
break and all the cables must be
unplugged from the motherboard i unscrew
the top cooler first this is the NZXT
x61 with a 280 mm in radiator followed
by freeing the motherboard and the aged
440 looks extremely lonely but it's time
for all this hardware to find a new home
and the enthu luxe and why it was the
perfect choice that still carries that
metallic white exterior just like on the
aged 440 I love the swivel side panels
that open like car doors on deluxe and
the internal power supply bracket that
will make my job easier for cable
management first I removed all the drive
caddies and installed my 9 terabytes of
total storage spread through for three
and a half inch drives I'm almost at
full capacity on those and might
actually need to replace my low capacity
one terabyte drive for another 4
terabyte drive then I quickly installed
my dual 256 gigabyte Samsung 850 pros on
to SSD brackets and it was time for all
the storage to go to their respective
places inside the lock
I love the SSD placement in particular
inside the case this is an awesome
utilization of the space next I remove
the power supply cover to install our
760 watt unit plus let's don't forget
the rear i/o shield and finally it was
time to lower in the motherboard and get
that secured lastly I installed the
second row of 140 millimeter fans on top
for push-pull with the all-in-one cooler
and here comes the fun part all the
cable management I say fun because the
interior is designed to handle water
cooling no problem and thus is
significantly larger than my previous
case selection and this makes cable
Ronnie and total breeze plus I am using
the black white kit from cable mod and
thanks to the entirely modular power
supply I can minimize the total cable
clutter so I could leave the power
supply cover out because all the exiting
cables are nice and tidy
I even bundled up the long 6 pin PCI
Express cables to keep order and check
this out the build is ready and I could
not be happier with how this turned out
I did place the power supply cover back
on to hide the red on the power supply
and while it's not the totally color
match to the white theme build the blue
accents on the motherboard give this
build a little bit extra character and I
am planning on switching towards the x99
platform sometime in the future so leave
your hardware suggestions below to
compliment a future upgrade the optional
lighting strips from fantex turned out
quite useful as they are adhesive and
connect to one of the lighting cables
that's already built into the case and
I'll show you what they look like in
just a moment but first check out that
cable management remember I am utilizing
all of my drive slots so it's not the
most tidy thing ever
but most importantly look at how flat
all the cables are to the back panel and
I had no issues connecting both SSDs as
I thought that the distance might be too
large between them for a standard motif
Kable and he or she is fully lit and
operational luckily no funky noises upon
first boot means I did everything right
and my only gripe with this entire build
is the adhesive on the lighting strip
that isn't very strong in some sections
but that would be out of the view with
the window on it's definitely worth the
extra ambience the internal lighting
adds especially with the tinted window
look looks fantastic and one of the main
reasons why I added the optional
lighting strips is the multicolored
support on the locks with the press of
button I can cycle through this range of
options to suit your mood or color coded
build plus the soft built in strips
running on each side at the front and
above makes the chassis really stand out
from the rest of the offerings but that
is pretty much it for my workstation
