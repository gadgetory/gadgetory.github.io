great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is dimitri with
Hurok knucks and I always say it's
exciting when companies branch out into
different categories and I'm
particularly excited for the direction
Kingston took with their HyperX line to
create a properly tuned and designed
gaming headset so this is the HyperX
cloud priced very competitively at just
over $100 and I am eager to see how
serious Kingston is with developing
their peripheral line so I guess this
would be a great place to start
now cupid was also part of the design
process which is great to see such
collaborations as you get the expertise
from a dedicated gaming gear brand now
we don't usually show the way product to
package but I really had to get this on
camera as everything is well padded
inside the box and for the price I'm
very happy with the presentation as part
of the accessories we get a non braided
3 meter extension an airplane adapter a
Y connector to be used with mobile
devices and an inline control hub with
volume wheel and my Butte also the large
button can be used to answer phone calls
and stop and play tracks but that means
having to use the headphone splitter
cable on your mobile device plus the hub
which is just way too much cabling for
on-the-go
plus it's totally out of reach and it
definitely needs to be closer to the
headset itself and not so far down the
cord an additional set of velour ear
cups is included which is awesome plus
we get a small carrying pouch with a
small pocket for your additional
accessories and of course the headset
itself now design wise this always
imitates biodynamic headphones with
solid metal frame and cables passing
from the top of each ear cup I don't
think it should cause any concerns with
longevity as the cable is braided so
just be mindful of it this does give the
HyperX cloud the somewhat industrial but
modern appeal with brushed aluminum
plates on each side along with a
rubberized plastic frame and a pretty
cool leather headband with red thread
for complementing accents and that
pretty awesome embedded hyper
logo I think Kingston has definitely
made the right decision with the name is
it only 350 grams you're looking at the
very light headset combine this with
thick ear cushions and you have the
perfect recipe for non-stop gaming the
headset feels really solid despite its
light weight and is extremely flexible
and of course a size adjustable the air
cups are oval and putting them on I was
very impressed with the fit and the
overall comfort the HyperX cloud isn't
too bulky and given we have a removable
microphone you could actually use this
for your mobile headphone needs noise
isolation with the leather cushions is
pretty great and the clamping force is
just like to have the right fit without
causing pressure fatigue and that could
easily wear these for hours on end so
the microphone is flexible and has a
wind foam to prevent from air bursts and
the microphone quality is OK for a
gaming headset of course we can't expect
miracles in this price bracket also
impressive is the sound quality they've
gone ahead with 53 millimeter drivers at
60 ohms impedance when powered through
my Asus DX sound card I was plenty
satisfied with the amount of detail you
can hear in the battlefield environment
during loud explosions events there was
no distortion in the bass section and
you can still make out the mid-range
detail so those wanting that proper bass
response for gaming would be absolutely
pleased with the HyperX cloud sound
stage took me also by surprise if it is
very similar to my HD 5 5 eighths that
are open style and the HyperX cloud are
capable of this wide immersion they're
not as Airy but I found the combination
of excellent mid-range detail and
exposed soundstage to be very fitting
for great positional awareness also
having that detachable microphone makes
this an appealing all-around headphone
and through my music test I was very
pleased with the sonic signature of the
drivers that are well controlled clean
and flat based response and angel and
also any bass heavy tracks that I played
like bang bang and no church in the wild
sounded wonderful for the price and
being gaming oriented particularly the
drivers are outstanding mid-range is
just slightly reserved vocals and time
I heard behind the guitar that simulates
a larger audio setting so doing a little
EQ to bring those vocals upfront is more
fitting I think for music playback the
treble on the HyperX cloud is not harsh
yet revealing with predominant high hats
and back to black and the sky full of
stars with absolutely no ringing ears
after several hours of listening I do
like the brighter sound personally and
high-end on the HyperX loud delivered
with high energy and fun response that I
seriously who is not expecting from a
company like Kingston now what we have
here is an extremely promising future
roadmap for their HyperX line of
peripherals I mean if they continue in
this direction I really can't wait to
see what they have in development as the
HyperX cloud starts off with the right
first impressions from the very
beginning with packaging - accessories -
outstanding build quality yet
lightweight and very comfortable and
also pretty stylish as well we also have
the removed microphone which is a huge
bonus and finally the 53 millimeter
drivers are seriously impressive with
properly tuned response for in-game
detail and the very impressive
soundstage and you can also use this as
a standalone headphone as well all this
for just $100 and I could see this being
the gaming headset of 2014 my only gripe
would be the microphone it is revealing
of the background and I wish it was more
noise cancelling but otherwise you're
looking at the damn good and a damn good
value gaming headset and if you're on
the market for one would definitely
suggest you pick one up well that is it
