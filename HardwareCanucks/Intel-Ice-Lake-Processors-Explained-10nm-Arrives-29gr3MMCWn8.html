a few weeks ago Intel actually invited
us over at their offices in California
to check out some upcoming processors 10
gen processors code-named ice lake now I
do want to be fully clear here ice Lake
is only officially rolling out into
lower powered notebooks and not be
higher desktop platforms so we're just
going to wait and see when the
architecture fully goes into that
platform but for now it's just tension
on lower powered notebooks and you'll
only be able to see them available in
October or November of this year so
without any further ado let's talk about
ice Lake but first a quick message from
our sponsor the newbie quiet dark rock
slim cooler offers high physical
clearance for any memory module thanks
to its slim heatsink and the low profile
120 mil airflow optimized fan so you get
great cooling low noise easy
installation and no issues for high
profile RAM check it out the low okay so
let's quickly talk about what exactly
ice Lake is because if you look at the
whole current state of Intel's processor
line up especially on a notebook side it
gets a bit confusing because we're only
starting to see companies roll out
whiskey Lake into the ultrabooks and
it's still gonna stay here for a really
long time and so Intel is gonna have a
tough time rolling out these new ice
Lake processors in 2019 so yeah I guess
it's just gonna cause a lot of confusion
among consumers but we're just gonna
have to wait and see how this all plays
out for the rest of 2019 anyway so for
the time being ice Lake will only be
replacing whiskey Lake CPUs in tenon
like notebooks from a technical
standpoint with Killick architecture
used the agent core design but Intel
still managed to increase frequencies by
a huge amount without sacrificing
battery life on the high performance
gaming notebook side there's coffee lake
which uses Intel's 9 generation but
that's not a space isolate we'll play
quite yet isolate is super important
because this is actually in tellest
architecture shift in the last five
years that's mostly because they're
finally able to shift away from the 14
nanometer manufacturing process and to a
10 nanometer node plus many of the
features and technologies will be
cascaded down into upcoming CPUs for
years to come without getting too far
into the technical details every single
part of isolate CPUs are new in some way
the Sun eco CPU cores are much more
advanced than anything skylake
derivatives offered
internal bandwidth and cache sizes have
been overhaul too so the processor can
chew through tasks a lot more faster
meanwhile the memory controller gets a
new phase to with support for up to 64
gigabytes of ddr4 3200 speeds or 32
gigabytes of LP for at 37 33 megahertz
which is crazy
in terms of specs this is all we really
know right now there will be a u and y
Series models with up to four cores and
eight threads so essentially a carbon
copy of a whiskey like set up much like
whisky Lake the TDP of these is
configurable but instead of ranging
between 10 watts to 25 watts the span
will now between 9 watts and 28 watts
with the most popular design likely
hitting the 15 watt mark l3 cache still
remains at 8 megabytes but secondary
caches are much larger and faster so
don't take this number as a lack of
improvement honestly the most
interesting spec here is probably the
clock speeds ice lakes max turbo
frequency hits up to 4 point 1 gigahertz
which is much lower than the 4.8 Gertz
achieved by the ieee 78665 you I'm
guessing that intel expects their
architecture improvements to make up for
the lower clock speeds but this will be
interesting to see
finally the graphics configuration is a
bit of a question mark right now
obviously there's the new gen 11
architecture which we'll dive deeper
into a separate video and Intel's Irish
name will come back with configurations
up to 64 execution units that's a huge
jump from the current maximum of 24 on
whiskey Lake and even more than the 48
offered on older iris plus GPUs the fact
that this kind of graphics power is
being added to lower powered notebook
CPUs is pretty impressive
but we don't know how gentlemen GPU
specs will play out across IP ice Lake
range so don't assume those 64 core
designs will hit lower price systems
Intel is also trying to push Thunderbolt
3 which is understandable since it's
their own technology plus the USB 3
ecosystem is becoming extremely
confusing and fractured lately with the
new ridiculous USB 3.2 rebranding to try
and simplify Thunderbolt is being added
to next-gen notebooks and they built a
four port Thunderbolt controller
directly into the isolate core rather
than being in a separate chip but will
that mean that more notebooks will be
built with exclusively tenable 3
compatible type-c ports
not really since it's up to
manufacturers to implement it properly
into their designs and we all know how
they love saving money by skimping on IO
ports but what does this all mean for
performance
well Intel really didn't show off much
in that respect and they didn't even
explain the final specs of their isolate
processor family which is sort of odd
before we even get into the charts let's
talk about the testing config Intel use
every single CPU is Intel's legacy
configurations that uses a 15 watt TDP
which in this case of cable a car and
this whiskey Lake example means a quad
core a thread part using 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 at 2400 megahertz in a dual channel
config there's nothing really to
complain about there the isolate config
ones pretty identical with 15 watts
eight threads and 16 gigs of memory but
that's been clocked at 37 33 megahertz
that might sound like a huge issue for
comparisons but this is lpddr4 which
means a reduced overall bandwidth but
the 13 30 megahertz speed Delta between
this and whiskey Lake could still throw
off the results by a bit alright so on
to a few charts we have this result
shows that from an instructions per
clock or IPC standpoint ice Lake will
deliver on an average of 80 percent
higher rates than skylake cores we see
that spec 2016 and 2017 cysmart web x
PRT and Cinebench were used but
absolutely nothing allows us to align
specific results or tests with the graph
it's also important to remember that
higher instructions per clock doesn't
necessarily translate into direct
corresponding boosts in key applications
this next chart shows that well here we
have single thread performance in a
simpler integer calculation across 15
watt CPUs it looks like the I select CPU
achieves between 5 to 6% better
performance but the result isn't as
clear as it first looks since Intel
clearly stated ice Lake will run at
lower speeds than whiskey Lake we could
be seeing a higher clock agent CPU
battling it out a technically lower
powered or lower speed 10 gen processor
since Intel clearly stated ice Lake will
run at lower speeds than whiskey Lake we
could be seeing a higher clock agency PU
battling it out a technically lower
speed tangent processor if that's the
case this result is pretty impressive
even
with a higher speed memory taken into
account however if both CPUs are hitting
the same frequency ice lake may end up
being a small incremental improvement
rather than a leap forward now this
chart again shows two 15-watt configs
but with an iris pro integrated part
alongside a previous gen UHD 620
graphics on one hand it's great to hear
that Intel will be rolling out MX 150
level graphics into their lower voltage
processors but we have several
unanswered questions about this
particular iris pro layout and the
number of execution units it uses the
last thing that I want to touch base on
is Intel's push towards Wi-Fi 6k plus
because while it's isn't new I don't
think it's a big selling feature yet
remember Wi-Fi 6 has been around since
whiskey lake but the number of
compatible devices is minimal due to
costs involved Intel is trying to fix
that issue with a newer module design
which should simplify a router and PC
designs but they're also adding the gig
plus specification which is yet another
speed increase the limiting factor of
gig plus is that it speeds reached well
about a thousand megabits per second
which is literally the limit of most
people's in how wide networks this is
very much geared towards enterprises
that might be running 10g
infrastructure's but in the future it
may apply to home users as well so there
you guys have it yet more processors
from Intel and it looks like it's a
pretty big step forward especially since
they're moving away from the 14 animated
manufacturing process to a 10 nanometer
process you've also got the new
architecture based off the sunny Cove
cores as well as Jenna lemon graphics
and much more so let me know what you
guys think are you excited for these new
processors let me know in the comments
