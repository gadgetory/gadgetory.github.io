hardware Connexus we check out Andy's
new 6000 series very excited to be here
with the 68 70 and 68 50 cards make sure
you stick around I'm sure you won't be
disappointed
now I think most people would agree a.m.
dat I had a pretty good thing going with
their 5000 series even by today's
standards the performance is pretty good
and as far as the architectural changes
it's still completely relevant in fact
as far as that goes there aren't really
too many alternatives so instead of just
wasting all of that time and all of that
research AMD is said look we already
have really good cards how do we make
them even better but their idea went
past just a simple product refresh AMD
is introducing a whole new top-end line
that makes some drastic improvements in
fact there's so many improvements that
they felt it was necessary to make a
whole new product line with a new name
so we have the AMD Radeon 6000 series
AMD has made changes in four key areas
first performance secondary power
consumption third we have brand new
features and probably most importantly
price stuff to look at for the series
better performance with enhanced
tessellation ami claims it will be
double that of the 5000 series pretty
bold it's also going to improve on image
quality features so you get a little
better handling of the eye candy in your
games there's also been a renewed focus
on parallel processing to help offload
CPU tasks we have new multimedia
features things such as HDMI 1.4 a our
standard better Eyefinity options and
AMD is jumping on the bandwagon
introducing its very own 3d technology
that is just a general overview about
what has changed in the 6000 series now
let's get on to the actual cards we have
both these 68 70 and 68 50 here you can
click on the annotation links on those
cards to check out the unboxings get a
little more in-depth look at them
otherwise we're just going to take a
look at the reference specs for these
cards as you'll see the cards don't
exactly crossover with their numerical
predecessors AMD actually compares the
6870 specs with that of their previous
generation 5850 as
that's its closest competition in fact
for the 6000 series AMD is restructuring
its entire market position what we have
is two cards coming in at a mid-level
range and from there AMD is looking to
fill out the top-end hopefully within
the next few months but that's enough
about that let's get to the real meat of
the review and see how well these cards
perform and that wraps up our look at
AMD 6000 series really you got to give
credit where credit's due guys the 68 70
and 60 850 hit it out of the park for
mid-range cards they come in at under
$250 and under $190 which as we saw with
the GTX 460 a little earlier is pretty
much the sweet spot for you know what
people are willing to pay for this level
of performance what you're getting is a
lot of improvements on the 5000 series
in areas people maybe felt we're lacking
you have the improvements to parallel
processing image quality enhancements
multimedia functions all in all it's a
pretty damn good card thanks for
checking out our coverage of the 68 70
and 68 50 Kurt's make sure you check
back as we will do more reviews on the
rest of ATI AMD's lineup as it comes out
and don't forget head over to triple W
Hardware canucks comm we have the full
written review there with even more
benchmarks opinion analysis all that
sort of fun stuff we'll see you next
time
