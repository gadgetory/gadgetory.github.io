in a single case two systems in a single
case that's right so today we're finally
building my dual system inside the vault
X I'm not gonna lie but I will miss the
super compact and elegant nature of what
I've been using so far the streak I'm
tattoo make sure to check out that video
right over here but in my space it fits
perfectly well and I think it's time to
upgrade the case to a mid Tower just for
fun alright so here's the situation
currently my 9900 K system with the RT X
xx atti
are inside the Cylon base 601 and my
intent here is to keep all the same
hardware and cooling even the fans and
just transfer them over into the evolve
X and then I want to take all my ITX
hardware with 8600 K in the Technic
speed this is what I've been using to
render videos and put it as a second
system inside the evolve X because this
has a ITX slot above your main ATX
motherboard area is gonna go up up there
and I'm hoping I will not encounter any
compatibility issues with the coolers
because I intend to keep the giant
knocked or cooler so I do have a few
concerns about this whole dual system
configuration 1 are the temperatures I'm
gonna have a lot of hardware in there
that's running hot the GPUs is the Titan
XP and the RT X xx atti based on my
review the GPU temperatures are really
hot so I'm just curious if I'll just
have to keep the the side panel open and
number 2 is actually using the dual
system configuration for my workflow now
the thing is I've never done a dual
system configuration in the past and I'm
having a hard time figuring out on how
to utilize it so if you have any
suggestions on what I could do with the
second system please let me know or any
helpful feedback that I could
potentially take for the next part of
this project that would be appreciated
and of course the thing I'm most excited
about is actually utilizing this really
powerful hardware for video production
you know I've been on this 6 course 6
thread part and I'm really powerful GPU
but we're moving to the 9900 K and the
r-tx 2080 TI for video production I'm
hoping that would be a nice little
upgrade
now the reason why I've been delaying
this project for a while now is because
I've been waiting for this the revolt X
power supply from fantex
this thing can power two systems so you
don't need a power splitter you don't
need any additional accessories
everything is sort of built in here
because has dual 24 pin dual eight pin
it's also a t + platinum efficiency
which is awesome and it's 1200 watts so
plenty of juice there for the 99 hundred
K the eight is 600 K and those dual GPUs
and I think I'll have six SSDs and is
always nerve-racking doing a complete
rebuild of my main production machine
because usually you know I have that as
like station everything that's always
running and I'm working with other
hardware and what I've been told so far
is that at least one of the system has
to use an all-in-one cooler or some form
of water cooling or a really low profile
air cooler but here I'm sticking with 80
600 K so need something you know that
has nice cooling capacity for that chip
and power outage good thing I have these
I go through the disassembly procedure
on every single case video that we do
and you know with the sound bass 601
that was a pretty simple operation with
this big ATX enclosure however with this
unique to where everything is attached
to be eclipsed and I have to disassemble
it that is what I'm not looking forward
hey the powers back let's resume the
assembly so my first order of business
is trying to figure out how cable
management would work for both systems
and more importantly figure out the
compatibility for the height of the CPU
cooler or the pump for the ITX
motherboard all right one two and three
no luck
now obviously I expect the hiccups but
given my current situation I might have
to rethink some things and so as I
expected this pump is just a little bit
too tall to pass the clearance for you
know this massive Noctua cooler of
course they've had an old one cooler for
this ATX motherboard I would have no
issues with the top room but I'll
substitute it for the low profile be
quiet silent loop 360 it is a 360 rad
that I was planning to put in the front
anyway so this kind of works out well
okay so the ITX mount is installed onto
the top fan bracket and you have to
insert it from the bottom not from the
top which is unfortunate this would be
much easier installation if you could
just insert the ITX motherboard from the
top but that's not possible the power
button for the i/o is right over here
and the i/o slightly pushed back so
there's a little bit of spacing in
between the frame and the i/o not really
a big issue and as you can see there is
a little bit of clearance between the
motherboard backplate and the frame
which means that if you have any nvme
SSDs or like MDOT two mounts behind the
motherboard tray this is fine however as
you can see the fan bracket doesn't
really allow access for the cooler so
like I have to remove the motherboard in
order to install any cooling the
clearance here is very tight so I'm
thinking I have to put this in rout all
the cables and install the cooler and
then mount my ATX motherboard because
otherwise it will be a pretty big
challenge and so this is where I am
right now
there were no issues mounting the pump
but the tubing it's not exactly low
profile so I cannot rotate the pump for
the tubes to exit on that side because
it just interferes with the CPU tower so
I had to remove the middle fan on the
cooler in order to have the tubes kind
of like pass through here a little bit
bend
/ and then just kind of manure the back
so this way it gives me enough length
for the tube so I can mount the radio to
the front of the frame but of course
another option is to go with a different
all-in-one cooler so this corsair h 150
i and it has a low-profile pump and
tubes that also exit from the side
therefore not interfering with my cpu
tower heatsink but then I'm thinking if
I have a 360 right at the front it will
warm up and block a lot of the airflow
that's coming for the main ATX system
which is what I'm more concerned about
and also I don't want to lose the middle
fan on the main knocked or cooler so
instead of going the 360 route I'm
decided to go the other route of still
having three fans at the front but for
the ITX system going with a really low
profile CPU tower so this entire duel
system configuration will be air-cooled
and I'm hoping that's not the big
compromise for the 80 600 K it'll still
have a nice powerful GPU but I might
have to down clog the 4.8 overclocked to
something a little bit more than you
know compatible with this little guy now
I know this looks a bit unconventional
I'm not worried about this configuration
temperatures on this car they're fine
this cooler is pretty capable I am
worried about temperatures on the 80 600
K but the compromise there is the ease
of assembly and cable management so when
I populate this in I can rather there's
no problem and then when I put this back
in you know it's not going to interfere
with anything that's above it which is
which is a positive but of course I
think I'll get hotter temperatures on
this little guy so let's populate the
rest of the fans and the rest of the
hardware and hopefully our temperatures
are not complete
so this revolt X power supply is pretty
interesting because for one for a 1200
watt unit it's pretty compact lovely
aluminum based over here and for your
connections we have a pretty interesting
row over here for system 1 and system 2
I mean it's pretty good for just closing
these rear panels I could make it better
but I am more interested to see if this
thing actually boots
okay well look what we have here is
basically booted on the first try I had
to just readjust one of the 24 pin
connectors on the power supply because
the second system was not booting but
after a little troubleshooting right now
about that five on my main 9900 KRT X 20
and GI system and just changing the
input here we're gonna go back to the
ITX system and we've got youtube full
audio everything is working fine not bad
at all the next thing to do would be
color coordination so it's not an ugly
piece of you know there's so much
horsepower in it and I want to showcase
that a little bit and I know it's a bit
difficult doing any color coordination
with the Brown fans but going orange is
always an option however my Jedi Order
Titan XP is not RGB so that's green so
I'm gonna try and explore my options
over here but yeah should be fun all
right good people so have you worked in
the evolve X for the second time now and
configuring my dual assistant build I
can say that you know if you're going
that route be prepared to pay the extra
for those accessories like the ITX
motherboard mount the riser cable that's
necessary if you're mounting a GPU for
that ITX system above it and also the
power supply because this one has no
dual power supply mounts so you have to
go with the revolt X or some other power
supply and buying the power supply
splitter from fantex
so that whole approach definitely
requires many many add-ons on top of
that pun intended the entire clearance
above the ATX motherboard is I think a
little bit too tight right now it's cool
because you cannot tell there's a second
system installed but with it comes a
really difficult assembly process
because for me to access that ITX
motherboard now would mean I have to
remove that entire ATX portion because
the installation of the motherboard is
from the bottom and not from the top of
course the heat will get trapped in that
corner so definitely again targeted to
water cooling getting the heat away via
tubes to your radiators and in terms of
my temperatures I haven't done full
extensive testing the ATX system is
perfectly fine the GPU is fine as well
but having to close the side panels yet
and I'm afraid that the top system with
that time
a cooler for the 8600 Kade will get
toasty because at idle it is running
around 50 degrees Celsius and so that is
an issue and I'll definitely have to
lower my overclock now a very
interesting visual observation you can
see because of the upside-down
motherboard is the RAM here I have
installed team groups nighthawk memory
in white which looks pretty cool
beautiful RGB illumination but it also
gives you the opportunity to match the
memory on the ATX motherboard side of
things for that really cool cohesive
look just something to keep in mind and
my last comment would be about the cable
management and how easy it was to route
everything you know with the additional
24 pin and the 8 pin connections they
don't really add too much bulk to the
rear of the chassis plus add in those
plates that close everything fine I did
not even have to use a zip tie which is
great and now I'm going to spend some
time actually using this dual system
configuration to get into the mindset of
a potential buyer of what they might use
this for you know dual systems I don't
even know what I'm gonna do with it now
that I have this really powerful ATX
system but we shall see
