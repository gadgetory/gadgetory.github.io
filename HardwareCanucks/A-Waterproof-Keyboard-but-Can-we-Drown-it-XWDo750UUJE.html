features a variable pump speed to high
static pressure 140 member fans and
beautiful user control through the cam
software click below to get Kraken game
is tend to be unflatteringly stereotyped
as being pretty messy with a lot of gunk
or food clamming up their peripherals
now obviously this is a gross
misrepresentation but it's not without
some basis keeping your stuff clean be
it from dust off from food is pretty
difficult at times
so Zalman has proposed a potential
solution this is the hay 650 WP and
otherwise plain looking $30 keyboard but
it has one key feature waterproofing so
let's see if that waterproofing feature
actually holds up and how useful it is
at $30 the keyboards design isn't really
that interesting so we'll hit it quickly
it's a solid plastic frame with very
little flex and its construction is
pretty impressive at the price on top
you have media keys and the Zed machine
gaming gear branding and on the bottom
you have to flip out feet and grills for
water to exit there's a plastic cable
which terminates in PS - true rather
than USB which is a little bit strange
but not too noteworthy since they
include an adapter otherwise it's a very
plain and frankly uninspired design
especially for gaming gear now many
using switches with a plunger design
which appears to be a linear membrane
switch designed to be light and non
clicky these are some of the better
membrane switches I've tried while I'm
not a huge fan of linear switches they
have a pretty good amount of travel
distance and a quite light which is good
for gaming the design also helps keep
the switches working well when
frequently exposed to water well they're
not as satisfying as mechanical switches
to use no one expected them to be and
frankly they do the job pretty well I'll
give a quick sound sample of the
switches now
all right so let's get down to the key
feature the waterproofing now there are
two things to look out here the first is
if it works as expected and secondly if
it's useful at all the first one is
pretty easy to answer that works just as
expected and it works very well I could
hit it with as much water as I wanted
and even use it when fully submerged it
works great and it's good to see that
Salman has executed it properly deciding
on if it's useful that's a harder task
there's two angles to look at it from if
it's useful to gamers and if it's useful
outside of that I'm gonna be honest for
most gamers I think it's a bit gimmicky
it's cool to be able to wash your
keyboard and to not have to worry about
spilling drinks or food on it but it's
not something which I found I cared
about it's definitely gonna be a selling
point for some people and I'm sure you
already know who you are at $30 it's
really not much more to get this
waterproofing over other cheap keyboards
however I still think putting aside the
messy gamer stereotype that it just
doesn't make sense for gamers for the
home Zellman does mention use in
internet cafes and I do agree with them
here having an easily cleanable keyboard
in a public area makes a lot of sense
and the affordable nature helped sell it
as well for outdoor environments like
construction sites I can see the good
build quality and waterproofing along
with that cheap price to be a really
good seller I think the only downside
though is that that gaming branding is
gonna stick out like a sore thumb
anywhere but in the office the
conclusion for this board is this if
you're looking for a no-frills keyboard
with waterproofing the case 650 WP does
it well however if waterproofing really
isn't your thing there's probably plenty
of other good gaming boards that will
sell you much more than this at $30 so
you should probably spend your money
elsewhere so thank you for watching
