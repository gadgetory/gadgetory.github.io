great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Eber with Hara
canucks and today we have an interesting
product from my onyx known for their
wide range of peripherals one of their
latest releases is the AV or 7000
optical Gaming Mouse priced at $79 this
particular mouse has a unique organ
Amish ape that is symmetrical and it's
meant to be used by either left or right
hand users this mouse can also support
both a palm and a claw type grip and the
soft touch rubber surface feels
excellent although will wear out in time
and I would have liked to see rubberized
sides for longitude of the coating on
places that it's used the most my onyx
claims that treated the surface of the
mouse with four layers of coating and
given the exceptional argan aam --ax and
placed with the overall feel of the
mouse the new ad NS 3310 gaming optical
sensor has been outstanding and I
haven't noticed any hardware
acceleration I've had no issues with
tracking accurately with this Mouse all
the way up to 7000 dpi which is all you
need for gaming on multiple high
resolution monitors as well as other
productive tasks it is one of the better
regarded optical sensors and a very
important part of the gaming equation is
the mousepad
the sensor doesn't track on white
surfaces nor on glass so keep that in
mind and for better results we recommend
using a hard mouse mat for a smoother
Glide
the Hydra grams D havior is one of the
lightest mice that have used with a
balanced weight distribution those who
prefer a heavy Mouse stay away as the AV
or 7000 might be uncomfortably light and
it's unfortunate that we don't have an
adjustable weight system behavior also
has customizable LED options that's
multicolored and you can adjust the two
lighting zones which includes the logo
at the back and the scroll wheel that
displays a single color or color shift
in solid blinking pulsating or breathing
effects they are subtle but having the
option to color match all your other
peripherals is something to be expected
from a gaming product now there are nine
programmable buttons on the AV or 7000
which can be programmed through the
driver software and out of the nine
button six of them can be programmed as
macros with two on each side and the
other two that are located behind the
scroll wheel that is typically meant to
adjust the DPI settings the buttons do
provide excellent tactile feedback with
left and right dot too heavy and just
white for quick presses the cable is
braided but the USB port isn't
color-coded so it is difficult to
differentiate when plugged in behind
your computer the USB port also wasn't
fully stable on one of my laptops with a
slight movement of the cord that caused
disconnections which was really implies
'end but it operated fine when plugged
in to a different machine one drawback
to the symmetrical design are the
buttons on the opposite side of your
thumb that I keep pressing accidentally
and they do prevent from a tight grip on
the better note the my onyx AVR 7000
software is easy to use with plenty of
customizable options where you can
program the macros to your preference as
well as have up to five different
profiles with different settings that
are stowed on the mouse itself you can
adjust the double clicking speed and the
scroll speed as well as the option to
enable or disable the pointer
acceleration the sensors performance can
also be adjusted with three different
stops for your deep a preference as well
as the surface analyzer tool that
analyzes the level of information about
your mouse mat that helps a bit there's
also the pointer speed option as well as
the lift distance adjustment which is
handy the color settings on the software
are easy to use and adjustable and as I
mentioned previously this is the place
where you can adjust your LED options to
your preference I'm going to conclude by
stating that the me onyx AV or 7000 hits
the market with a lot of advantages like
the mouse being lightweight with precise
sensor tracking as well as the option to
customize the LED lighting zones it is
ergonomically pleasing with excellent
tactile switches and an intuitive and
clean driver software however there are
downsides like the soft contact of the
USB that isn't stable and the button
sitting opposite to my thumb that were
interfering build quality feels kind of
weak compared to the mcc v ramp or say
for example that utilizes an aluminum
frame and lack of a weight adjustment
system was something to be expected as
price point given the fact that the
competition provides more flexible
features and at 100 grams this will just
be too light for menus
and I think that the AVR 7000 is an
attractive choice for those wanting the
lighter feel and the symmetrical design
for both left and right hand users
combined with excellence into
performance when paired up with an
appropriate mouse mat also the same
price we'd recommend the Neo 7000 for
it's much better
ergonomic support featuring the same
sensor and switches and so that
concludes our review of the my onyx AVR
7000 optical gaming mouse thanks for

we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
