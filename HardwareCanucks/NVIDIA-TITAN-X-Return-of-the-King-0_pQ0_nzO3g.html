he's wandering a video hmm wait what GTX
1080
whoa my video
hmm
tie necks
I know
so while in the midst of testing G texts
an ADIZ from various board partners
Nvidia pulled the trigger last week and
launched the Titan X based off the
Pascal architecture even though this
card is primarily meant to provide high
performance yet an affordable solution
for scientific deep learning tasks it
nonetheless set a spark within the
gaming industry people were talking
about the price the performance and how
much improvement it offers over the GTX
1080 so this video will answer all those
questions and more Toshiba now offering
occ products that are awesome and
affordable like the Rd 400 TR 150 + VT
180 that are backed by advanced warranty
program now stronger than ever under
Toshiba this is by no means an
affordable GPU and I'm serious
priced at $1,200 USD people will think
twice before pressing the checkout
button something to also remember is
that none of Nvidia's board partners
will have this card for sale and neither
will online retailers the Titan X will
only be available through Nvidia com now
before I go on there are a few things
you guys have to be aware of I mentioned
that Nvidia is supposedly marketing this
as a more of a professional solution
since it features over 40 teraflops of
8-bit integer performance while it will
indeed get folks in the deep learning
community excited I've also seen a lot
of gamers snapping up these cards Plus
this Titan X has an illuminated GeForce
logo on its side so gamers are obviously
a good portion of its intended audience
glancing at the specs the Titan X is
something incredible it's got 40% more
CUDA cores than the GTX 1080 12
gigabytes of gddr5 X memory and one of
the clock frequencies are a little lower
than its younger brother the mass of
course and texture units should make up
for that physically the card looks like
a black town founders edition 1080 with
the angular sides and the exact same
cooler
I love the stealth look and it's
gorgeous considering this card has a 2
50-watt EEP it's not a surprise to see
an 8 plus 6 pin power input this also
grants a good amount of power input
overhead for overclocking the GP 102
core as well the cards underside is
completely covered with a backplane
which houses and videos logo as well as
the GeForce type next label as for i/o
you're getting three DisplayPort 1.3
outputs a single HDMI 2.0 connector and
a legacy DVI given this card has a same
cooler found on the 10 eighties founders
Edition temperatures actually start off
quite well and then end up hovering
around the 85 degrees Celsius mark as we
seen from the past
Nvidia's boost algorithms work hard
enough to balance power consumption fan
speeds temperatures and frequencies to
achieve optimal performance taking a
look at fan speeds that was the first
sacrifice as you can see the rotational
speeds are higher than every other
reference design we've seen during this
generation the difference is just above
500 rpm which isn't that much
considering what's powering the Titan X
but it isn't quite either our sample was
able to hit a constant speed of about
1600 megahertz even after hours of game
playing but I'm sure many of you will
want to throw a custom water cooling
solution and that should give you a lot
more Headroom for overclocking like I
said before the stock cooler isn't quiet
and it isn't loud either there was
noticeably a lot more fan noise than the
GTX 1080 but it was under control this
is a powerful yet power efficient GPU
likely because Nvidia already has a good
handle on their 16 nanometer
manufacturing process they have been
able to cram 12 billion transistors and
12 gigabytes of gddr5 X memory into this
card and it only requires just 27 watts
more power than the 90 DTI and 18 watts
more than the fury ax this is beyond
unbelievable so are you guys ready for
the benchmarks here you go
1440p tests at Ultra sinks were
dominated by the Titan X that's all I
have to say go ahead continue watching
I think it's safe to say that the Titan
X is a true 4k drivable GPU just look at
it everything at max settings and you're
achieving close to 60 frames per second
in most titles whereas more than that in
some other ones jaw-dropping results
okay let me set up the stage for you
guys the Titan X is a ludicrously fast
card and you've seen it by the numbers
but there's still more room left under
the tank for overclocking however there
are a few limitations first nvidia
hasn't a lot for any software based
voltage unlocking at least for the time
being but perhaps we can expect
somewhere around those lines in the
future
second this is a reference card only
which means you will never see a custom
heatsink from board partners which is
disappointing because the stock cooler
isn't meant to hold its Ford when the
Titan X is pushed above its limits but I
can't wait to see what this car can do
when put under water with that out of
the way how far were we able to push
this bad boy poorly freaking far with
the generous 20% power limit overhead
Nvidia currently provides we were able
to hit the constant core frequency of
1920 megahertz and the GDR FMX modules
operated just a little north of 11
gigabits per second and here's a test
run of the division at max settings in
over K this kind of performance from one
card is beyond incredible a single Titan
X achieved performance levels that
almost approaches to GTX 10 a DS in SLI
so who would actually buy a graphics
card that costs so much naturally some
budding scientists will see this as an
awesome value considering the price for
an equivalent card from Nvidia Tesla
line up the new Titan X can also be
targeted towards people who are looking
for a GTX 1080 SLI setup as the price
points are similar and the single card
solution won't encounter some of the
dual card system potential hiccups of
course there's no real reason to spend
$1200 on a GPU unless if you won the
absolute best of the best but for the
rest you'd have to think twice before
clicking the checkout button I'll admit
I would spend $1200 on a 69 hundred K
for my upcoming workstation PC and that
will ask me for the next two to three
years who knows how long this Titan X
would remain the fastest GPU on the
market but for now this card is the
fastest GPU that you can buy so how many
of you guys would actually pick up one
of these cards or how many of you would
actually consider spending that much
money on a GPU
definitely share your thoughts down
below I meet bird with hurricane axe
thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
