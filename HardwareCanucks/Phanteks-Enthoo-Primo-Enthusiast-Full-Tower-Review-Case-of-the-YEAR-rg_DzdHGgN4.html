back to another hurricane axe review now
we're taking a look at probably the case
of the year for enthusiasts which
completely blew me away from the very
beginning designed by a Dutch company
fantex
who specialized in PC cooling solutions
this is their first chassis and I'm
hoping they follow a similar path as
Corsair as the legendary 800 D really
paved the way for Corsair to acquire a
major chunk of the market share when it
came to enclosures the good news with
this product from fantex is that it aims
to redefine of how we think about
enthusiast cases it's no longer about
just giving us room but giving us
flexibility and functionality that is so
long overdue and you're looking at the
end through primal with a hefty price
tag of $250 but still surprisingly low
compared to other similar enthusiast
enclosures on the market also this isn't
just a regular full Tower but with
specific emphasis on insane water
cooling builds thanks to its moderately
large size but not as massive as the 900
d which means this is a perfect
alternative for those wanting to go
overkill the N through primal is one
elegant piece with tinted side panels
brushed aluminum at the front and the
top the front exhaust is covered by a
removable double panel that features a
built in dust filter attached with clips
and screws so it's not the most
convenient if you need to remove it the
dual panel is space to allow airflow to
enter plus there's extra ventilation on
either side of the fans but still we
know there will be quite a lot of
resistance because of all these barriers
luckily fantex is not new to cooling and
too high airflow fans will deliver an
ample of airflow plus they retail for
over $20 apiece which makes us happy
they they've been included the front
cover opens a little past 90 degrees and
we all know the disadvantages of this
design it could easily break and cannot
be swapped to be open from the other
side a total of 5 optical bays are
included with built-in dust filters on
the covers the left side panel is
occupied by one large window that will
beautifully showcase your components
while the smaller one is tasked with
displaying the fantex logo the right
side panel has dual fan ventilation and
power
supply intake both of which are covered
with magnetic dust filters the power
button along with the hard drive
activity light are located at the top of
the case but still within reach and the
rest of the connections are located at
the very top with LED switch for the
fans a reset button a total of four USB
ports two of which are USB 3 and chrome
plated audio jacks now given this is a
very tall enclosure the placement of the
USB ports is not the most ideal but if
you are showing off your rig and it's
not under the desk which is most likely
won't be it really is not a big issue
the top panel has a large easily
removable mesh with a dust filter and
really shows off at the water-cooling
potential with the ento primals quad 120
millionaire fans are supported or triple
140s with one included positioning of
the fence is flexible thanks to these
strips instead of single holes for
mounting and there is plenty of room
above the frame to push pull for your
radiator moving to the bottom of the
case fantex are truly delivering to what
every builder wants and that's full dust
proof enclosure with large dust filters
covering the entire bottom which are
easily removable and accessible from the
side now there's plenty going on in the
rear starting with the top exhaust with
height adjustment mount there are the
only ones we've seen to implement this
design aside from NZXT and we like it
which allows a little extra top
clearance for your radiator below are
the eight PCI slots plus additional
venting and plenty of different mounting
holes for a reservoir after all this is
a case designed for water cooling
enthusiasts and functionality and at the
very bottom we have a fan mount on the
right that is also a secondary spot for
a power supply and on the left is the
stock location for your power unit now
I'm very excited to get inside the end
to Primal particularly because there's a
lot to talk about and taking off both
panels the internals look a little
different from what you used to first we
do have tooless mounting for all the
optical drives and the hard drive cage
below is accessed exclusively from the
rear which is preferable the bottom
portion includes a fan bracket to be
used with 240 and 280 millimeter
radiators and with one intake fan
included there's about six inches of
clearance l till the motherboard area
which is plenty of room for
or thick radiators the fan bracket is
removable that allows a 480 millimeter
radiator to be installed at the bottom
which is quite impressive but also
allows clearance for power supply to be
installed the two adhesive rubber strips
are included to prevent noise from
vibration and the orientation of your
power supply is dependent on preference
as ventilation is available on either
side of the unit coming to the
motherboard area given enthuse Primus
emphasis on water cooling a reservoir
bracket is included which can also be
used to cover up the rubber grommets it
is easily removable and has a brushed
aluminum plastic panel and many
pre-drilled holes for different types of
reservoirs the only disadvantage with
this is the limited clearance for your
GPU is once installed only 10 the
half-inch cards will fit and only in the
top 5 PCI slots is the cutout on the
bracket doesn't follow all the way down
otherwise without the bracket 13 plus
inches is available we do have a lot of
rubber grommets around the motherboard
tray and the large CPU cutout and so far
it doesn't seem like fantex missed
anything regarding compatibility so
let's turn the case around and see how
it handles with cable management the
first thing you notice is how all the
stock cables are sleeved and cleaned up
which makes working with the case a lot
simpler there's also very clever cable
management system in place with velcro
straps that you can loosen up to fit
more cables or vice versa
there plenty of cable tie mounts as well
and generally a lot of room you just
have to work around the stock cables as
they do cover a lot of the rubber
grommets we do have a central fan hub
for seven fans which your motherboard
might be able to power through a single
4 pin connector but if not the molex
connector is available you're also able
to reposition the hub a little further
down so fan texture emphasizes on
flexibility with this case the hard
drive gauge is located in its usual spot
with unique Drive caddies that you don't
need to flex or widen but it sort of has
this wing design where you place the
drive and close the wings and it
actually quite sturdy and hassle free
and of course SSD compatible each cage
can also mount 120mm fans to drive
better airflow and of
it is modular very much expected from
what we've seen so far you can move the
entire assembly closer to the front to
allow better cooling for the drives or
remove the assembly completely for
installation of front radiator with
ample of 6.5 inches of space the front
will support 240 or 280 millimeter rods
but also and through primal comes with
side radiator bracket which can be used
with 240 Millner radiators it is very
simple installation but with radiator in
place you lose out on the entire hard
drive cage however if you are running
just the fans which have to be installed
on the outside of the bracket it fits in
just fine with the drive cage installed
this means extra cooling for your drives
and the panel causes just fine without
touching the fan we also have designated
SSD brackets above the main cage that
are easily removable each bracket houses
two drives and I think the user space is
appropriate plus there are specific
cutouts available to route your SATA
cables you can also replace one in the
brackets to another location if you
don't want to route your SATA power for
example all the way up there or have a
side radiator installed and rubber
grommet is available right underneath
for appropriate cable routing moving on
to the power supply it is elevated with
rubber standoffs and is mounted sideways
and the chassis comes equipped with a
pump bracket which is installed in front
of the power supply but can be moved
slightly forward for a little extra room
for all your cables and can be installed
instead of the bottom hard drive cage
there's also a tube cutout so you can
easily route your tubing from the pump
into the main chamber so you can see
that water cooling is sort of the
essential focus for the end to prime oh
and to recap here all the supported
radiators which is quite amazing this is
due to a functional design that allows
so much flexibility for preference and
fantex did a really good job with making
sure there are no compromises and
starting with the assembly that extended
middle motherboard standoff is really
useful to get you going and a small
toolbox is included that contains all
the needed screws that improves the
overall user experience there's over 80
millimeters of clearance between the top
frame and the memory on our board which
is good news
or thick radiators and finally looking
at the finished build it is very clean
and tidy thanks to the rear power supply
chamber and turning the case around
everything is well secured then really
there were no issues with cable routing
but anthro primer really screams for
more hardware and radius and this
certainly is one of top choices for
water cooling now we are going to
conclude without pros and cons list and
fantex
certainly didn't cut any corners with
the Antho primal as the build quality
and the looks are outstanding
the total of five quality high airflow
fans are included with plenty more
airflow options rear power supply
chamber does allow a cleaner looking
build without compromises with the
optional second replacement for the unit
the chassis is full dust proof with
easily accessible filters and features
an excellent velcro strap system for
your cable management really the core
purpose of the chassis is water cooling
and fan --tx has done an excellent job
with multi radiator support and even
include a pump and a reservoir bracket
and while $250 price tag may seem like a
lot the enter primer packs in the
incredible value for those wanting to
take the full advantage of what the case
has to offer really my main critique
here is that I wish there weren't that
many stock cables as they do block the
rubber grommets and make it a little bit
more difficult with routing also I wish
the design of the reservoir bracket
wouldn't conflict with longer GPUs but
in reality that is just me being picky
and the anthro primer really exceeded my
expectations
and deserve the hard work nugs damn good
and them innovative award because every
inch of this case serves a function and
I can't wait for their next case and
really to be honest I think this is the
best case we have reviewed to date and I
highly praise fantex for not leaving
anything out so what do you guys think
of the enter primer do you think it's a
bit overkill and will you pay such a
price given your water cooling let us
know in the comments below thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
