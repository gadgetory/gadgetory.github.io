wondering whether the TTL direction the
smaller side is right for you so in this
video we'll talk about the benefits the
drawbacks my personal experience with
TTL keyboards because I have a bit of a
keyboard fetish if you may and I know
the topic of keyboard sizes is very
personal varies from user the user but
hopefully this video will highlight why
key key L keyboards are coming up now
and more more predominant on the
marketplace so we'll talk about all that
right after this creativity is fueled by
the best instruments it doesn't always
come easy and in the process you often
realize how important quality is the Rd
400 bio CC gives you quality and speed
with M de tu interface the Shiban and
flash and a pci bracket making it
possible to focus on what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a five-year advance
warranty so first let's establish the
size reference so we have the full size
keyboards which are very common got all
the keys and usually with macro controls
and separate media buttons then we have
a tkl or ten keyless or maybe refer to
sometimes as 80% keyboards that are
basically full size keyboard but without
the numpad with all the other keys there
and then they're in between full-size
and TTL keyboards I would call them
let's say medium keyboard it basically
also falls into the TTL distinction
where the numpad is sort of built into
the arrow keys so it is a slightly
larger board than the standard TTL but
it's not as long as full-size boards and
then below the standard 10 kilos
distinction we have 60% and lower
keyboards which are very small but yet
you offer such a unique user experience
because each key has this multi-layered
functionality built in because keyboards
are so little you need to you know find
space on the board to perform the
standard tasks that you would normally
find on a full-size or a TTL keyboard
but for this video we'll talk about the
TTL in this form factor so basically a
standard full-size board without the
numpad so first let's start with the
positives and the obvious one is the
smaller keyboard size
find less space on your desk which means
that you can either have a smaller desk
and still not have it look cluttered or
you can you know have more items around
the keyboard without it interfering with
how you use your mouse and keyboard and
how you just interact with your space I
would also say it's also more visually
appealing having a smaller keyboard in
your space regardless of if your desk is
large or small it just looks better when
the keyboard is smaller it's also easier
to carry around fits in your backpack if
you travel a lot if you go to land
events or you want to just take a
keyboard somewhere it also fits in your
coat a smaller keyboard allows less
complications with the mouse pad so they
don't have to overlap whereas with
full-sized keyboards that little corner
where the new pad is overlaps with the
mouse pad and kind of causes the
keyboard to tilt so small keyboard less
interference with the mouse pad however
one the main advantages I would argue
with the hand placement and this
economic improvement that a smaller
keyboard delivers because your right and
left hands are naturally closer together
so this transitioning between going from
mouse - keyboard hand movement is it has
to cover less distance and also you're
just naturally hands closer together
when you're typing or using the mouse at
the same time is more comfortable and
because of the distance reduction from
your left and right hand it means that
your keyboard can be sort of oriented
properly whereas with a full size
keyboard you would sometimes see is
being angled to reduce that space which
is a common trick for you know for
gaming for example but you won't have to
do that with a tkl keyboard and again
coming back to this economic improvement
a smaller keyboard would allow your
field of view to be a little bit more
centered with where you're typing -
let's say if you have a screen right in
front of you whereas with a larger board
it might be offset slightly and so your
hands would also be offset also in our
experience a lot of tkl keyboards the
smaller size have a removable cable that
complements this whole portability
factor whereas full-sized keyboards some
have the removable cable but majority
don't and one more I will mention this
is maybe just me but my perception of
build quality with smaller and TTL key
in general is just better maybe it's
because the frame is the same as what
you would find on the larger keyboard
but because it's not as long it doesn't
doesn't have as much flex for example
and they just feel really good so yeah
perception of bill quality may be
improved on a small keyboard and now
let's move on to negatives and don't
even mention the lack of an amp ad
because that is the nature of the
keyboard however I so miss that side
enter and that is because for a lot of
applications that side enter is used as
secondary command so it's not your
simple enter like you would find in the
middle of the keyboard but is for
example in Photoshop it's used to accept
changes so if you make adjustment to
your layer you can quickly press that
side ENTER to accept changes with your
thumb without having to list off your
hand from your mouse you can do the same
thing with control enter if you don't
have that side enter but it's just more
time-consuming and one walk around you
can do is map something on this side of
the keyboard to that side enter and
therefore if you need to quickly press
that side enter when your thumb you can
do so but as long as your keyboard
allows that remapping or macro
customization and of course because the
size being one of the benefits of a tkl
keyboard there's usually a lot less room
on the frame for media control so
everything's got built into the keys
which I would say is not a negative but
some may see that as a negative because
maybe you want a slightly you know wider
frame to allow more buttons for media
controls but majority of them are built
into the keys like this home button or
the F keys and the final major negative
for me would be price why is it that the
T key our keyboards are generally more
expensive than they're exactly the same
variants of a full-size keyboard it
doesn't make any sense I mean it is
market demand and maybe there is more
need for smaller keyboards and therefore
companies are monetizing on the fact
that more people want TTL direction and
they're now starting to come out market
and they're more expensive but the
incentive is not there the incentive is
for you to stay with a full-size
keyboard because it is cheaper than 80
killed version that is just unfortunate
because pto keyboards are awesome so
yeah that is my list of positives and
negative
regarding tkl keyboards I will leave a
bunch of them in description below for
you to check out regarding models and
pricing availability and all of that and
for all those who are using tkl
keyboards or lower what your what's your
experience been like you know share it
in the comments below I'm sure a lot of
people are trying to decide whether or
not TTL is the right direction for them
so let's have this conversation I'm
going to meet you with how our connects
thanks much for watching we'll see you
