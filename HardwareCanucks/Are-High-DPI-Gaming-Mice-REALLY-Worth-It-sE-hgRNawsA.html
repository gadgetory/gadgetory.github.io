some fun shall we I want to explore the
topic of maximum dpi for gaming mice
because it's such an arbitrary and
almost vague number that nobody should
ever use so why does it exist in the
first place so here is me gaming at 400
dpi as you can see how full control my
muscle memory kicks in in terms of
flicks and aim correction when I
overshoot my target but here is me
gaming at 16,000 16,000 dpi it is
impossible to game at 16,000 dpi you
probably already knew that it's
hilarious and it's also frustrating even
after lowering my sensitivity in Windows
and in game to somewhat of a level where
I have a bit more control it's just it
doesn't make any sense but of course
there are reasons why we have mice with
16,000 dpi sensitivity with 12000 dpi
and CPI so let's talk about all the
reasons why right after this the new t46
calibre ddr4 memory is one unique RGB
kit with awesome light spill from each
module and the special edition has a
cool totem design on the light bar you
get lifetime warranty up to 4,000
megahertz speeds and full lighting
control through the software check out
the t46 calibre ram down below alright
so i'm a bit of a mice collector and so
here's a collection of all my mice and
their maximum DPI sensitivity starting
off with the lowest one I have the Zoe
FK one it only goes up to 3200 dpi which
is respectable given that started
audience for eSports players and most of
whom don't go above a thousand dpi
because you want to have that control
when doing those headshots moving up the
scale we have the MX master 2's it's a
Productivity Mouse but it only goes up
to 4000 dpi and they say only in
comparison to what you're about to see
come next my favourites still series
mice the rival 310 and 600 both go up to
12,000 CPI then laundry Tex g3 or 5g for
3G 6 or 3 and the original G Pro go up
to 12,000 dpi as well but if you're not
moving up the dpi chain how you really
dancing and this is where I think you
know gaming brands are kind of an
dilemma they want to appear like they're
releasing new products and innovating
but you know releasing a 16k sensor
versus a 12k sensor we had two years ago
technological advancement is there and
you can appreciate for this true one to
one performance throughout the entire
range no filtering from 100 to 16,000
dpi it's impressive but it doesn't
matter it seems like it's being released
just as a showpiece you know like this
is where we are right now with sensor
technology but machines can detect
16,000 dpi with no filtering but humans
can't now I love the approach from
Logitech in terms of releasing these new
sensors and upgrading their older mice
like the g502 hero and the G Pro now
have the new 16 K hero sensors without
any price premiums you're still paying
$79 for this and 69 for the G pro mouse
and wireless integration of course is a
brand new one but it's awesome to see
older bodies being upgraded with the new
sensors without any price premiums but
of course marketing has played a huge
role in increasing the maximum dpi I
think because 16 K sounds a lot better
than 12 K and below but I think is a
gaming community as a whole
we've moved beyond preceding high
sensitivity sensors as anything of like
value to us because now it's all about
the weight the shaped buttons the
quality of the entire structure more
than the sensor itself because the
sensors are becoming so good that any
advancement in them is almost irrelevant
so for example the original G pro of
Mouse that I've used ever since launch a
fantastic performer and by the way you
can check out my favorite list of my
style description below along with mouse
mats but the new G Pro has the new 16
hero sensor and upgraded cable based on
feedback but everything else is
identical and aside from having the
thinner cable the doesn't kink might
perceive performance between these two
mice one a 16 K sensor or the other is
12 is identical at 400 dpi so it makes
no difference but now I'd like to
discuss all the reasons why high DPI
sensitivity exists in the first place
let's begin with high resolution gaming
so I went back to
cs:go enabled 8k resolution the adsr I
know it's not exactly a k resolution
since I'm playing in the 4k display but
just having control is so it's almost
impossible even though I played this for
half an hour before recording this
gameplay just to understand how my
cursor would you know behave and you
know and how much movement I have to
control so in any of these examples you
can see the mouse is very jerky I have
very little control of where my
crosshair goes and in csgo
it's super important because that's how
you aim so precise and accurate shots
are important so for example here I take
out my pistol trying to aim and I'm
trying to correct for my error but it's
just impossible because tiny movement of
the mouse to like a million little
movement of the mouse mat is so much
movement on screen it's almost like I'm
flicking everywhere and just simple aim
becomes impossible
now jumping into quake champions another
super-important FPS where aim is crucial
but this one we have a bit more margin
of error because rocket launcher is
another weapons deal damage in the
radius format so you can still shoot at
the wall and potentially kill your
opponent so here is me playing at 400
dpi I'm very comfortable with my aim I
know exactly where to pre aim when I go
around certain corners but then when we
switch to 16,000 dpi this story changes
and just as with csgo my aim is
impossible I cannot find my target and
it was quite frustrating at 16,000 dpi
it's quite unnatural having such slight
motion of the mouse itself that lose so
many pixels on screen if you really want
to test your in-game patience play with
an extremely high DPI that is unnatural
and yeah see how frustrated you get but
gaming aside another argument for having
high DPI sensitivity on the mouse is if
you have multiple high resolution
monitors so imagine if you have 8 4k
displays all together and you need to
get from one corner of one them to the
bottom you know dragging windows and
stuff and right now I'm at 12,000 dpi
and you can see just how fast I can
maneuver that window and this is at 100%
scaling but then you lose the whole
control you know the precise accuracy is
lost when your look dealing with
something that is so high in dpi
but I'm guessing having that really high
12000 or 16,000 dpi in a really large
pixel real estate might actually be
helpful for productivity as long as you
can drop down for that navigation
accuracy the Newmark - coarser strafe
and k70 keyboards are fully loaded with
custom illumination convenient media
buttons USB pass-through extra set of
key camps and ergonomic rest rest for
each keyboard so you can type or game
comfortably with a variety of MX
switches available so you can check out
which keyboard suits you best in the
description below alright so the
takeaway is this gaming at really high
DPI makes no sense even if you try to
control for it by lowering sensitivity
in game and increasing it on the mouse
take advantage
the full potential of that 16k sensor
because it's all about showcase it's
about like here we can make this
technology happen without increasing the
price and not because the users
necessarily need it and I would love for
you guys to do something go to your
maximum dpi in the mouse and record
yourself in gameplay and send us on
Twitter because I want to see the
hilarious reactions of trying to control
something that's so unnatural and
unfamiliar based on what your original
or most common dpi is all right I'm
Dimitri hope you enjoy this video make
sure to check out this other relevant
content check out there our new boot
sequence Channel and all the mice and
things will be listed in the description
below so yeah they starts for watching
we'll see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
