to you by and say XCOM technology
connect ok so we are here in sanitizer
at CES 2014 you have a massive boot set
up showcasing all different types of
gaming products had audiophile
headphones rates there's some really
exclusive things behind behind this wall
that we'll show you later but I know a
lot of you guys are interested in the
gaming sphere and what's on Heiser can
offer in that so I'm here with Christian
he's the director of their gaming mind
for headphones they've just announced
their game 1 and game 0 but first let's
take a look at the game one it's they do
follow the same conventional design as
with the rest of the Sennheiser
headphones it is you know looks like
it's same type of construction but what
have you changed what's different about
this the game one versus say the PC 360
and PC 350 yeah basically for the PC for
the game one I'm sorry yeah you
basically see first of all that's that's
a design update we have done on the
product so I stare at Lee it's white
it's it's white it has a different touch
of the surface so it feels actually much
more sturdy and nice than the
predecessors yeah technically we haven't
changed so much so you can still see
there's there's a microphone mute
integrated in the microphone boom so you
move it up and you mute the microphone
where's the volume control on the on the
right ear cup to control the volume and
it's so much easier to find that
compared to having a volume control oh
yeah absolutely it's it's still an open
design it
as a fantastic we're in Concord so you
can play for hours but you would use
that mainly in a situation where it's a
little more quiet around you because
again it's an open design and that means
you can hear all the noise that is
surrounding you so but there's no noise
that's there's so many advantages of
using an open design I I myself am a
huge fan sanitizer I use an open design
headset for movies and gaming and music
but aside from I so it does leap audio
you can still hear anything from your
surroundings but what are the advantages
of an open design for gaming an open
design for game is you don't first of
all you don't feel that isolated right
so you're still you still hear what is
going on around you so again that is
something would we would recommend for
us somebody playing mostly at home right
Ella gives gives a very natural sound so
as you may have seen on our products we
don't have so much pronunciation on the
on the base yeah we know that also from
some studies that having too much base
will just disturb the experience of the
game in the term that you don't hear all
the details anymore and as more
professional gamer you of course need to
you are you know you rely on all the
details to to win your game and that is
something that we that we really pursue
in these products so the base is not
over pronounce but it really goes very
deep so you have to write all your
material you can really feel this
shaking
so you tonal properties this gaming
headset is tuned in for not too much
place for just enough and great pyramids
and I travel nice and crispy so you can
hear basically so basically we also tune
the frequency response in a way that you
can specifically here where sounds come
from so that is that is specifically
tuned for the gamers because that is
what you rely on in the game when you
want to hear right absolutely yeah
so this damn one is the game one right
if you are a gamer who is more likely to
travel to friends or to competitions we
have the game 0 that's a closed acoustic
design so you see this like a
leatherette
yet which is really really comfortable
and it's very nice feeling it's
extremely soft with memory foam
underneath with two different heights
that basically has to make sure that the
headset is sealing sealing very well off
around your ear
I will come to that later and basically
it also folds together so you can
collapse it it comes with a case so you
can easily transport it to wherever you
go to to play your games again it's a
closed design one advantage is of course
that it shuts you off from the
environment so you don't hear all the
noise around it you can try it out later
but you always have to make sure that it
really seals well around the year
because for two reasons one is that
otherwise you lose the noise canceling
effect the second is that you lose the
bass so the bass performance is very
much depending on how well this is
sealing around sorry isolation not noise
cancelling no no it's not active it's
just a passive one but it's very good so
you can try it outlines the ICU but
again you have to make sure that it
really seals around your year for the
noise isolation but also for the bass
performing yeah and again based
performance is not access I would say
but it's really going very deep down so
with the right audio material that's
really
and again same features you have muting
of the microphone with the boom so that
is something very intuitive to do and on
the right ear cup you have the volume
control to adjust the volume level
what's the price point for game zero and
game one game one is at 229 US dollar
sorry 249 u.s. talaga game game zero is
at 279 u.s. so you're giving the users
so with these headsets I feel like you
know it's much more it is on the
aesthetic of change you're targeting
difference and the price difference
between the other Tesla headsets with
the earlier models yeah is still sort of
on par so very competitive so depending
on what you kind of feel like it if you
do like the white version you could go
with that or you could go with the
slightly I guess the previous models if
you want that more black and Gray's
aesthetic right okay so thanks Chris
now we're gonna go ahead check out
something very interesting behind this
