and welcome to another video as this
year comes to a close we decided to do a
top five cases of 2013 because if you
look at our review history we've taken
look at a lot of cases and hopefully can
provide you guys a little bit of an
objective and also slightly subjective
opinion about what you should consider
if you are looking for a case now before
we get on with our top 5 list I want to
first give some honorable mentions to a
few cases that actually are from 2012
that should still be considered so one
of the cases is you if you're looking
for a micro ATX case is the Cougar spike
now a lot of people are going to jump up
from your chairs and the red flags are
going to be flashing everywhere danger
but the Cougar spike in my opinion is
one of the most budget-friendly micro
ATX cases on the market it's only $35
it offers enthusiast compatibility free
graphics cards because there's a lot of
room at the bottom as the power supply
is installed at the top true you are
facing no fans in the front all your
hard drives are facing internally so
that might create some issues with cable
management but from when I was working
with it it was actually not a big issue
at all it was definitely something that
stuck with me because it's only $35 and
to give this in perspective when I was
buying a side panel for cool master 692
that cost just as much as this entire
case so that alone $35 price tag for a
budget-friendly micro ATX build is
totally perfect looks might be not so
good but moving up next case is beat
Phenix prodigy up to this day it's still
very popular simply because it's a mini
ITX case that has water cooling support
without any sort of compromises and
that's definitely a case that still is
very popular today so huge mention to
that next one is Corsair 200 R it's only
$60 it's an ATX case very open like we
know to come to expect from Corsair
cable management is decent and only 60
bucks for sort of this budget-friendly
six chassis is very nice and the last
one in this auto mentions before we get
in our top five list is Silverstone Sugo
SGO nine this is one of the most compact
and most user-friendly micro ATX cases
that I've worked in simply because it is
so tiny yet that can fit in so much into
it so a huge shout out to Silverstone
for design in this amazing compact
enclosure so with those four cases
mentioned in the honorable mentions
let's dive in in our top five cases of
2013 all right starting at number five
is case labs mercury s5 we've recently
taken a look in this case and this is
one of the best built quality cases that
I've ever taken look at here at Eric
Knox
it offers extreme user flexibility from
the initial configuration because you
have to order it from from their website
and there you choose different color
options different panels different water
cooling options you can actually order
even sort of the base paint so you can
paint it yourself which is really cool
but in terms of functionality it offers
all the basics and more that you would
need if you're doing anything enthusiast
related this would be in the enthusiast
great case because it's likely more
expensive than so you're sort of your
consumer great products and consumer
great chassis but it is totally worth it
and deserves the number 5 place on our
top 5 cases of 2013 number four is the
courser obsidian and it's not going to
be 900 d because we've had so many
issues with it until it just does not
offer the same functionality and
actually no build quality on the 900 e
is a little bit out of whack and so
number 4 space goes to 350 d this is a
micro ATX case it's beautiful very
elegant case very open internally has an
SSD caged something that's at the time
was sort of innovative now we are seeing
more as the cage is being implemented
but a really cool thing to see from
Corsair so definitely if you're looking
for a micro ATX build Corsair 350 d
should definitely
on your consideration list number three
is Coolermaster and 600 you also have
the N 509 and 400 and 300 and 200 s a
lot of cases in the end series there n
series is the compact yet feature packed
and functional and closure
I think the N 600 is one of the best ATX
cases on the market because it's only
$80 it has a side Raider amount not
particularly for custom water cooling
loops because of the limitation with
space because again this is a very
compact enclosure but for an all-in-one
water coolers or 240 ml radiators that
are slim that don't have any much much
of those tubing's coming out this is
going to be a perfect spot for a
radiator on the side allowing you still
utilizing the top fans and the back fans
and actually looks beautiful it's a very
simple and elegant case for eighty
dollars and packs in a lot of the
features with cable management air flow
options storage options especially with
the SSD cage that you can sort the hard
drive cage that you can turn from a 3.5
inch hard drive cage to a 2.5 inch drive
cage something or giving a users a
little bit more flexibility there okay
number two is going to be a little bit
different because a number two I
actually have three cases here simply
because they're I would say they're
almost the same case they're all from
different companies and they are they
have slightly different price point but
I feel they all offer the same features
the same functionality and so the first
one is beat Phenix ronin it's $99 i
think it's one of the best cases from
beat Phenix it has the stealth cover
that covers your hard drives and your
power supply but yet still offers a
beautiful window to look inside it's
always a big bonus here it offers
flexible hard drive gauges what are
cooling options especially because you
can install fans above the frame I think
that's very important next one is arc
MIDI or two from fractal design it's a
slightly more expensive than the
BitFenix Ronin but still very elegant
offers very much similar features with
module drive gauges beautiful tinted
window water cooling options air flow
options and user flexibility
and user-friendly assembly it's very
important as well and also in the same
line of number two is NZXT phantom 5/3
again offering very flexible user
assembly a lot of options to choose from
SSD mounts at the back so you don't need
to utilize your hard drive cages
especially for SSDs airflow option and
it looks awesome as well so you can have
the white version that looks a little
bit like a starship trooper and all
three cases again are very similar in
design very similar in functionality but
they all have a little bit different
aesthetics and a little bit different
price points so it would really depend
on what you like and what your
preference is like for each brand so
those three cases definitely deserve the
number two spot in our list and number
one case of 2013 that we've taken look
at while I was doing the review it was
sort of a foreshadowing what's about to
come so number one is phantoms and two
primal this is the best case of the year
this is totally it deserved spot fantex
this is their first case and I'm super
excited to see what they come up with
next at CES they're actually revealing
their mid tower I'm really excited to
see what type of next level they took
because with the enter primal it really
smokes every other enthusiasts case in
its price category which is only $250
this is $100 cheaper than the Corsair
900 d so anybody who is thinking about
water cooling enthusiast components air
cooling whatever enter primal is totally
the choice for you and I would give them
the number one spot in our top 5 cases
of 2013 simply because it looks awesome
lots of flexibility those chambers
separating components dual power supply
options and also integrated water
cooling support for your pump for your
reservoir brackets I mean they've really
thought about everything cable
management is a complete breeze so
fantex really happy that you guys are on
the market really excited to see what
you
come back next alright guys so this
concludes our top five cases of 2013 we
always appreciate your continued
engagement and always come back to watch
our heart hearing reviews hopefully this
makes a little bit easier for you to
make an informed decision if you're on
the market for chassis we have some
cases here that we were able to put on
this desk some of the one we haven't
reviewed yet but that's all coming in
2014 which is going to be an amazing
year so as always thanks for watching
and Happy New Year alright so number and
so starting with number five is case
labs mercury s5 this is one of the most
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
