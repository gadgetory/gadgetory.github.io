sleeping gaming notebooks are all about
that performance and that portability
performance in the relative term code
that coincides with the size of the
machine and portability in objective
terms let's be honest I can fit my
gaming notebook inside the backpack
easily cannot say the same thing about
this gaming ITX system that I built
recently which does not include a
monitor and accompanying peripherals by
the way and if you are in the market for
a gaming notebook then I would
definitely suggest you check out our
video here that outlines all the maxvill
offerings from the 960m the 965 m 970 m
and the 980 m and i would say for the
modern gamer the frame rates and the
performance within those GPUs is pretty
adequate and so we traveled to New York
City to check out what Nvidia was
showing off and up until now I think we
always expected a compromise on
performance when dealing with the
notebook form factor but I'm happy to
say that may no longer be the case as
Nvidia is rolling out with a GTX 980 for
the notebook sector this means I fully
unlocked GM 204 core with 2048 CUDA
cores seven gigabits per second speed on
the memory compared to the five gigabits
maximum on the 980 m minimum for phase
power supply and up to eight on some
machines compared to maximum three
phases on previous notebooks and fifty
percent higher peak currents on the
entire power system including inductors
and capacitors to make sure overclocking
Headroom is available and what we're
told these are gtx 980 s that they are
picked to be able to deliver the certain
performance
that they expect from 980 but with the
lower power envelope so in comparison to
a desktop gtx 980 it's more efficient
and performance variance is about five
percent and to see the performance
difference a desktop 980 with the has
both 4770k was set up on one machine
running firestrike extreme and the same
benchmark was run on this Cleavon
notebook with a gtx 980 and skylake 6700
k both pieces of desktop hardware packed
inside and notebook and just taking a
look at the graphics core the notebook
and versus the desktop and the
difference is about one percent at this
particular test it's still pretty
exciting to have all that GPU power as
here is our 3d mark 5 strike test
featuring the entire mobile and desktop
stack let's just focus on the graphics
core and take the GTX 980 versus a very
impressive 980 m which up to now was the
fastest mobile GPU and the difference is
31% enthusiast gamers could use the
additional 31 percent for higher
settings and obviously better frame rate
we also get a chance to overclock the
GTX 980 inside the msi gt72
from 1215 megahertz all the way to 1421
megahertz so two hundred six extra
megahertz on the core the overclock will
obviously vary from notebook notebook
based on cooling but it seems the target
temperature is set to 82 degrees Celsius
which brings us to fan control is users
will now be able to create custom fan
curves for the GPU inside the notebook
which complements the overclocking
ability just perfectly the last two
points that are important to mention are
surround gaming which would deliver
better framerate thanks to the extra
power of the 980 but I really doubt
that's a popular approach with surround
running off a notebook but what really
caught my eye is VR application just
because it's demanding having to render
two separate frames at 90 frames per
second for fluid motion is taxing on the
GPU and so now all of this sounds
exciting but based on our previous
gaming notebook reviews we've heard and
we've read and we've listened to a lot
of
backlash in the price to performance
argument in particular the I could build
myself a much better desktop for half
the cost but double the performance and
I definitely think there's merit in that
argument and I definitely think the
price argument is the sole reason why a
desktop replacement argument is not
sticking but now for the performance
argument that could change with the
introduction of a fully unlocked GTX 980
for the notebook now what are your
thoughts on the matter
are you excited for the desktop hardware
to weave its way into the notebook
sector let us know with the comment
below as always give us a like if you
want us to review any of the upcoming
notebooks with a 980
I'm Dimitri with harbor Canucks thanks
much for watching we'll see you in
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
