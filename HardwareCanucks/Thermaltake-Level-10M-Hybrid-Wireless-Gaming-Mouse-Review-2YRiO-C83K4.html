great technology selections and service
hey guys Eber here with Haruka Knox and
today we're taking a look at a product
from thermaltake especially from their
tte sports gaming division this is the
level 10m hybrid wireless mouse priced
at $110 the thermaltake has gone with a
wireless revision of the very popular
level 10m and they've made some changes
like the added finger support on the
right the browser buttons on the left
are now the same size plus the aluminum
frame is now a slightly darker shade the
build quality is extremely solid
combined with the software server
surface to give the 10m hybrid that
familiar and sturdy feel there's also
the added support for your ring and
pinky fingers for a much improved
ergonomics as its boxy form on the
original was one of the main
disadvantages the 10m hybrid is large
and heavy and it's disappointing to see
no weight adjustment system however we
can adjust the height and the angle of
the top surface using the included
torque tool this is an excellent
consideration allowing some user
flexibility whether you prefer a taller
or a slightly shorter body the angle
adjustment on our sample is quite loose
however so the body swayed side-to-side
with ease it didn't affect the grip but
it does reveal the drawback of this
adjustment system that turns it obsolete
now the hybrid and the name stands for
wireless or wired with the included USB
cable the external front section is
where you plug in the cable and it makes
the mouse unnecessarily long and you'll
require a fairly large mouse mat to
maintain that smooth Glide the cable is
braided plus the tip is color-coded for
easier distinction when used in wireless
mode Thermaltake includes this end piece
that you put in front of the mouse for
that familiar look but I really wish the
front design was something else
the included wireless receiver can be
stored on the USB cap that is tied onto
the cable which prevents it from being
this place that is considerate and also
there's an included carrying case that
has proper divisions for cable and the
males itself the hybrid has 9
programmable buttons with two browser
buttons with a joystick like button with
four directions on its own click this is
an awesome way to cram in plenty of
macros and the profile and dpi
by the directional presses on the
joystick are not as defined as it's easy
to click the up command when trying to
click the forward on the joystick
primary left and right clicks are very
tactile with quick bounds short travel
distance and light enough for quick
presses the scroll wheel is also easy to
press plus a scroll steps are defined
unlike the original TT sports logo below
the mesh does not illuminate but the
other LED zones have remained unchanged
so on the left click you'll get this
strange rectangular illumination and the
scroll wheel there's also the DPI shift
indicator on the right click but I feel
like it's placed in the wrong side
because you can't see the DPI levels
you're using and it's most likely
covered by a metal finger luckily
there's an onscreen overlay for dpi and
profile shifts keep in mind that the
LEDs don't light up when used in
wireless mode that complements battery
life and the LEDs in the mouse will
blink once you hit 30% of battery or
less reminding you to charge the mouse
at the bottom we may find glide paths
plus an on/off switch to preserve
battery in a pairing button for the
receiver the Avago 9800 laser sensor
seems to be hitting mini gaming mice
lately like this in say Wireless from
steel series or EVG is first Mouse the
Torx x10 and no surprises here with
accurate tracking but occasional
stuttering and lag in wireless mode when
tested on white surfaces however using a
large mouse mat proved more reliable for
smooth and accurate navigation the
included driver software looks clean
with standard button mapping there's
also the normal and battle mode option
that changes the lighting based on your
frequency of your clicks then you have
the five different profiles lighting
options for the two zones macro
recordings are very convenient and of
course sensor adjustments are crucial
with four levels along with liftoff
distance and all these settings are
saved on the mouse thanks to the
built-in memory given the large size and
non-conventional square form give
yourself some time to get used to the
shape after finding my optimal grip my
aiming accuracy was spot-on and my hand
felt comfortable despite the lack of
thumb support so this level 10m refresh
still carries that solid form thanks to
the aluminum frame excellent primary
switches the hybrid option for wireless
or wired mode and form adjustment
allowing height and such set flexibility
the inclusion of the finger support on
the right is of course welcome although
I wish we
I'm support instead so now comes the
negatives the mouse doesn't need to be
this long just to hold a cable that
requires a large than usual tracking
area the joystick on the left side is
very flimsy without properly defined
directional presses the angular
adjustment is also quite loose and the
DPI indicators on the right are out of
sight although thanks the on-screen
overlay that is not a big deal
also for a wireless mouse there is no
convenient way to charge the 10m hybrid
meaning you have to plug it every few
days in which in case you might as well
just opt for the original 10m for half
the price and I get that wireless gaming
mice are becoming more common but it's
the inconvenient charging that turns me
off from the 10m hybrid but would you
think would you consider the wireless
capability for twice the price or just
stick with the wired option let us know
