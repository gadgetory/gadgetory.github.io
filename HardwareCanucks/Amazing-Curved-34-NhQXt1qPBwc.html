panels on this channel to me the fresh
rate is priority fold by panel types so
I'll be talking about TN or IPS or V a
followed by size and resolution so this
panel behind me is the first curved
gaming panel that I've experienced it
runs at 144 Hertz with available
overclocked to 166 Hertz with g-sync
support it's got an IPS panel and 34
inch size with an appropriate amount of
curve I mean I can do like video editing
on this thing without that bowtie effect
so the catch
it's 2560 by 1080 resolution and it cost
$1000 damn it
free sink model of this monitor is $300
cheaper so what is LG thinking with the
34 you see 89 G I'm here to break down
why this is one of the best curved
gaming panels to get and perhaps why you
shouldn't buy one right after this
wondering how to fix a boring fan check
out halos RGB there are super slim fan
frames that light up your blades of any
shade come on 120 and 140 member sizes
to fit any fan and a control through
your motherboard or your fan text case
available in beautiful aluminum or
simple plastic it's time to halos your
build outline what matters okay so
clearly LG wants to create that large
separation between their gaming line and
the productivity line as they have
clearly not been following the hate
gloss trend because it's everywhere I do
prefer the cleaner and curved your base
on their non gaming monitor and I wish
that we had something other than the red
and black color scheme how original
functionally the base is perfect with
lots of movement a good height position
and you can also have a little bit
rotation to strengthen the panel and
this cable management hoop in the back
that can also hold a pair of headphones
if you don't mind that location
connectivity is good with USB 3
pass-through DisplayPort and HDMI plus a
headphone jack that is actually pretty
powerful of course the location is
awkward unless you're routing speakers
the display maximum brightness is
surprisingly them at only 308 nits
compared to my other panels that have
much brighter output contrast ratio in
my measurement is below 1000 to 1 which
is not a big deal but it covers 99% of
the sRGB color space so considering the
refresh rate and its intended purpose
this IPS panel is good the viewing
angles are as expected no color or
contra
shifting but I can see uniformity is not
perfect with the entire left side of the
monitor slightly warmer that is
noticeable only in the white sections
and is not visible in games I only
noticed this in Excel or having two side
by side windows open one word document
and another chrome page for example that
has some white in it in that setting
it's noticeable but in games it never
really occurred to me the difference in
uniformity because there's so much
happening you don't have a chance to
stop and observe the difference so the
resolution of this monitor I think is
appropriate for the target audience 2560
by 1080 is not that difficult to run and
you know for high refresh rate panels
1080p is that sweet spot even for my
1440p and 4k displays I always downgrade
the resolution to 1080p in games to get
the best framerate possible with
slightly lower settings and so with this
panel you do gain that extra viewing
angles on the ultrawide monitor and
therefore you have to almost train
yourself to scan those sections of the
monitor that you're normally not used to
on 16 by 9 and therefore for games like
csgo where your eyes are glued to the
crosshair and that's how you sort of
scan your area ultra wide is pointless
but then for third person games like pop
G ARMA 3 Mass Effect's or others you do
gain that extra wide real estate and
therefore you can be more aware of your
surroundings by checking corners and
things like that but as long as those
those white pixels are not being skewed
normally and actually being rendered
appropriately for 21 by 9 and also
another visual advantage you get with
ultra whites is all the in-game assets
like the map the chat you know the
killfeed and whatever your ammo is being
moved those sides and therefore you have
a wider field of view on your normal
gameplay that would otherwise be
overlaid with those in-game assets and
because this panel is such a high 144
Hertz refresh rate and can even be
overclocked to 166 it means that you get
very smooth gameplay and nothing comes
close in the ultra wide high refresh
market to this panel we even get a few
digital enhancements like black
stabilizer
that boosts all the shadows for better
visibility in darker areas there is even
a crosshair selection for noobs and I
love switching between profiles that
is instantaneous so you don't have to
restart the monitor every time you
switch a profile but then on the flip
side of that coin it's this exact
resolution on why you shouldn't buy this
monitor 2560 by 1080 is still very
pixelated for productivity and I'm a
strong believer and having one display
that is you know for multi-purpose
things not just a strictly gaming or
strictly productivity but a nice mix in
between and unfortunately this panel
does not deliver just look at the
difference of my premiere time line
between the qHD and this panel and how
much extra real estate would gain with
higher pixel density and I wish that we
were not locked this particular
resolution and refresh rate combo I wish
that we had some dynamic refresh rate
that would allow us to let's say go to
high resolution like 34 40 by 1440 and
get maximum 100 Hertz but say if you
want that extra refresh rate you dumb
down the resolution to 2560 by 1080 and
get 144 Hertz I wish that the dynamic
refresh rate worked with resolutions in
conjunction yeah that would have been
awesome and the main advantage of this
panel over other g-sync ultra wide
monitors is the lower price point and
the high refresh rate and the compromise
of a low resolution so it fills that
void in the market that it's currently
missing but I feel this resolution in
this refresh rate combo will only get
more saturated in the market so if you
are in the market for display I would
nudge you in the direction of you know
1440p 27 inches 144 Hertz and IPS plenty
of monitors that are available in those
criteria that they're similarly priced
as this but of course with a high
resolution check out the asrock desk
mini GTX 4rx with incredible performance
and a tiny size supports MX M type B
graphics cards for awesome performance
and games and the triple m dot 2 slot
for super fast transfer speeds expect
rock-solid performance out of the desk
mini GTX 4 RX perfect for VR and more
all right so that's my experience with a
34 UC 89 G it's a fantastic gaming panel
and hits all the right points for that
criteria but unless you're exclusively
using this for games then the resolution
is a bit of a letdown for such a new
release and the price difference between
g-sync and freesync of this exact same
monitors whoa it's good to be on team
red right now of course if you can find
the cards so that's it thanks so much
