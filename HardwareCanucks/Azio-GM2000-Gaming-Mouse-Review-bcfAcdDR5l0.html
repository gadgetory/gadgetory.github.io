comes to gaming mice we do get the wide
variety of options to choose from many
of which incorporate different lighting
options adjustable design both on
economics and software but of course
this usually means higher prices so
we're checking out a wallet-friendly
alternative from azo the GM 2000 now
we've come to expect less features on
more affordable products but how does it
hold its true purpose and gaming well
let's find out so starting off with the
size and shape I would say this is a
more suited for smaller hands partially
because the mouse is super light and
because of its small size there isn't
much palm support for those of you cloth
type gamers this will work well and also
quite comfortable but for palm time grip
and large hands it does not feel natural
now notice the mouse is symmetrical
unfortunately only available for
right-handed users it would be awesome
to have another set of buttons on the
right side to cover left-handed users
now the mouse exterior is covered in
rubberized surface although we do get
these shiny bits on the top and on the
sides then they're quite slippery and
don't really help with a secure grip the
build quality is not fantastic it is
made entirely of light plastic so you do
get what you pay for so this is a 5
button Mouse a pretty standard with your
left and right click the scroll wheel
dpi change button and your browser
buttons on the side the scroll wheel
does provide feedback and is textured
the DPI button is quick to access and we
have three dpi settings that are
programmed in and cannot be changed now
there's no software or drivers for the
spouse
it's just plug and play
so the three dpi settings include 800
1600 and 2000 dpi which is the maximum
after all it is in the name now on the
one hand this is a good range I
personally never go above 2,000 even
when gaming but there are many who
prefer any more sensitive Mouse for FPS
titles and like to configure their own
dpi settings so the lack of software may
be a deal-breaker for many and the
brightness of the LED in front the DPI
Change button indicates with dpi setting
here using now on the topic of lighting
the GM mm does achieve this gaming look
both of the sides are lit along with the
logo at the back the color cannot be
changed unfortunately neither can it be
turned off but that shouldn't be an
issue unless you're concerned about
matching colors of all you gaining gear
now if you look at the bottom you can
see the rear of the mouse is a lot wider
it's sort of shaped like a pear and it
says most pressure comes to the front of
the mouse because of your left and right
click combining this mouse with a softer
mouse pad might give you a little
trouble and testing this mouse with
multiple different surfaces I found that
works best on harder surfaces simply
because the mouse would tilt forward on
softer surface and completely disturb
your movement and I think there's a
major flaw and Asia should have just
widen the front just a little bit to
keep the mouse a bit more stable now in
the harder surfaces the mouse does not
sync and it works really well now
another issue of found was with the
browser buttons the back button wasn't
always recognized even though it clicked
and applying a bit more pressure seemed
to solve the problem now it comes to
gaming the mouse performed pretty well
my only issue is that you can't be very
precise with your aim because the mouse
is so light so when it comes to really
narrowing down your sights you might
have trouble getting that right hit now
after doing a bit of gaming I really
wish there would be an even lower dpi
setting as 800 dpi seemed a bit too
sensitive due to its light weight so
compensating with lower dpi setting
would be more ideal so overall this a
decent budget alternative
for a gaming mouse we do get on a fly
dpi change and the settings are
configured pretty the side buttons are
appropriately sized and are in
comfortable to reach spot and the mouse
offers great support for cloth type
gamers with smaller hands now we
understand this a budget product and
we're not asking for accessory pouches
nor fancy software but sensor tracking
is crucial and I was a little
disappointed with it
I really wish there was a lower dpi
setting to compensate for its light
weight for palm type grip you don't get
much real estate to rest your hands so
you might look elsewhere now the lack of
software may be a deal-breaker
as you really can't adjust to your
optimal settings and there are a lot of
mice at this price range that come with
that feature also the size of the mouse
are glossy and do not help with the
secure grip
so although the GM mm gives us the
basics when it comes to gaming and
perhaps that is all you need it does
have a specific ergonomic design that
might not appeal to palm grippers but it
certainly should be a consideration for
claw type gamers on the budget so thanks
guys for watching and we'll see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
