comes to gaming mice we do get the wide
variety of options to choose from many
of which incorporate different lighting
options adjustable design both on
economics and software but of course
this usually means high prices so we're
checking out a wallet-friendly
alternative from AZ oh the GM 2000 now
we've come to expect less features on
more affordable products but how does it
hold its true purpose and gaming well
let's find out so starting off with the
size and shape I would say this is a
more suited for smaller hands partially
because the mouse is super light and
because of its small size there isn't
much palm support for those of you claw
type gamers this will work well and also
quite comfortable but for palm time grip
and large hands it does not feel natural
now notice the mouse is symmetrical
unfortunately only available for
right-handed users it would be awesome
to have another set of buttons on the
right side to cover left-handed users
now the mouse exterior is covered in
rubberized surface although we do get
these shiny bits on the top and on the
sides then they're quite slippery and
don't really help with a secure grip the
build quality is not fantastic it is
made entirely of light plastic so you do
get what you pay for so this is a 5
button mouse are pretty standard with
your left and right click the scroll
wheel dpi change button and your browser
buttons on the side the scroll wheel
does provide feedback and this texture
the DPI button is quick to access and we
have three DPI settings that are
programmed in and cannot be changed now
there's no software or drivers for the
spouse it's just plugging play
so the three DPI settings include 816
hundred and two thousand DPI which is
the maximum after all it is in the name
now on the one hand this is a good range
I personally never go above 2,000 even
when gaming but there are many who
prefer any more sensitive mouse for FPS
titles and like to configure their own
DPI settings so the lack of software may
be a deal-breaker for many and the
brightness of the LED in front of the
DPI Change button indicates with DPI
setting here using now on the topic of
lighting the GM 2000 does achieve this
gaming look both of the sides are lit
along with the logo at the back the
color cannot be changed unfortunately
neither can it be turned off but that
shouldn't be an issue unless you're
concerned about matching colors of all
you gaining gear now if you look at the
bottom you can see the rear of the mouse
is a lot wider and sort of shaped like a
pear and then since most pressure comes
to the front of the mouse because of
your left and right click combining this
mouse with a softer mousepad might give
you a little trouble and testing this
mouse with multiple different surfaces I
found that works best on harder surfaces
simply because the mouse would tilt
forward on softer surface and completely
disturb your movement and I think
there's a major flaw and Asian should
have just widen the front just a little
bit to keep the mouse a bit more stable
now in the harder surfaces the mouse
does not sink and it works really well
now another issue of found was with the
browser buttons the back button wasn't
always recognized even though it clicked
and applying a bit more pressure seemed
to solve the problem now it comes to
gaming the mouse / formed pretty well my
only issue is that you can't be very
precise with your aim because the mouse
is so light so when it comes to really
narrowing down your sights you might
have trouble getting that right hit now
after doing a bit of gaming I really
wish there would be an even lower DPI
setting as 800 DPI seemed a bit too
sensitive due to its lightweight so
compensating with lower DPI setting
would be more and deal so overall this
is a decent budget alternative
for a gaming mouse we do get on a flight
dpi change and the settings are
configured pretty the side buttons are
appropriately sized and are in
comfortable to reach spot and the mouse
offers great support for clock up gamers
with smaller hands now we understand
this a budget product and we're not
asking for accessory pouches nor fancy
software but sensor tracking is crucial
and I was a little disappointed with it
I really wish there was a lower dpi
setting to compensate for its light
weight for palm type grip you don't get
much real estate to rest your hand so
you might look elsewhere now the lack of
software may be a deal-breaker as you
really can't adjust to your optimal
settings and there are a lot of mice at
this price range that come with that
feature also the size of the mouse are
glossy and do not help with a secure
grip so all know the GM 2000 gives us
the basics when it comes to gaming and
perhaps that is all you need it does
have a specific ergonomic design that
might not appeal to palm grippers but it
certainly should be a consideration for
claw type gamers on the budget so thanks
guys for watching they will see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
