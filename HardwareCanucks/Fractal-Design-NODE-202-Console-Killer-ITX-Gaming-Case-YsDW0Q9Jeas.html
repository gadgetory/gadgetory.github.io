hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Hardware
Canucks and it seems that everyone was
really intrigued by the fractal design
no 202 case showcased at Computex so
it's finally in-house and I gotta say
that I'm happy to see more slim ATX
cases like this on the market that would
suit an elegant and simple gaming build
for the living room
priced at $79 for the case only and $139
for the bundled 450 watt integra sfx
power supply you are looking at a
competitive price point considering the
closest case to this one is the RB 0 1
from silverstone at $85 and having the
extra power supply option is appreciated
to get you started
size wise this is a slim design here it
is next to the defined s and if you have
been considering an ITX build I would
certainly gravitate towards this type of
ITX tower
there's just something intriguing about
knowing the limitations of the case and
building an exact machine the case is
designed for there are two blackout USB
3 ports at the front along with audio
jacks and illuminated power button the
logo is very much muted and imprinted
with white so when in the vertical
position it looks a little bit out of
place and feels more natural when the
case is laying flat the plastic support
base is fine it's stable enough and the
rubber feet at the bottom prevent it
from scratching anything and also
sliding around with a set of adhesive
feet and included for application of
horizontal orientation and I would
recommend applying them regardless as
you'll need to lay the keys flat during
assembly anyway and I've scratched my
table without the rubber feet so
something to keep in mind the note 202
is ventilated where needed large opening
a found on both side panels and on the
thinnest portions of the chassis to let
hot air escape regardless of orientation
take a look at the back there is our
motherboard IO and 2 PCI slots along
with the power input and to get started
we first need to remove the four screws
from the bottom of the case that allows
us to remove the main cover that has a
fine mesh dust filter positioned right
above the CPU area further we need to
remove the
so chassis frame from the bottom cover
and it's a simple process of just
attaching a few clips and pulling the
frame off where we further find two more
dust filters that are also fine mesh and
magnetic the larger one is for the GPU
chamber and the little one is for the
power supply and I'm glad that these are
present but just keep in mind the
process of disassembly to get access to
these filters and so the note 202 is
cleverly constructed of these three main
parts that would allow users to assemble
their system in the main frame that is
open from on the sides and only then put
the bottom and top covers back on take a
look inside we have a clear chamber
separation between the motherboard and
the power supply in the bottom chamber
with CPU coolers up to 56 millimeters in
height supported the tiny drive gauge in
the middle and the GPU chamber at the
very top we receive the case here with a
power supply and unfortunately despite
the braided cables that colorful mess
will be unpleasant to deal with and
while there is no windowed version for
the note 202 it still be nice to have
all black cables the GPU chamber has
that dust filter that we saw earlier and
because of the extra space
two-and-a-half slot graphics cards are
supported up to 31 centimeters in length
there's also an angled support bracket
that has some vertical mobility to
accommodate for different sized GPUs it
is attached via these screws so it's not
a tools design unfortunately but this
chamber can support dual 120mm fans to
help with additional cooling for the GPU
as long as the graphics card is 35
millimeters in width or shorter you
could also use slim 10 millimeter fans
for thicker graphics cards compatibility
one thing to keep in mind is you'll need
to remove the GPU support bracket if
populating both fans and I would
recommend you keep the bracket in place
to eliminate the tension of the GPU when
the case is in the vertical position the
drive cage here is removable with a
single screw and the note 202 can only
house a couple of two and a half inch
drives and I would have liked to see a
spot available for
three and a half inch drive somewhere
but that is something you have to work
around and beginning our assembly
process the wiring was just not pleasant
at all just because you are dealing with
such a confined space and even though
there are K bowtie Hoops available
around the motherboard tray they're just
really thin and it's really difficult to
actually use them the cable lengths of
the power supply is perfect they're
short cables but after everything was
wired there is so much room and found
the power supply that was under utilized
and felt wasted perhaps could fit
another SSD in there
in case you need more storage next we
needed to remove the PCI frame to
install the riser card and this is what
it looks like with the GPU installed and
finally lowering in this assembly into
the motherboard and connecting it to the
power supply and so first I was really
surprised at how much room there is left
on the side of the GPU and this space
allows the cables to remain out of the
way and you can definitely fit a set of
fans in there if you're worried about
GPU temperatures one design element that
I really appreciate is the magnetic dust
filter and the removable bottom cover so
you can access all the cables on this
side of the GPU and in case there's any
interference with any of the cables with
any of the fans you can go in and make
sure that everything is tucked away
properly and here are the internals of a
finished system I did my best with the
cables and I'm pretty happy with how it
turned out the best design element of
the Interior is this chamber separation
and in case need to replace any of the
hardware you don't need to disassemble
any of the other parts in your build and
also check out just how much height
clearance we have available above the
GPU so taller than reference designs
should fit here no problem and the final
piece of the assembly process is
mounting the frame onto the bottom cover
and then closing the top piece for this
discreet looking but pretty capable
gaming machine I don't particularly like
how it looks when lying down reminds me
too much of a VCR and I would personally
make sure it's standing upright for my
own showcase but I was disappointed to
realize that there's no
dust filter in the top ventilation when
it's in this position and they put allow
dust particles to just settle through
and if fractal design could just include
the same magnetic dust filter that is
found on the sides I would be more
comfortable with the this type of
orientation long term and so this is it
the note 202 delivers on practically
everything we wanted to see for an ITX
chassis you have to keep in mind all the
limitations for hardware and things with
clearance and I think the space
efficiency could be a tab better like
letting us mount a three and a half inch
drive on the spot of that 120mm fan
mount in the GPU chamber and this would
grant us better acceptance for an HT PC
and now thinking about it I would prefer
to not have that logo at the front at
all as it ruins this orientation option
for me even though it's kind of a minor
thing at $79 you are looking at an
attractive ITX slim tower at only ten
point two liters with plenty of powerful
Hardware potential and we're giving it
the Harvick Knox damn good award so this
concludes our review of the note 2 or 2
thank you so much for watching and let
us know if the case interests you for
your next build and which orientation do
you prefer for this type of case leave
