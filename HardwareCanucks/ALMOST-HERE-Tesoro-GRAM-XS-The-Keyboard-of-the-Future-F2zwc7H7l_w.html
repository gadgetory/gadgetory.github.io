live from Lakshmi what's up guys I'm
Dmitry with Haruka Knox and we're back
again with a low profile Tesoro keyboard
now this one's been around for on the
horizon for like a year so exactly last
year at CES everyone went crazy for
their integration of a low profile
mechanical switch in this very beautiful
low-profile body at Computex we saw it
was like halfway done and now we finally
have the keyboard this is still a
handmade sample but full details on what
this thing is about are in our hands so
let's talk about that but first huge
thank you to our sponsors fantex Corsair
and Coolermaster for making this C as
possible so the model name is finally
revealed this is the gram excess excess
stands for extra small as you can see
it's a very low-profile keyboard low
profile flat key caps and when you press
them they kind of like submerge entirely
into the frame and they look create
quite cool and obviously the white frame
makes the color and the lighting pop I
absolutely love what the Sora is doing
in terms of the color customization when
their keyboards they look absolutely
beautiful
a lot of you may be thinking about a tkl
version and perhaps you want to take a
little before a full-size board by the
way if you want to see my video on how
to utilize the full-size board and why
it's superior check it out over here but
we are told that tkl is on the horizon
and bluetooth is also kind of in the
works so I'm really this that'll be a
fantastic way to see tkl version
Wireless mechanical and this switch I'm
don't know exactly how much power it
requires but and they're talking about
having this switch on a wireless body
then that's a good sign
obviously everyone's gonna be excited to
hear about the actual shipping date
global shipping date will be end of
January so that's awesome but you're
gonna have to pay quite the price for
this one it's gonna be priced at $149
which is quite expensive I would say
because for this new switch design and
low profile body not many companies do
that and therefore you
a niche thing but put to put it in
perspective there Graham se spectrum
which is the you know the the slight
deep which uses the optical switches and
slightly more thicker body of course it
so goes for $119 so there is a quite
chunky price premium to pay for
something that is this thin so now let's
talk about the low profile switches so a
cool little timid is that they don't
have the name for the switch yet so it
would be a cool opportunity to get this
engagement going so if you have any
ideas on what you'd like to switch to be
called leave them in the comments below
it will come in two variants red and
blue red being the linear switch and
blue being the clicky type with the
little actuation point the clicky
tactile point the specification so the
actual actuation distance is 1.1
millimeters on both red and blue the
actuation force so this is pretty
interesting it's gonna be 40 grams on
the blue and 45 grams on the red so the
blue switch is a bit lighter
apparently I'm guessing it's to provide
that nice tactile feedback so the keys
don't feel too heavy and especially
because we have only three millimeters
of travel distance I'm guessing it would
be better to have a lighter tactile
switch then a heavier tactile switch on
such a you know low key so the key caps
are utilizing the floating chiclet style
so in naturally they have more likely
ninis and wobble but in the final
production model they are trying to
secure it so the key cap is quite stiff
and doesn't wobble too much when you
type on it and one the biggest changes
they're also rolling out is the software
which utilizes a totally new UI which is
clean and it's not that really weird
gamer II crap that we've seen in the
past so in this way it'd be like their
hub for all their peripherals so you can
customize perky lighting you know save
different profiles do macro
customization and yeah the UI as we've
seen it is much better than before and
that's for the keyboard itself we have
an key role over a six key role over you
can lock the keyboard you can adjust the
brightness you can record macros
on-the-fly you can disable the Windows
key we have three profiles on the
keyboard so you don't have to require to
redownload the software to access your
saved settings
crows or lighting and we have meeting
controls in the top F geese and so
obviously there's big demand for a slim
mechanical type of keyboard and from my
experience of typing on it it's nice but
the bottoming out feels a little too
harsh I wish that it was a bit squishier
I'm you very used to the you know the
contact point on my macbook pro or like
the really fast rebounds on some other
notebooks so this one is kind of
in-between the rebalance point is not as
sharp and I feel like he actually
bottoming out effect is a little too
harsh so what do you guys think about
the Graham XS let us know in the
comments below from my point of view I'm
really looking forward to that
Bluetooth tkl version because I think
that would be really just a knock out of
a keyboard for anyone who's looking for
something slim and looks beautiful
obviously because the RGB and white
frame now in terms of the actual
thickness they've made it a bit thicker
than the original because they've added
a steel plate at the top and yeah it
looks actually fine obviously the cable
is removable
it is braided so you can maneuver that
any way you please and yeah that's the
Graham XS and one more cool product from
Tesoro is coming out from this is the
Graham tkl so it's basically just a TTL
version of the Graham keyboard which is
the full-size
it's utilizing the same where these
switches called their the low-profile
agile switches that come in red and blue
and that's got that low-profile key cap
and it's tkl it's gonna be $99 and it's
gonna be shipping sometime in March
alright guys so that's it for the store
here let us know what you think of this
final release of this long-awaited
product and if you're satisfied with it
I was actually hoping for a slightly
slimmer body I wasn't expecting to be
you know the final production to be that
thick but because they added a steel
plate and I'm guessing it needed some
extra room for the switch yeah I'm okay
with it but let us know what you think
thanks for watching we'll see you in the
next CSV do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
