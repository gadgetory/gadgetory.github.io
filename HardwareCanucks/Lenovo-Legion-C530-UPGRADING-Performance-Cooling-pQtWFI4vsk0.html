a bit of a confession to make
simply put I love stacking my CPU
coolers so here's my be quiet selection
with a dark rock pro 3 out this is for
my rising system I have the h7 and now
we have a little extra delivery from
knock tour that will satisfy that
obsession with stacking things but we'll
use these for something a bit more
important so if you guys recall this is
the legion c 530 a nice portable gaming
station you can check out that video
right over here but the cool thing about
this whole system is that you can
upgrade anything without voiding your
warranty now many of you are probably
wondering why I'm going through this
procedure in the first place you'd buy
pre-built PC and then you want to
upgrade those components but the whole
idea is to showcase that you can upgrade
things so if you have the system for a
year and a half two years and want to
upgrade something down the line it is a
possibility I've had the system for six
months now and upgrading your fans and
you know the GPU doesn't sound like a
bad idea and the overall purpose with
this upgrade is to see how much quieter
I can get a system to run by having a
larger CPU cooler so maybe reducing the
rpm on that fan and also replacing those
stock fans with something of quality to
knock to a 81 motor for the back and 292
motors for the front potentially also
reducing the RPM of those and seeing how
much cooler and quieter I can get my
system to be now based on a Twitter poll
we ran you guys wanted us to upgrade
everything and I will except for the
power supply so I am replacing the
entire cooling system I'm adding dual
channel RAM and also taking out the gtx
1050 ti4 gigabyte version and replacing
it with a much more powerful gtx 1066
gig version and you can pick up these
cards for round $280 brand new or around
200 if you're buying used and the
additional money invested into this
system will make a huge difference in
gaming performance all right let's do
the upgrade right for this so you're
saying this is the most colorful way to
cool I'm telling you the master liquid
ml 360 our RGB is the way to go cooler
masters new 360 millimeter all in one
liquid cooler is all about performance
in style with the custom low resistance
radiator and dual chamber pump with
sleeve tubing for that premium look
while being totally flat
the fan strike a balance for air
pressure and airflow with transparent
blades to perfectly match the colorful
combination of the pump that you can
sync via its own controller or through
various addressable and 12-volt RGB
connectors alright perhaps you should
check it out in the scription below
alright so I have all my components
ready let's begin the teardown alright
so here's the deal the entire procedure
went pretty smooth and I'm surprised
that there were no you know hidden
little nooks for the panels like all the
the back panel the front panel just
removed with ease fans are not attached
with any proprietary things and I still
wish that they would release the case
individually now internally we have
pretty limited height for the CPU tower
clearance less than a hundred
millimeters until we hit the side panel
which is why I opted for the l9 x 65
it's a pretty beefy heatsink with nice
low-profile fan at only 65 millimeters
with the fan in height which is awesome
fits inside there no problem and the
noise levels and the cooling capacity
throughout this whole upgrade are pretty
impressive now since my priority was to
reduce the noise level of the system
because the default fans were quite loud
yeah check this out I'm so impressed at
how much quieter the system now is both
at idle and load situations that you
know the system is currently running
behind me it is an idle but it's almost
sounding identical in load situations
but it is super quiet and that makes me
happy a slight hum is there and kind of
like approaching the max Q territory for
that 40 DB a noise floor awesome as for
temperatures the CPU at load was running
only 3 degrees Celsius cooler versus the
default fan configure
so that Delta is not really significant
you're not gaining anything performance
because the cpu all six cores running at
three point four gigahertz and the thing
is I cannot control the RPM of the fans
there is no control in BIOS there's no
utility software for this Legion PC so I
kind of have to let the motherboard do
its thing
the CPU fan was running almost at 100%
while the front fans running at 1600 rpm
while they're rated at 2,000 fans and
the back fan is a bit slow at 600 rpm
and that little fan is rated for 2200
rpm so you could squeeze a bit more
cooling out of this case and these fans
but the motherboard doesn't allow it
luckily we're not sacrificing on cooling
and noise levels it's just that we have
a lot more rpm potential built into here
than what we're capable of achieving
with this motherboard the GTX 1060 ran
much harder but that is by design the
1050 T is are much cooler GPUs and also
I've removed the shroud so that might
have something to do with it but the
blower style form factor here is
important because it can exhaust the hot
air from the GPU outside of the case
which is important for such a small form
factor
now as for gaming performance obviously
the GTX 960 is a massive upgrade over
1050 TI and FPS so at 1080p at high
settings we're looking about 21%
increase on quite champions in csgo
over 60% in overwatch and far cry 5 and
the crazy improvement in witcher 3 at
the hundred and thirteen percent as for
1440p we're seeing the same result so
only a 14% increase with csgo 35% in
quake champions
you know witcher 3 is over 100% again
which is awesome and over watching far
cry 5 are crazy in there like high 60
percentage improvement in fps now
performance aside I really appreciate
the entire user experience you know it's
almost like making a case review and
building it's something that is designed
to be like a standalone enclosure you
populate all your components in it terms
of like accessing your your Hardware
removing the side panels actually
removing the motherboard so I can access
the backplate for the CPU cooler
and you didn't feel like any different
it almost doesn't feel like a prebuilt
system it almost feels like me upgrading
something that I've built in the past
and of course that is important for
potential see 5:30 and c7 to the owners
who might upgrade some hardware down the
line and have that peace of mind and not
be locked down to this like some sort of
proprietary interior design and of
course the warranty carries over to all
the original components which is awesome
so now the GTX stands 50 TI is out of
there but yet I still have warranty for
it which is great and so if you do get
that base configuration for 850 bucks
with a gtx 750ti
you have a lot more performance that you
can squeeze into this system down the
line by upgrading the GPU to gtx 1060
maybe or 1070 because we have an 8 pin
PCI connector for the power supply here
so pretty happy with the performance
increase and now I can potentially sell
the 1050 t I do you know counteract that
price difference between what I would
spend on that additional GPU I also put
a dual channel memory in here instead of
the single dim 16 gigabyte kid on the
default configuration but it's kind of
wasteful because in the BIOS I cannot
overclock the CPU nor the Bram so this
Ram is rated for 3,200 megahertz but
it's running the default 2666 megahertz
so I'm losing a little bit of
performance tears so I wouldn't upgrade
the memory because you cannot overclock
it and I'm pretty happy with this
blanket upgrade replacing all the
cooling and the GPU for a lot more power
and games and runs so quiet than the
default configuration which would look
like over 54 DBA that was way too loud
versus now that is what I'm happy with
treat your ears with the incredibly
comfortable
HD 5/8 X Jubilee headphones from mass
drop and some Heiser delivering sound
expected from $500 headphones but only
for a hundred 50 bucks
making it one of the best price to
