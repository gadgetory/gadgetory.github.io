going on everybody
Aiden here with Hardwick Canucks and
great sound usually comes at a high
price
if you're putting down a boatload of
cash you're gonna want more than just
audio bliss these days buyers of
leading-edge headphones want not only
that great sound but also class-leading
features now wireless connectivity has
been storming the market however this
connectivity comes at a high price so
let's look at V Motors attempt at
bringing a high-end set of cancer that
off of cordless operation with the
crossfade Wireless priced at $300 they
certainly aren't inexpensive but before
you pass judgment be aware these aren't
builders yet another knockoff product
out of China
other than the Bluetooth connectivity
the ability to use these in Wired mode
as well bean motor offers a long list of
options to ensure these headphones are
as unique as your tastes and I'll talk a
bit more about that later but with the
abundance of great headphones out there
can the v-moda crossfade wireless
standout to be sure there is a countless
number of wireless Bluetooth headphones
popping up on the market now
particularly due to apple's announcement
of cord cutting features with their
iPhone 7 however there are very few
brands that are willing to claim long
development cycles or an exacting
attention to sound quality whereas
v-moda has spent the better part of five
years tuning the crossfades design
v-moda has a good number of bonus
add-ons with these headphones - all from
the moment you order them on the website
you can customize the metal plates with
not only your choice of colors but you
can also upload your own logo
there's also color customization custom
laser engraving the option for
additional interchangeable ear cups and
many other things it's amazing to see
how much variety is being offered here
and that really says at the crossfade
part as you can see our sample has the
Hardwick Knox branding on a gunmetal
finish which I think looks great
within the awesome packaging you'll get
this well-built hardcase for carrying
the headphones and inside that you'll
find the included cable with mic as well
as a micro USB cable for charging
without a doubt this set excels in build
quality and you've got one of the
toughest constructions I've seen on a
pair of headphones with a combination of
tough plastic and metal which is
something you don't see often however
the combination of the heavier build and
integrated battery means these
headphones are moderately heavy at 290
grams and you'll certainly feel the
weight of these on your head comfort
isn't the crossfades strongest point
either the headband is flexible enough
without feeling constraining and the
pleather ear pad material isn't bad for
breathability but I personally have
issue with the shape and the clamping
force the ear pads aren't quite thick
enough for my ears which means the
drivers could be felt at times and the
diamond shape is a bit odd at first the
headphones clamped quite heavily which
is understandable since they need to
stay in place but I found that I would
get head fatigue from the amount of
force and it really made them less
comfortable than they otherwise could be
so let's figure out what the wireless
nature is worth now there's a couple of
key points to address here first of all
how the sound compares to Wired mode
versus Wireless how the battery life
lasts and also the overall value
proposition of the headphones one of the
best features in my opinion is the
ability to use the crossfades
in either wireless mode using bluetooth
or through the 3.5 millimeter jack which
also disables any of the electronic
internals when these are wired up being
pretty happy with the sound and you
probably will be - as long as you know
what you're getting into these have a
very mainstream focused sound signature
with a very noticeable v-shape which
means the highs and lows are heavily
focused rather than offering a truly
neutral sound space this is the beats by
dre formula so if you're looking for
flat and studio accurate sound you're
not gonna find it here however these do
the so-called beats sound better than
anything else I've heard the low end is
extremely powerful and very full while
still being fairly controlled although
it can get a little loose and a little
boomy at times
highs are still detailed although a bit
veiled and mids are a bit recessed for
my tastes you sacrifice clarity for this
sound style but overall it's a very fun
sound signature and for heavy electronic
or rap is
is an excellent set of cans if you're an
audio enthusiasts who values clarity or
a neutral sound signature or a more a
fan of classical music this might not
appeal to you as much when switching
over to wireless you'll still get most
of what's great about these headphones
but there are a few downsides the first
issue is when powered on there's an
audible background hiss it's not a huge
issue when you've got media playing but
it's certainly annoying when everything
is quiet and I was hoping this wouldn't
be an issue at the price point the other
downside is more understandable you will
notice some sound degradation over
Bluetooth with the current technology it
seems impossible to get perfect quality
over Bluetooth and somebody should
remind Apple of that however v-moda does
handle things pretty well all things
considered across the whole range of
sounds you'll probably notice a decrease
in audio fidelity but it's still
impressively similar to Wired operation
overall I also found there claimed a
range of about 30 feet to be pretty
accurate battery life has impressed me
as well
v-moda advertises an estimated 10 to 12
hours of play time and I've been able to
use these headphones very regularly
while only charging them occasionally
the battery life has been good enough
that I don't have to worry about
charging them and having the 3.5
millimeter option means you can always
just plug them in when they run out
there are three main options for
microphones with the crossfade Wireless
the first is the microphone built into
the headphones which is used for
bluetooth the second one is the mic
built into the included cable and the
third is the $30 edition of the boom pro
microphone so this is the inbuilt sound
on the v-moda crossfade Wireless is
inbuilt mic running over Bluetooth into
audacity as you can hear it's pretty
average sound quality it'll get you by
for a quick phone call but I wouldn't
want to be using it much more than that
now let's check out the inbuilt inline
microphone okay so now we're using the
inline reverse microphone so as you can
hear it's definitely a step up from the
inbuilt microphone in the headphones but
it's still pretty crummy audio quality
really it sounds a bit nasally and
overall it's also quiet at times I would
avoid it if possible but it will be
alright for some calls and just bits and
bobs
now let's switch over the boom pro
microphone so the $30 boom for a
microphone sounds pretty decent my voice
is still a little nasally but it's a lot
more filled out than the previous two a
lot clearer and there's only a bit of
distortion
it's not going to match up against
something a lot more expensive but at 30
dollars it's pretty versatile and with
inline controls here it's pretty good
and nice flexibility of the microphone
at 30 dollars this is a solid little
microphone which is a great affordable
accompaniment fit across spades
or really any other headset if the mod
mic is a little out of your price range
bringing it back to the headphones I
really only have a couple of other
assorted nitpicks
things like the ports being on a weird
side with the 3.5 millimeter jack being
on the right words it's usually on the
left and other issues like not having
any way of monitoring the battery
percentage
besides low battery audio cues but these
are probably small things so is Wireless
worth $300 here in this case yes since
these headphones are already built on B
motifs and m100 headphones which were
already were received and they also were
almost $300 so you're not even paying
much more to get that Wireless nature
however you're still paying $300 for a
pair of headphones and with the wide
range of excellent cans at under half
the price it's hard to justify I think
that while Bluetooth functionality is
handy it's not worth paying the fifty
two hundred dollars more that many other
pairs are asking for if audio quality is
a necessity I counted as more of a bonus
feature alongside a very good set of
wired headphones so concluding on the
crossfade Wireless these are definitely
taking aim at the market occupied by dr.
Dre's beats line up there for the
average consumer who wants a
good-looking pair of headphones with a
base heavy sound signature as well as
that wireless functionality but they
still want to be able to run it in Wired
mode as well so they're not going to be
for everyone the feature set is
definitely unique but if you can afford
the price they're definitely good fear
