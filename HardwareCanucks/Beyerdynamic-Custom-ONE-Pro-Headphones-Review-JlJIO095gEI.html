great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry and welcome back
to another Hard Rock's review so
beyerdynamic is definitely in the audio
brand that you should recognize they
make premium headphones with comparable
quality to Sennheiser or sure so I'm
really excited to put these to the test
so these are the custom one Pro the name
is representative of the exchangeable
ear plates or about $20 for a pair so
you can print customizable logos and
they serve really no function but gain
you the bragging rights and aesthetic
customization the second feature behind
the name is the adjustable base response
but more on that later pricing on this
is actually quite competitive at 250
bucks considering they're made in
Germany and all the included features
but how do they sound for such a premium
price suspects wise we're looking at a
very low impedance headphone only at 16
ohms this means we have very low amount
of resistance on the electrical current
and thus they would be ideal for use on
portable players like your tablet
smartphone or an iPod they are plenty
sensitive though at 96 DB and have a
wide range of frequency response so one
of the unique features of the custom one
Pro is the adjustable base response and
bar dynamic actually includes a
frequency response graph to represent
what each of the four adjustments do and
I have to say being able to reduce the
bass for more flat sound or enhance it
for house music is very satisfying Auto
custom one Pro didn't exactly reach the
lows that are advertised the build
quality and the overall feel of the
headphone is very impressive with
aluminum and steel frame and some sturdy
plastic bits basically this is a German
product and it shows they're also quite
lightweight at 290 grams and very very
flexible and we also have a height
adjustment now sadly these are not
foldable which means they are not going
to be as portable so the headphones also
feature a removable audio cable with a
twist to lock function and a screw on
quarter of an inch
turn your questions are plenty soft and
provide nice noise isolation from the
surrounding environment and also make
sure there's no audio leaked the
headband is also comfortable and reveal
a light steel headband and the exposed
cable that passes through now on the one
hand I do like the look of this design
but it makes me question durability of
the product if you travel a lot now on a
pair of headphones where the cushions
the side plates and the main cable can
be replaced this might be a significant
design flaw as the headband cable isn't
replaceable now putting these headphones
on first of all they're very light and
the leather cushions are soft and the
driver is deep enough so regardless of
how hard your ears are they never make
contact with the internals but I do have
two main complaints now first the inside
of the ear cushion is perforated and the
spot where the two pieces are sort of
glued together a piece together isn't
smoothed out so I could definitely feel
that with my ears and honestly it was
irritating the second these headphones
don't allow your ears to breathe now
they are closed headphones but still
after an hour of use I had to take them
off to let my ears cool so moving on to
adjust the bass response each ear cup
has a slider they click once in either
of the four positions but since they
provide quite a bit resistance you can
set the slider for anywhere in between
to adjust exactly how much bass you
wanted for different types of music and
so finally let's talk on equality now I
have to admit this a very unique product
with a very reasonable function to
customize characteristics of your audio
directly from the headphones so I left
them to burn in overnight and have been
constantly using them for over a week
and upon putting them on I was both
impressed and very disappointed at the
same time now you don't have to play
around with the sliders to find the best
spot which complements your listening
style in the music genre for example
there's no need for bass enhancements
for classical or any vocal heavy tracks
but very much desirable for dubstep
house hip-hop and the ability to
seamlessly switch between these profiles
is a huge bonus and there's also a large
emphasis on quality of the bass on the
custom one Pro and actually quite liked
it on second and third
while it was deep and prominent without
distortion so you can still hear a clear
instrument differentiation the first and
fourth setting however were my least
favorite because for the first there was
no depth and sounded quite dull
while the bass-heavy profile get rid of
any soundstage
so based aside my main disappointment
with these cans was the hollow mids
regardless of the profile it felt like
the mid-tones were suppressed which also
contributed to a loss of clarity
particularly for vocals they weren't as
crisp as I'd hoped which is a major
letdown particularly for the price the
highs are well tuned and not too crisp
but the bottom line is the custom one
pro isn't an all-around headphone but
specifically designed for genres that
emphasize the bass and that would not
suffer from drowned mid-tones
so for classical or jazz these are big
No
the soundstage was all right for a
closed headphone and I love the depth of
the base for uplifting house and dubstep
and they did prove quite awesome for
Crysis 3 as well but I have to admit I
did miss nicely tuned mid-range which
mainly put my lovely HD 5 5/8 back on
for proper listening experience so as I
mentioned before the custom one Pro is a
unique pair of headphones with an
amazing build quality replaceable parts
like weight for extended period of use
and adjustable bass response that
delivered an enjoyable listening
experience for sums honors but they're
certainly not without this flaws like
the exposed overhead cable that could be
damaged over time slight irritation from
periphery ear cups and the lack of
proper mid-tones that doesn't fully
satisfy and I was honestly expecting
more given the price so thanks guys for
