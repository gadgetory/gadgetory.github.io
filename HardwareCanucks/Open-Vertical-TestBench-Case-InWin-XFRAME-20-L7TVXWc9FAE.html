work benches like that but here in wind
this is their signature chassis for
complex 2016 let's check it out if you
love what you see from the show Nvidia
fantex NCIX and msi made the show
possible
so with every show beat CES a Computex
we see a very unique piece of art in
their case format from in win and this
year is no different this is the X frame
2.0 for enthusiasts showcase it's a very
it's a very cool open workbench it's got
full aluminum thick construction the
main chassis frame can rotate and stay
vertically on an angle prepare to
showcase if we can point so you can also
lay it flat horizontally but man look at
that how beautiful that looks when it's
towering on an angle with all the
components showing I like it the feet
are massive here they span out almost
like a landing pad for a spaceship
they're solid and all the constructions
for holding the frame is built into it
very quality things there there's a
little locking mechanism so he doesn't
have to rotate you can unlock it so you
can either angle it or rotate it for
your desire for component selection we
have an angular power supply that is
included on all their signature cases so
this one is the 1065 watts and it's
slightly on an angle not sure if I if I
like that but there is there are dual
this is the brackets on the top slow-mo
D D we have triple 120mm and fan support
on the side of the motherboard and for
removable three and a half inch drive
brackets underneath the frame or behind
the frame depending on how you are place
it the test system they're showing here
looks absolutely awesome I really love
that they're able to build stuff into it
to showcase what the case is truly all
about it's a showcase piece so that you
can do a sexy system put it there
rotate it all around the way you want
and also lay it flat if you want that
but yeah this is the extreme 2.0 from n
win hope you guys enjoyed it is this the
type of thing that you would ever get
for your own PC let us know in the
comments down below and we tree with our
Canucks thanks much for watching it
