this to cart now all right Eber you

shipping free returns just in case plus
24/7 customer support all he will love

Eber and joy Wow
surface before
the surface pro 4 is unconventionally
functional now with a lighter magnesium
body larger display with smaller bezels
fantastic glass trackpad and an optional
fingerprint sensor for security the new
surface pen is awesome for notes or
artwork and with the right add-ons like
a mouse and keyboard I can replace my
laptop with this a few years ago we took
a look at this surface pro 3 from
Microsoft and given the damn good award
Microsoft did a fantastic job with that
tablet and it was a huge step up from
its predecessor the surface pro 2 in
terms of the size and the form factor so
I was super excited to get this while
the price point hasn't increased
significantly compared to the surface
pro 3 it is still within the sub $1,500
price range so well within the realm of
affordability for students and their
loved ones the model I have comes with a
6 gen Core i5 CPU 8 gigabytes of RAM and
a 256 gigabyte SSD while there are
plenty of hybrid convertible solutions
on the market from other brands the
surface pro 4 seems to be among the best
options here's why the screen is
gorgeous its native resolution is 27 36
by 1824 and Microsoft increased the
screen size from 12 to 12 point 3 inches
while also making the bezels thinner the
added a million pixels of resolution
compared to the surface pro 3 and I'll
admit the display is sharp beautiful to
watch content on and new angles are so
close to being perfect if you recall the
surface pro 3 had a Windows capacitive
button on the right-hand side of the
screen which has now been eliminated on
the pro 4 honestly this is a smart move
since I don't have to worry about
accidentally touching the button while
handling the device as a tablet the
magnesium alloy unibody design is not
that different from the surface pro 3
but I still appreciate the craftsmanship
that went into creating this device it's
built well it's lighter than its
predecessor and I wholeheartedly
consider this a premium device Microsoft
has the build quality angle nailed for
connectivity there's a mini display port
a USB 3.0 power aim and a headphone jack
if you wish to extend the ports for
additional connectivity Microsoft offers
a dedicated docking station for the
surface pro 4 now if you own the surface
pro 3
King Station microsoft offers a free
adapter that will offer forwards
compatibility there is also a hidden
microsd card slot behind the kickstand
for expandable storage which is always
welcome now something that completes the
whole surface experience is the surface
type cover it is an additional accessory
that does cost a bit of money but
without it the surface experience simply
feels incomplete as with all things the
keyboard has been upgraded over the pro
3 the keys are evenly spaced out and
there's a new scissor switch with
slightly longer travel distance and
sharper bounce back somehow even with
all these refinements Microsoft has
still found space for a white backlight
the trackpad is excellent - one of the
best ones I've ever used on a Windows
machine the surface area has increased
which in turn makes more room for finger
movement despite the slim chassis and
portable dimensions the battery life was
as expected for an all-in-one Windows
Device I was easily able to get through
a whole day with casual web browsing
watching content and listening to
Spotify if I was sitting in a classroom
or within abode room taking notes it
would have lasted longer even when
you're running out of juice the charger
is so small so you can easily tuck it
into your bag the kickstand is an
interesting addition since it is well
balanced but as with all tablet stands
it is well adapted for a desk
environment and it can also be used on
your lap as an X surface pro 3 owner
I really enjoyed using the surface pro 4
for writing scripts watching videos
movies and listening to music
there wasn't any difference here but the
changes I mentioned previous along with
the surface band that attaches
magnetically to the device and that's a
big deal for transportation gone are the
days what you have to cart around a
heavy notebook to do work speaking of
the surface pen Microsoft eliminated the
eraser button from the previous pen and
added a sensor at the rear end that
functions like an actual one the tips
are interchangeable and Microsoft offers
a pen tip kit that runs for 10 dollars
which this can be useful for artists
designers architects or anyone who needs
to take handwritten notes the
above-mentioned changes are incremental
but they do make a huge difference when
using this device from day to day
surface pro for functional beyond a
typical laptop
folks make sure to check out Microsoft
Store CA because school season is right
around the corner and you can benefit
from things like free shipping 10% off
for students first party customer
service etc I also have a surprise for
our Canadian viewers

tight cover just follow the gleam link
