Canucks right now where the cooler
master suite where a lot of products are
shown over 30 lunches here are you
kidding me but a lot of conceptual
products launches as well on my left is
this gigantic case which is used by a
cooler master engineers to see what
works see what doesn't they're really
trying to target that modular aspect and
they are taking those concepts and
eventually they move on over to this
line behind me a broken ox is at another
fantastic Computex show all thanks to
Nvidia fantex NCIX
and MSI the master case maker 7 is that
case right there it's pretty awesome
again it's a conceptual presentation of
what is available
lots of modular aspects where with
rotatable motherboard we can actually
assemble the motherboard tray so that
law if you're using an ITX micro ATX or
an ATX whatever everything will be
compatible but the new case that will
actually be released is the master case
3 the master case 3 is a $99 product it
is targeting the micro ATX market which
is quite nice it's a little bit smaller
than the maker 5 but not by much and the
$99 price point includes the top
radiator bracket it has a side panel
window it has additional extra panels
for silence and unfortunately only one
SSD location in the back there are a few
implementations and improvements they're
rolling out with this case like a
removable floor for the power supply
chamber so if you want to expand the
interior you can do that no problem and
we also have a modular import rail which
is where you install or the hard drives
that can be placed in two positions
either to hide some cables or for actual
functionality with installation of
drives onto it these two upgrades will
be rolled out into the mastercase 5
eventually at Computex 2017 for the
mastercase 5 the maker 5 also receives a
new edition the maker 5 T G stands for
well they said turbo mode which
basically transforms the case into a
little bit more a turrible looking thing
with a handle so that's a board from the
trooper or the striker
and a new dual tone on the inside which
looks fantastic I love the dark red and
people will also be able to upgrade the
handle by the handle separately and put
it on
master maker 5 they also introduced a
new series the master box series the
master box 5 is behind me they're
telling us that the master box 3 and
potentially 7 in the pipeline which is a
little more standard and more simple
version variation has less features than
the master cases series but it's going
to be targeted the $79 or $69 price
point and up and also have this the
master box 5t again the turbo case with
low panels here and a little more
aggressive look to new cooler products
that I found interesting was the new fan
design so it's it has a memory of
maximum rpm that it has to maintain so
if a fan is placed against you know a
solid surface on the standard fan it
would slow down because there is a you
know resistance on there but for this
one it's supposed to maintain the
maximum rpm which you can actually
change so that's awesome if you want to
maintain a certain sound level and the
second product is this guy still
announced still in production it's
combining the technologies from the
master liquid pro and their airflow
series so this is very interesting
because it has sort of water cooling and
air flow elements built in it's fairly
compact perhaps going to be called the
master hybrid liquid or something like
that mounts like this and right now the
fans are facing each other so don't get
confused about blowing air blowing into
the same spot the cool thing is because
it can rotate it can either stand like
this for airflow going in this standard
direction I would say this is perfect
probably for HTTP cs4 something small
where you can still achieve better
cooling performance versus at 120 aao
but in a sort of I would say smaller
compact footprint especially when this
is above the motherboard that is it for
the cooler master booth I'm really
looking forward to reviewing the master
case 3 looks like a promising enclosure
lots of improvements going on can't wait
for those improvements to move on to the
mastercase 5 let us know what you think
about the process we talked about today
I'm going to be true with how our
conducts we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
