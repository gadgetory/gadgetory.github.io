to you by NCI XCOM technology connect
now we're here with Scott behind the
wall behind the secret wall where they
have this really awesome demos going on
so this is the Orpheus this was released
in 1991 this was a very limited edition
headphone in the place so not a
headphone this was a full audiophile set
so it came with a headphone tube
amplifier and a lot of other things so
they sold they made just over 300 units
back in 1991 selling for 17,000 per unit
and now we are we actually have a chance
to take a listen to them and actually
experience what it's like to own such a
such an amazing thing so Scott tell us a
little bit more about this how was it so
special and what type of value does this
type of said carry today after how many
years over over 20 years 22 years yeah
yeah just over 20 years old still Harold
as the benchmark of audiophile
headphones systems so as you said it's a
tube pre amplifier for an electrostatic
set of headphones so back in 91 the
Sennheiser family had said sparing no
expense make the best sounding headphone
possible that's why there was only a
limited number of just around 300 units
sold and why they carried such a high
price tag especially in the US was
around $17,000 and today you know people
who are selling them through venues like
eBay or anything like that online can
pretty much ask for about twenty five
thirty thousand dollars in resale value
now so and and it's something that is
highly highly sought after through the
audiophile community in the US or
globally even its you know looking at
the forums and things you see there's
always talk and it's always mentioned as
when we talk of the best of the best you
can't talk about it without mentioning
the Orpheus within the same breath or
not so and that's something that's
always been important to the Sennheiser
legacy and will continue to be that way
I think for the foreseeable future and
we want to show this to you guys because
it shows that Sennheiser is you know you
guys are true
audiofile you know about audio and the
fact that this headphone and this whole
system I mean can maintain such a high
value over 20 years showcases that you
know when we take a look at these gaming
headphones gaming headsets you know
sanitizer has the history behind that so
I do sort of vouch for for you guys as a
gaming company as a sort of your gaming
brand as well so that that is an amazing
Orpheus system so guys this concludes
