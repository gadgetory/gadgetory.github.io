year's when it comes to computer
components back then both Intel and AMD
were showing off some competing
platforms with Rison and sky like X
which meant there were a bunch of new X
370 be 350 and X 299 motherboards to
cover even at Computex we ended up
seeing the brand new thread Ripper X 399
boards which was awesome but at CES 2018
there wasn't a new platform to show off
to the public even though there were
some small glimpses of X 470 which will
end up launching in April we'll have
coverage of that shortly so stay tuned
for that the only new boards we found
we're from asrock and they're still
pretty cool for all the people who have
been asking for more micro ATX options
in this case both the ultra high-end X
399 and X 299 platforms are being given
the m80 x treatment with motherboards
that were originally a proof-of-concept
but now we're actually going to be able
to see them at retail stores but before
we get to that I want to give a huge
shout out to fantex Corsair and
Coolermaster for sponsoring our CES 2018
coverage without them this just would
not have been possible the first new
board I wanted to talk about is this the
asrock x3 99m Taichi which is actually
the world's first m ATX motherboard it
actually looks a bit funny because that
massive tr4 socket takes up so much of
the available space but even with that
as rock has still found space for a ton
of features and the necessary quad
channel memory set up actually I found
myself really wanting this thing for an
upcoming thread dipper build so what do
you guys think should we attempt a
compact x3 iodine build let us know
anyways what this board offers is
nothing short of incredible from a
storage standpoint there's a u2
connector 3 ultra and two slots at
support and Ymir 8 setups and 8 SATA 6
gigabits per second connectors for
enthusiasts as rack has included onboard
power and reset buttons USB 3.1 gen2
connectivity and RGB header and 3x 16
PCI slots if you want to install 3 dual
card slots there may be some clearance
issues with the bottom onboard
connectors but other than that it's hard
to see any flaws with this design as
Erick has not only ensured its support
16 core threadable processors without a
problem but the impressive lemon phase
pwm with its dr. Maas design means
overclocking is possible as well now
moving on from thread repair to the
upcoming x2 99 Skellig X platform and
I'm thinking this motherboard could be
even more impressive than the X
$3.99 and Taichi this is the ass rock x2
99m extreme 4 and wow guys it looks
great but unlike the other one I talked
about this isn't the first ma T X X 299
that award goes through msi and expect
us to do a build with that really soon
what Azeroth claims is that the extreme
4 is actually the best micro-atx extra
nany my motherboard around and looking
at the specifications that isn't too
hard to believe it has 11 phase power
design and a massive vrm heatsink which
allows for native support for the 18
course colleague X processors but while
the board does support overclocking it
will be limited on higher wattage CPUs
like the i9 79 80 Hz that's
understandable since Intel's highest and
consumer CPU can draw an insane amount
of power when overclocked other than old
honking the x2 99m extreme 4 has dual
intel Gigabit LAN USB 3.1 gen2 type a
and type C ports and two ultra m2 slots
one of which is able to support up to a
type 22 1 1 0 to nvme SSDs unlike the X
3 9 and M taichi what it can't do is
support more than two graphics cards at
full speed and it also doesn't have an
onboard post readout or RGB options
basically this is geared more towards
overclockers rather than people who want
tons of lighting effects on their
motherboard so that's it for as rocks
new motherboards from CES 2018
personally I can't wait to start using
them since both seems to pack a ton of
performance into a small form-factor
plus with some new ma ATX cases being
offered building a compact high-end
system is becoming more and more
interesting an e bar with hardware
connects thank you so much for watching
make sure to subscribe for more CES
coverage and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
