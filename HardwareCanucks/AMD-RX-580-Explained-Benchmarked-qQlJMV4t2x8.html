Canucks thank you for joining us Amy
just launched the rx 500 line so make
sure to subscribe and kill across that
notification belt to be part of the
notification squad for all of our
upcoming rx 500 contents now you can see
this launch as a refresh not exactly as
a rebrand so let's see if they're on the
right track and is it time to upgrade
find out after this cool master master
keys keyboard lineup is now available
and three sizes to fit within your space
with large medium and small boards with
either beautiful RGB or pure white LED
illumination a little something for
everyone
make it yours with the master keys Pro
by Cooler Master all right so let's dive
right in with the key points about the
rx 500 lineup so first it's using the
same Polaris 10 architecture from the RX
400h using the 14 nanometer FinFET
process with improved power efficiency
during light loads and AMD is really
pushing hard on radio and chill that
renders only frames that are needed
while consuming less power and running
cooler the four variants are the RX 585
75 60 and the 550 so spending broad
range covering all the way from a few GS
stuff to competing with iGPS
the RX 580 has the same number of stream
processors as the arcs 480 but with much
higher clock so around 12% increase on
the base and 6% increase on the boost
with promising Headroom for overclocking
hmm overclocking Headroom huh we'll see
about that the TDP has seen an increase
to 100 85 watt and 200 watts on some
overclocked models and it's priced
exactly the same as the our Expo 80 and
we will see both four gigabytes and 80
Mike models to fill in that gap between
the gtx pen six is three and six
gigabyte models moving on to the RX 570
it's pretty interesting because it has
the same amount of extreme processors
arabes and texture units as the RX 470
but with the massive increase in
frequencies 26% increase on the base
clocks and only 3% on the boost versus
the RX 470 it is priced around 170 to
190 dollars so it should compete with
the gtx 750ti
the RX 560 and the 550 covered the sub
$100 price points so let us know if it
won't these covered
channel but in this video you will see
benchmarks for 14 games man that is a
lot of work we should all thank our lab
in Montreal Thank You sky both at 1080
and 1440p with two variants for the arcs
580 and you can also read our full
article below first card is the sapphire
rx 580 Nitro+ limited edition which is a
beat I has been rx 580 with a 14 10
megahertz boost and a second bias
available for 14 50 megahertz overclock
and it's priced at to a USD the second
card is the XFX rx 580 GTS xxx Edition
xxx really but it has a more reasonable
price point of 240 dollars and a slight
twenty six megahertz overclock on the
boost frequency compared to reference so
let's begin with 1080p benchmarks notice
we are using the 1% minimum to better
portray performance fluctuations and in
the stack are the arcs 480 GTX 1060
founders Edition and dbg superclocked
alongside the GTX 970 founders Edition
you can see the arcs 580 cards fare
pretty well against the GTX 960 and
offer an attractive Delta of about 5 to
13 percent increase over the originals
are explained
I do want to mention overwatch and GTA 5
were the only games with the AMD cards
in the bottom three
moving on to 1440p resolution it seems
that the RX 580 takes an extra lead over
the gtx 960 in majority of games
and again Amy occupying the three lowest
spots and games like overwatch GTA 5 and
titanfall 2 but still fairly close to
the gtx 960 acoustically these two cards
are some of the quietest we've ever
tested and this will vary of course
based on board partners and their own
cool design but check this out
temperatures are in total control
stabilizing around 75 degrees Celsius on
both cards with totally stable
frequencies as well and that is
excellent to see and based on these
gaming results the RX 580 seems to be an
excellent option around the $250 price
point and is a clear winner come when
compared against the gtx 960 so Nvidia
price cuts maybe now when we did our
follow up with the RX 480 is performance
with maturer drivers we actually saw a
significant boost in performance
so hopefully the RX 580 carries that
trend forward but there are two caveats
regarding this new cards first of all is
power consumption it is actually pretty
high just as much as the foundation gtx
1070 and that is 70 watts more than the
gtx 1066 gigabyte version and two
overclocking do not bother
after hours of thinking with Walkman we
were only able to achieve 60 megahertz
on both cards as an increase from there
you know perspective boost clocks so it
is very limited but that is after hours
of crashes and instabilities and stuff
so overclocking on the rx 500 series is
limited and to wrap things up the RX 580
is a fantastic targets for maximum 1080p
gaming and 1440p on high something that
the GTX pens 66 give bike model sort of
lags behind and there's a lot of
potential for excellent competition
around the 240 260 dollar mark and if
you've been considering a gtx 1066
gigabyte model would you consider team
red now the RX panini is out let us know
in the comments i also want to mention
the RX 570 is already in the lab so make
sure to subscribe for that school
benchmarks and or deal with comparisons
I'm Dimitri how are snacks thanks so
much for watching we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
