I want to make this quick video
regarding Intel's upcoming 8th
generation CPUs the reason why we wanted
to post this video is to clear some
misconceptions about these upcoming
products but also explain to you guys
what the difference is between a
generation CPUs versus Kaiba Lake or
seventh generation products now quick
disclaimer we still have no information
regarding intel's upcoming copy lake
cpus we might share a few information
here and there in this video but we just
have to wait for the specs and all that
kind of stuff later down the road but as
of right now this video is just going to
go quickly over intel's upcoming a
generation cpus into ultra books and
guys i have to admit the specs are
really and I mean really interesting so
let's dive in right after this cool
master master keys keyboard line-up is
now available and three sizes to fit
within your space with large medium and
small boards with either beautiful RGB
or pure white LED illumination it will
something for everyone make it yours
with a master keys Pro by Cooler Master
so let's have a quick refresher about
what until a generation course series
involves since things are pretty
different this time around
it used to be that each generation was
tied together with specific architecture
for example the seventh generation held
exclusively kbla chips while the sixth
generation was skylake shifting beyond
the 40 nanometer manufacturing process
has been proven to be a challenge so
basically we now have an architecture
change following optimizations on an
architecture without switching
processing nodes that means skylake kb
lake and other refreshes are all the
same 14 nanometer manufacturing process
basically Intel's a generation will
include three different refreshes new KB
Lake processors coffee lake and even
cannon Lake expect to hear more
information about copy Lake in the fall
and we'll be covering that architecture
in depth very soon this release follows
their new naming scheme while
introducing a new set of cable 8
processors for the slim and light
ultrabook range intel is calling these
newer 8000 series processors kb lake are
and honestly i'm pretty excited for them
but why is intel targeting ultrabooks
with this refresh well the simple answer
to that is the majority of consumers
heavily rely on these products students
professors business professionals use
these devices on
regular basis to get work done in fact I
use this LG gram 15 every day to log
benchmarks write scripts consume content
and in some cases even edit videos our
day 1 RX Vega coverage back in LA is a
testament to that since it was all
edited produced and rendered on an
ultrabook that weighs a bit more than a
soda can also over the past few years
we've only seen a minimal improvement in
terms of performance from one generation
to the next
in fact we did test out the ultra low
voltage u series skylake vs cable xt
peers and notice roughly 9 to 15 percent
increase in ROM performance so it wasn't
really worth upgrading from skylight to
cable ache unless if you really needed
that extended battery life because cable
a chips were known for having better
power efficiency if you're interested in
that comparison video I'll leave a link
to that in the description down below so
what exactly are these new a generation
mobile CPU is called at least the
low-end SKUs that we're discussing today
well you can address them as KB Lake
refresh or like I said KB Lake are
because they're essentially using a
refined and matured 40 nanometer
manufacturing process compared to KB
Lake there's also some minor design
changes that allow for better
performance per one Intel says that the
new notebooks will feature CPUs based
off this 14 nanometer plus technology
that means a more powerful node that
allows them to jam four cores onto an
ultra-low voltage package without
increasing its GDP versus the dual core
seven generation processors basically
these new i7 and i-5 series CPUs will
have up to four cores and eight threads
while boasting a TDP of around 15 watts
that's really amazing since it could
really enhance performance without
sacrificing battery life it's like a
dream come true
I don't know but let's take a look at
some specs just to be clear all four
SKUs that we're looking at today feature
four course and eight threads starting
from the top we have the i7 8650 you CPU
that comes with a base clock of 1.9
gigahertz and turbo boost up to 4.2 it
also comes with eight megabytes of cash
so that's doubled up compared to last
gen however it still seems to be using
the same integrated graphics except they
have renamed it from HD to UHD implying
these new CPUs can easily playback 4k
content without breaking a sweat
I'll have to test that for myself of
course
moving down the line we have the I 78550
you let's collect at 1.8 gigahertz for
bass and boost up to 4 gigahertz it
still carries the same amount of cash
from the 8650 you the i-5 8350 you is
clocked at a base of 1.7 gigahertz and
goes all the way up to 3.6 gigahertz so
the blue frequency is quite lower
compared to the i7 and a cache has been
reduced to 6 megabytes they still
feature the UHD 620 graphics but they
are 50 measures under clocked last but
not least we have the i-5 8250 new CPU
sporting a base clock of 1.6 gigahertz
with a turbo boost after 3.4 and the
rest of specs are identical to the a350
you what's even impressive is that the
TDP on these new processors remain at or
slightly above a 15 watts so regardless
of those two additional course Intel
claims up to 10 hours of battery life
like everything else we'll have to
validate that when we get our hands on
the new ultrabooks so stay tuned for
that one thing I have to mention is that
Intel has achieved their excellent TDP
and battery values by drastically
separating the speeds achieved by single
and all core performance on the desktop
we're used to seeing a few hundred
megahertz but in this case the Delta is
several gigahertz basically int'l is
prioritizing multiple threads over raw
frequencies when an application
determines all eight threads are needed
but what about availability of the
products well Intel claims it will see
over 145 designs in September and coffee
Lake will be coming to the desktop very
soon as well we can't wait to see what
Intel has to offer especially with
rising putting on some pressure lately
so what can we take away from this
announcement from Intel well there are a
few things one the specs on paper look
very promising for users who are looking
to upgrade to two or three or even
five-year-old notebooks even our mini
editor-in-chief mike AKA sky mt l has
been using his five-year-old veil z as
his notebook and so you know CD specs
would perhaps make him upgrade to a
newer notebook very soon I really don't
know
also remember that quad core CPUs were
launched into mainstream networks ever
since Intel's the second generation Core
Series so it's you know it's awesome to
see them finally implement those quad
core chips or not those chips but quad
core
teacher into ultra books and I'm really
excited for that this is also an
excellent glimpse into what a generation
desktops EPS are going to look like and
I'm just gonna leave it right there so I
wanna hear your thoughts on Intel's
upcoming a generation you series
processors are you excited for this over
the desktop or even the processors
getting into the mainstream notebooks
this fall let us know in the comments
down below any boards higher connects
thank you so much for watching make sure
to save subscribed to the channel for
more upcoming content and we'll see you
