great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Herrick knucks and after the release of
the final 5 from fractal design many of
our viewers have expressed their
interest in seeing how it compares to
the widely popular NZXT H 440 both of
these are pretty much and topping the
charts for silent oriented builds and we
decided to do this our 5 versus H 440
showdown two outstanding cases if you
are considering water cooling they offer
plenty of storage potential and solid
build quality starting with the price
both cases are released at $119 that I
think is competitive from what they
offer there are a dent just for both
cases and we hope this video will help
you narrow down your decision so the r5
is available in black white and titanium
gray both in window and solid side panel
options while the H 440 blends a little
bit more variety into the mix with blue
red and white and now the Razr edition
of the case with a windowed side panel
only both the h4 40 and the r5 are very
minimalistic with the fractal case
looking like every other defined release
with a matte brushed plastic front panel
while the atrial 40 brings a bit of a
unique character into the mix I
personally like the h4 40 more thanks to
those rounded edges and glossy or matte
accents depending on color combination
but let us know which design you prefer
in the comment below the i/o ports are
located up top for both I like this
location with four USB ports two of
which are USB 3 PR buttons and your
audio jacks the power button illuminates
on the r5 in an attractive and
non-distracting blue and that's the only
letter portion of the case very subtle
while the H 440 has a few extra
illuminated spots so we have the power
button the NZXT logo and the power
supply shroud and the rear i/o is also
illuminated now notice how the H 440
does not have an optical Bay this was a
complaint many people had when we first
released the full review but the r 5 has
two optical base so that's definitely a
bonus for fan controllers Bay reservoirs
etc the age of 40 is slightly taller as
top cover is built to act as a sound
barrier while the r5 is slightly longer
at the front the r5 has the upper hand
for front intake layout as ventilation
is on both sides with the large gap
between the fam and the front panel
while the intake ports on the h4 40 are
only on the left side with a rounded
corner on the right side that looks
fantastic but the intake suffers easy
removal dust filters are available for
both with three 120mm fans included on
the h4 40 with support for 140
millimeters as well while only a single
140 member fan is present on the r5 with
dual fan mount available and they've
done a fantastic job with getting rid of
airflow barriers here the front
utilizing a more open hard drive design
and while the HR 14 does not have your
conventional cage design instead they
use a spaced out drive caddies that are
independently mounted and I love this
approach for top airflow options the
extra top cover on the age of 40 allows
the utilization of this space without
totally sacrificing that silence element
although the events on the top panel are
facing the left side meaning if you are
facing the side panel window you can
easily hear the fan noise the r5 on the
other hand utilizes these module ends
that are in conveniently removed from
the inside with difficult-to-reach clips
and if you decide to install an Almond
cooler in there you're effectively
getting rid of any sound barriers
although the ability to remove one or
two of these covers for the slots that
are utilized is appreciated for you know
build specific scenarios and I would
recommend these to stay closed for a
totally silent build the r5 can support
triple 120 s and 140 member fans up top
while the h4 40 can do triple 120 s but
only dual 140 million air fans
so there is a bit of an advantage on a
defined case with fan mount but notice
there is no dust filter so the h4 40 has
that slight advantage of the cover as it
will prevent from any dust from settling
in they also have very similar view
layout with flexible fan mount to
accommodate for top radiator clearance
it ones 40 millimeter fan
on each there are seven PCI slots and
bottom dust filtration is present for
the r5 spanning the entire floor and
conveniently removable from the front
and getting inside this is where the
magic happens
the main difference you see here would
be the clear chamber separation is on
the h4 40 the power supply is hidden so
this means you have to do very little to
make it they'll look clean plus all the
drives are hidden behind this piece
while the r5 is more conventional with
modular drive cages so you can remove
them reposition them depending on your
system and how you want things to look
and either case is very simple to work
in the age of 40 supports a total of six
three and a half inch drives with five
on the metal drive caddies that also
support SSDs and a single mounting slot
on the floor and from the power supply
while the dual cage on the r5 can
accommodate four eight three and a half
and two and a half inch drives both with
dedicated SSD mounts as well I love the
location of those on the h4 40 that is
revealing you know you want to showcase
your fast SSDs and they're also not very
difficult to wire while it carries on
the r5 are located behind the
motherboard also an effective spot and
it's utilized well long GPUs are not a
problem for either the r5 with a cage in
place we have 31 centimeters of
clearance while the h4 40 until the
drive caddy has 29 centimeters and keep
in mind that both the cages and the
drive caddies can be removed to
accommodate for longer GPUs water
cooling abilities on each case are super
impressive for this form factor as
efficient layout of the Interior means
extra flexibility for water cooled
systems and starting with the h4 40
having triple 120 s and dual 140
millimeter fans both at the top and the
front means a combination of 360 and 240
normal radiators installed at the same
time is possible and if you do install a
radiator at the front of the case this
means sacrificing on all Drive caddies
while having a more conventional cage
system on the r5 allows users to
relocate the drive closer to the power
supply to have clearance in the front
and that's exactly what I did there for
my build
so you still can accommodate for water
cooling without
totally getting rid of your mechanical
storage and the r5 is more flexible in
this way that I think appeals to water
cooling more you can even remove the
optical drive cage and install your main
drive cage there to have clearance for a
bottom radiator for example and after
assembly each case looks gorgeous on the
inside with really clean cable
management with appropriate cutouts
around the motherboard with the h4 40
having a slightly better accommodation
for micro ATX builds with cutouts at the
bottom while the r5 perfectly
accommodates for full ATX boards just
fine auto coming around to the back and
checking out the cable management I have
to give this one to fractal design as I
was able to clean up everything with no
hassle and look at just our flat my
cables look without any problems of
closing the panel then that's a very
different story with the h4 40 there
isn't that much room behind the
motherboard tray plus the foam on the
side panel restricts so much clearance
and this in turn makes it really
difficult closing the panel and you can
even see the indentations in the foam
from my personal build because of all
the tight cables and because of the
power supply chamber you don't really
have to deal with anything you know in
front of the power supply so that
element of cable management on the h4 40
is easier but the limited spacing
between the side panel and the
motherboard tray creates a more
difficult overall process than on the
define r5 and a few last things to
mention is exactly how silent are these
cases well the window on the age of 40
does not do a good job with noise
isolation plus the exhaust vents on the
left side are not ideal as you can hear
fan noise regardless if you expect a
totally silent system lower your
expectations as you have to approach
this with the new lower rpm fans and
other silent components for this to be a
truly silent case they define our 5
however handles sound isolation like a
boss giving you keep your margins in
place and of course the full side panel
is more effective than the window at
blocking the noise for my test system I
use the same hardware but with different
cooler orientation so this isn't exactly
a perfect comparison but the idle CPU
temperatures
hovering around 32 and 35 degrees
Celsius while GPU was at 30 and 31 for
the R 5 and H for 40 respectively at
load the CPU temperatures were just over
50 degrees Celsius and GPU is slowly
rising to high 70s during game time and
this effectively tells us that cooling
on both cases is perfectly sufficient
without adding any extra case fans aside
from the dual 140 millimeter fans on the
crack and X 61 and so for conclusion I
think both of these cases really stand
out and offer everything for the modern
builder be it an enthusiast editing
machine or an office PC I personally
prefer the exterior design of the H 440
but I also appreciate the modest looks
of the r5 the lack of an optical Bay on
the NZXT case however is an excuse to
choose the competition building inside
each of these is enjoyable but I have to
give the edge to the r5 for simpler
Drive installation and having a less
crammed interior plus more space behind
the motherboard tray for super easy
cable management but I also really love
the power supply shroud on the H 440 to
help with chamber separation the H 440
also comes with four fans while the r5
only with two but cooling on both is
comparable and excellent and while you
have to take into account the
limitations on each case regarding its
silent features I would still personally
opt out for the r5 if silence is your
priority and for my own editing rig I've
gone ahead with the 840 as I wanted to
utilize the top slot for the cooler but
because we have the 2 extra drive
caddies on the r5 I might switch to that
to accommodate for more backup drives
now I realize there are benefits and
drawbacks to each chassis and thus one
cannot be sort of titled superior or the
King so it's a matter of preference and
so let us know which case you would
prefer for your specific build and
priorities with a comment below and
yours like if you enjoy this type of
content and let us know what to cases
should go head-to-head in the next
showdown and as always we appreciate
