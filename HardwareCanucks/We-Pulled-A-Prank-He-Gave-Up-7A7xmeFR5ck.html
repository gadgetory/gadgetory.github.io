the morning Michael my first time at
Eva's new place is it safe
Wow look at that
it's a work in progress yes all right
let's go to base there's one poor dude
working at Starbucks that was like 45
minutes so oh my god
hello and as usual big thanks to our
sponsors for making see as possible
Razer Coursera fantex MSI and
thermaltake and now we're the hotel so
we are almost settled in but of course
we can't go on without having our first
American lunch
are you happy what's the score can you
have 1 out of 10 to 25 6.58 today
alright so here's the situation we want
to prank eber because my notebook has
been making some weird sounds with the
fans so me and Michael are gonna pretend
like we don't hear it and see how Eva
reacts you don't hear anything else it's
a literary literally coming out of that
notebook what's coming out its and it
sounds really bad oh my god what you are
you know are you gonna record something
again dude you hear this it also the
debunkers will explode oh it is
vibrating it is feel it by all the
kidding sound
my god
all right we did it yeah
I turned out the microphone turns off
yeah yeah because I thought that the
microphone was on but I didn't realize
you're recording now if you're wondering
how we record audio while we're at CES
we just find a nice fluffy room with
lots of furniture and soft items and
just yeah just record on that on the bed
that some one of us will sleep on later
tonight and this is the editing station
we've all got our computers Eber is
already cutting a video so productivity
is 100% Michael's watching some stuff
plus script writing so that's a lot of
help and yeah I'm about to cut up this
little one oh man so getting to the
Venetian we're here you know it's es
quiet early so everybody's setting up oh
look we got Corsair but you can't look
inside can't look inside this is the
first time we were actually seeing all
the boxes and like what goes into you
know the behind it scenes of what
happens there's like this big big big
garbage thing there's a big Locker yeah
all right all to the next meeting yes
truck
see even the floor is completely covered
but tomorrow you pull the open not be
able to see the floor because it's give
me so many people true church or to that
it's also quite refreshing to be walking
along these hallways and actually not
being crowded because normally this
whole space is completely full of people
and so that's how we do we do the smart
way breathe a little better and then
yeah just see everything before the
public and the rest of press sees
everything too so over the years we have
learned to figure out how to schedule
all of our meetings so that when we pass
through all this craziness and when we
get lost in the mazes that that compiled
this hotel establishments and all the
you know all the casino stuff we know
exactly where to go and most of the time
we don't so we get lost find our way
around and that we're not lost yet
though we are not lost yet know it we're
just on a random escalator in the
Venetian we're good I think yeah I think
that's the right way to go yeah yeah
well what do you know it's the end of
the day Eber has tapped out we have lost
him to the editing suite but right now
we are heading to our next destination
that is fantasy and just to you know
enlighten Eber because we are a team
we're gonna have Sun him a nice funny
message as Jim pucks
hey Eber Eber we miss you buddy we
really do and if you you know if you
need a nappy nap you should really take
it and then we'll meet you at the
restaurants but only if you're wanting
to come out with us you know what then
continue your nap you know no pressure
mate okay all right so just got back to
the hotel we hear there is no internet
which is pretty bad I just feel bad that
we haven't heard from Eber so hopefully
he's getting some shut-eye though hi
hopefully he's here I hope he's here if
not we're all in trouble okay let's go
see
looks like you were sleeping you were
sleeping I think we should get some
sleep too if there's no internet yeah
all right no internet one man down I
think it'll be a three mind out thank
you guys so much for watching have a
good one
see you on the next one see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
