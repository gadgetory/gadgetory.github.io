great technology selection and service
Corsair they completely stole my
attention with the strafe RGB gaming
keyboard that are reviewed last year but
to complete the set they also announced
this as well meet the shemitah' RGB MOBA
Gaming Mouse priced at $80 this mouse
targets the mobile and MMO markets by
putting a huge number of customizable
shortcut buttons right at our fingertips
and also incorporates a unique key
slider mechanism that allows gamers to
tailor its layout to their liking if you
recall the vengeance m90 that was
announced back in 2012 it didn't receive
a huge amount of Attraction but it was
marketed towards MMO and RTS gamers this
time Corsair has come back with the
Scimitar which adds more functionality
along with some really cool features and
we are about to find out if it has what
it takes to beat the competition diving
into the build quality and design the
Scimitar looks relatively simple
compared to other mobile mice but there
are some highlights here the added
yellow plastic frame on the left side
looks great and for those who don't feel
such a loud color fitting their style a
standard black version is also available
Corsair originally introduced this color
scheme with their void headsets for
visual aesthetics but it doesn't appeal
to everyone this is a huge and heavy
Mouse weighing at about 150 grams that's
sadly not customizable due to the
aluminium piece that's built inside the
mouse's center line with that being said
that aluminium reinforcements
surprisingly does a good job keeping up
the weight balance and giving the
shemitah' a solid feel the outer shell
is coated with a soft touch rubber
surface that was very comfortable to use
although just like any Mouse that comes
with this coating it starts to wear off
over time the size of the Scimitar is
something to take in account since users
with small hands may find it challenging
to wrap their palms around the body I
didn't have any issues since my palms
are large but keep that in mind
as for grips you'll find one on the
right side that is perfectly placed for
your ring and pinky fingers while on the
left side there are two sets of side
buttons three each that
with the texture which does a pretty
good job of holding your thumb what you
won't find is a thumb rest since coarser
figures your thumb will be using the
shortcut buttons the high curve design
of the shimmy tars
top did support my palms really well but
it might get sweaty during those
intensive gaming sessions there is no
room for air to pass through since the
palm touches the surface the whole time
I'm not sure if this is just me but let
me know what you think about this in the
comments down below
Corsair packed a whopping 12,000 DPI
optical sensor into the shimmy tar and
honestly I wonder who would ever take
advantage of this setting unless if you
have multiple high-resolution screens
right in front of you that you would
want to quickly navigate into personally
I think it's a marketing gimmick but
anyway the performance is none of the
less stunning I tend to prefer obstacle
gaming mice for both editing and gaming
accuracy was on point with no lag which
complemented my aiming and really
boosted responsiveness I used an
aluminum mouse pad for testing the
shemitah'
which allowed the sensor to shine and
resulted in excellent tracking plus
smooth movement there are a total of 17
programmable buttons on the Scimitar
this includes the primary left and right
click buttons the scroll wheel button 2d
flashes buttons right behind the scroll
wheel and last the 12 buttons on the
left side of the mouse now an
interesting feature on this mouse is the
key slider basically if you're having
any trouble reaching any of the left
side buttons you can adjust the whole
set a little backwards or forwards and
then tighten it into place with the
included hex screwdriver on the bottom
of the mouse it's a nice feature and I
had it place all the way in the front
since my thumbs were perfectly fine
reaching all the buttons the primary
left and right click buttons have a nice
tactile response to them this follows
along with the DPI shaped buttons and
the scrolling button which indeed
requires a lot of pressure to press but
the scroll steps are nicely defined the
12 side buttons have great feedback as
well although they do feel mushy when a
button is pressed moving into lighting
the shemitah' has for letting zones the
subtle lighting on the scroll wheel logo
at the back the 12 mm long buttons on
the side and the lighting and the front
all these zones are RGB meaning you can
customize them to any color
your choice Corsa has once again
surprised me in this department
the lighting transitions are so smooth
with no latency so it really blends in
perfectly with the strafe RGB if you
happen to pick that up as well each zone
can be customized to a different effect
or one single effect can be applied to
all four zones there are four effects in
total rainbow solid color color shift
and color pulse corsair skew engine
software is pretty straightforward you
are greeted with the assignments tab
where you can program or remap all the
seventeen buttons to your preference
lying tab lets you customize the
lighting effects of each zones as
discussed earlier and as you can see
they're very well organized
kudos Corsair the performance in DPI tab
allows you to adjust the five different
steps of dpi sensitivity the pointer
speed enable or disable angle snapping
and adjust the liftoff distance all
these settings will be stored inside the
microprocessor built inside the shim
ATAR ok
there are a few things I need to
establish with the shemitah' I have a
lot of mixed feelings with the mouse
like the softest rubber coating on the
shell it's so comfortable yet it will
wear out over time the high curve design
on the top part of the mouse is an
excellent support for your palms but
there is no gap for air movement and
that will eventually lead to sweaty
palms the optical sensor is excellent
for gaming although I don't think the
12-thousand DK a marketing strategy
might help with their sales because I
was perfectly comfortable with my 800 to
1600 dpi settings the 12 side buttons
are nice and tactile plus all of them
are in reach for your thumb with the key
slider being an excellent feature the
lighting is also excellent and it blends
in perfectly within your setup it's more
than obvious the corsair scimitar
focuses in on a narrow yet quickly
growing segment of the gaming peripheral
market this thing is laser targeted at
mobile and MMO players in that respect
it does quite well though there's a
steep learning curve when it comes to
successfully interacting with all those
buttons particularly when the in-game
action becomes frantic over time you
will get a hang of it and courses
excellent cue software will be there
holding your hand
while gamers who prefer the first-person
shooter genre will surely find its
primary feature although shortcut
buttons to be a needless add-on there
are those who will benefit from it
this is actually one of the first MMO
centric mice we reviewed so the jury is
still out regarding how well the
shemitah' fares against its direct
competition so what do you guys think of
the shemitah' from Corsair is it
something that you would consider let us
know in the comments down below i'm ebar
