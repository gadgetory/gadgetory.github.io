canucks and welcome to another video
review now somehow there is one company
that I trust when it comes to headphones
but they also have a pretty wide variety
of gaming headsets that takes their
well-established
audio drivers in combination with the
microphone and that's how the game
series was born now the latest offerings
is the game one as an open style headset
retailing for 250 dollars and one of the
most predominant changes so you see here
is the white and red color scheme moving
away from the traditional black designs
found on all their previous game series
products
the glossy white and metallic red
accents throughout the headset is going
to be one loss love it or hated type of
color schemes I myself am NOT a fan for
this direction however I do understand
the need to distinguish the brand versus
all that is out there on the market when
it comes to gaming headsets I do however
love the red lining inside the ear cups
build quality is what you'd expect from
sanitiser very sturdy yet flexible and
of course size adjustable the large boom
mic is slightly flexible as well and is
muted when in the upright position I
really would have loved the option to
remove the microphone for me to use this
as a standalone headphone but it's
pretty clear why they kept it intact if
you want to sanitize your headphone
you'll have to get that separately so
here is the microphone quality test I
have a background track playing to test
out the noise canceling effect of this
microphone but it does sound really
clear and really crisp and totally
acceptable for in game volume the right
ear Cup features a volume wheel that's
always convenient and something every
gaming headset should incorporate it
does connect through a standard mic and
headphone jack with a three meter
braided cable so I've mentioned this as
an open style headset and if you care
about directionality and soundstage in
game this is certainly the way to go
develop your Cup's combined with the
open design means you never sweat and I
mean after five hours of gaming you
don't even need to vent your ears this
also means they're in no way isolating
you can pretty much hear everything
that's going on around you and same goes
for leaking sound if you care about
blasting your cane without disturbing
anyone consider the game zero that are
closed style the headband has a thick
layer of the same velvet cushion and
putting these on they sit very well
hugging your ears without any spaces at
the bottom the mic is so also so large
and I really would like to see something
smaller or perhaps retractable or
removable and also just be careful not
to poke yourself in the eye because
apparently that happens and finally
moving on to audio quality for gaming
sanitizer doesn't put any enhancements
on the drivers instead emphasis is
placed on sound fidelity
there's no low-end boost there's no
treble enhancements and this in turn
means very well-balanced frequency
response the bass is really tight with
great resolution its distortion free and
doesn't bleed into the mid-range there
is also well-balanced for detail and
element separation it is so refreshing
putting on the gaming headset that
performs very closely to an entry-level
audiophile headphone the high end on the
game one needs slight Sparkle based on
my own personal preference but these
deliver warm audio with smooth treble
that doesn't disappoint also thanks to
the open style you will immediately feel
your audio environment enlarged that is
if you're coming from a closed style
headset soundstage is controlled and not
too Airy this means a hearing distant
gunshots and actually feeling the
distance of where that audio was
produced i prefer open style headphones
for this particular advantage of larger
soundstage and the game one delivers to
that perfectly when it comes to
directionality because the larger
soundstage you might find that some
audio elements are slightly muted and
they're not as detailed in this case I
would recommend increasing your high end
for that extra Sparkle so footsteps and
other surrounding elements are even more
evident for that total awareness having
said that the game one delivers accurate
sound and some gamers might find it
lacking that head rumbling bass feeling
and the razor-sharp detail and if that's
what you're after open style maybe not
for you but that's something I can
sacrifice myself to get incredible
immersive feeling for large soundstage
in-game excellent positional awareness
and a little touch of EQ on the high end
to get that extra sparkle they are also
really comfortable and most importantly
let your ears breathe first of all in
control on the right ear cough is super
convenient I think when the console will
be the color scheme here is one those
either love it or hate it type of
situations it's personally not my style
but let us know how you feel about that
I also think we need to see a low
profile microphone or even perhaps
something renewable as for $250 I would
want
have that option to use it outside of
the home so the game one is no doubt
going to deliver exceptional audio
quality for gaming with deep bass and
excellent balance throughout the range
and we're giving it the hard work knocks
damn good at work now the main question
would be whether or not the open style
design is for you and obviously if the
new color scheme tickles your fancy so
