hard-working axe review we are checking
out two fan controls from BitFenix today
the Hydra Pro and the Recon fan
controllers are very popular within the
modding community most of the time and
adds to the creative appearance of the
case and monitoring those temperatures
and noise levels are a must for many
enthusiasts so let's first take a look
at the Hydra Pro this is the five in the
quarter inch compatible main mount with
five channel fan control with up to 30
watts per channel this is good news for
enthusiasts who are mounting powerful
fans and just for reference these
standard 120mm fans that you see here
and they move about 42 CFM and draw a
maximum of about 2 watts per channel so
now you can really see how much head
room there is per channel for a much
more powerful fan the front faceplate is
covered with big Phenix a soft touch
coating which does add a nice quality
feel we have a white LED to indicate
power the 5 sliders and the LED on and
off switch for the fans all the sliders
have a really nice smooth motion when
adjusting the speed this contributes to
the overall quality of this unit
how are the knobs that sit on the
sliders can be removed when changing the
speed this doesn't disturb the function
of the sliders but a tighter fit would
have been better but on the bright side
such low-profile design allows
compatibility with cases that have front
panel doors that open in terms of
connectivity at the back we have 5 LED
connectors that would be used with
compatible fans this would allow the LED
button on the front to switch them on or
off then we have the 5 3 pin fan
connector with proper labels that are on
the fan headers great for organization
during the build they are fairly long
which would allow the wiring without any
extensions and we have the dual box
connections for power and lastly all the
connectors can be removed in case you
need to limit your cable clutter so
let's put it to the test I've connected
five fans and notice the fan controller
doesn't turn off the fans completely at
its lowest power I would say the sliders
really give the user flexibility between
low medium or high speeds and also the
fan power is reflected by the brightness
of the fan LED and I also wanted to
mention that if you want to fully
utilize a fan controller I
recommend using higher speed fans
something around 2,000 rpm or even
higher just to have the flexibility of
proper speed adjustments because if you
are using standard 2000 rpm fans
switching between the maximum and the
minimum power will not be that
noticeable
well alright enough for the hydro Pro
let's check out the Recon which between
exclaims to be the first Internet
connected fan controller this one is a
touchscreen fan controller also five and
a quarter inch Bay mount with soft touch
coating for the front plate the screen
size here is 4.7 inches diagonally
unfortunately the height of the screen
is not even an inch so there isn't much
room to work here there is a large bezel
around the screen so minimizing that for
a larger display would have been ideal
this is also a five channel controller
with up to 10 watts per channel still
pretty good for an enthusiast build but
don't expect anything too powerful like
the tree work fans for example that
required 12 watts so check it out the
touchscreen here we have a very bright
blueish interface we are using the Recon
in manual mode circling the first
channel and pressing the digital fan
will highlight the speed and then you
can adjust that with plus and minus
signs each of the channels can be
adjusted in increments of 10 and you can
shut off the sound as it does tend to
get a bit annoying and this is a
pressure-sensitive display so using your
pen or anything else will work just as
fine
there's no brightness adjustments but
you can shut off the screen by holding
down the power button for three seconds
and press anywhere on display to wake up
the controller one major disappointing
aspect of the Recon are the viewing
angles and now I'm not expecting this to
be an IPS panel but you can't make
anything on the screen unless you are
directly at the front of the controller
and unless you have your desktop at eye
level it's not very practical but on the
brighter side we have temperature
monitoring and an alarm system for each
of the five channels with either Celsius
or Fahrenheit which is monitored by the
temperature sensors included on the
controller and the rest of campbell's
include 5/3 pin fan connectors dual
molix for power and USB ports that allow
the network link and this is actually
quite cool very innovative you download
the drivers off the website from between
and you get all the same options as you
do on the actual fan controller by using
your web browser on your desktop or a
mobile device with internet connection
so you can adjust the speed you can set
the alarms create different profiles and
you can also shut down the reekin
service completely with this shut down
monitor button for some reason recon
service did not work for me with
Internet Explorer now in terms of
functionality monitoring the
temperatures and adjusting the fan speed
right from your Explorer is very
convenient you don't have to wiggle with
a small display in the controller but
having the ability to connect your
mobile device to this service makes
things a bit more interesting that's
because you can monitor and control the
fan speed while you're on the go as long
as you have internet connection it could
be useful for server type systems just
to make sure everything stays nice and
cool instructions are very simple you
just have to make sure to allow the link
in your firewall and if you are using a
mobile device while not at home you have
to enable port forwarding in order to
get connected all right so let's recap
what we have here with the Hydra Pro is
a low profile 5 channel high wattage fan
controller that has great feedback
sliders that rings in at an excellent
value of $35 my only critique are the
falling out knobs on the sliders
I wish between X we'd have done a bit
more in terms of quality control and the
Recon has a fairly decent touch
interface 5 channel control with
temperature monitoring and Internet
connectivity they can use on your
desktop instead of reaching for the fan
controller itself and the ability to use
the Recon service while you're on the go
is very appealing and works great now
there are several things that bother me
screen sizes one of them all the buttons
do seem to be cramped in and the smaller
bezel would have been better also the
viewing angles are very limited and you
can only make of things when looking
directly from the front so to conclude
the Hydra pro is on the right track for
delivering all the practical functions
we need in a fan controller and there
serves the damn good to file your work
and the Recon does offer something we
haven't seen yet and that's on the go
control and we're giving in the hardware
canucks dam in the video of a word and
that is it for this one guys thanks for
watching we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
