mouse why do you think I don't know
maybe for airflow nope
better lighting mm-hmm it's to cut down
on the weight Oh
and so the hype surrounding the glorious
model Oh mouse makes total sense what
we've got here is a perfect recipe for
an FPS mouse following in the footsteps
of what final Mouse try to deliver but
hopefully with less challenges on
actually shipping these to consumers and
also it looking quite similar to the air
fifty-eight ninja Mouse means that the
model all will ride that popularity way
because some people might not realize
that this is a different Mouse but this
thing is going to be my main from now on
let me tell you why after this did you
bring the stuff I sure did
it's so compact this brushed aluminum
plates floating half high keycaps MX
cherry low-profile switches a type-c
connection and comes in different sizes
to the cooler master sk series careful
not to missing links below so the good
thing is these are not expensive mice
the matte versions are $50 the glossy
models are 60 and I love the two-toned
variation to satisfy your color taste
and texture preference and the glossy
model has this kind of stickiness factor
that I don't particularly like it turns
out I move my fingers over the primary
buttons often and the smoother matte
texture is just more pleasing for me
personally but I love the look of the
glossy models the honeycomb shell is all
about weight reduction however both Mike
and Eber have expressed their concerns
about dust and other particle
accumulation on the inside and over time
will that impact its performance and
that is a sound concern but I guess
we'll have to wait and see
in the long term but the see-through
nature especially in the white model is
gorgeous for RGB illumination that has
that soft spill on the interior so the
mouse looks pretty inside and out and
also because of it this
the lightest mouse that I've ever used
at 67 and 68 grams and that is pretty
incredible given the price point now for
reference my lightest wired mouse is the
largest aqui pro hero at 83 grams and
the rival 310 at 88 grams and while on
the wireless side only the G Pro
Wireless is a lightweight at 80 grams
now in the reality can you tell the
difference between 67 grams at 80 grams
actually yes holding the model on your
hand feels effortless if you play a
lower dpi and move your mouse across
larger surface area for the mouse mat it
makes total sense and it's fantastic and
actually moving from the motor low back
to the Wireless G Pro with 80 grams this
thing feels a little bit heavy now and
I'm not sure if I'm getting spoiled but
the whole precision element of having
something that light and your flicks and
having a bit more control is awesome
the court also has an important part to
play because the braiding is incredibly
light and it has no pool so you can use
this without a bungee no problem it is
slightly thicker visually versus
standard mice but I really like how it
feels the button placement is standard
no complaints here
with a low profile dpi switch and the
color toggle below the browser buttons
have that satisfying softness while the
scroll wheel has slightly muddy steps
and a bit too hard middle click so we'll
use that often but the primary buttons
are good Emraan switches with short
travel distance as for the shape we've
got an ambidextrous body but for right
hand use only you could switch the left
and right clicks but they don't feel
exactly the same so that might feel odd
and for my hybrid claw style grip it's
almost the perfect size it feels very
similar to the G Pro Wireless but with a
flatter back section and a slightly
longer body but I can easily switch
between the G Pro Wireless the G pro
hero and the model oh and so the reason
why I'm going to be using this as my
main is because my aim correction and
low dpi gameplay and overall comfort
just feels fantastic the pics are 3360
sensor is flawless and having sixty
seven grams of precision under my hand
just feels so good the two millimeter
liftoff distance is low enough without
interfering with my aim upon contact
back with the mouse math and gaming has
been satisfying overall and as long as
you perform well with the lighter Mouse
and don't prefer something heavy for
stability for example I think you will
definitely enjoy the model oh especially
for this price
as for the glourious software all the
basics are here with button mapping
lighting effect selection and polling
rate we have six dpi profiles at 108
commit changes lift off distance
adjustments from 2 to 3 and this
debounce time feature that supposedly
can help if the mouse starts to
double-click in the future thus
increasing latency can offset the double
triggering of a switch and so for
conclusion time you know this whole 4k
60fps has been really weird to edit and
I look way too smooth but the glorious
model o is satisfactory it brings on
that affordable price point and that
true FPS ready that is performance
oriented and the super-lightweight
target for many FPS gamers and my only
complaint here in terms of the color
options would be the glossy one I don't
particularly how it feels on my fingers
it feels like my fingers are sticking to
the surface instead of them being really
smooth on the matte versions and I'm
hoping that glorious will deliver in
terms of longevity or something like
this we have a two-year warranty I think
it's a well rounded product that I'm
hoping more people will get their hands
on and in the long term they won't fail
I really do hope to see more courts like
this because it's fantastic better than
anything ever else I tried it's just so
light and doesn't interfere with
anything I don't need a mouse bungee for
this particular chord and that's
appreciated and the other thing is the
software customization does not allow
like individual RGB zone control like
we've see on many other gaming mice but
I really don't care and I'm guessing
this whole trend of honeycomb and
removing a lot of the body to minimize
on the weight will continue to be a
thing in the future and we'll just see
who does the best but so enough for now
the glorious model would be my
recommendation if you want something
under 80 grams now we haven't given out
on the word in a while but the model Oh
deserves the Harbor Canucks damn would
have worked all right guys I'm Dimitri
thanks much for watching make sure to
check out this other relevant content
let me know which Mouse you're using and
how heavy is it and if 67 gram sounds
way too light but
somebody who prefers lighter mice this
is the perfect weight for my style thank
so much for watching I'll see you guys
in the next video
No More 60fps though whoo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
