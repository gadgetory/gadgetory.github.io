great technology selections and service
so we have Android on our phones on our
tablets and that is an excellent mobile
operating system without standing user
experience so what happens when you
combine the stationary device with a
mobile OS well you get an Android PC for
this segment we're not only reviewing
this aoc 24 inch Android PC but really
trying to answer whether or not Android
makes sense for this form factor and to
get the specs out of the way this twenty
three point six inch display houses Full
HD resolution and this model will set
you back around five hundred dollars so
you are getting an IPS panel with a
built in system so an Nvidia t-33 which
is a Tegra 3 quad-core SOC clocked at
1.6 gigahertz two gigabytes of memory a
gigabytes of built-in storage with only
five gigabytes usable on our unit
support for Bluetooth Wi-Fi b/g/n and
touch controls in Windows and it is
running an outdated version of Android
jelly bean 4.2 now the whole point of
this Android PC is the user experience
and the lack of support for even Android
4.3 is already disappointing and I doubt
we'll see support for latest version of
Android rolling out anytime soon so the
form factor is also a little strange
having this dual bezel design first a
glossy outside frame then the inside
screen bezel making this monitor
actually larger than most 24-inch panels
the outside frame also exhibits a lot of
flags and it seems like the glue used
here is pretty weak with the portion
below the front-facing camera has
completely come off on our unit we have
an 8 megapixel camera at the front
capacitive touch controls at the bottom
right that I wish were physical buttons
so we get on-screen display controls
like color presets brightness sharpness
and all the rest plus the arrow keys
adjust the volume while in Android mode
and can also be used to access sharpens
controls there are no buttons on the
outer shell just a silver accent
surrounding the large housing and on one
side we have two USB 2.0 ports for
monitor use only
audio jacks and the micro USB port for
OTG devices when in Android mode the
backplate is piano gloss with a nice
curvature to it and built-in stereo
speakers that are just okay for some
audio but I would not rely on it and
this is where we find the rest of the
connections including an Ethernet port
USB power for those side USB ports
really uncomfortable SD card slot it's
right below the stand so good luck
accessing it and the power plug that's
needed for operation as this does not
have a built in battery we also have
full-sized HDMI and VGA ports for
external monitor use as this is the
monitor after all the aluminium stand
here is very basic and is very sturdy
very nice to see that there only two
positions so the standard mode and the
low mode we also have a small plastic
strip at the bottom of the stand which
is meant to stabilize the monitor along
with these rubber inserts at the bottom
but they do pop out easily and actually
lost one of them making the AIO
really slippery on the desk and actually
very uncomfortable to use with touch now
I'm happy to see 75-millimeter VESA
mounting holes allowing additional
flexibility and integration of this
panel into your desk environment so now
comes the question of Android user
experience with this form factor and
right from the start I could clearly see
how unfitting this combination is there
are many features unoptimized for this
24 inch size like the massive keyboard
that you cannot scale down so typing in
this thing is just ridiculous there is
potential here I mean there's enough
area to include the full numbers line
and all the special characters somewhere
around but in this state it's
unproductive and inefficient luckily you
can connect the Bluetooth keyboard to go
around this and it will actually been
considerate of aoc to include a mouse
keyboard bundle plus imagine connecting
a Bluetooth game controller for some
casual and your gaming which would be
pretty sweet
second are the back home and multi
window buttons at the bottom left corner
that they're just awkward to reach every
time the touch interface can be used by
anything I actually like that I think
that might be useful
however touch registration is not
precise meaning if I hover to three
millimeters away from the surface of the
display it would still register that
touch command so imagine needing to
select a specific portion of the text
only to start playing catch the cursor
and so it's really unpleasant and so
based on all that I was seriously
relying on user experience to win me
over only to be utterly disappointed
with sluggish performance laggy
animations apps take a while to load and
I just found browsing the web on my
phone a lot quicker so if the UI was
silky smooth and perhaps would see a
specific skin to work with this form
factor I would maybe consider the
possibility of Android fitting within
desktop a iOS but this attempt from AOC
is quite disappointing from an Android
PC perspective monitor wise you are
looking at a pretty decent color
reproduction and contrast with excellent
viewing angles although it is quite
reflective the ability to use this as a
standalone monitor is appreciated
through the HDMI and VGA ports but the
lack of height adjustment stand as you
get on most monitors today is I think a
deal-breaker and I don't think that this
Android PC would be more suitable versus
your standard regular monitor and
perhaps Android on your phone or tablet
as a separate device to me the best
thing about this Android PC is actually
the screen it's vibrant bright enough
and the stand isn't bad either with
quality form and two main angled
positions and I'm really glad to see
75-millimeter face and mounting points
although everything else from the for
Android performance with unoptimized UI
like awkward placed on-screen buttons
and Jake handing on-screen keyboard
inconvenient capacitive power button
terrible SD card placement and not
really a seamless transition between
monitor use and Android use where
there's about a 30 second wait between
system power on the outer frame also
exhibits a lot of flex plus a dual bezel
design makes this monitor larger and
then it needs to be and also touch
registration needs more work so yes this
looks like an almost complete flop from
a user perspective and I think Android
is definitely more fitting on mobile
devices instead of such attempts to
bring Android to a desktop scene and
realistically if you do have this hooked
up as a monitor why not just browse the
web and enjoy social media through
more comfortable means rather than
sluggish Android PC but let us know in
what situations you think this Android
PC would actually be useful in as we all
have our preferences as always thanks
