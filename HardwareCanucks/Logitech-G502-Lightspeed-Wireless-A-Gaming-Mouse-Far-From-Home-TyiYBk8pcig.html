of the most popular gaming minds from
logitech g502 gets a wireless upgrade
they've been doing such a good job of
breaking down the stigma surrounding
wireless peripherals and gaming in terms
of battery life and sensor performance
and their current wireless army
portfolio is plenty satisfactory and so
this is my experience with the g502
Lightspeed Wireless enjoy after this
damn what I provide TX system you run
and this is an ATX machine you mean
micro idea no no full sized ATX
components it's just a small package it
can still satisfy the Q 500 l by
Coolermaster and affordable and the
pretty compact enclosure for all your
regular hardware with perforated
exterior and PSU bracket the chips
up-and-down flexible signed IO and
awesome cable management the Q 500 l a
compact frame with full ATX satisfaction
check it out below alright so let's get
the technicals out of the way first
among the entire wireless army from
large tech this one is a bit on the
heavier side at 114 grams with the
option to add 16 more grams with these
new weight systems keeping true to the
original design either adding 8 grams to
the back of the mouse and or
distributing smaller 2 gram weights
around the center balance for people who
love a heavier Mouse under the hand this
is awesome but I still prefer the
lightweight champion the G pro Wireless
that is the same price by the way over
the g502 Lightspeed and of course
this is for all my FPS goodness where as
I'm totally fine using the g502 for
editing and like some more critical
things but aim wise I'm more comfortable
with lighter and as usual all the mice
will be linked in the description below
if you check out thank you very much
now despite it looking the same with the
side textures and the glossy buttons
everything under the hood is actually
totally new to make it even lighter
versus the wired version so the
fan-favorite hyper scroll wheel is now
rubberized and fitter with super tactile
scroll steps and the same activation for
hyper scroll the bottom magnetic plate
is smaller to reveal our weight
compartment there's also the cover for
the USB receiver area and if you have a
power-play mat this
where you insert the power park that
charges the mouse whenever it's on the
powerplay mat oh my god that is a lot of
power and honestly I would be okay for
them not to include the power plate
compatibility and lowering the price of
it the G logo is now slightly larger
with all the same RGB goodness and the
buttons are on the right places with dpi
up and down browser switches and the
sniper button or dpi shift is slightly
too forward for my grip style but if we
okay for larger hands also by default
you can check the battery status with
the g9 key that gives us a color code
everything is remarkable as usual and
you can save your profiles to the mouse
itself but that is for some reason
inside the gear settings and the DPI
shift speeds are adjusted in one
increments for really precise
customization on that wonderful hero 16k
sensor and that's what we've seen on all
their flagship wireless mice so far plus
the hero ditions or the g pro and the g502 literally there's nothing bad to
say about its performance there's no
filtering no acceleration zero smoothing
so you basically get raw tracking
throughout the entire full range of dpi
and the only disadvantage here is the
lack of any lift off distance adjustment
which is not really an issue at lower
dpi but it might become a little bit too
jerky at higher dpi settings as for
battery life this thing is rated at 48
hours of continuous usage which means
for my activity I can go for a whole
week eight hours a day on a single
charge the sensor is super efficient and
shuts down whenever it's not in use and
so the only culprit here is that RGB
illumination logo it's consuming more
power than the sensor while in use oh
and the cable included here is very nice
but giving the deep housing for that
micro USB port at the front don't lose
the cable and so I remember using the
g502 proteus spectrum the original one
and you thinking it was my favorite
Mouse because I loved the shape I love
the buttons I love the scroll wheel and
the weight at the time was not really an
issue it provided a little bit more
stability for my desktop operations but
as mice got smaller as my mice got
lighter and wireless I've actually never
looked back but I can totally see the
appeal of the g502 wireless 4 to replace
the original for many users and for
casual gaming the weight is not really
for me but I do feel slightly locked
down and less free with my aim versus
the total control that I feel with my
flicks
on the G pro wireless or the original G
pro Mouse perhaps I've just gotten
totally used to the simplified shape and
not really fanned this whole complex
design you know some years ago I was
totally into that but now with this like
the more economic shape and much lighter
body and the same price - I would say
that for most people if you have $150
for Mouse definitely consider the G Pro
wireless instead unless of course you've
been using the original G502 and
really love the shape want to stick with
it and then of course the g fiber -
Wireless would be satisfactory but
having said all that the launch tech G305 is still my top favorite Wireless
recommendation for Mouse because of its
shape because of its battery life
because what's wait at 99 grams and you
can further reduce that by using a
lithium battery and the price do it only
$60 you cannot go wrong and if the G502
wireless was slightly cheaper
to separate itself from the end game
that there's the G Pro wireless then I
would say you'd have better chances but
for now I would recommend the G /
Wireless all the way all right I don't
mean to disappoint and I know there are
many people who love the g502 for
exactly what it is it's like your
heavier Mouse a bit more complicated
shape cool design that hyper scroll
wheel button as well but if you could
look beyond the horizon especially at
that $150 price point then definitely
consider other options thanks for
watching i'll tell you guys next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
