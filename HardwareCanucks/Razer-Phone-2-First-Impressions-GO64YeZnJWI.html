Heinrich in Acts and this is the razor
phone too now at first glance you're not
going to notice a major difference
between this and it's a previous or
predecessor the razor phone because from
a design standpoint it's pretty much the
exact same thing except for a few minor
increments in terms of features and
let's talk about that right after
message from our sponsor the new master
keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic wrist rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection Coolermaster
doing it right check it out below
okay so what's really new with the razor
phone - well let's start off with the
design and to be honest it's not that
different from the original razor phone
I think we noticeable difference that
you'll see compared to the original
phone is that the rear side of the
device has been replaced with Gorilla
Glass 5 instead of the traditional matte
black aluminum finish this adds support
for wireless charging but given that
this is a glass back you can definitely
expect scratches and it being a slippery
eventually over time because it's
obviously a surface that picks up grease
and fingerprints quicker than aluminium
surfaces so that's again something to
keep note of now given that it's 2018 we
had to expect some sort of RGB lighting
on a smart phone of this caliber and
that's exactly what's going on here so
the logo hidden underneath the Gorilla
Glass 5 back is RGB LED and it's
controlled through Racers chroma app
pre-installed on the device there are
three learning effects that you can play
around with so there's spectrum cycling
breathing and static effect and you can
customize the colors - up to sixteen
point seven million colors which is
certainly a nice touch so if you're
looking for a smart phone with RGB
lighting this is certainly the one to
get apart from the rate of part from the
ROG phone then is that I still have no
idea on availability or launch so yeah
RGB where's our phone - they've also
added ip67 water-resistant rating which
is a welcoming update from the original
RAZR phone it's certainly on IP 68
certified but
you've got to front-facing speakers
razor actually had to redesign the
speaker the system to accommodate that
certification so it's certainly and
welcoming and refreshing update from the
original RAZR phone but aside from that
from a design standpoint it's again very
much identical to the original RAZR
phone
all right so spec wise you're getting a
snapdragon 845 processor a gigabytes of
RAM 64 gigabytes of storage and a four
thousand milliamp hour battery again the
only incremental upgrade internally is
that processor bump you're still getting
the same amount of RAM compared to the
original RAZR phone you're also getting
the same battery capacity so again not a
significant upgrade on that department
as well
but what they have included is a new
vapor cooling chamber design internally
so it actually dissipates the heat a lot
better so that's again something to be
validated in the full review the next
thing to talk about is the display and
just as expected it's not a significant
update from the original RAZR phone so
you're getting the same 5.7 inch qHD
plus display with the 120 Hertz refresh
rate and my god it looks amazing in
person if you're someone who's used to a
traditional smartphone especially like
myself who has never actually used the
original RAZR phone
I was certainly I just fell in love with
this display right away because the
fluidity and the experience that you get
just browsing through the Android
operating system and of course gaming
for the most part is just fantastic I
didn't get some hands-on time with that
gaming as well and it's again a
breathtaking experience you really have
to feel it by yourself in person because
the hundred twenty Hertz display is just
quite amazing especially on a mobile
device and it's really hard for me to go
back to a smartphone that uses a
traditional 60 Hertz display because the
phone feels slower and it just doesn't
complete that experience now razer did
increase the brightness of this display
by 50 percent so you're looking at 580
nits or just 318 it's on the original
RAZR phone so that's certainly again a
incremental upgrade but certainly
refreshing to see on the second
generation razor phone software wise
this phone is rocking Android 8.1 Oreo
out of the box which is kind of
disappointing because I was expecting
Android Pi and you know for phone that's
launching at the end of 2018 it just
doesn't make any sense for it to ship
with 8.1 but Razer is promising Android
Pi sooner than later
not just for the razor phone too but
also for the razor phone one so let's
just hope that happens but other than
that you are getting a pretty close to
stock Android experience without any
bloatware so that's awesome there are no
third-party skins or anything like that
in fact razor gives you full
customization options so it is rockin
nova launcher by default but most
specifically you do have a theme store
so if you want to play around with
different themes that's there but
there's also Razer cortex which is in a
dedicated application that makes you
switch between different modes
particularly for you know it balanced a
performance mode that lets you just
conserve battery life for longer usage
or if you want absolute best performance
you can go for the max performance mode
which will give you the highest frame
rates but that's definitely gonna take a
little bit of hit on battery life now
one of the major drawbacks of the
original razor phone was the camera
performance because it just wasn't up to
the standards especially when compared
to the flagships from last year and
razor is trying to address that with the
razor phone too because they've
implemented dual 12 megapixel cameras
you've got a standard lens and a
telephoto lens with a different aperture
variants but they do come with optical
image stabilization but most
specifically you'd also get you know
extra features like po'trait mode better
low-light performance and there's also a
beauty mode integrated on this device so
again those are some of the things that
I'll have to validate for the full
review so definitely stay tuned for that
but I'm gonna keep my expectations
neutral because from my initial testing
or with my initial hands-on with this
device I just wasn't impressed with the
camera performance so let's just wait
and see I'm just gonna spend some time
with the camera on the razor phone to to
give my full thoughts on that and
perhaps I'll be able to compare it to
the note 9 and the pixel 2 so again
definitely stay tuned for that so guys
that's pretty much a story with the
razor phone 2 and honestly it's an
incremental upgrade over the original
razor phone just to quickly run over the
updates you're getting a new finish on
the back its now Gorilla Glass 5 with
the RGB lat logo and it supports
wireless charging slightly improved
cameras it also comes with eyepieces own
water-resistant rating a private display
slightly better sounding speakers
and that's about it and of course it's
gonna be priced a little bit higher so
the original RAZR phone retailed for
$6.99 for the base model the razor phone
2 is gonna be starting at $7.99 for the
base model which is certainly an
expensive investment but if you look at
the smartphone market in general I think
it's priced competitively especially
when you compare to the pixel of 3 the
galaxy note 9 p LG v 40 so again it's a
smart phone specifically targeted
towards a certain market if you're a
gamer and if you're looking for an
all-in-one entertainment device this is
certainly something to look into because
that one in 20 Hertz display is
certainly something that I just can't I
can't take my eyes off said I will be
spending some time with this device just
like my other devices especially like
the note 9 just to see what the
experience is like and if I really like
it particularly the cameras those are
some of the things that I really want to
test to see if it's actually worth the
$7.99 price tag so certainly stay tuned
