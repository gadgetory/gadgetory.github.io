possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCI X there were a few exciting
announcements coming from AMD at CES
first they launched a new stock CPU
cooler the wrath cooler this is very
much needed as the predecessor is much
louder and have solved that with this
new design it will spin at constant rpm
regardless of the CPU load the heatsink
is much larger than before but not
overly large that they will fit in
pretty much all modern cases except
where low-profile coolers are needed as
it is quite a bit taller than aim these
previous stock solution the wrath cooler
is rated at 125 watt heat dissipation
and acoustically is 1/10 of the noise
output compared to the previous cooler
which is amazing so the goal here was
silence and they have achieved that
perfectly well but actual cooling
performance at load is comparable to
what you would get with the smaller
predecessor it will ship with only
select aim the processors and is not
meant to fully replace the older cooler
and we are told it will not sell
separately we also got at ease of aim
these next gen Polaris GPU in terms of
power consumption they had two identical
systems running Star Wars Battlefront
with vsync locked at 60fps the system on
the left was running in the GTX 950
while the system on the right had this
undisclosed aim the polaris card with
total system power draw on display and
it seems there is that 65 watt
difference when taking everything is
equal so we are super excited to see how
AMD was able to tackle this power
efficiency and the last announcement was
the new aim D a.m. for socket letting us
know that Zen based CPUs are almost here
the socket will be compatible with ap
use and CPUs support for ddr4 and
released in mid-2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
