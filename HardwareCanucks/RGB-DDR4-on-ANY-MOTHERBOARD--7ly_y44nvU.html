are majority of your components will be
RGB compatible so that means you can
think the lighting from your PC case to
your motherboard to the cooler to the
cooler fans the graphics card will for
sure have some RGB elements in there
somewhere
power supplies not so popular RGB
storage is not there yet but system
memory in particular RGB system memory
is here so let's see if it's here to
stay
creativity is fueled by the best
instruments it doesn't always come easy
and in the process you often realize how
important quality is the Rd 400 by OCC
gives you quality and speed with M de 2
interface the Shiban and flash and a pci
bracket making it possible to focus on
what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty and what I have on hand is a 16
gigabyte 32 hundred megahertz Evo X DVR
for kids from gale jail q I don't know
now this kit is not perfect but it's a
very good way to test the waters on
users acceptance of our GB memory in the
first place and g.skill recently came
out with their trigons the RGB kits that
are fully software controllable although
there are some compatibility issues with
some chipsets and the beta software
doesn't work with x99 so this hardware
gaming memory yep it actually sells out
on the package tries to mitigate those
compatibility concerns with a physical
color switch on each dim letting me
choose between red green blue or the RGB
color cycle and so the concept is future
friendly and lighting is not being
locked down by software but first of all
the plastic switch rattles and the body
doesn't really have that high quality
feel despite having some aluminum plate
and the LED module at the top is no
low-profile at all it's about 6
centimeters and
- total for the entire them and here it
is next to some low profile and just
standard memory kits and the evil ex
will just may be too tall for many CPU
tower heat sinks so maybe in a AO is
recommended with these and whose idea
was it to color the plastic switch in
red instead of something less striking
for this RGB component that is
definitely the rule number one for
neutral color design is to make
everything neutral so you can color
things with those lighting components in
the package we get two cables and it
seems that Gail definitely care about
color neutrality as a red cables are
visible on one and RGB tips on the other
so to power the lights without the
software you need to use this three pin
fan header with individual connectors
into each Tim the cables pretty long
it's actually quite easy to hide but if
only it was a standard black cable
without the red but who cares about
attention to detail when you have
hardcore gaming in the product line and
with the dim powered with the three thin
pen header you can manually switch
between the blue green red and the RGB
cycle / dim and it's always fading in
and out something that you have no
control over and that's one of my least
favorite things about the illumination
on Ram in general I also dislike the
lack of consistent diffusion on that
transparent top portion as you can
clearly see there are some brighter
spots along the strip and it's not
really pretty and the only reason why
you'd want to use these in manual
control is if one of three colors suits
your build perfectly and also if you
don't have a compatible motherboard for
software control which is where the
second way to power the LEDs comes into
play so we have this 12 volt RGB
connector which is on the opposite side
of them and connects to the RGB
connector on your motherboard to allow
you to think and control the lighting of
your RAM and the rest of your components
through software so it's basically a
true two in one solution but be careful
only one method is allowed to be used at
once so only one of the cables needs to
be plugged in for illumination
so you either power it the other 12-volt
RGB connectors or go through the three
pins and header
so now what I've done is connected the
ram into my Maximus 8 kilo alpha
motherboard with D 12 volt RGB connector
so I can control the memory led through
the aura software on the AC side or you
have an MSI board you can do that same
thing with mystic like sync which is
their own implementation of the same
thing so here let's check out how
accurate these colors are first of all
the red channel looks very nice and you
can go into the purples and they look
pretty nice I said the N 60 X 62 cooler
behind me in this light blue just for
reference for you are we're on how those
colors can change so it's quite simple
to color match based on your other
lighting inside you case - you know
within this half of the spectrum between
the blues and the purples and the red
however when we enter into this green
arena it looks absolutely terrible for
example right now we have the highest
intensity of the light and the greens
look like they look super washed out
there's no color in that it looks white
with a little hint of green the same
thing continues as we approach the
yellows which is so disappointing right
now we are in the yellow spectrum and
all we see is just again just washed out
orange so it's it's quite disappointing
to not have any color definition within
the orange or the green spectrum and
that might be disappointing if you want
to you know choose GPU a CPU temperature
in fact because that's all it's doing
looking into the greens and the yellows
the orange is fine but you know my CPU
temperature right now is under 30
so we're should be in the greens and
that looks absolutely terrible
so the only way to really highlight the
greens is if you to not really go into
the color cycle effect because the green
still doesn't show up but if you were to
manually select the green through the
that little slider switch on the actual
memory when it comes to the breathing
effect it's quite uniform it's nice that
follows in for both DRAM slots
equally so there's consistency and not
like randomness that goes on but I do
like the the static nature of
DRM and being able to change the color
of it the only thing is that obviously
it's not consistent throughout for the
blues it's fine but if you choose any
other color like in the Purple's also
you can still see the inconsistency of
the lighting spread throughout that
transparent portion at the top and
that's just disappointing that's not
what you want to see from you know an
LED specific memory kit so that maybe
they should definitely work on that
improving that so that it looks much
prettier and that's it for our first
look on this RGB memory I really love
the concept of combining software and
manual control into one but the evil x
kit is far from perfect design wise I
think more companies should be pushing
with subtle color accents and soft
diffusion especially when it comes to
RGB components I would want to see more
quality of a quantity when it comes to
color and so the only thing that's left
to receive the RGB treatment is Rams
moving forward needs to be better
storage maybe like RGB SSDs and then
power supplies so between those three
components where would you like the
focus of companies to prioritize on
proper lighting implementation let me
know in the comments down below
I'm Dmitry how it's not stick much for
watching we'll see you to the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
