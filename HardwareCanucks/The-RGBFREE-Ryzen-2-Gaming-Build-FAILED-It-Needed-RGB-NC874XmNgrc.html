hard-working axe and it feels like a
long time since I've done a gaming PC
build video on the channel so what did I
do well I built a gaming PC but this
time with a little bit of twist
you see it's 2018 I get it people really
care about RGB you know if they're
trying to build a gaming PC they
probably look for a component with RGB
lighting whether that's you know
motherboard RAM CPU cooler fans GPU case
the list just keeps going on but I
wanted this bill to be RGB free at least
I tried to achieve that in the beginning
by choosing components that were pretty
affordable that had unique designs in
terms of aesthetics but at the end I
actually had to add a few RGB fans to
make the build pop a little bit and as
you can see it's not overly done it's
pretty subtle so I kind of like the way
how it is it's not glowing with RGB
lighting so it's pretty low-key but it
does showcase V aesthetics and I want to
focus this built primarily on aesthetics
not lighting but aesthetics so asu's
decided to team up with a few key
players in the gaming industry to expand
their top gaming brand so this includes
brands like Coolermaster Corsair team
group memory and a few more to promote
their tough branding it's actually one
of the main reasons why I thought this
PC would look amazing without lighting
the colors just all go together so well
what's really unique about this build is
that the theme is sort of consistent
across the board but most importantly
it's got some serious power under the
hood and it costs less than $1,500 which
is definitely you know if not super
expensive but relatively along the lines
of getting you the best you know sort of
gaming performance along with aesthetics
because a lot of people care about that
these days so we didn't want to cheap
out on a lot of components but we also
wanted to sort of create a balance
between again the performance and
physical looks so without any further
ado let's check this out but first a
quick message from our sponsor so you're
looking for something with class good
value comfortably populated an ATX
motherboard are you it's all about the
users
and great airflow who knew your
temperatures would drop that low route
the cables behind the cover illuminate
your hardware with built-in LEDs the age
500 I is for you to discover this one's
in real life not in your dreams say
hello to the link below the aged 500
series from NZ XD is a go alright so the
choice for my CPU was the Rison 520 600
X that costs around 230 dollars it
features six cores with 12 threads comes
with the base conquer 3.6 gigahertz with
a boost up to 4.2 this should be plenty
enough for gaming as well as some light
content creation thanks to the inclusion
of 12 threads plus with a little bit of
aura clocking we might be able to
squeeze just again a little bit of
performance out of the CPU housing the
2600 X is the Asus top x4 70 + gaming
motherboard and to be honest this
component was an inspiration for the
whole tough themed build because the PCB
features this cool digital camouflage
with the light orange accents giving it
quite the unique look I especially love
how the right side of the board has this
angular cutout and that just adds to the
aesthetics of this whole build now being
a tough series board expect high-quality
components like ESD cards to prevent
electrostatic discharge tough chokes
that delivers steady power to the CPU
tough capacitors and MOSFETs the i/o is
fairly limited but it should be adequate
enough to power your peripherals and
other accessories there are two MDOT two
slots with one of them supporting PCIe
nvme drives and a whole bunch of other
features that make this a solid x4 70
motherboard now to cool the 2600 X I
could have easily gone with the included
weights pyre cooler out of the box but
if you recall watching my Rison 526 our
next review I wasn't actually able to
overclock the processor with the
included cooler because it just wasn't
able to adequately cool the CPU so I had
to go with an aftermarket solution in
order to get some results so given that
this is a tough team build I picked this
the cooler master master air ma 620 P
top gaming Edition that was a mouthful
but none of the less it really
complements a tough motherboard because
it's got the digital camouflage that
perfectly matches the motherboard plus
the included fans feature the light
orange accents and given the duel tower
heatsink design you should
have a problem overclocking the 2600 ex
bus it should keep the CPU relatively
cool now the fans do come with RGB
lining but for the sake of simplicity
with this build I'll be disabling that
on this cooler
moving on to memory and this was a
no-brainer I knew exactly what I needed
for this build because this kit caught
everyone's attention at Computex so I
had to get my hands on it right away
meet the team group T force Vulcan tough
condition 16 gigabyte ddr4 kit clonked
at 3000 megahertz it doesn't have any
fancy RGB lining but it does feature the
tough branding with the camouflage that
again looks very unique compared to the
competition and given its weighted
speeds it should help a little bit with
performance okay so for storage I chose
the Toshiba RC 100 240 gigabyte nvme SSD
what's really fascinating about this
drive is its form factor and the
performance you get for the price this
little guy costs less than $80 and
sports read speeds well over 1.6
gigabytes per second and write speeds
over a gigabyte per second again 480
dollars and that's incredible
considering that there are SATA based
SSDs in the market for the exact same
cost toshiba was able to do this by
leveraging their expertise in NAND flash
to design an entire SSD that fits within
a single BGA package featuring their
state-of-the-art 3d by CS flash that
delivers fast performance in a power
efficient manner and there's also the
form factor it's very tiny and cute
coming in at just 42 millimeters in
length plus installing it on the
motherboard should be a breeze for
storing my game library Western Digital
4 terabyte blue caviar hard drive should
do the trick one of the cool features
with AMD's x4 7e platform is the
inclusion of AMD's store mi technology
and this essentially creates an array
combining your nvme SSD or SATA basicity
whatever that is with the traditional
mechanical hard drive and of course the
RAM to sort of create this single
operating system drive that it reads as
a whole Drive so this actually reduces
game load times it accelerates
performance so I do plan on
investigating store mi on a later video
and of course see how it plays out
in terms of real-world performance and
perhaps compared to Intel's offering
which is obtained so definitely stay
tuned for that video but store mi should
translate really well with this bill
because
we've got P R C 100 which is a fast nvme
SSD along with a 4 terabyte gigantic
hard drive so all in all if we find a
way to sort of optimize this system and
by using a feature I think we're looking
at a pretty awesome system for a really
good price and now onto my GPU of choice
I chose these Strix gtx 1066 gigabyte in
fact this is a discontinued card as of
right now and it was the only one i had
lying around the studio so i just
decided to throw it in its direct cu2
design is pretty awesome with the wing
blade fans that stay silent during idle
operations boost clocks are expected to
go well over 1800 megahertz it doesn't
come with any fancy RGB lighting which
is pretty much what we wanted and while
the red accents might be a bit of a
mismatch it won't really show once we've
installed a GPU inside the case and as i
mentioned earlier it is a discontinued
card so i'll leave links to some
alternative components down in the
description I think a really cool
alternative to the Strix GTX 1060 is the
EVGA 1060 superclocked Edition it costs
less than three hundred dollars it's a
six key buy variant it's super compact
and it should really go well with the
build because again it doesn't have any
RGB lining and it's also pretty
affordable now that being said I'm
actually a little bit disappointed with
aces not being able to launch a GPU with
the tough branding because they're the
ones who sort of started this whole
series so it doesn't make sense as to
why they haven't come out with a
graphics card featuring the tough of
color scheme because it would have
looked awesome I mean imagine a GPU with
the tough with a shroud and the digital
camouflage with the orange accents man
that would have definitely suited this
build but perhaps we could expect that
with the new GPU launches that we're
sort of hearing about that in the rumors
so yeah we'll see powering the whole
system is the cooler master master watch
750 tough gaming addition power supply
this is yet another product from the top
gaming Alliance and you can clearly see
that with the exterior design it's a
semi modular PSU with an 80 plus bronze
certification and it should be plenty
enough to power the entire system and it
gives you a little bit of room for
upgrade ability down the road but it's
also super quiet and during idle and
load operations the case of choice is
the cooler master master box 500 top
gaming Edition 88
enclosure this wraps up the styling of
the entire PC with the camouflage
imprints pretty much everywhere so that
includes the front panel the close to
side panel as well as the main tempered
glass panel it really does look amazing
in person and even better with a fully
functioning PC inside and it doesn't
really require a ton of RGB line
components to highlight the exterior
design as you can still achieve that non
RGB look and it'll highlight the tough
branding really well during the daytime
where there's lots of natural light
there's plenty of airflow for both
intake and exhaust no restrictions
whatsoever and for $80 this is certainly
a unique a/c in the market so now that
you've taken a look at the parts list
for this PC let's actually put it
together actually it's built already
sitting right behind me duh but I happen
to film the b-roll or I happen to film
some b-roll of me putting it together so
let's that's the world of montage
and so here is the final system boy does
it look very unique in my opinion in
fact it's probably one of my favorite
pcs that I've ever built here in the
office certainly enjoying the way how it
looks the digital camouflage around the
build including the motherboard the
cooler and the RAM just really adds to
the overall aesthetics of this PC and it
really does look amazing there's again
plenty of room for upgrade ability down
the road and of course the lack of RGB
makes it certainly look unique in good
lending conditions you can easily spot
the orange or light yellow accents from
the memory the cooler and the
motherboard the GPU not so much but it
is what it is and I like that now as I
mentioned in the beginning of this video
I actually decided to add a few RGB fans
to the build to add a subtle effect not
super glowing but to add some character
to the build and the end result has
definitely grown on me in this case I
replaced the stock fans that came with a
chassis with thermal takes ring plus
fans and what's interesting about this
set is its muted glow effect on the
frame rather than the spill effect you
get with some other fans through the
blades it looks really stealth and I
like that the good thing is that it
doesn't take away anything in terms of
aesthetics but rather I think it gives
an extra 10 to 20 points just for looks
I'm aware that I started this build with
the RGB free theme in mind but needless
to say I have fallen for RGB in a good
way at least I think but what you guys
think RGB on or RGB off let me know in
the comments down below and the last
thing to discuss here is performance I
did manage to overclock the Rison five
2600 X to four point one five gigahertz
at one point for two of eyeballs using
the Indies rice and master software
fairly intuitive process you just have
to open the software bump up the voltage
and of course the frequencies well hit
apply and you're set to go
super simple love how the way it works
and I did also manage to overclock the
memory to 3000 megahertz I did not
experience any BSO DS while stress
testing so that's fantastic
and really just proves the fact that
memory compatibility with the Rison is
definitely maturing so that's good news
but I also did manage to come
pair of run some synthetic tests and
compare the stock versus overclocked
setting to see if we're actually getting
some performance so let's kick things
off with Cinebench r15 and as you can
see there is a slight improvement in
terms of performance so you're looking
at 1333 at stock settings compared to
1401 moving on to the Adobe Media
encoder test I took a 12-minute 4k
project with GHI footage and I exported
it to the YouTube 4k precent
and in stock settings the system took 23
minutes and 50 seconds compared to 22
minutes and 27 seconds with the
overclock and it's not a significant
difference because you're only looking
about a little over a minute of a
difference which isn't that significant
but you will certainly notice the
rendering decrease if you go with
something like the 2700 X and now on to
some gimme performance and I'm gonna
give you guys a heads up don't expect a
significant improvement in terms of
frame rates when compared to stock and
overclocked because as you can see with
3d mark firestrike there isn't a
significant difference with both stock
and overclocked setting we have
battlefield 1 and 1080p set to ultra
settings and as you can see pretty much
identical results and then moving on to
overwatch at 1080p and epoch the same
story realized that you're only looking
at 1 FPS difference which is just
nothing and then we have doom at 1080p
set to ultra using the Vulkan API and
stock settings we got 120 8.5 compared
to one twenty nine point two with the
overclocked saying so again not a
significant difference in that title as
well so it really comes down to GPU
restrictions because this case we are
using a 1060 so that's certainly a
factor to consider but most importantly
you know what start saying is this the
frequencies are actually over 4
gigahertz because you've got XFR to
running the background so you could
technically leave your CPU running at
stock speeds and that should yield ooh
about the same performance when compared
to overclock so technically you could
have gone with the right spot color but
you know I just decided to go with
something a little bit more tough themed
so that's that CP temperatures are
respectable I'd say so I used hardware
monitor to monitor the CP temps and used
Ida 64 FP low tests to stress tester
CPUs for 15 minutes and it's talked the
CPU was idling around 30
foresee with a low temp of 75 C and an
overclocked obviously that bumped it up
because we're running at one point four
to five volts and as you can see an idle
were hovering around forty six degree
Celsius and eighty-eight degrees Celsius
under Ludd which is actually not that
impressive considering it's an air
cooler so temperatures are definitely
not favoring for this kind of an
overclock setting for the 2600 X and of
course the cooler master air cooler so
having looked at the gaming performance
comparing the stock versus overclocked
setting it's clear or it's actually
makes a lot more sense to leave the CPU
at stock settings because really not
getting that much of a performance and
you can certainly expect lower
temperatures now it also did manage to
monitor the GPU core frequencies on the
strict GTX 1060 which is discontinued at
the moment but interestingly enough it
actually the maximum achievable clock
that I got was nineteen forty nine
megahertz which is insane
considering the form factor and the size
so that's pretty awesome and that about
wraps up this video I hope you enjoyed
this one in fact I had a lot of fun
building this PC because I didn't have
to worry about a lot of RTV components
and playing around with the lighting
cables and all that kind of stuff super
just it's just a super simple build and
file that thermaltake fans were actually
easier to install because it was just
one controller box that plugs into the
USB 2.0 header and that was it I didn't
have to worry about plugging in the fan
cables to the motherboard because
everything is controlled via the
controller box easily tuck that away on
the backside so it just works right away
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this
build what are your what's your take on
the whole top gaming Alliance and the
way how asus is sort of collaborating
with these key players like Coolermaster
corsair team group memory and a few more
love to hear your thoughts on that if I
were to change one thing with this build
that would be the power supply not
specifically the power supply by itself
but the cables now it is a semi modular
power supply I really wish it if it was
fully modular so I could have come with
something like Hakeem wants custom
extensions with the orange and black
sleeves so that would have looked really
awesome with this build but that's the
only thing that I wish I would have
changed also let me know what you guys
think about the performance of this PC
I'm more specifically would you have
swamped one component for another and of
course if you have any alternatives I'd
love to take a look at that in the
comments also links to purchase all
these components will be in the
