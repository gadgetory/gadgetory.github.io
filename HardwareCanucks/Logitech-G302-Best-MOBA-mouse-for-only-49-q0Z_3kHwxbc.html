great technology selection and service
hey guys Eva here with hauberk onyx and
Logitech has been organizing their
gaming mice lineup from the g 300s all
the way up to the G 700 s with various
flexible price points that gamers
appreciate so today we're taking a look
at their newest addition to the product
lineup the GE theory or - data Lea's
prime Gaming Mouse priced at $50 this
attractive price point does feel
tempting but is it worth the investment
let's take a look the build quality of
the G 302 feels solid with its hard
plastic material the textures in the
body itself is comfortable to use and
it's kind of like a silky smooth texture
ergonomically the mouse is well shaped
in a unique way compared to many other
gaming mice that you've encountered the
body is symmetrical and is really meant
for claw tight grip given with its
elevated rear portion of the frame
however palmtop grip is still fine but
the narrowing of the back is less ideal
for full hand support at 87 grams the G
302 is probably the lightest Mouse that
I've used so far the weight is
distributed equally with movement there
is no customizable weights to suit the
users needs and as for the price I think
we're asking for a little too much
the Teflon feet at the bottom of the
mouse complements a smooth glide and I
didn't notice any signs of peeling since
we did experience that issue with the
bigger brother the g5 a - well done
Logitech the G 302 is equipped with a
4000 dpi optical sensor which delivered
the best possible tracking experience
and I did enjoy my typical 800 to 1600
API setting for gaming the sensor does
track on dark and white surfaces but not
on glass so that's something to keep in
mind there are six buttons on the G 302
prime primary left and right buttons
scroll click button the DPI shift button
behind the scroll wheel and the two side
browser buttons I was surprised to not
see any browser buttons on the right
side for left hand users given the mouse
is symmetrical but for right hand users
this eliminates the annoyance of
accidentally
meeting them if they were there the
primary left and right buttons respond
well with excellent hard bounce and
light enough to click to score over five
registrations per second logitech
designed this with the help of mobile
players and it passed with flying colors
the scroll wheel is also light to press
with distinct scroll steps which is
definitely a positive feature for FPS
games especially at this price point the
DPI shift button is well within reach
with your point finger and since it's a
single click you get five dpi steps you
either have to cycle through all five to
return to the original or make the DPI
sensitivity the same on every other step
this way you don't have to cycle through
in terms of lighting logitech stepped it
up and this feels like next-level stuff
the logo is well-defined and bright
without any visible grading and the two
pattern blowing LEDs on both the left
and the right side look amazing it
showcases the school pattern that looks
stunning in the dark especially how it
casts the lighting projections on the
surface and where Toula gatech uses
lasers on the production line to make
sure both lighting casts are exactly
identical otherwise the mouse is
rejected there's a breathing mode and
off switch but what would really be
awesome is interchangeable plates on the
sides that you can 3d print for custom
lighting casts of your gaming plan and
full RGB spectrum for extra lighting
flexibility we can't complain because
this is still quality execution the
driver software looks clean and elegant
the user is greeted with the option to
save the profiles to the onboard memory
or the automatic game detection program
that's built inside the driver software
the button mapping is well organized
with a physical layout of the mouse with
proper labeling on the left side and
towards the right the option to change
the DPI settings with up to five
different levels and the option to
change the polling rate is also a
welcome feature inside the lighting tab
you can adjust the brightness and the
speed of the effect so for $50 we
weren't expecting much customization
anyway and this is still good in the end
logitech has managed to create an
affordable Mouse with strong elements
throughout like quality body switches
optical sensor and unique lighting to
tie this
to a damn good value Gaming Mouse really
the only thing to keep in mind is the
shape that isn't totally supportive for
the palm but I guess you can't have it
all for $50 thank you so much for
