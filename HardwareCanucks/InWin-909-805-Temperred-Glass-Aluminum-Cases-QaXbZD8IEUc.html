thanks to the following sponsors
show them some love for helping us get
here to Taipei so aside from showing off
the H tower in win' has been hard at
work redesigning and taking feedback
from the community on their tempered
glass and aluminum cases so the first
one I'd like to point out is the in win
909 being a 900 series case it shares
many similar elements from the 904 and
the 901 like this open pocket at the
bottom at the front that is your intake
area actually supports dual 120mm intake
fans and a magnetic dust filter attached
to the bottom as well with the side IO
that has USB C tab connector integrated
I'm happy that we saw this trend pick up
at Computex the panels are tempered
glass and mounted in a standard way with
4 thumb screws and you really gotta love
the material choices for this in one
case behind the panel the interior
layout actually seems pretty good and of
course we'll have to do our own building
process but everything is in its own
compartments with a hard drive cage
above the build there are two fan
brackets right at the front with some
spacing behind the front panel so the
fans can actually breathe the power
supply area is in its own compartment
but in wind has learned from the past to
make it more open for easier cable
management and above the power supply is
a rotated dual fan bracket with two five
and a quarter inch drive base right
below for installation of fan
controllers like they have done here or
maybe even optical drives with what
looks like enough spacing and for the
motherboard IO they are still utilizing
the stealth design where you would route
all the cables for your GPU
USB stuff and the power at the back but
I think the main thing to take away from
this is an improved layout from the
original 904 that was a bit of a
disappointment
so this still would make more sense for
showcase build but I'm still happy with
what has changed for this contemporary
slash modern caliber of a case and
they're also releasing this in black red
aside from the traditional sort of
silver and black they're also showing
off their new in win 805 that is geared
more towards of a less extreme system
but with a similar build quality and
materials used
side panels are still tempered-glass and
so is that front that makes the case
really stand out having this glass box
with aluminum frame with one a coolest
front panel designs that I've seen on
the show floor as the illumination
behind the honeycomb will highlight this
pattern making the case look really
fantastic plus we'll have two color
options the black gold and the black red
and on the interior there's a modular
drive cage that can be moved off the
floor to the front panel it will rely on
this front to rear air flow direction or
the totally solid aluminum top and the
rear side panel is also just a tempered
glass panel that should encourage clean
cable management I noticed this angled
power supply shroud that I think looks
really good and helps to separate the
components a bit inside and I'm really
liking in which design approach with
these cases prioritizing on the
presentation but also improving on many
things for the internals to also be
functional</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
