axe and si es is just a few months away
so I'm starting to prepare myself for
that week because we'll be shooting a
lot of b-roll transfering footage back
and forth for editing and uploading to
the channel so I was looking for a
portable and reliable external storage
solution that could speed up our
workflow Samsung t3 portable SSD has
been widely popular amongst some fellow
youtubers I know
due to its capacity and durability so I
wanted to test it for myself to see if
it can actually hold up to our standards
but before that quick look at our
sponsor Toshiba now offering OCC
products that are awesome and affordable
like the Rd 400 TR 150 and vt1 80 that
are backed by advanced warranty program
now stronger than ever
under Toshiba I was amazed at how the t3
looked when I picked it up in the first
place it's compact well-constructed and
beautifully crafted I've been using the
silicon power 860 1 terabyte hard drive
from the honor series for past events
and it's still holding up pretty well
but just comparing these side-by-side I
was just staring at both of them for a
while and it's truly amazing to see how
small these devices have become now
before I get too far into this review
let's take a quick look at what this
drive offers this is the 500 gigabyte
model which costs $200 though Samsung
offers 250 gigabyte one terabyte and 2
terabyte models that range in price from
$99 all the way up to an eye-watering
$800 at just ten point five millimeters
thick and a footprint of 74 by 58
millimeters it can easily fit into a
carry-on luggage without taking up the
central space it certainly won't weigh
me down like the hard drive based a 60
did Samsung claims their t3 is fast too
and it's hard to find any fault with
this since it uses wien and technology
that not only boosts internal speeds but
also supposed to offer increased NAND
cell lifespan to get that power on the
road the t3 comes with a USB 3.1 gen2 on
type-c connector and a type C to type a
cable one thing to note is that the USB
3.1 gen2 on interface is simply a
rebrand of USB 3.0
which means this Drive offers speeds of
up to 450 megabytes per second under
ideal conditions provided your system
supports the uas-b protocol
another interesting add-on here is
Samsung's portable SSD Android app which
allows the t-3 to interface directly
with a compatible phone though you'll
need an adapter cable for that when
compared to something like the $70
Armour a sixty one terabyte which is
shockproof water-resistant and carries
and ipx4 rating the $200 Samsung t3
seems expensive but it has the size and
speed on its side so how fast is it
compared to the h-60 let's start with
synthetic benchmarks I fired a crystal
disk mark and tested these drives by
sending the number of tests at five and
a file size of one gigabyte the results
do speak for themselves the t3 averaged
a read and write speeds just a little
north of 400 megabytes per second
whereas the a 60 average close to 140
megabytes per second for read and 131
megabytes per second for right moving on
to a totus benchmark a program that
tests the drives read and write speeds
using incremental file sizes the t3
dished out 456 megabytes per second on
read and 420 megabytes per second on
write these numbers remind me of the
Intel 520 series SSD that was inside my
XPS 15 a while back anyways the a 60
pumped out at respectable 101 megabytes
per second on read and 109 megabytes per
second on right now onto some real-world
tests I transferred a 46 gigabyte folder
packed with 4k videos back and forth
between the computer and the drives
starting with the a 60 that whole folder
took 7 minutes to transfer to the
desktop averaging between 100 to 110
megabytes per second performing that
backwards took roughly the same time
averaging similar speeds switching over
to the t3 transferring the same folder
to the desktop took 2 minutes
averaging close to 400 megabytes per
second transferring back to 30 seconds
longer which made sense because the
write speeds were topping out at 320
megabytes per second still damn fast in
my opinion my last test was to copy and
paste a game folder in this case or
watch this consists of files ranging
from kilobytes to gigabytes and it
give you a rough idea of how long it
could take to transfer large folders
made up of hundreds of files and the t3
did it in 30 seconds whereas the a60
took three minutes to complete while the
gap is fairly minimal for one folder it
can get bigger when transferring your
entire Steam library that's probably
more than 200 to 300 gigabytes so what
can we take away from this the t3 is
hands-down a much faster Drive compared
to my a 60 but that was expected given
Samsung's use of fast
solid-state storage by performing these
tests I'm convinced that this drive
should keep up very well with our
production when we're out of our Studios
covering events the slim form factor
plus the shock resistant feature is
always a welcome addition however the
consistent performance on the a 60 even
after two years of harsh use does
complement the reliability factor given
there's a spinning drive inside it's
also waterproof so that's always a bonus
for me it should also be interesting to
see how the t3 holds up under those same
conditions price will also be a big
factor for anyone looking to move
towards an external SSD so that
concludes my quest to find a fast and
reliable external storage solution for
editing on the go but I have a question
for you guys is the t3 worth the hefty
price tag or are there any alternative
solutions that might give the t3 a run
for its money feedback is always
appreciated
I mean bear with hurricane axe thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
