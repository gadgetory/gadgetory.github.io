want to cut the cord where the cable is
bothering you or you maybe don't have a
bungee or you simply don't like the look
of cables in your setup and what's
minimal clean space and it's why I love
the wireless g43
the performance is fantastic the shape
is good but having to recharge this
thing every two to three days is just
not something that I'm into and having
something like this the master 2s that
you don't have to recharge for 90 days
but the performance for gaming is not in
the same level as this guy so large deck
has a solution with the G power play
allows you to charge the mouse while
you're using it on this mouse pad so you
don't look so evil wanting to correct
all your cords let's get started
creativity is fueled by the best
instruments it doesn't always come easy
and in the process you often realize how
important quality is the Rd 400s BIOS
easy gives you quality and speed with M
de tu interface the Shiban and flash and
a PCI bracket making it possible to
focus on what matters
investing storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty and so the power play is
expensive it's basically a $99 mouse pad
with the ability to charge your mouse
but they can only charge the latest a
large section of 3 and the 9:03 mice due
to this proprietary nature of the
charging module and you cannot use your
existing g43 or the g 900 mice so an
upgrade path is non-existent from the
previous iterations so you get two mouse
pad surfaces one fabric one and one
plastic one both with excellent tracking
but the fabric has no texture on the
bottom so it's not usable on its own
because it just glides all over the
place while the harder service can be
used on its own but it's also a little
bit thicker and adds a little bit too
much height to the whole mousepad
alright so for reference here's my set
up of course angled keyboards very large
mouse pad and the g pro on top of it
inside a mouse bungee so cable wise I
don't mind the way this looks you know
two additional cables from my
peripherals is not an issue although I
wish that my keyboard was wireless but
mechanical
I was keyboard there's still a little
bit farther away and for the mouse
because I'm using the bungee it really
is not an issue so it's time to plug
this thing in so we can power while we
play
all right so this is what the G
power-play looks like in action of
course we eliminate the cable on the
mouse so that's nice and three but the
mouse path has to be connected something
so I'm reusing my bungee so that it
controls that cable so doesn't just span
across the desk like that so the mouse
pad has to be plugged in so it can pass
the power so you can charge the mice and
also there is a second very sort of
functionality built in into this plastic
frame here aside from the RGB
illumination is that there is a receiver
built-in so if you're using any of these
mice on it on top of it you don't
actually have to plug in one of these
you know tiny moon and receivers into
your PC by itself you can just use the G
power play and because these products
are sold separately all wireless mice
come with that wireless receiver so you
can potentially leave this inside your
notebook while having power and receiver
charging on your desktop all through
this mouse pad so I appreciate the
receiver being built into the mouse pad
and of course this is a little bit
chunky still but I'm assuming it's
because it also has to connect all the
electronics for the the coil that's
inside here so you can you know charge
the mouse but this was the other option
before if you want the receivers
slightly closer to your mouse you have
this lay well low weighted brick that
would allow you to position it closer to
where your mouse pad was to eliminate
the distance between the two but now
this is very nicely built in so if
you're using the mouse anywhere around
the vicinity you would still pick up and
get tracking even if you're off the
mouse pad because that is the receiver
but you have to be on it in order to
charge so the charging implementation is
actually quite clever using the original
pocket where you could add the magnetic
weight but now you can populate it
instead with a power core module for
charging so it's basically acting like a
bridge between the mouse pad and the
battery inside the mouse and since the
entire base is generating this energy
field you're constantly getting power
even if you're moving the mouse around
so you can still charge it if you're
slightly lift the mouse too so there's
about one centimeter lift off charging
distance and there is a convenient
non-distracting LED below the G to
indicate charging and I'm happy to
report that the LED stays on when your
system is powered off to end
okay the mouse is charging overnight now
it is important to not bend the
powerplay base as the circuits inside of
it are very delicate and I do wonder if
there any health effects on your wrist
with it being so close to this constant
energy field that is being generated by
the power play base so what is it like
not having to worry about charging your
mouse ever so as a concept it's awesome
but from my experience the battery
readings have not been entirely
consistent so for example after three
hours of using the mouse with the lights
on
we went from 18% to 15% so there was
that slight drop but leading the mouse
idle for 10 minutes we get extra juice
so the charging I think is intentionally
slow to preserve the battery life of the
battery inside of here and also make
sure that the mouse never dies if you
experience any decreases in battery it
will refill as soon as the mouse is idle
plus it's recharging overnight when your
system is off to make sure that you
never get dead mouse and so the concept
power play is amazing since while is
gaining mice to becoming so good with
performance latency sensors all that
stuff but it's also very expensive at
$99 and it only works with the two mice
at the moment and it's not backwards
compatible with previous versions for
the g4 3 or the 900 and the size of the
mouse pad while good I did get
accustomed to larger pads for a lower
dpi with games but where I see this
technology going forward is obviously
expanding that area of where your
peripherals can charge may be moving
into direction of charging a wireless
mechanical keyboard that will be amazing
charging your mouse charging your phone
and I'm happy that large stick is
introduced to products that is working
and that you can buy now and of course
it's expensive but that is being the
nullity of being first and so that's it
