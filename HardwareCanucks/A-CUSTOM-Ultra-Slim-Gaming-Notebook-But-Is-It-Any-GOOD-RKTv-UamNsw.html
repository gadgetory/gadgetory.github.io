CES is over I'm back here in the studio
getting back to the normal grind but I'm
gonna kick things off with this the
eurocom q5 gaming laptop Uemura called
this notebook from a video that I did
last month we teamed up with Samsung to
create a how-to guide on upgrading you
know notebooks traditional hard drive to
an nvme SSD and we talked about the
performance benefits so if you're
interested to learn more about that you
can check it out right over here now
while I was working on that video I
noticed something interesting about the
display on this notebook because it
sports a 15.6 inch 1080p TN panel at a
refresh rate of 120 Hertz and that got
me to thinking well how is it like
gaming on a panel or on a laptop with a
refresher of 120 Hertz because normally
we do see gaming monitors ranging from a
hundred all the way to 240 Hertz but you
obviously have a slightly larger screen
real estate to work with but how was it
like to actually came out of notebook I
mean I did recently take a look at a
notebook from Asus called the rog
Zephyrus that comes with a 120 Hertz
g-sync display which was absolutely
fantastic
but that thing cost like three thousand
dollars which is kind of ridiculous and
I really didn't like that notebook but
this seems to be on par with what I
would expect but it still has its
limitations so I'm gonna talk about my
experience most importantly we will take
an in-depth look at this notebook and
talk about you know how it performs its
price point actually speaking of its
price point this thing costs $2,000 and
that ain't cheap guys that ain't cheap
anyways let's take a closer look right
after this the new master liquid
all-in-one coolers are available in 120
and 240 millimeter stylish radiator
sizes with air Balance fans included for
best airflow and RGB sync on the pump
and the fans that are controlled via
this hub or through your motherboard
check out the ML 120 ln 240 L down below
ok so let's get down to business if
you're thinking about creating content
say you want to edit photos or videos
with a TN panel don't even think about
it the contrast ratio on this panel
lacks consistency and it doesn't display
colors as accurately as an IPS panel
especially when you're grading here's a
comparison to the gigabyte Aero 15 X
featuring a Pantone certified display
I've used
this notebook to edit our recent CES
videos and I have to admit this thing is
a content creators dream if you're
interested to learn more about this
notebook I'll link the video in the
description down below anyways coming
back to the q5 while the TN panel
suffers color reproduction it shouldn't
pose a problem while gaming since the
number one thing that gamers care about
is higher frame rates lower response
times and possibly a display with a high
refresh rate to complement obviously a
smoother gameplay experience and that's
exactly where the q5 shines with its 120
Hertz refresh rate and 5 millisecond
response time it's very hard to pass
this over an IPS display with a 60 Hertz
refresh rate so there are some
compromises to take when you're going
for a 120 Hertz TN panel versus a 60
Hertz IPS panel but I'd love to hear
your thoughts on IPS versus TN displays
on notebooks are you willing to
compromise on you know a color
reproduction for a high refresh rate or
vice versa on a gaming laptop not on
monitors but on gaming notebooks let us
know in the comments down below I also
did a little bit of an experiment
testing out how high refresh rates could
affect battery life and to my surprise
it really didn't I ran the 3d mark 5
track test on a loop until it drained
the battery on the first run I had the
display set to 120 Hertz and in the
second run I toned it down to 60 I love
the results using Batman and as you can
see there wasn't a difference whatsoever
this is also a really good time to
comment on battery life for the q5 it's
really not that great I mean the maximum
you could squeeze is maybe an hour
depending on what settings you play with
now normal usage would get me roughly 4
to 5 hours depending on you know your
usage but it all comes down to hardware
and software optimizations I don't think
your gum has done a pretty good job when
compared to gigabytes air 15 X but that
guy sports a much larger battery than
the q5 so do keep that in mind let's
move on to the rest of the hardware
first up the design it's alright
definitely not on par with the XPS 15 or
even the Aero 15 x from gigabyte the
chassis is mostly made out of aluminium
and plastic materials and I would give
it a solid 8 out of 10 in my books for
build quality you can spot a few red
accents throughout the body like this
undefined logo then is
here comes branding and les if I'm
mistaken there are subtle red LEDs
beside the logo that complements the
aggressive design the bezels are thick
but that could just mean me because I'm
so spoiled after using the arrow 15 X
the keyboard however is fantastic
there is great tactile feedback they
don't feel mushy when typing but rather
there is a good amount of travel
distance which is awesome they have
received the RGB treatment but you can
only customize the colors either as an
entire set or by three zones using
software I wish they gave users the
option to customize the colors on the
wast key set but perhaps we could expect
that in the next revision the trackpad
is really good thankfully they're using
Windows precision drivers over a LAN or
synaptics so you can take full advantage
of the gesture control within Windows 10
which is a thumbs up from my end there's
a built-in fingerprint reader for your
convenience and it's quick at unlocking
the notebook the dedicated primary left
and right buttons are within comfortable
reach and they don't require too much
force to register and I quite like this
implementation over integrated buttons
but it may not be to your taste port
selection is plenty on the q5 on the
right hand side there is a Kensington
lock a LAN check an SD card reader a SIM
card reader same card reader well I'll
take that a single USB 3.0 port and a
dedicated headphone in my checks
switching over to the left you'll find
power in HDMI 2.0 port 2 mini
DisplayPort 1.3 ports a couple of USB
3.1 gen2 type-c connectors and two more
USB 3.0 type-a ports you won't have to
carry any adapters around because the q5
has you covered it's a lot more than
what you would get with the Aero 15 X
and here's a side-by-side chart
comparing both of them with regards to
how thick or thin they are let's talk
about specs so the q5 features a core i7
7700 HQ quad-core CPU 16 gigabytes of
RAM GTX 1070 in its max Q design a 256
gigabyte Samsung 850 Evo SATA SSD and a
1080p 120 Hertz TN display and this
particular configuration costs $2,200
remember $2,200 and I'm gonna let that
sink into your minds for a moment
because personally in my opinion that's
a complete ripoff because first and
foremost
you're getting a SATA base SSD instead
of nvme at a much lower capacity and if
you try to bump up that storage using
their online configurator you're gonna
be paying a lot more than what you would
normally be doing but I think part of
that premium involves the fact that you
can actually upgrade this notebook and
customize it to the spec you desire you
can't necessarily do that with the Aero
15 X or the ROG Sepphoris because that
would void your warranty and actually
getting into those notebooks is quite
complicated so here's what I would
recommend is you know pick up the very
bare bones basic system so probably get
8 gigabytes of RAM maybe a traditional
hard drive and then pick up the
aftermarket parts so like the 16
gigabyte RAM kit and an nvme SSD from a
retail channel and just upgrade yourself
you're gonna save a lot of money that
route but either way I mean thinking
thinking about it I don't think it still
offers a lot more value because
personally I prefer the arrow 15 X over
the q5 in a lot of ways because that
notebook is priced exactly around $2,000
and it comes with a great design
fantastic display and of course the
performance is just right on par with
the q5 but I just prefer that over over
the q5 so upgradability is fairly simple
on the q5 I'm so glad your comp has
included a warranty void if remote
sticker the user has full control to
upgrade the components so once you have
access to all 11 screws you can open the
lid and you find access to the 2 and
half inch hard drive bracket there's an
MDM 2 slot that can support an nvme
Drive and the RAM is also a gradable as
well switching over to performance the
q5 blazes through most titles at 1080p
set to high settings and this is all
thanks to the gtx 1070 in its a max q
design battlefield 1 at 1080p set to
high averaged well over a hundred frames
per second or watch set to epic I gave
is roughly seventy four frames per
second dooms set at Ultra using the
Vulcan API was blazing through the
gameplay dishing out well over 120
frames per second Tom Clancy's Ghost
Recon wildlands which is a heavily
demanding title averaged around 60
frames per second and this is at the
very high preset you could get away with
some 1440p gaming if you connect the
notebook to an external display but
you'll have to fiddle around with the
settings to get it comfortably
experience now I do have a few concerns
with regards to the acoustic performance
on the q5 because both under idle and
load situations the fans do ramp up
quite often I think this is probably due
to the cooling solution being integrated
to cool the gtx 1070 max-q
but most importantly the was keyboard
the wast area section of the notebook
got relatively warm while gaming and it
was kind of comfortable or uncomfortable
because my palms got or my fingers got
sweaty and yeah overall it wasn't really
a pleasing experience so that's
something to keep in mind if you're
considering new york on q5 CP and GP
temperatures were really good and this
makes sense because the fan was trying
so hard to cool both the components so
as you can see I got around 45 degrees
idle with the CPU and around 84 C under
load and this is during our height of 64
stress test during gaming the GPU God is
far a 74 C which is not bad it's
definitely respectable but I thought the
whole idea of Max Q was to give users
higher performance and a relatively thin
inform factor without sacrificing on
thermal efficiency but unfortunately the
q5 struggles to checkmark some of those
tests
and so this brings me to the conclusion
the eurocom q5 is an interesting
notebook in a lot of ways I mean for one
you have a lot of options to play around
with especially when configuring the
notebook to the spec you like the only
problem is that find that it's a 2015
notebook with 2017 specs because the
design is not that outstanding
especially when compared to the Aero 15
X I can go back to using a notebook with
thicker bezels the performance is great
given that it has a gtx 1070 and it's
max q design you can blaze through 1080p
gaming you can also get away with some
1440p gaming as well but be mindful that
the notebook does get louder under
gaming and sometimes even idle scenarios
where the fan just ramps up randomly so
I just found that to be a really odd
situation because I've never experienced
something like that on the air 15 X the
last thing that I want to touch base on
is the price point because at $2,000 I
really can't recommend this notebook
after using the air 15 X and I've been
saying the air 15 X or I've been
comparing this notebook to the air 15 X
throughout the video but guys it makes
total sense
that notebook is a lot better than the
q5 it has a beautiful display the design
is absolutely great I love the thin
bezels yeah just probably go get the air
15 X escape this guy but I'd love to
hear your thoughts on the eurocom q5
gaming laptop what do you guys think
about the notebook you know is it worth
its price are you a fan of the design
are you okay with it let us know in the
comments down below most importantly I
would love to hear your thoughts on IPS
versus TN displays on notebooks would
you consider taking a sacrifice for a
high refresh rate but rather a poor
color reproduction or vice versa leave
your thoughts in the comments I made
with hurricane X thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
