is brought to you by and cix technology
connected alright so coming on to this
workstation msi laptops this is it
incorporates the basic foundations of
what msi has been sort of going forward
with so you still have the steelseries
keyboard you still have the diner on
your audio which delivers very nice and
crisp sound the speakers are located
right in the front so now that stuff at
the bottom that really muffle the sound
the sound is going to be nice and crisp
we heard the demo and it sounds actually
really nice the keyboard as with the GT
Dominator gaming keyboard is very
sponsored it's a chiclet keyboard we got
backlit keys anti-ghosting in both into
zones which means that you still be able
to you know if you do prefer gaming in
this laptop i mean you probably
shouldn't but the anti-ghosting and the
entire foundation of what they consider
to be sort of needed for a notebook is
included the selling point of this
workstation laptop though is its 3k
display so this is a 15-point a 15.6
inch display that supports 98% ntsc so
that means color accuracy straight out
of the box they do include factory
calibration which is excellent to see on
the workstation laptop with especially
if you're dealing with any type of video
or visual type of work and this is
exactly what it's targeted towards you
know CAD 3d modeling doing stuff with
Adobe doing things with that type of
stuff basically so it's very interesting
to see this type of direction for mobile
heavy workstations that can provide such
a massive amounts of power and this is
being powered by the cod roe 30 100m
which has 4 gigabytes of vram which
allows you know the this pc to actually
power this 3k display it also has an
hdmi out and to display ports which
means you can connect three additional
displays for a total of four this place
so you can have this plus three
additional this place for an insane
workstation real estate if you are into
that and so exactly where this is this
is the type of target market they are
really going to this GT
60 works workstation 3k now an
interesting thing let's move over to
here and check out this this is a 17
inch display at 1080p and the fact that
3k is not yet available on this form
fractures because well 17 inch 33k
displays are not yet available but we
are told that as soon as they are we
will see 3k in this 17 inch a larger
form factor but as you can see they look
pretty much identical this is a very
just a small brother this is tiny
slightly bigger incorporating the same
steelseries keyboard dinah audio and
ninety-five percent ntsc when a 1080p
factory calibrated display against
speakers and very nice aluminum
construction on the both of these
laptops again following the same
foundations of their gaming gaming
lineup but is now incorporated into
productivity workstations like this now
the cool thing is that they have a fully
AMD set up gaming laptop I gave me
laptop so let's go and check that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
