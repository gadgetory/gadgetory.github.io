basically staring a bunch of keyboards
and mice it looks like we're about to do
a roundup so this was getting
interesting because these are combos and
they're priced under $100 so pretty
affordable so yeah let's do this what's
up guys Eber here with hardware connects
and let's get something straight here
the gaming mechanical keyboard market or
the peripherals market is oversaturated
at least at the time I'm making this
video we have a variety of options for
gamers to choose from we're slowly
starting to see wireless mechanical
keyboards sort of enter the arena gaming
mice has become a lot better I mean I
guess we could say that their sense of
performance is improved just a little
bit not too much but I can still watch
for a lot of people who are still using
their 3 or 4-year old gaming mice that
are still holding up just fine but they
might have invested a lot more at the
beginning and that's probably why it's
probably lasting a lot longer I think
that's one of the cool things about
investing in a mechanical keyboard or in
our premium gaming man giving mouse it
just lasts you a lot longer the
durability is there it built a lot
better and of course the performance on
those peripherals or of course a lot
better now these keyboards or these
combos are pretty affordable but they do
come at a cost so for example you would
be sacrificing a little bit on
durability you obviously are not gonna
expect mechanical switches on any of
these keyboards and in terms of the
mouse design or the ergonomics it's not
as premium built as some of the
expensive give me - that and we have
taken look at in the past you see every
mechanical switch has its own
characteristics some users prefer MX
blues some users prefer MX Reds some
users are kind of getting accustomed to
these custom om mechanical switches like
Romer G razor came out with their and
new switches coursers MX speed and just
let's just keeps going on so it is a
different market out there in terms of
mechanical switches but today we are
taking a look at a bunch of combo sense
featuring membrane switches and -
keyboards that have implemented a custom
mechanical switch so it's like sort of
emulating a mechanical keyboard so we'll
talk about that
in the video and of course probably come
to a conclusion as to which one of these
combos is worth your price because there
are a lot of cheap ones and of course
there's seem much expensive cool and
masterkey more than I'm looking already
anyways let's get to this right after
message from our sponsor are you ready
okay watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P managed by
Coolermaster check it out in the
description below
okay so we're taking a look at six
combos and each of them are priced
differently
I'll start all the way with the cheapest
option that we have over here and that
is the red dragon s101 complicit this
feature is a pretty basic membrane
keyboard with a gaming mouse stepping
things up we have the cool meister
Devastator three accomplice it from cool
master it's priced at $40 and it comes
with the same sort of similar design but
it comes with a little bit better build
quality and of course it comes with the
mouse featuring an optical sensor
stepping things up we have the habit
magic eagle series it's a combo set I'm
not really sure why they named it that
way but let's just go with that there
are two variants for this model so
there's a black one and there's also a
white Varian obviously pick the white
miriam because i wanted to try something
different
it comes with membrane switches it also
comes with a gaming mouse featuring i'm
not exactly sure what sensor this mouse
is featuring but we'll get into the
performance a little bit later on next
up we have the cooler master master keys
light L that's priced at $60 if you
recall I did take a look at this combo
last year and I'll leave a link to the
review in the description or you can
check it out right over here but
basically you know to put it in short I
absolutely love this combo set
especially for the price it offered
great performance
I love the RGB lining I came out of this
keyboard it was just absolutely
fantastic and yeah cool master has
implemented their custom design mem
chemical switch which it's obviously not
a mechanical switch but it sort of
emulates a mechanical feeling and we'll
get into the bigger brother later on but
this is this is a pretty interesting
composition okay so we're next for $10
over the master case light l we have the
Cerberus from Asus this is a pretty
basic membrane keyboard it doesn't come
with anything fancy although it does
come with a splash proof design
basically that means they've implemented
drain holes so if you accidentally spill
liquids or whatnot
it doesn't you know stay within the
chassis it'll just flaw is too densely
and you can you know you'll be up and
running in no time our last contender is
cool masters master set em s 120 it's
priced at $90 so it is the most
expensive out of
this roundup and it features cooler
masters custom design mem chemical
hybrid switch so it emulates a
mechanical keyboard yet it gives you a
nice tactile feedback when compared to
the master key slight else combo said so
let's actually start with this guy the
red dragon and then we'll move our way
up and sort of compare it to the rest of
the keyboards if you guys were wondering
all the combos in this video can be
brought through the links in the
description down below and I'll also
leave timestamps for when each of these
combos will be shown in the video all
right so let's start with the red dragon
keyboard the chassis is super
lightweight is by far the lightest
keyboard that I've ever held and but
that sacrifices durability the body flex
is easily with just a little bit of
force applied so I'd be extra careful
when handling this keyboard the layout
is pretty straightforward
easy to get accustomed to at the top red
dragon has included a handful of
navigation keys like Search refresh
forward and backward there's also a
power off button that shuts down your
system sleep brightness adjust button
which oddly didn't work on my sample and
a File Explorer button these are great
tools by the way that could come in
handy in certain situations although I
would have preferred a dedicated media
playback Keys instead of these
navigating buttons but that's just me
however media playback keys are
integrated into the function keys so
that's nice the keys do feel a little
bit on the mushy er side but that's just
the nature of any membrane keyboard
there is good amount of travel distance
and the keys don't require too much
force to actuate RGB lighting is present
but it isn't bright enough in darker
scenarios and the lighting itself is
pretty inconsistent across the board we
have integrated five different lighting
effects including color cycle static
breathing effect and a bunch of other
RGB wave effects and you can adjust the
brightness and the speed of the car wave
effect through the arrow keys the
included M 601 Gaming Mouse features an
ambidextrous body the build quality is
all right it's made out of plastic
materials you can definitely notice the
aggressive design of the body
it matches the red and black branding
the surface structure on the primary
left and right buttons complements
towards a nice grip it kind of feels
like a sandpaper the buttons themselves
are nice and tactile requires minimum
force to actuate so the should play out
really well while gaming the scroll
wheel is defined with individual scroll
steps so switching between weapons can
be done easily the DPI shift button is
located beside the scroll wheel cycles
between 1000
1600 and 2000 dpi respectively my
comfort setting was around 1600 dpi and
the forward and backward buttons are
easier to reach they're nice and tactile
interestingly enough the EM 601 gaming
mouse actually comes with a software and
you can download it from red track and
official website but unfortunately it
didn't work on my sample because for
some reason the software wasn't able to
detect this Gaming Mouse
I even tried it on a different laptop
and it was the same story so I'm not
exactly sure what went wrong there but
again for 30 dollars I guess I could
give it a pass maybe you might be lucky
when you decide to try this combo set
another cool feature about this mouse is
that you can customize its weight so red
dragon has included eight two point four
grand modules and they can be accessed
by simply turning this piece so if you
want a complete lightweight setup you
can go that route the LED lighting is
not RGB it comes with a red backlighting
so it doesn't match with the keyboard
even the cords don't match between the
two in terms of colors but generally
speaking I think you're getting a pretty
inconsistent set in terms of the color
or the design in general with the s101
combo gamyeon in hand was pretty amazing
for the price especially the m600 and
mouse i was surprised in a lot of ways
for one it's got great tracking the
liftoff distance while moving is very
minimal I had no issues with any my
targets while gaming and I think overall
you're looking at a great combo set for
the price remember it's just $30 moving
on we have the Coolermaster Devastator 3
for $40 if you're familiar with cool
masters previous Devastator series this
shoot feel like home the layout design
and build quality is exactly the same
except this time they've added RGB
lighting that cycles between seven
different colors yay if I were to
compare this keyboard to the red dragon
s101 I'd say this one's built a little
bit better the body has a nice heft to
it you also find the dedicated media
playback buttons at the top so that's a
thumbs own the LED backlighting is
actually a lot more brighter and vibrant
when compared to the red dragon so you
wouldn't have a problem identifying keys
in low-light conditions
unfortunately there are no lighting
effects like the red dragon however you
can simply color cycle between seven
different colors which just a press a
button and I kind of like that you can
also adjust the brightness using the
page up and down Keys while holding the
function button so that's pretty
straightforward the keystrokes feel
identical to the
dragon they are membrane switches so
expect the inertia feeling while typing
or gaming and the keys don't require too
much force to actuate the included mouse
is built really well Coolermaster has
used some hard plastic materials for
this one and it's also on the heavier
side coming in at around a hundred and
thirty grams unfortunately you can't
customize the weight like the red dragon
m6o one gaming mouse I'm also not that
impressed with the ergonomics of this
mouse I found the body to be a little
bit on the slimmer side so it's pretty
difficult to rest your entire palm on
the top but that's just because I have
large hands these surface is pretty
smooth and comfortable to place your
fingers the thumb rest features soft
silicon materials for additional grip
support but I did find the forward and
backward buttons a bit difficult to
press as they require additional
pressure
it isn't as tactile and easier to reach
as the red dragon m6o in a gaming mouse
the same story goes for the primary left
and right buttons it isn't as tactile
and fast when compared to the red dragon
Mouse but yeah this is something to keep
in mind the scroll wheel is well defined
with accurate scroll steps and you'll
find the color cycling button right
beside it since it also features RGB
lighting which the red dragon doesn't
the mouse features Nabucco optical
sensor and it cycles between four dpi
levels eight hundred twelve hundred
eighteen hundred and twenty eight
hundred dpi respectively and the changes
can be made by holding the color cycling
button and the forward and backward
buttons I found tracking to be pretty
accurate especially when gaming however
the liftoff distance is pretty high on
this Mouse meaning if you're in the
middle of an intense gaming session and
if you're aiming at your target but then
you quickly decide to lift your mouse
for a comfortable position you'd lose
your shot because the mouse would be
tracking somewhere else unfortunately
Coolermaster does not include a
dedicated software to adjust the liftoff
distance for this mouse but some premium
high-end mouse do feature that so that's
something to keep in mind with what
you're getting for a combo at this price
point all right so our next contender is
the habit magic eagle rainbow gaming
keyboard and mouse combo yeah that was a
mouthful but yeah this combo set is
priced around $50 needless to say I'm
actually really diggin the white variant
the design is pretty similar to the
coolermaster Devastator keyboard except
for a few layout changes the dedicated
media playback buttons are located to
the left
hand side of the keyboard you may
accidentally trigger them while typing a
document or something as they're really
close to these shift and caps key the
build quality of this keyboard is all
right
I'd say it's right in between the red
dragon and the devastated keyboard
remember all these combo keyboards are
made out of plastic materials so don't
expect the best durability the LED
lighting is nice and vibrant and given
that I have the white model over here
the colors pop out even better but the
lighting only takes place underneath the
keys meaning it doesn't shine through
the key caps so you're definitely gonna
have trouble identifying keys in the
dark it is RGB by default but the colors
are set to display in this rainbow mode
and there's no way to set it to a static
color output so that's something to keep
in mind you can cycle between breathing
and static effect plus you can have the
option to adjust the brightness as well
through the function and Escape key the
keys are once again membrane type
nothing too much to talk about other
than the fact that they feel exactly the
same when compared to the red dragon
keyboard same wish a feeling not as
tactile is the Devastator but I did find
typing and a habit to be a lot faster
than the other two okay switching over
to the mouse and clearly there's a lot
going on with the design personally I'm
not a fan of it I like the simple and
still looking designs I found on some
other gaming mice but if you're into
aggressive artwork you may like this
the included mouse is built really well
it has a nice heft to it and the
ambidextrous body shouldn't cause a
major economic issues for left hand
right hand users although the forward
and backward buttons are geared towards
the right hand users so that's something
to keep in mind the primary left and
right buttons are excellent they feature
great tactile feedback just like the red
dragon m6o and mouse but they do require
just a bit more force to actuate the
scroll wheel is nicely defined and the
DPI shift button is located fried and
decided and it cycles between 800 1200
1600 and 2400 dpi respectively I'm not
exactly sure what sensor they've
implemented on this mouse but I'm happy
to report tracking is great the lifts
optisense is also very minimum when
compared to the Devastator mouse so I
didn't have any issues aiming my targets
so overall solid package for the price
next up we have the cooler master master
key slight al combo priced around $60
the one thing that I noticed right away
was the incredible build quality of the
keyboard when compared to the red dragon
the Devastator and the
a magic Eagle keyboard the chassis is
made out of premium plastic materials
and the structural integrity is
top-notch it's also a lot more compact
from a form factors perspective so if
you're looking for a simple clean
looking keyboard without any fancy
aggressive gamer elements this is what
you should get the LED lighting on this
is pretty vibrant on the backplane but
it struggles to showcase that through
the key caps the keyboard does feature
RGB lighting and it comes with a ton of
effects everything can be done in
keyboard without the help of a driver
software and I did go over them in my
full review so you can check it out all
right over here
there are no dedicated media playback
buttons but that makes sense considering
the compact size of the keyboard the
keys feel great while typing
kula masters designed a custom mem
chemical switch and it feels like typing
on a set of plastics which is when
compared to an actual mechanical
keyboard travel distance is present and
minimal forces required for actuation is
to take place as for the included Mouse
it's pretty lightweight and ambidextrous
in shape
the primary left and right buttons are
nice and tactile with less force
required for actuation the scroll wheel
is well defined with scroll steps and
the DPI shift button is located by
beside it and it cycles between five
hundred thousand two thousand and thirty
five hundred respectively the lighting
is not the best on this mouse it only
features a couple of LEDs that disperse
inside giving you this gradient effect
it looks alright but not the best that I
come across in this round up tracking
however is fantastic this is a welcoming
upgrade compared to the Devastator Mouse
as the lift up distance is very minimal
it's also an excellent choice for FPS
titles and casual gaming as well our
second last contender is the asus
servers priced at $70 honestly coming
from the $60 master key Slidell combo
this feels so much cheap the build
quality is all right and while Asus
claims that they've used a full secc
metal plate on the chassis it still
flexes the design looks a lot similar to
the Devastator combo from coolermaster
you've got dedicated media playback
buttons at the top the LED lighting is
red and not RGB which is a little bit
disappointing considering the price it
is vibrant and bright enough for lowly
conditions which is at least something
the keys are not special same membrane
switches found on the red dragon the
Devastator and the habit it does feel
like typing on rubber not sure if that
makes a good analogy here but if you try
membrane switchers this should
like home the one cool feature about
this keyboard is its splash proof design
this essentially protects the servers
from accidental spilled liquids because
the integrated drain holes prevents the
liquids from being trapped within the
chassis and you're up and running in no
time
fYI the master key Slidell is resistant
to water but just by little because it
doesn't feature any drain holes that's
been included mouse is built really well
it isn't ambidextrous design although I
did feel the actual sides of the mouse
to be a little bit on the narrower side
a little bit too curvy so it's hard for
me to sort of place my thumb comfortably
and start gaming on it instantly the
forward and backward buttons are easier
to access and they feature a nice
tactile feedback so are the primary left
and right buttons which is great
unfortunately the scroll wheel didn't
work where it just doesn't work on my
sample so it's just when I'm trying to
scroll the webpage or something like
that it just doesn't work I have to
scroll multiple times in order to get a
little bit of a movement so that is
unfortunate and it's kind of
disappointing it's doing you're paying
$70 for a keyboard or for a combo like
this on the positive side tracking on
this mouse was fantastic so I didn't
have any issues aiming my targets and
overall I think from a price to
performance ratio you're getting a
pretty decent value with the service but
personally speaking the cool master
master key Slidell combo offers a lot
better than the server's ok so last but
not least we have the cooler master
master set ms 120 this isn't that much
different from the master case light out
the only difference between this
keyboard and the expensive ms 120 is of
course the implementation of the hybrid
mechanical switch so basically it comes
with a spring attached to the plunger to
give you this tactile feedback kind of
like emulating a MX blue switch you
still feel like typing on mechanical
switches but it is alright and if you
want to kind of feel like typing on a
mechanical switch you should probably
consider this because the tactile
feedback is really well it's well
defined when compared to the master keys
line L combo the layout is pretty
similar it still features a compact
design so if you're looking for
something on the cleaner and something
that doesn't feature aggressive gamer
elements again the MS 120 is a great
option for gamers this keyboard also
features our to be lining and it
features a variety of effects that can
be done within the keyboard so you don't
need a dedicated drivers
afterward to take control of the
different lighting effects which is
great the dedicated media playback
buttons are integrated as well it is
exactly the same when compared to the
master key slight hell combo you the
only premium prices you're paying for is
the hybrid mechanical switch and
features that spring but other than that
I don't think you're seeing much of an
upgrade when it comes to build quality
or you know something something else now
the included Mouse is also similar in
terms of center type it does feature the
same about 3050 optical sensor when
compared to the mouse targeting with a
master key Slidell combo although the
shape is a little bit different so
you're not getting an ambidextrous body
with the MS 128 Mouse it is only geared
towards left hand or sorry right hand
users the primary left and right buttons
feature great tactile feedback the
scroll steps are nicely defined the
d-pad shift button is right beside it
the forward and backward buttons are
easier to reach so it's very comfortable
and I think from a comfort standpoint
personally I do prefer the mouse that
comes with the MS 120 said because first
and foremost I am right-handed and
ergonomically this is just a lot better
than the rest of the keyboard or the
rest of the mouse join the wireless club
with Corsairs new dark core Mouse play
the way you want with nine programmable
buttons aligned in the comfortable shape
and fantastic sensor you can trust and
crazy good Wireless performance plus Qi
wireless charging built-in focus on the
game the dark core will do the rest okay
so I think it's about time to conclude
my thoughts on this roundup personally
speaking I prefer the cool master master
key slide L combo that price that's
priced 160 dollars because it offers
excellent features at that price point
the one you're getting great build
quality it's pretty compact it's clean
it's not too gamey when compared to the
rest of the keyboards except for the
master at the NS 120 the included mouse
is great it's it features an
ambidextrous body so that's nice and of
course the optical sensor performs
identical to the one found on the MS 120
Mouse so that's something that I'm
really impressed with especially for the
price there is one combo that I wouldn't
recommend and that is the Asus Cerberus
price of $70 I think you're just wasting
a lot of money in terms of just what
features that they offer for one it
doesn't feature RGB lighting and it's
also not that built better I mean it's
alright the good qualities
and the mouse just I mean it's a great
mouse it tracks well by the slow wheel
doesn't work and I'm just not a fan of
the ergonomics on this Mouse and yeah
when you compare that combo to the $60
master key Slidell I would much rather
go with this over over that so I guess
the one thing that I like about that
keyboard is its splash proof design
because if you live in an environment
where you're not careful with your
liquids then this is something that a
good look into it's it's waterproof so
yeah now if I were to pick one keyboard
and mouse to go with I would definitely
pick the master key slide-out keyboard
and vm 601 gaming mouse from red dragon
because from an ergonomic standpoint
from his sense of tracking standpoint or
a sense of performance standpoint
this smells does a really good job for
the price and I'm really impressed with
what they've done here I'm not a fan of
the design it's the red and black design
I mean it's alright but but from a
functionality standpoint this mouse is
excellent I would highly recommend this
if you're into if you're a little bit on
the budget side and it's actually it's a
lot better than the Coolermaster
Devastator Mouse it's obviously a lot
better than the Asus Mouse and of course
comparing it to the habit magic eagle
it's okay but again this is much more
expensive this is fifty dollars when
compared to thirty dollars and one more
thing that I need to point out is that
some of these combo combos can go for
sale so you could end up picking out the
much more expensive you know MS 120 for
$60 depending on sales or you can even
pick up the EM master keys light L for a
lot cheaper than $60 so that is
something to keep in mind
I'll definitely leave links to all of
these combos in the description down
below if you're interested and I'd love
to hear your thoughts on this keyboard

mouse to be interesting and of course
