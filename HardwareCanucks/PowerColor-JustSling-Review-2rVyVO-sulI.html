work next review and today we're looking
at the particularly interesting product
from power color this is just laying
wireless video transmitting system that
is targeted to use within your home as a
gateway to a wireless entertainment this
is a plug-and-play system which makes it
very convenient to relocate on different
devices and just extremely simple to use
it should be available in the market as
of now at the retail price of around 170
dollars so not a particularly cheap
alternative to a wired system however
the unit allows full HD 1080p video
transmission and 7.1 channel audio all
wirelessly from one tower to another it
also supports 3d format at 1080p at 24
hurts and with three gigabit per second
data rate blu-ray playback is supported
the wireless home digital interface is
relatively new on the market and with
introduction of more products the price
for such devices may perhaps hit a more
affordable price range this product is
hitting the shelf with all the bells and
whistles this consumer technology can
offer at the moment so let's check it
out it is meant to distribute
entertainment throughout your home from
any hdmi compatible device onto an
external monitor HDTV or a projector for
example streaming movies or gaming from
one central computer at your home to a
monitor in another room the advertised
latency is less than one millisecond and
then our testing no visible light was
present however that depends on the
signal strength and the transmission
distance and power color states it
should still pick up signal up to 25
meters but the units should face a
direct line of sight it is a fairly
small unit so positioning it should not
be of a concern it is also made of
plastic which makes it very light and a
portable system the included base where
towers could be improved as the unit
simply is placed on the stand without
any clips and it's not at all stable
which kind of defeats the purpose the
front of each of the towers have two
green LEDs indicating power and link
between transmitter and the receiver a
link status bar would have been more
appropriate to indicate the strength of
the signal perhaps in different colour
or even posing as the units may have
extremely poor link but
LED would still light up both units have
mini USB ports the one on the receiver
allows a compatible hid device to be
connected such as a wireless mouse or a
keyboard and now some manufacturers
allow dual devices to be controlled by
one wireless receiver but it would have
been nice to have a USB splitter to
connect to USB devices separately and
the USB port on the transmitter should
be directly connected to your PC in
order to have the link between the hid
device and the receiver tower has a
built-in infrared receiver in case you
intend to use a remote control with
these units and the transmitter has a
pair button allows to trigger the signal
between the units on the other side both
have AC power inputs with HDMI out on
the receiver and an hdmi in for the
transmitter along with an infrared
blaster Jack that allows the user remote
control and power color includes all the
appropriate cables in order to get this
product up and running with the
following accessories we have the two
tower basis the unit's themselves to
hdmi cables USB male and female cable
infrared cable and to AC power units
which feature in the interchangeable
plug with an included type c european
plug alright let's turn the units on and
both LEDs are lit meaning power and Link
are established and here it is just
linked in practice the unit on the right
is a transmitter connected directly into
our GPU via HDMI and the source video is
shown on the right monitor the receiver
on the left is connected to an external
monitor and now we switch to the correct
input on the monitor and video is
streamed without any issues no the
flicker on either on the monitors is
caused by the camera and not by the
product also the native resolution of
the monitor on the left is slightly
higher than 1080p which means 1080p
resolution will be stretched accordingly
also as you see there is some coloured
deviation between two screens which is
caused by different color settings on
the monitors and not by the wireless
units the two devices are communicating
flawlessly when in close proximity to
each other but let's see how the
wireless transmission stacks up at some
distance we place the monitor with the
receiver tower about 6 meters away in
another room with two walls in between
here's an eight gig
bluray file playing and we then thought
us any lagging or artifacts and it's
actually quite impressive that the
signal can maintain enough strength to
stream such large files and also testing
out some gaming we were again impressed
by the transmission performance there
was no visible lag or video artifacts
and the signal maintained is stable
connection for a prolonged period of
time it was only after we moved the
monitor and the receiver further away in
the next room now having three walls and
distance of around 10 meters that the
connection has started to show issues
with slight video lag but mainly
experiencing lots of artefacts during
motion you can see that here during
fast-paced gaming or a simple video so
overall just linked from power color is
an adequate solution for wireless
entertainment for your home that works
extremely well if the networking towers
are positioned in relatively close
proximity of each other around six
meters and it's an easy plug-and-play
unit that supports the standard
high-definition resolution and also 3d
support and 7.1 channel audio and it
also allows USB devices connectivity and
remote control and on the other hand the
connection is significantly worse than
at distances greater than 6 meters and
more resistance is added to the
transmission in terms of walls and doors
the connectivity is just not on par to
stream the most basic video playback and
requires a relocation of the device but
just laying is a step in the right
direction for consumer wireless video
entertainment systems and it is bound to
get a lot of attention from users who
want to use it at its optimal
performance at fairly close distance
otherwise it may be a bit early diving
into this technology for video streaming
at greater distances and that is it for
this one thank you guys for watching and
we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
