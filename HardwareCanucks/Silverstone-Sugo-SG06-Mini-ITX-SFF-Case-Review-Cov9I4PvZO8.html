hardware canucks review those with
interest in smallest chassis for either
mini ITX or DTX motherboards
here's a small form-factor chassis from
silverstone this is the SG 0-6 450 which
is a part of the suger series which aims
at reducing the sizing of the enclosure
while still being able to handle a
decent configuration this particular
model comes with a 450 watt power supply
with an 80 plus bronze certification
this chassis is actually the smallest of
the suger series perfect for home
theater pcs although although steep with
a price of $150 we have a nice aluminum
front panel and steel for the rest of
the construction for the front one slim
optical drive can be installed then we
have two USB ports unfortunately not USB
three ready audio ports hard drive a
clear lights and your power button now
unfortunately for slim optical drives
the SATA connection is different from
your regular five-and-a-quarter optical
drive you must purchase the proper
doctor to convert the standard slim
laptop DVD or CD drive into a compatible
SATA power and data connection they're
quite rare to find an silverstone
expects you to buy their drive just to
get the adapter the front panel also has
side and bottom ventilation to the
included 120 millimeter intake fan which
is protected by a dust filter take a
look at the back we have the power
supply a reset button two expansion
slots and your i/o area
now this chassis is equipped with fair
ventilation all around allowing for
positive pressure cooling delivering
cool air from the front and exhausting
it through the back opening of the
chassis unfortunately not with thumb
screws you have to remove both the
optical drive bay along the hard drive
bay in order to start the assembly now
you will need a screwdriver throughout
the assembly and considering the size in
this case a more convenient approach
with thumb screws is more appropriate
the optical Bei mount has rubber
grommets in the cable cutouts to prevent
any damage or cutting of the wires
amount of a 2.5 inch drive is available
right underneath the optical Bay and it
is slightly oversized to support the
velociraptors as well now for the power
supply it has all the connectors you
need in order to install a system into
such a small case and they are all
graded so let's begin with the assembly
this service supports graphics cards up
to 9 inches long which in itself is
adequate for a home theater PC and
supports CPU heatsink of 82 millimeters
in height which is the retail box
coolers that are included with your
processor now when wiring all the cables
there isn't any dedicated cable
management space and this could reduce
the airflow throughout the case but
storing all the cables closer to the
side panel is suggested some of the
accessories included with the case are
the cable clamp that will work best to
tidy of all the front panel connectors
and for adhesive rubber feet
now when you install the hard drive Bay
inside the case there isn't any room to
handle cables with your graphics cards
installed so we recommend either
inserting the card in the end or connect
all the appropriate cables to the hard
drive before it is placed inside the
chassis now fully assemble this tiny
case handles really well and making sure
the cables stay clear of the intake fan
cooling is directed both of the GPU and
your CPU heatsink over all the sg0 six
is quite impressive for its size making
it extremely portable and with a decent
cooling configuration it has support for
SSDs and GPUs in length of nine inches
but on a downside we would have liked to
see more tools approach towards assembly
maybe using thumb screws instead of
regular screws would be more convenient
and focusing a little bit more on cable
management options as the cable cutter
will affect the airflow and the fact
that you must purchase the adapter to
convert the slim optical drive SATA into
regular SATA and power connection is
inconvenient and silverstone expects you
to purchase one of their drives in order
to get the adapter it would have been
nice if they included this adapter as
part of the case accessories so if you
are on the market for the smallest
possible form practice chassis
Silverstone's sg0 6 may be a good option
thank you guys for watching and we'll
see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
