great technology selection and service
hello everyone
Aidan here with hardware key Knox and
today we're looking in a mechanical
keyboard from Zelman this is the Z
machine K 700 M full sized board with
cherry MX red switches and a bunch of
built-in options it comes in with an
MSRP of one $39.99 putting it in the
price range of the Corsair strafe RGB so
there are some high expectations here
alongside strong competition with
already well established brands in the
gaming market so what does the K 700m
offer while it has a decent feature set
all of the functionality is done at the
hardware level
so the keyboard is completely driverless
this means you don't have the
proprietary software to deal with but it
also means some of the customization
isn't as intuitive the keyboard is built
of a solid plastic and it weighs in at
one point three kilograms there's very
little flex and it feels fairly tough
the 1.7 meter cable is nicely braided
and the board has nice grooves for easy
wire management also on the bottom of
the two flip-out feet and rubber pads
for better grip so the solid build is up
to scratch but is the board rich enough
in features to justify the price point
one of the first things to look at is
lighting the K 700 M uses bright white
LEDs which look great
the lack of RGB is a little
disappointing but there is a range of
lighting modes it has set print
adjustment for the constant backlighting
and custom Rhodes with seven stops of
adjustment you also have various modes
with key touch activation three wave
modes individual key lighting mask mode
dimmer and breathing there are even six
different EQ modes which I'll show
briefly now
unless you use your keyboard as party
lights the EQ might not be that useful
and the other thing to consider is there
as a microphone in the keyboard for
detecting outside volume so that might
not be your thing the Zen machine also
has five macro keys with three functions
the first three keys record up to 140
characters with timings and are
programmed by holding the function key
along with the desired action key the
fourth key will do the same function as
the first three but loop it until my
nearly stopped you can adjust the speed
of the macros with the arrow keys the
fifth key supposedly loops without
timings however I found that it would
only register one key thus making it
fairly useless the only other thing I
would have liked to see is non timed non
looping macros for video editing I would
love to see complex shortcuts running
instantly and by bines for games like
csgo but alas that is missing that aside
macros seem pretty simple and easy to
use for typing MX Reds personally aren't
my favourites which I prefer either MX
blues or Browns but the switch choice
does make sense for a gaming board the
light actuation of MX Reds makes quick
keypresses easy and the thousand Hertz
polling rate as well as full and key
roll over over ps3 and USB means that
the board is pretty well set out for
gaming not that having a gaming keyboard
helps me much but these switches and key
caps were good and being able to disable
the windows key was handy I don't
understand why Salman went with a full
sized layout for the board though as the
numpad takes valuable mouse space for
gaming and having both hands closer
together is better for ergonomics if
this was a Productivity focused keyboard
it would make sense to have a numpad but
for a gaming board I would have
preferred a 60% layout but aside there I
found that typing and gaming was just as
good as on any other MX red board the
keyboard has a couple of other little
knickknacks with the mask mode I alluded
to earlier which allows for any key to
be turned on
off with the backlight indicating keys
currently in use something which can be
handy if you don't want to mash keys in
game you also have windows and control
key locks various media shortcuts and a
double tap num lock calculator launcher
as well as repeat speed control which
allows the key repeat to be sped up to a
hundred strokes per second the last
thing to mention is the igb Zedd logo
with the light meter on the side of the
board
it offers typing speed display volume
display LED brightness control and macro
running speed settings I haven't found
it useful in almost any way though since
for typing speed it's not nearly
accurate enough to be useful
it doesn't properly show volume macro
speed doesn't display and LED brightness
is pretty self-evident the only useful
thing is that it flashes red when
programming macros but that could have
easily been implemented elsewhere even
if it worked perfectly it would still
feel gimmicky and it could easily be
removed from the board without any loss
so it seems this keyboard is a fairly
simple exterior with quite a bit of
under-the-hood functionality the big
question though is it worth the one
$39.99 price tag honestly I would have
to say probably not it's a great board
no doubt but with a really high price
point especially when competing with the
likes of coarser razor or Logitech did
offer their unique driver
characteristics or lighting this board
does everything pretty well and I'm sure
that for some people its unique feature
set is appealing but I think for many
that price point is just a little too
high unless you pick one up on sale and
then it should definitely be on your
radar so thank you for watching everyone
