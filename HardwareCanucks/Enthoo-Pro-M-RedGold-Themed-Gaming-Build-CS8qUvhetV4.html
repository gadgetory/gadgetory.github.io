hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Heydrich
knucks and we've been patiently waiting
for fantex to release a more
budget-friendly case for those who want
to experience that seamless building
process they've become known for so the
enter pro M is hitting the shelves at
$79 and it's going to be the case to
beat within this price category fantex
continues to be aggressive with in the
case market for example the defined s
from fractal hits the same price point
and so if you would be interested in
seeing a proper showdown leave a comment
or a like on this video the anthro m is
a smart move from fantex because there's
that trend emerging of giving users an
open interior chamber to allow for
comfortable water cooling or just
unrestricted front air flow and the
pro-am utilizes the exact same interior
frame as the evolved ATX but the
exterior design on the pro m is
drastically different it follows in the
footsteps of the enter pro but in a more
compact form we still get a brushed
plastic front panel that has become the
staple for many case exteriors and not
just faint X the side panel window is
revealing but it should have been larger
to expand our review of the interior a
little more Plus maybe a cutout to show
off this SSD spot on the other side of
that coin I am worried that with a
larger nonmetal section on the panel it
would have lost complete rigidity as the
panel already is extremely soft and
flimsy something I wasn't expecting to
be honest from fan tags and even the
other side panel that is completely
metal flexes a little bit too much and
even though the program is more value
introduction and the frame itself
maintains full structural integrity so
that's a positive I just wish that the
panels were stamped or something to give
off completely solid handling for this
chassis for the i/o we get two USB 3
ports audio jacks and the reset button
on the side the power button is at the
very top I like this location to give
this minimalist approach plus fantex has
done an excellent job with wiring that
is nicely collected and will not
interfere with front fans behind the
front panel we
a removable dust filter that covers main
front intake portion but you'll still
have to do occasional maintenance as the
silent elation is behind the filter that
would allow dust particles to enter
however the top is covered with a large
magnetic filter spending the entire
ventilation area with strong magnetic
strips coming back to the front you can
install triple 120mm fans or dual 140
millimeter with their mounting strips
for extra flexibility and only a single
140 millimeter fan included with a pro M
so you need to populate it with your own
fans regardless of the build on the
inside notice the absence of traditional
drive gauge to let the front intake just
enter without any obstacles
I like this ventilated floor too and
this is a natural chamber separation to
make cable management so much easier
and notice this fantex plate on the side
and it is one of their innovative
mounting solutions for three and a half
and two and a half inch drives with
these angle brackets
unfortunately the program does not come
with any of these brackets and they must
be purchased separately but what this
allows you to do is install drives with
flexible mounting options in any of
these five spots so for example you can
install them at the very top so they're
out of the way or move them in the
center so they are cooled by the front
intake so it's all up to the user but
aside from that a cage with two Drive
brackets is available in the bottom
chamber plus a single SSD bracket behind
the motherboard tray which is fine for
storage but I just wish that a single
angle bracket was included with the end
pro m4 table airflow fantex continues to
use a removal bracket that is a
brilliant solution for installation of
radiators and fans outside of the case
and then simply sliding it back after so
a triple 120 or dual 140 millimeter fans
are compatible on the bracket utilizing
strips for mounting flexibility and the
fans are offset closer to the side panel
even with my 140 member fans installed
you can see just how much clearance
there is away from the motherboard in
case you'd want to populate it with
three 120mm fans the
five and a quarter inch drive bay is
removable to welcome a three sixty
millimeter radiator and this is what the
final build looks like I had extra fun
with the pro M utilizing some of the
extra lights these magnetic strips from
BitFenix I tried to follow sort of a
color scheme of red and gold with the
active LED avexir Ram the Asus greif on
Armour edition and the yellow themed
sapphire 390x that really sort of sealed
the deal with the build and there are
mounting the 240 millimeter all-in-one
courser unit to the front with the fans
set to exhaust and the radiator fit
perfectly without me needing to remove
the bottom plate on the floor and I also
routed the fence through one of the
drive openings cable management on the
interior was extremely simple you get
these two large grommet cutouts on the
right side of the motherboard a few more
right below to pass your i/o cables and
because the power supply is concealed in
its own chamber you basically don't have
to do much with the cables anything that
is routed behind the motherboard tray
can be collected via velcro straps and
spacing is not an issue so you can get
away with doing nothing for cable
management because the system in place
is very much excellent and what you get
for $79 is one of the best frames on the
market with a functional interior that
can house an excellent water-cooled
build and if you decide to just focus on
air cooling there Pro M is a no
compromise choice I only wish the side
panels weren't so flimsy and a larger
window would be nice to showcase more of
the inside and I would have preferred to
have one of the interior drive brackets
to just sweeten the deal with storage
potential also the fan hub at the back
unfortunately is missing on the pro M
which is pretty clear that fantex had to
cut down on some of the features to hit
that price point and we still think
though that it deserves the damn good
value award and now that you've seen
what this case is capable of leave your
impressions below what you thought of
the build and
of this value enclosure in general if
you're on a tight budget
would you consider building a time line
of these and make sure to subscribe
because we'll be doing a full showdown
versus the defined s and this concludes
this review of the end to pro em from
Pantex thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
