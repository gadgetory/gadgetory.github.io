chances are you're satisfied working
with the monitor or monitors of your
choice I'll be honest with you I love
editing videos on my Delpy 2715 q4k
monitor it has served me well for more
than two years now and my reasoning
behind choosing that panel was obviously
the UHD resolution and the icing on top
of that was the IPS display 10 bit
support with a display that supported
99% of the srgb color gamut but that
wasn't cheap and it came with the cost
of $700 and that shouldn't be a concern
for most professionals since it is a
necessity to produce content that's
color accurate and at the end of the day
that's their source for generating
revenue but if you're starting a career
as a creative professional on your own
you might be looking for affordable
options that won't sacrifice features
and I think thank you has something for
you but before that quick look at our
sponsor light up your build with hue
plus by NZ XD it fits into two and a
half inch drive slots comes with four
individually controlled RGB strips with
plenty of connection cables for best
routing and is wonderfully controlled
through the camp software get 10% off at
NZXT comm link in the description this
is the PD 2700 Q 27-inch monitor what's
impressive about this panel is its price
at $500 and the features that come with
it might be an attractive option for you
creative professionals out there more
specifically you're getting a 2560 by
1440 resolution IPS panel with native 10
bit support and 100% coverage of the
srgb color gamut if I were to put this
in simple terms these specs are very
comparable to the P 2715 Q except for
the resolution but I'll get to that in a
moment from a design standpoint there's
not a lot going on here which is good
for blending into a work environment the
bezels are not flush with the screen but
the build quality is pretty robust
in my opinion the screen is matte coated
and it did a great job diffusing
reflections even in a bright room it's
not as pretty as some of the LG monitors
that we've taken a look at but let's be
realistic here how many of you care
about aesthetics for a monitor leave a
comment down below the assembly process
was fairly simple the Stan came attached
with the
and attaching that to a baseplate was
just a matter of tightening the screw to
it if you prefer to vase amount this
panel the only option here is a hundred
millimeter setting so keep that in mind
the stand offers 25 degrees of tilt
swivel and even landscape to portrait
configuration there's also a 130
millimetres of height adjustment and the
stand comes with a flat base so if you'd
like to sort items off your desk you
have that option taking a glance at the
i/o we have two USB 2.0 downstream ports
followed by a single upstream port but
it's 2016 so I would have preferred USB
3.0 moving on we have a 3.5 millimeter
audio output mini DisplayPort full-sized
DisplayPort and HDMI it would have been
nice to include a type-c connector but
at this price point I'm just going to
waive it for them on a positive note
they do include HDMI mini DisplayPort to
display port and USB 2.0 cables these
six physical buttons to adjust the
display settings were located behind the
right-hand side of the monitor when one
of them is pressed you're greeted with a
quick setting like brightness input
picture mode and the last option is to
dive in deeper into the OSD which is
where you can adjust the contrast
sharpness gamma color temperature and
the option to reset the color the
picture Advanced tab is loaded with
different profiles like rec.709 srgb cad
animation low blue light output option
for darkroom setting eco and custom user
profile now check this out guys there's
a dual view option where you can set
half the screen to display the picture
profile of your choice for example I can
have the left side of the screen output
and srgb profile and on the right I can
opt for a CAD profile you see Bank use
marketing this monitor to be as flexible
as it can so which satisfy the majority
of creative professionals out there and
the results do speak for themselves
there's also system settings that you
can play around with especially if you
want to assign custom keys and now to
answer the most important question how
does the display perform and what's the
experience like using one of these it's
fantastic when compared to the P 2715 Q
I notice the colours on the bank you
wear a bit warmer and there should be
obvious since I've enabled the srgb
color profile on it compared to my
custom profile on the Dell everyone has
their own taste when it comes to
profiles for displays and this monitor
is certainly flexible for the end-user
viewing angles were excellent with no
contrast or color shift but rather the
color reproduction throughout the panel
from side to side top to bottom was just
amazing and this was expected from an
IPS panel it sharp easy to get
accustomed to and perfect for content
creators I also noticed just a slight
amount of back bleed around the corners
but it's very minimal so in reality it's
not a big deal I did my testing by
spending some time opening a previous
premiere projects that have worked on
edited a few recent voiceovers and
created thumbnails for recent videos it
was just like using my Dell 4k monitor
and I'll be honest with you that monitor
was scaled at 150% to to its 4k
resolution so technically it was just
like using a 1440p display and that made
me realize something
given the sharpness of the 4k screen
Windows still has a bit of catching up
to do
with its scaling plus there wasn't a
lack of screen real estate using the
bank you monitor even when scrubbing
through a video timeline so for editing
in general you'll be happy using the PD
2700 Q monitor now if you're into
photography this is probably where the
4k monitor reigns supreme over the thank
you especially when you're editing high
resolution RAW files but there isn't a
significant difference between the two
and I'm sure most of you would be more
than happy to edit on the bank you
monitor
now what about gaming for those time
when you need to take a break from
editing well this is a 60 Hertz screen
that doesn't have free sync or G sync so
don't expect miracles however its color
depth and excellent contrast ratio sure
makes games look really good so there
you have it a wonderful new addition
from banku for a relatively affordable
price point targeted towards creative
professionals I actually have the PD
2700 Q paired with the eurocom tornado
f5 for my second workstation setup and
it's primarily going to be used for
testing hardware and maybe editing short
videos that don't require intense CPU
and GPU usage the gram spectrum keyboard
by Tesoro comes with a new mechanical
agile switch with low profile key caps
with super fast response and shorter
actuation distance plus all the
customization included with RGB lighting
and macros for a premium user
alright question for you guys what are
your thoughts about the PD 2,700 cue
from thank you it's not a gaming monitor
by any stretch of the imagination but
for you creative professionals out there
would this be an attractive option or
are there any alternative solutions that
you might be interested in let us know

I mean bird hurricane axe thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
