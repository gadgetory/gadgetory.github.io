CES possible thermaltake Razer fantex
Corsair and MSI hello good people I'm
Dimitri we have the two camera angle one
over here one over there it's our last
meeting for CES and as usual we're gonna
continue with the goofiness we're at
inland this is the 9 to 8 my friends all
right 9 to 8 I feel like it's going to
be a little bit an extreme situation
with this case because this has been
designed particularly for the new Intel
motherboard layout 14 by 14 inches you
know what that means for ITX
motherboards basically a little bit this
somewhere there but 9 to 8 is an extreme
case $8.99 for the price point so
obviously in when tries to show off
something different and unique and
premium all the time and this is exactly
that case as usual they're going the
full aluminium route full aluminum
panels and it's so thick it's so
satisfying you know touching some
plastic cases in the past and coming to
this it's just like wow fully tempered
glass panel really thick all the little
notches and screws everything feels
really good you know but of course for
the price point you expect that you
expect the premium and so you know the
new motherboard layout here is all about
water cooling so we have vertical GPU
mount we have a really wide selection of
the frame so you can install dual 4:20
radiators above the motherboard so
that's kind of intense but the thing is
you need two power supplies to power two
to power that new into motherboard
because of the - 24 pin connections and
so in the back we have two power supply
mounts one above another and they they
look nice and you know tidy they're like
a unit as for the front you can do three
120 s over 140 s not radiators here this
is mainly for your like you know airflow
column the same thing at the back and
yeah the nine to eight from in when and
$899 monster I love it and then we have
the a1 the in 1 a 1 plus so I love this
enclosure because it's kind of like an
all-encompassing one ITX form factor
good air cooling you can still have a
nice GPU with
a big skirt underneath so you can have
nice GPU cooling as well we have a
built-in Qi charger that has now been
upgraded from five watts to 10 watts
which is awesome
however they have made it now so that
it's exposed the actual coil is there
you can it's visible yeah I don't know
how I feel about that the you know the
traditional solution where it was kind
of hidden I think I like that better
but another upgrade here would be
included a address about a RGB fan in
the back so that's nice and it's all
black now it's gonna also come in
regular white and so the thing is the
price point has increased to $1.99
versus traditional 169 but that is
because the power supply has been
upgraded from 600 watts bronze to 650
watts gold okay now that is what I'm
talking about also another little update
is the well they are they're calling it
the skirt I feel a little uncomfortable
calling a skirt in the case here but
that has been slightly tinted to
camouflage any little scratch marks and
stuff because the previously it was kind
of too clear so now any scratches that
happen because it is plastic will be not
as visible as before and the last
enclosure we got is the Inman 905 so I
remember checking out the 901 I love the
aesthetic approach to this whole like
unibody aluminum frame so you know the
the front is totally solid the top is
totally solid and all the interior
sections are kind of divided so you
still have good airflow selection nice
reach ability but the 905 really kind of
you know refines that whole section so
as you can see the tempered glass side
panel is fully flat against the frame so
there's a button in the back to release
the panel but also I love the whole like
emptiness of this bottom section here so
it that is kind of your intake so we we
can remove the dust filter and that's
where majority of the intake for the
interior comes from because as you can
see the front panel is completely solid
however there are fans in the front you
can do 240 radiator there because the
side ventilation is adequate enough so
if you recall our H 500 review from NZXT
it's basically the exactly the same
approach
enough spacing about an inch a slightly
maybe longer than an inch so that air
can just get through it's not an issue
and on the interior as you can see it
has been sort of designed for water
cooling we have a 360 rad at the bottom
at 240 at the front a 120 at the back
still everything kind of condensed into
into this one area I like this design
it's obviously very niche but if you
know what you're doing
then I think you you might enjoy
building inside the 905 the power supply
section is it's separate there's enough
clearance above it so these fans have a
little bit of intake as well aside from
just the intake air from the front
cavity over here and the back section is
pretty nice the open lots of space for
cable management so the in 1/9 of 5 is
going to be guess how much
$280 so it kind of in the same ballpark
as what they've launched the 901 and the
904 so it's kind of what you would
expect but now it is refined and one
more cool thing about this front LED
panel so right now as you can see it is
fully RGB you can change the color with
the button over here but what they might
be thinking of doing is adding an OLED
panel so that you can plug that into the
Asus motherboards asrock motherboards
and actually display information because
through that little RGB section either
lighting or information which would be
actually quite cool alright guys so that
is the in win 928 the a1 plus and the
905 let me know if you'd like us to
review any of this I'm really interested
about the a1 plus because I think the
upgrades are definitely worth it new
power supply and you know the the really
high-end stuff is really intriguing if
you're you know really excited about
that $1000 plus until motherboard thanks
much for watching and yeah this is our
last year's video it's been nice talk to
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
