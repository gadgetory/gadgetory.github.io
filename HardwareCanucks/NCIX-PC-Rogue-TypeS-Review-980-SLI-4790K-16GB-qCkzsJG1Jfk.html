hard record NOx and welcome to our very
first showcase PC review this one's from
NCIX PC built by the crazy Russian
himself with emphasis on this snow white
camouflage complemented by appropriate
hardware with white accents and overall
a gorgeous system inside the slightly
moderate arctic white Corsair 760 T in
this video we'll go over the specs the
purpose of the system see how well
they've handled cable management take a
look at gaming performance along with
temperatures and acoustics both under
load and idle this is the rogue type
pass and cix PC let's check it out
so first let's get the specs out of the
way for graphics we have a GTX 980 from
Asus in two-way SLI after gaming on this
system I have really want an SLI setup
myself just because of how much
horsepower you could squeeze with two
cards plus I did not run into any issues
with SLI profiles in the latest titles
the CPU of choice is an Intel Core i7
4790k with a custom overclock done by
Ivan himself reaching 4.8 gigahertz with
stability testing done in-house so I
didn't have to worry about crashes or
tinkering with it myself
the chip is house perfectly by the Asus
Sabretooth z97 mark s ATX motherboard
this is a limited edition run because of
the white camouflage Thermal Armor crowd
and ours here is numbered at 3724 and
notice the uniform common flash across
the chassis that matches the foundation
of the mother force design like Botha's
back plates on the EK water block are
covered with the same pattern both
guards looking gorgeous all the white
pieces on the exterior have been covered
with this pattern at the top the non
transparent parts of the side panel and
even the front mesh has received a
pattern that is a bit difficult to pick
out unless you look from the sides on
the inside the top 360 moon radiator has
sites covered with the camouflage vinyl
along with the top piece on the Corsair
a x86 power supply to really merge the
styling of the rogue both on the inside
and the outside especially with the use
of kibum odd custom sleeved white and
black cables to keep the build in
character for storage we have a 480
gigabyte until 730 SSD stashed away
behind here but it's still visible for
showcase with a backup hard drive in the
drive cage in front of the power supply
the RAM is from a vex ear this is a 16
gigabyte kit with four modules and they
have become known for their unique
lighting implementations that light up
when memory is in use looks really
awesome on video and even better in
person
this custom cooling loop also keeps up
with the white theme with white tubing
and chrome quick-release joints where
the pump and reservoir are
into the CPU block and that's why you
don't see a dedicated reservoir or a
pump just the 240mm radiator at the
front with dual 120mm fans on the inside
and do 140 member fans
pushing air through the radiator and at
the top there's a 360 mm radiator with
fans set up to intake creating positive
air pressure which is better for cooling
but the lack of a dust filter at the top
means we have to be cautious about dust
buildup and so that's the specs now the
purpose of the Rove type s is to be a
showcase system and really highlight the
capabilities of the NCIX PC build team
one awesome part about water cooling are
the quick-release joints just because
the GPUs are taken out during shipping
and this allows quick and easy setup in
less than five minutes to get things up
and running and while this is
one-of-a-kind type of showpiece
everything you see here is available for
purchase with three configuration tiers
and for anyone interested I will leave a
link in the description below opening
the back panel cable management is well
done the chassis is wide enough to
support the thick bundle and this
concentration is nicely under control
makes me have one to open up my own
system and spend some time with cable
management now this is my first time
gaming on a desktop SLI system and I was
very happy with the performance at 1440p
and the highest possible settings
getting close to 100 frames on average
through the playtime especially with a
g-sync monitor and lastly the dual
radiator configuration handles two GPUs
and an overclocked CPU like a boss idle
temperatures are cool in the low 30s and
under load both GPUs remained in the low
50s while the CPU hiked up to maximum 83
C and that is right in line with an
overclock but totally fine for 24/7
operation now let's do a sound test see
how loud especially gets
and now that you've heard how the system
sounds its conclusion time I appreciate
the rope type s for staying in character
with consistent design language
throughout a very clean and open system
made to travel between showrooms with
quick-release joints for easier assembly
and I really want an SLI system now and
I think that's exactly what this until
Asus courser and avec see our system was
trying to achieve but what do you guys
think of this setup do you like the
white camouflage approach that they've
done here leave your thoughts in the
