great technology selection and service
you guys have no idea of how excited
that was to receive the new Razer
Diamondback 2015 edition
I mean Razer goes as far to say that
this is the return of the legend and
given how many fantastic gaming mice
have passed through my hands in the last
few months I had my expectations on this
sort of overload mode to see if this
will become my new csgo Mouse priced at
90 bucks you're looking at a slightly
more expensive price bracket for this
ambidextrous design that accommodates
both left and right hand users and from
a material and build perspective the
mouse feels fantastic the textured sides
in particular offer a pleasant surface
to the touch for a nice balance between
the rest of the smooth plastic also the
lighting on the Diamondback has got to
be one of the best on any Mouse that
I've used delivering a very beautiful
thin strip that wraps around the mouse
and Razer logo is very uniformly lit
plus the scroll wheel has nice
double-sided illumination it is also RGB
with plenty of customization that will
touch on a bit later the scroll wheel
has a functional grippy texture with
distinct scroll steps and a very
satisfying middle click that I can see
to use in-game without affecting my aim
and the primary buttons are also very
well done delivering super fast and
light actuations on both the left and
right clicks and your fingers are
comfortably secured inside this slight
curvature on each side and now I want to
spend the rest of this review talking
about the shape and why I think Razer
missed an amazing opportunity with this
return of this past legend quote-unquote
first the mouse is very low profile and
the long body makes it kind of awkward
to hold this mouse is designed for clone
grippers who tend to lift the mouse when
moving it's a very particular shape that
is very different from everything else
razer offers the biggest problem for
meto with the Diamondback is the form as
it nears the bottom because it thins out
and thus the bottom surface area is so
much smaller especially with this curved
thinner midsection here's the side by
side next to my onyx castor that has a
very nice hand support and the base is
large enough to actually support the
mouse itself whereas with the
Diamondback
not only is the thumb support lacking
because of this inward curve but on the
other side both of my ring and pinky
fingers have no comfortable spot and
what happens then is my fingers slide
across the mousepad
and ruin my aim also it's very easy to
tip the mouse and either direction
because the base is so thin and thus
requires a totally new learning curve
for handling such as higher dpi to avoid
much movement and lifting the mouse to
avoid tipping it over if moving it side
to side while holding the mouse in the
clock to avoid pressing the side browser
buttons on the opposite side of your
thumb if that doesn't sound like your
type of grip then the diamondback is not
for you the glide feet though are very
smooth the braided cable is light enough
and the primary switches are fantastic
plus the mouse is in a very comfortable
way down at 89 grams without the cable
which makes lifting the mouse and moving
it over larger surface area not an issue
at all coming out of the sensor and
razor used a laser sensor here which is
surprising considering the original
Diamondback has the first optical gaming
sensor but even so after finding my
comfortable dpi I was able to
comfortably zero in with my aim where I
wanted to but a very important part
about getting this mouse to work for you
is surface calibration and that's
because figuring out the optimal lift
off distance will prevent from
unnecessary cursor movement when placing
the mouse down you can see the cursor
shoots up to the left without
calibration while after surface
calibration cursor remains in proper
position when you place the mouse back
down now quickly going into the driver
software so first we have the basic and
some advanced button remapping
sensitivity adjustment under the
performance tab in up to five stages in
50 dpi increments all the way up to
16,000 dpi which we can refer to as an
arbitrary number as it makes zero sense
in any resolution ever polling rate up
to 1000 Hertz and the lighting tab is
awesome with brightness adjustment some
pretty standard lighting effects
included but when we enter the chroma
configurator it's actually a very unique
feature letting you configure the strip
lie
in this multi-zone layout and also
independently control the razer logo and
the scroll wheel for instance if you
want a green and purple combination you
can achieve exactly that with this multi
zone customization and so lastly the
calibration tab is where you'd need to
go first when you first get the mouse
because the software does a really good
job in optimizing that liftoff distance
based on your surface so in conclusion
the mouse performs well in the right
hands but finding those right hands may
be a challenge due to a very
unconventional shape at least compared
to majority of mice out there for me the
Diamondback 2015 is the least
comfortable Mouse I've used and that's a
bit of a disappointment because of all
the hype around the return of the legend
which was totally real but unfortunately
I prefer a more supporting shape or at
least a wider base so it's not as
awkward to fold but that is pretty much
all I have to say about the new Razer
Diamondback 2015 edition I hope you guys
