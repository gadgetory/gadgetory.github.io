AMD showed off their upcoming processors
and graphics cards honestly there is
just a lot to talk about
in fact I've actually covered all of the
Navi GPU stuff in a separate video so if
you're interested in that link will be
right over here but this video is a
little bit different from our normal
explain series you see we wanted to put
a little bit more time into reading all
of the information than AMD has bestowed
upon us with regards to Zen 2 and the
upcoming Ryzen 3000 series processors
but the further we got into the
information the same question came up
over and over again how does this all
compare to what
Intel has to offer right now and our
Intel Desa platforms really in a bunch
of trouble so let's just cut through the
hype and get into this from a more
balanced perspective while I explained
some of the finer points of AMD's
approach to third-generation Ryzen oh
and yeah this video is gonna be a little
bit a longer one so definitely make sure
to check the comments where x temps will
be pinned the first a quick message from
our sponsor the master fan series from
Coolermaster has now received a fresh
new look with a square frame designed to
generate high pressure air flow and
silent operation the fans feature this
beautiful addressable RGB illumination
and you can pick it up in 120 240 and
360 millimetre variants learn more in
the description down below alright so
let's start with the obvious thing about
this whole intel versus AMD cpu wars
team blue was caught with their pants
down when AMD announced Zen now what
could even be worrying for Team Blue is
that Zen 2 seems to be performing even
better than anyone else expected
including AMD they initially thought you
know of about 7 to 10 percent uplift in
instructions per clock or IPC but it's
right now hovering around 15 percent but
there is more to usually companies have
some issues moving to a new
manufacturing process like Intel
sticking to their 49 meter for about
half a decade now since 10 nanometer
just wasn't ready but with the new 790
meter technology aimed he has been able
to drastically increase density while
also cutting power and of course
increasing performance per watt also do
keep in mind that switching processes
usually leads to decreased core
frequencies between one generation to
the next
but somehow AMD was able to avoid all of
this and so there are new 7 nanometer
basic views will have equal or higher
Quincy's than the ones they replace now
if Intel was hoping for lower
frequencies to offset aim these
architectural improvements well they
were clearly wrong but I also want to
focus a bit on that density point from
before because it's gonna be really
important in the battle against Intel
and it's key point to understanding how
aim D can do what they're doing you
might have noticed that Lisa sue showed
off a Ryzen CPU that looked something
like this with two smaller dies
alongside one larger one
those small course are what AMD calls
chip lights and they happen to be the
cornerstone of reisen's future remember
I said that density matters well each of
those little 74 square millimetre chips
houses processing cores cache and more
meanwhile the larger da you see here is
the input output section that houses
things like the Infinity fabric memory
controllers and device communications
dining a bit deeper those complex
designs triplets or C CDs are super
small but the 7 nanometre manufacturing
process allows them to house 2 quad core
a threaded Ryzen cores and 32 megabytes
of l3 cache now when you add 2 of these
C CDs together and you have yourself a
CPU with 16 cores and 32 threads while
other designs can be created by simply
disabling course for example a 12 core
part can be created by including 2 core
complex designs but disabling 1 quad
core section meanwhile an 8 core 16
threat CPU can be done by including just
a single one of these shifflet's
alongside the cio D but the really cool
thing here is that in theory these 8
cores can keep being added or removed to
create all kinds of different products
now for Intel this could cause a massive
challenge since AMD can now use this
modular approach to pack as many 7
nanometre cores onto the CPU and this
will allow them to launch relatively
affordable and efficient CPUs with
higher thread counts that could
potentially overcome some of intel's
most expensive h EDD processors a
perfect example of that would be the
upcoming Ryzen 9 3950x a 16 core 32
threaded monster that will go for around
$750 u.s. I can't imagine the look of
horror on Intel spaces when the price
was announced since their closest
competitor
would be the I9 9960x and yes it goes
for a ridiculous $1,700 us now the new
triplet approach does bring up something
a bit concerning and that is heat you
see while the Ryzen 3000 series
processors seem to be really efficient
concentrating heat on multiple cores in
a relatively you know small package
could cause heat buildup we saw this
with Intel when they moved over to
stacked 40 nanometer transistors with
Broadwell and Indy could face something
similar now supposedly AMD's internal
testing proves their chips do run cooler
than Intel's
and results like these thermal images
seem to prove that but we will have to
test that out ourselves
especially when overclocking other than
the 1350X I already talked about AMD's
line up will have a bunch of other
processors starting with the Ryzen 9
3900X which is their first 12 core 24
thread CPU available for the aim for
platform at $500 it's the most expensive
non-threaded for CPU yet but if you want
something less expensive
there's the $400 Ryzen 7 3800X and the
330 dollar 3700X the last two
processors will follow in the footsteps
of the 2700X by offering a course and
16 threads along with higher boost
frequencies all of these have TDPS of
just 105 watts which is really
impressive except the 3700X which is 65
watts rumors are to be believed that
will allow it to overclock quite high -
one thing that should jump out right
away is the fact that the Ryzen 7 3700X
costs exactly the same amount as the
2700X when it first launched so AMD
isn't charging a premium for their new
architecture part of that could be due
to how similar the specs are between the
2700X and a 3700X but I really really
hope Intel is paying attention here
while the more expensive 3rd gen Ryzen
processors will probably get a lot of
attention or actually more excited about
the 12 thread Ryzen 5 3600X and 3600
Ryzen 5's are usually a nice performance
per dollar leaders and these newer ones
don't look any different
remember they're competing price-wise
against Intel's six core sixth thread i5 9600k
and the 9400 which should be an
interesting battle especially when it
comes to budget gaming bills here you
can pretty clearly see what Intel's
likely scrambling right now to get
influencers on board and content for
their processors out the door when
viewing the battle from this perspective
there's a lot of reason to believe that
AMD will be a dominating player at every
price point but there's some areas where
AMD may still be a bit weak and Intel
can capitalize on that more on that in
just a bit
something else that I just wanted to
highlight are the two new AP use in this
lineup
the 3400G and the 3200G these are
basically updated Raven which ap use
which still use the 14 animated
manufacturing process and simply bump
the clock speed versus last gen 7
nanometre AP use on do out this year so
these are simply placeholders alright so
I mentioned that in some areas AMD
might need improvement you see if you
remember with 2nd generation Ryzen
processors they tended to lag pretty far
behind coffee lake in you know single or
life he putted workloads and because of
that gaming suffered as well
now AMD things that they've addressed
that with Zen to when you combine their
design enhancements as well as improved
clock speed consistency they're supposed
to be a 21% increase in single thread
performance in a perfect world like
Cinebench that is but what about gaming
well AMD has also doubled Ryzen 3's
level 3 cache sizes and calls a game
cache more cache means more information
can be stored locally on the processors
high-speed memory rather than being
dumped on to the slower system memory
when you combine that with the fact that
sin 2 can hit 30 600 megahertz as an
overclocked memory speed there are some
big potential framerate boosts but does
that mean Intel should be worried yes
and no on one hand AMD showed that the
Ryzen 9 3900X pretty much matching
the 9900K
but remember the rides in CPU cost a few
bucks more than a 9900K it's good
to see them being at an even playing
field here and the game seemed
cherry-picked as well to show the best
in Ryzen what's a bit more concerning is
the 3800X versus 9700K benchmarks
because they do show Intel leading in a
few more cases but by how much
well there's no way of telling just
remember that all of these benchmarks
are at 1080p and if the resolution was
increased the gap would reduce by quite
a bit
due to the GPU being a bottleneck now
gaming benchmarks was one of Intel's
last safe havens against Ryzen but it
looks like AMD is narrowing the gap even
further with these new third generation
processors now when you look at it
overall there doesn't seem to be a
clear-cut winner in the whole 3000
series lineup at least against Coffee
Lake
I mean sure they do look better but a
convincing win doesn't look possible yet
where Intel will lose and lose big time
is in multitrader performance benchmarks
AMD can simply offer more cores for less
money but there's one thing that we
noticed here there is no way AMD
enabled Intel's quick sync support for
that Adobe premier test since with it on
the 9900K would have dominated
everywhere else though the wind seems
pretty convincing while virtual threats
don't scale nearly as well as physical
ones in this test we can see that AMD
absolutely needs their core count
advantage over Intel to win even though
that the 3800X has double the thread
count as Intel's 9700K it can only edge
it out by a maximum of 37% wow that's a
huge win given the price of each CPU
there are obviously some strong points
in Intel's current architecture can they
actually build on that well just gonna
have to wait and see now another key
selling feature of AMD's next
generation platform is the x570 chipset
in fact if you're interested in learning
more about that and the new x570
motherboards yes motherboards super
exciting right you can actually check
out our in-depth coverage of MSI's
offerings right over here but as we kept
digging through the information that
AMD did provide us some things did come
up that were quite concerning with
regards to pricing one of the most
talked about features of x570
is the PCI 4.0 interface super exciting
right now while graphics cards aren't
anywhere close to needing the bandwidth
it provides storage devices can sure
benefit gigabyte corsair and other
manufacturers have announced nvme SSDs
that can operate and 5 gigabytes per
second which is absolutely insane PCI
4.0 also offers a lot more flexibility
for devices that need additional
bandwidth so X570 boards will have a
lot more high in connectivity than
either C390 or X470 the problem we see
is cost since the price of these
motherboards is trending upwards
you see PCI Gen 4 twice writing requires
upgraded PCBs for signaling strength and
many of these standard motherboards
actually use workstation technologies so
that obviously drives the cost up
another thing that's boosting prices is
the sheer number of features many of
these boards have that's a vote of
confidence from the motherboard makers
to AMD since they now feel Ryzen is the
premium product everyone hoped it would
become but finding a lower priced x570
may be a challenge but to me what's
really concerning is AMD's more
affordable b500 series and a 5 minute
series that are nowhere to be found
during the last two Ryzen launches
both chipsets were detailed right at the
start but this time they haven't been
mentioned at all now luckily AMD has
almost complete backwards compatibility
for Ryzen 3000 series processors but
there are some limitations if you want a
more budget-friendly system around 3rd
gen writes and CPUs maybe look for a be
450 motherboard or maybe even an X470
if they go on sale honestly I really
think the lack of lower price 500 series
motherboards will end up hurting the
Ryzen 5 3600X and 3600 more than
anyone else could the new Hydra x-series
from Corsair is a full water cooling
ecosystem with transparent blocks for
RGB goodness and built-in flow
indicators with soft and heart tubing
available and the full array of fittings
so you can design the perfect loop for
you hide your X by Corsair everything's
linked below alright guys so I mean it's
time to bring up that question one more
time is Intel any spot of trouble in the
desktop market the answer to that is
yes they probably are you see MD has new
CPUs shiny new CPUs power efficient CPUs
little bit cores and they also perform
very competitively against Intel and
they don't cost a lot of money but until
the biggest issue is that they don't
have a direct answer to AMD these 3rd
generation Ryzen processors you see the
sunny core architecture isn't ready for
desktop yet and even then on notebooks
it's only expected to come later in
October but then again Intel did vaguely
announce that they're gonna come out
with new core X processors which I know
for a fact are gonna be super expensive
then again if you think about it
the Ryzen 9 3950X is a direct answer
from AMD to that and remember it takes
years to build changes into a product
roadmap and honestly Intel doesn't have
years or even months Zen 2 and some
nanometers are here now and Zen 3 with
refined 7nm process is coming
in 2020 so let's quickly talk about what
Intel can do right now lowering their
damn high prices would be a great start
but sadly they've been completely
unwilling to do that in the past first
they've got to stop burying their faces
in sand and making believe Ryzen doesn't
exist
AMD and NVIDIA battled it out for years
with continual price cuts until their
next edition cards already and it would
work here - Intel isn't out of the game
by a longshot but I think they have
stayed calm listened for too long if the
Ryzen 3000 series lives up to
expectations their entire z390 platform
looks like overpriced last gen tech now
of course AMD needs to actually deliver
on their promises and deliver products
to buy on July the 7th but judging from
what we've seen so far I think Intel has
a much bigger hill to climb so that's it
for now guys and I would love to know
your thoughts about this whole topic
would you still stick to your current
system or would you consider switching
to 3rd gen Ryzen I mean there's a new
platform look appealing to you in fact
if you have any questions or concerns
with these new CPUs definitely let us
know in the comments down below and
we'll definitely make sure to check them
out during launch day which is July the
7th it's certainly an interesting
exciting month for us here at hardwood
connects but yeah
definitely stay tuned and even retardo
connects thank you so much for watching
sure to check out some relevant content
over here and I'll see you guys
hmm there's been a long one in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
