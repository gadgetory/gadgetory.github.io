great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry and welcome back
to another Harkness review
now Razer is certainly a popular brand
because they sure do things differently
now one of those unique products is the
Deathstalker ultimate elite gaming
keyboard which retails for a hefty
wallet cleaner with $260 price tag now
this is a lot to spend on a keyboard
giving it's not mechanical but it sure
is a device for show because of the
touch screen now before getting to that
I first want to talk about the form
factor of the desktop ultimate and my
main critique is that its massive Razer
for sure could have chipped a few
corners so the keyboard won't occupy
that much real estate on your desk the
armrest is already built in it is
rubberized with this honeycomb design it
does the job for keeping your wrist at
the appropriate level with the keys but
I sure think the removable ones are more
convenient also the keyboard is very
light and plastic and shows quite a bit
of flex so the premium price tag doesn't
exactly match the quality now one thing
that I really like about the design is
the matte black coating so on it doesn't
reveal fingerprints as much but it's
also non reflective so key illumination
is very prominent regardless of the
angle you're looking at of course you
can adjust the brightness and color of
the illumination and I really like the
uniformity and intensity of the
backlight and of course we get all the
function keys incorporated into your F
keys we also have five M keys on the
left and of course on the fly' macro
recording is very simple we do have a
macro recording button that opens up
Razer app on the LCD so you can assign
your macros to any of the ten display
buttons or any key on the keyboard you
are able to configure each individual
key in the software as well and create
different profiles and also remember to
enable the M keys is by default they are
disabled
there's also game mode basically
disables Windows key and two more
optional button combination so your alt
tab and alt f4 and the keyboard has ten
key rollover now the keys are very
low-profile and a standard chiclet
switches so they're not mechanical and
of course
you know how I feel about non-mechanical
gaining keyboards now it's all about
tactile response and being comfortable
with fast presses and while the keys on
a Deathstalker ultimate have sort of a
mechanical feel with fast bounce it's
still far inferior to tactile response
of any MX Cherokee all right so let's
talk about the four inch touch display
which is a no doubt the sole reason for
this insane price tag first it has a
very smooth touch Fuel comparable to
that of high-end smartphones with
physical left and right click you can
also left-click simply by tapping the
screen but no right-click through the
touch interface you can change the
background image of the display and as
you can see it doesn't properly scale
the image but stretches it to fit the
screen it does support two and three
finger gestures for all the windows 8
features like two finger scroll
pinch-to-zoom but realistically isn't
all that practical for navigation the
given you have a mouse and in 99% of the
time will be used as a display rather
than a trackpad so the 10 buttons above
are also tiny displays that you can
assign either a picture or custom text
but most often will be used to display
the different apps available through the
Razer synapse 2.0 software now they have
a really poor bounce and feel and I
certainly was not expecting this type of
toy like quality on such an expensive
product a three finger swipe will
navigate between ten different pages so
you can combine all the games for
example onto one page and all the social
media into another now these buttons
also have very specific viewing angles
so looking at them directly above or
from the right side and they will get
quite blurry you can adjust the exact
position of the keys depending on your
viewing angle which is actually pretty
useful now we do have a very small
collection of supported apps but all the
social media like Facebook Twitter
YouTube and Gmail are supported giving
you the ability to watch your Twitter
feed monetary Facebook follow up on some
emails while gaming
and while the apps work just fine they
are quite laggy and the small font makes
it very difficult to read or click on
desired positions and I've never really
cared about incoming mail while gaming
never really use these social apps
through the keyboard as using my phone
tablet or computer was a lot quicker and
familiar to use but there were some apps
that I found quite useful including
Adobe Premiere and Photoshop that reveal
all the commonly used shortcuts but
they'd find it's very unnatural working
on a project just from the keyboard now
giving this a gaming device I was very
disappointed at the limited games it
supports for example we have battlefield
3 conscious strike Skyrim Team Fortress
2 and some others that reveal the most
common key functions again playing with
the mouse I never found the use of any
of these shortcuts the synapse 2.0
software also includes a system
monitoring which might come in useful
while you're gaming also a mirror mode
which selects a portion or entire screen
of your gameplay which you can zoom in
on either the chat dialogue or the
mini-map we also have built-in browser
so you can basically browse the web from
your keyboard literally and while it's a
cool concept it's not really useful in
practice and so to conclude the Razer
Deathstalker Ultimate elite gaming
keyboard is a touch computer slash
keyboard and they're certainly thinking
outside of the box but perhaps a little
too far away from real functionality
it sure does have all the perks like
different color illumination macro
recording and function keys and of
course a very good quality touchscreen
display with decent resolution and color
but they sure managed to miss a few key
points when it comes to gaming as the
desk Tocker
ultimate elite is non-mechanical and
really seems like a failed attempt to
put a touchscreen display to where it
doesn't belong I mean sure you can check
your email or send the tweets but
navigating that small screen sure is not
convenient and support for only 7 games
for the display is very limiting
considering the extremely high price tag
and for that much money I rather opt out
for a proper mechanical gaming keyboard
and use the rest perhaps on a tablet now
I really cannot think of any reasons why
this keyboard would be useful for gamers
as throughout my experience I didn't
find it natural to use the preloaded
shortcuts for games or the apps and
really avoided the touchscreen
altogether so what do you guys think of
this idea
execution from razor is this something
you would find useful during gaining or
not leave you comment down below thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
