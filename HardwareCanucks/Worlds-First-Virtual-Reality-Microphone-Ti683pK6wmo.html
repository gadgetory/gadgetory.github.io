possible by our partner invidia it is
also made possible thanks to corsair
phanteks and NCIX a virtual reality is
on the rise and we talked about the
impressive visuals the amazing latency
reductions in headsets but nobody really
touches upon audio side of things and if
you think about it is it's just as
important for proper 3d immersion as the
visuals themselves son Heiser has been
hard at work to design and test the
world's first virtual reality microphone
or unless fancy clickbait terms a 3d
microphone that records everything
around it literally in every direction
for this 9.1 surround sound and then
using an accelerometer inside the
headphones to determine the proper audio
projection for the user in whatever
direction that you're facing they have
done the demo with recording sound
properties and some of the world's most
popular clubs and then create a
frequency response that matches to that
of what you would hear in that space so
you can move your head around in all
directions to hear what it would
actually sound like if you were to move
your head in that space it's actually
quite fascinating to be able to not only
recreate the sound staging of these
rooms but also with the help of the
accelerometer inside the headphone to
move the virtual reality projection for
the audio and this is the microphone
behind all these VR recordings and it's
still a little early prototype but we
just wanted to share that we must not
forget about proper audio when it comes
to virtual reality and it really seems
that son Heiser is right in line with
designing the proper way to compliment
3d audio when vr truly becomes
mainstream</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
