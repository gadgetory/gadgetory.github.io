great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry with Jairo
Canucks and welcome back to another of
you a genius seems to be the name that
has been popping up a little more often
with regards to gaming peripherals there
GX gaming line is ambitious with the pro
gaming style tag so let's see if the
$17.00 GX gaming imperator pro keyboard
can live up to the name and branding now
genius states that this keyboard is
professionally designed and engineered
specifically for the MMO RPG slash RTS
gamer the first thing we notice about
the Imperator Pro is its size it's a bit
larger than the majority of keyboards
and design wise it just looks like a
typical gaming oriented frame with
unfortunately in non removable palm rest
also it is very plastic we're getting
used to so many keyboards with metal and
aluminum frames that the Imperator pro
just feels a little bit out of place and
a little too late into the game and I do
wish that more emphasis was put into the
construction of the keyboard now one
thing that I was surprised to find a
dual USB to pass through ports at the
back an excellent feature for additional
connectivity the keyboard is connected
through two ports both of which must be
plugged in for the backlight and USB
pass-through to operate along the top we
find our media keys as well as volume
control with a mute button we also have
three profiles which give us a total of
18 macro combinations with the 6 G keys
on the left brightness of the backlight
can be adjusted with three levels as
well as this breathing mode with slow
medium and continuous for your gaming
preference and at the bottom we have
very small rubber feet and non
rubberized standoffs so if you prefer a
little tilt on your keyboard and be
prepared for some sliding action now
onto the keys themselves the Imperator
is pretty comfortable to use with a
three point eight millimeter key travel
distance I find that this is just enough
to give that satisfying feedback with
little key noise or they feel a little
bit heavy in comparison to our office
mechanical set but for non mechanical
keys I would say the balance and
response is actually
quite nice the Imperator Pro also
features in 1400 which translates into
one millisecond response time now key
rollover is very important on all gaming
keyboards and we have three different
zones now this is not mechanical set so
rollover is limited to anti-ghosting
clusters of up to 18 keys now this does
limit the amount of keys registered when
pounding on the keyboard but this
shouldn't really affect gameplay as
anti-ghosting clusters are quite large
but of course I would like to see
unlimited rollover for those speedy
typers and gamers who assign multiple
keys to different functions when you
gain but for a value keyboard I do
appreciate the anti-ghosting clusters
given the limitations of the switches
the backlight only Peaks through the
darkest conditions it's not very bright
and the lettering is also transparent so
at certain angles it's actually very
hard to see what keys are what I would
have preferred not totally transparent
lettering color is customizable with the
genius gaming UI software how are the
color options look like something out of
the 80 says they're all very pastel II
and don't translate that accurately onto
the keyboard which was also something we
found on their jigs geela gaming mouse
also since there are no individual
windows lock key windows key can be
locked through the software for either
of the profiles now when it comes to
button customization genius have done an
excellent job for multiple button
options the G key options are limited
but macro recording is available so
that's always a plus considering this is
designed for MMO and RTS gaming and one
surprising feature I found is the
ability to swap any of the keys to
something else so you can use your
Windows key for something more useful
now and gain like marking your enemies
which is a very welcomed feature also
using alt ctrl and shift you can assign
secondary commands to your entire
keyboard as holding either of the three
buttons switches your profile button
layout while the key is pressed and
everything is saved to the emperor is
pros onboard memory so your settings go
where ever you go now it's not the most
modern UI but it does the job also the
backspace button is very small which I
cannot stand and the Enter key is
oversized
now I know the key layout is regions
Pacific but this is unusual for a North
American English layout now overall this
keyboard hasn't really shown us anything
new in a pretty crowded marketplace
there isn't any real innovation but at
the price of $70 it packs the basics
that we can expect from a mid-range non
mechanical gaming keyboard I really like
the practical functionality of being
able to remap all your keys and of
course assign secondary command options
using alt ctrl and shift as this is
designed for MMO and RTS gaming the keys
are responsive with a one millisecond
response time and we've also got two USB
pass throughs while we have
anti-ghosting coasters we still don't
have full and key rollover and of course
the price of $70 for this plastic
peripheral I still feel is a bit
expensive now overall the genius Emperor
Pro performs like a mid-range gaming
keyboard and nothing more and as I
always say you better opt in for
mechanical set if you're serious about
gaming and this concludes the review of
the genius Emperor Pro gaming keyboard
