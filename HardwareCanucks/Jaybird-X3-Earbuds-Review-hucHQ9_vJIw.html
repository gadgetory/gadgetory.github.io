topic to discuss in general because on
one side you have the convenience of
cordless access to music and of course
complementing features that enhance the
audio experience however if you're an
audiophile you'd say that headphones
sound much better when they're wired
directly to a device I'm somewhere in
between those two arguments because I'll
be honest with you I love listening to
my dt9 any premium headphones while
editing and if I'm traveling I always
carry my trusty rh8 H&amp;amp;I headphones
however at times their cords do get
tangled up and they aren't all that
convenient when I'm working out and I
think that my quest to find an
acceptable set of wireless headphones
may have come to a conclusion but before
I move on quick look at our sponsor the
dark bass 900 maybe the most innovative
case of the year with a built-in Qi
charger interior lighting tempered glass
that can be installed on either side and
a fully modular interior that can be
inverted if you so desire be quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below I'm going to step
back two years from now and revisit my
first pair of wireless headphones the
jaybird bluebloods X I picked them up
from Amazon for a good price and the
reviews were quite satisfying too
they sounded great at the time but
eventually after tons of hard use the
ear tips started falling off and
sometimes when I'm walking outside on a
cold day wearing a hat on top of these
I've noticed signal disturbances which
are kind of annoying and was obviously
time for an upgrade say hello to the
j-bird x3 Wireless or headphones this is
e successor to the very popular x2
wireless buds and they retail for one
hundred and thirty dollars which is a
$20 cut from the x2 headphones
Thank You j-bird I'm going to be
focusing this review on what j-bird has
improved over two generations because as
an ex owner of the original blue box ex
the x3 looks to be a welcoming upgrade
but does that mean it's time to retire
my t10 eyes or will the x3 be a good
complementary set you'll get an answer
to that question by the end of this
video j-bird has refined the design of
the x3 in a lot of ways they look sleek
and attractive to me to be specific
they've shrunk in the size of the
earpiece by almost half when
compared to the original blue BOTS X and
that alone should help with a
comfortable fit even if you're wearing a
helmet or hat these headphones will be
available in four colors all of which
have metal accents in the box you do get
three pairs of silicon and three pairs
of comply premium foam ear tips varying
in sizes now for a more secure fit they
do include three pairs of ear fins and
right off the bat I noticed a difference
in quality compared to the fins from the
blue bus X they are thicker and also
have a slight curve at the edge which
did a fantastic job securing the ear
piece while I'm wearing them I would
highly recommend you spend some time
testing out different sizes of these
fins so you can pick the right fit they
also include a carrying pouch for
storage I did my listening test from the
comply foam ear tips installed and they
did an excellent job isolating
background noise plus I prefer these
over the standard silicon ear tips
because when I compress the foam and
insert them into my ears they expand
after fifteen to thirty seconds and that
creates a seal the version I have here
is the Black Edition with silver caps at
the end the other options include Sparta
which is white and gold version alpha
that's a military green variant and
finally Road Rash that's rocking a red
and dark chrome color scheme which is
pretty cool I really appreciate the
material choice jaybird used for the x3
headphones it's a softer chopper finish
which is definitely an improvement over
the glossy and slippery material found
on the original blue bots X this alone
adds grips to the ear fins so they don't
start moving around the sound tubes are
made out of a metal frame which adds an
extra layer of premium quality compared
to the plastic construction found on the
blue box X plus the extra refinements
and the actual tubes should prevent your
tips from falling off they've also
shifted the wireless antenna into the
inline volume control bar whereas in the
blue box X it was located inside one of
the earpieces this improves a few things
one is obviously the low-profile look on
the X 3 series and 2 it strengthens the
signal when you're outdoors and from my
testing they work great however if you
want to charge these headphones you have
to use the proprietary charging clip
that attaches to the inline wall and
control bar and it uses magnetic pins to
charge the pair so if you lose the clip
it's going to be a challenge to charge
these back the blue box ex accepts any
microUSB cable directly into the
which was a lot more convenient jaybird
history and headphones have one thing in
common and that's the user flexibility
you can wear them either in an over ear
style for a snug fit or under your style
which is my preferred setting they do
include cork clips to shorten the cord
but if you prefer to wear them under
here
the included shirt clip does do a pretty
good job keeping them intact just like
any jaybird headphones the x3 are sweat
proof and throughout my testing these
are right flawlessly even under water
this is an excellent feature especially
for trainers or even professional
athletes who spend the majority of their
time outdoors playing sports or working
out so how do they sound I have to admit
they are remarkably better than my blue
buds ex the six millimeter driver
outputs great clarity in the ions the
base is more pronounced and powerful
plus the soundstage is wider on these
compared to the original blue BOTS ex in
fact they outperform my t10 dice by a
slight margin and that should be obvious
given the terrible DAC inside my Nexus
6p in this case my choice of listening
device it makes me realize that wireless
audio does have its advantage over
regular headphones if you happen to rock
a phone with a subpar deck or you happen
to have a recent Apple phone which
doesn't even have a headphone jack if
you want to play around the sound
profile on these headphones the my sound
app available for both Android and iOS
lets you fiddle around with different
sound presets plus there's a whole
community of enthusiasts sharing their
custom profiles to the public which is
very thoughtful I do want to point out
that once you create and load the custom
sound profile to the headphones they
never get reverted back to the default
setting even if you pair it to a
different device unless if you come back
to the app to perform the change so that
should be convenient bluetooth is
getting smarter these days and J board
has implemented the Bluetooth 4.1 spec
on the X threes this brings a few
advantages to the table and one of them
is the ability to pair the x3 up to
eight different devices that support
bluetooth for example you can have your
X 3 buttons connected to your laptop and
your phone at the same time this way you
can listen to music from your laptop and
still answer an incoming call on your
phone using the x3 buds inline remote
control I did experience a few signal
cuts when I started playing music at the
beginning right after pairing but after
that it was just flawless the signal was
strong outdoors
I even wore a hat on top
these two check the quality and they
were absolutely no signal loss the
battery life lasted a little over seven
hours with continuous playback mind you
this could vary with temperature change
and your surroundings but overall I'm
very impressed when you compare Jaybirds
new x3 bluetooth headphones to the
original blue BOTS X there's a lot to
like about these and the switch feels
like an incremental upgrade you know
things like a low profile design
software and comfortable ear fins along
with the inclusion of a comply form your
tips better Bluetooth connectivity and
of course improved sound signature I'm
definitely gonna enjoy listening to
tunes while I'm filming the studio
working out commuting you name it and
430 dollars these are well worth the
price especially compared to the
absolutely ridiculous price of Apple's
air pods and holiday season is right
around the corner so if you find these
on sale don't hesitate to pick them up
so that about wraps up my thoughts on
the new j-bert x3 bluetooth headphones
what are your thoughts about these pair
you know are there any alternatives that
you might be interested in please don't
tear your pods amiibo with harken ax
thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
