right now in Vegas much better than
yesterday and we are on our way to the
Venetian what do you guys expect I think
it's gonna be super pac's
no room to breed and kind of yeah we
won't be able to see the floor period
yeah or move let's see what the floor
looks like oh my goodness
the madness begins oh it's bad
and of course huge thanks to our
sponsors Thermaltake corsair fan takes
msi and razer for making c as possible
and so today was pretty great we've only
had three meetings because we were extra
productive yesterday we had an amazing
kale shake from Dell and now we're gonna
maneuver our way back to the hotel it's
gonna be a chill time of evening dinner
hanging out with the boys
good day overall Wow all these hotel
establishments are so grand look at this
cool Eva how do you like all the
grandmas grandmas grandmas it's okay
yeah it's good so today I think we can
all agree was a pretty nice relaxing day
yeah good job amazing day and so we all
got dressed up on fancy so now we're
going out for there and that we brought
a special nice gift for the camera
the 55 millimeter F one point eight for
those low-light Beauty shots with the
food we haven't really done anything
like we've done at Computex so let's
let's try and deliver and this year we
got the non-smoking floor which was the
best idea
all right so normally around five
o'clock we'll be going to our let's say
last meeting of the day but today's so
chill we're going to dinner at this hour
feeling good doing
oh man that was amazing
I one of those you guys won't want to
oh the motor bag it's a camera magnet
arrived
I mean it is almost 8 o'clock but we got
you a videos to edit so it doesn't hurt
to have a little caffeine the system and
then you know hit the LA sac oh and now
we're back in the hotel now the thing is
Eber is recording right now in the
bedroom
yep he's still going ok let's go see
what the setup is like and maybe
surprise him
Wow okay so that is how what summers are
done no let me close the door he totally
did not see us coming he didn't but he
was too neutral we did very good yeah
all done
good people while the video is rendering
we have another surprise for uber you
know we're not gonna pretend we don't
hear the laptop but we have sort of
established this tradition because of
Mike so ever since he started traveling
with us for complex shows and CES he's
been wearing this elephant shirt and
we've kind of made fun of him for that
but we thought about like how cool would
it be to have a matching shirt for the
team so he found it so we actually found
it it got me one and we got Eber one and
it's been sitting on the table on the
table where we edit for the last it's
right here since we arrived basically
and we thought maybe he could ask us you
know like what is that and we're like oh
that's a shirt for you but since he
hasn't we're gonna we're wearing ours
and then when he comes back from getting
coffee we're gonna wipe he recognizes
that we both have the shirts on yeah and
maybe click saying that maybe there's
one for him too how many teachers are
you wearing today just do two just two
what do you mean you've got the elephant
route - okay yeah did you show up man I
want with something surprise surprise we
got you one
I'm splitting this right now you put it
away just threw it
you just threw it onto the couch he
comes back the cameras rolling
oh my god it's a great t-shirt alright
guys so we're here at a cocktail bar
just relaxing chilling here yeah yeah
see yes it's it's his first mojito ever
okay let's do this on camera all right
take it and you better not see it's good
I like it let's verify delicious right
berry nya you issue is there no power
flux in this bar so we're gonna have to
see how much of an edit we can get done
with the battery power we have so we're
gonna just kick back relax have a good
time and get a little bit of editing
done oh that's it guys have a good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
