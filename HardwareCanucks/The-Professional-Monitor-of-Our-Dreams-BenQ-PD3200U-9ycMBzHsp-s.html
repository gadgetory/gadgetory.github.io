hurricane axe and today we're checking
out yet another monitor but this time it
ain't gaming oriented so for those of
you who are expecting 1440 P 240 Hertz
with a GC module and one millisecond
response time all of that back to find
an IPS display that's just not gonna
happen actually coming to think of it
that that doesn't even exist
so regardless of that we're checking out
a professional-grade monitor from thank
you
more specifically the PD 3200 u it's a
32 inch display featuring a resolution
of 3840 by 2160 so 4k and it comes with
all the bells and whistles that
professionals care about so let's check
out this monitor but first a message
from our sponsor wondering how to fix a
boring fan check out halos RGB there are
super slim fan frames that light up your
blades of any shade come on to 120 and
140 member sizes to fit any fan and a
control through your motherboard or your
fan text case available in beautiful
aluminum or simple plastic it's time to
halos your build outline what matters
all right so let's get the specs out of
the way so this is a 4k 32 inch display
that comes with an IPS panel 10 bit
support 100% coverage of the srgb color
gamut as well as support for rec.709 it
natively runs at 60 Hertz refresh rate
and it costs $800 so it's definitely an
expensive investment but if you're
comfortable compromising the 4k
resolution with something like a 1440p
panel thank you does offer the exact
same monitor with similar specs except
for the VA panel at around $500 now from
a design standpoint this display looks
out of date especially in 2017
competitors like LG have already started
ripping monitors with bezel s screens
and they look quite modern the bezels on
this monitor are not flush with the
screen and they are pretty thick but it
should fit in with any normal disk
environment now given that this is a
professional monitor it focuses more on
utility than good looks so keep that in
mind the build quality is pretty robust
in my opinion there were no signs of
creaking which was awesome and the
screen is matte coated plus a desert
great job diffusing reflections even in
a bright room setting for those of you
wondering this monitor is bass are
compatible and it only supports the 100
by 100 millimeter configuration the
included stand
offers up to 6 inches of height
adjustment vertical tilt up to 15
degrees swivel adjust up to 45 degrees
on both the left and right hand side you
can also fully pivot the panel 90
degrees if you so desire so overall the
PD 3200 you check marks flexibility in
all aspects which is nice the i/o is
kind of all over the place on this
display so let me walk you through that
step by step at the bottom we have two
USB 3.0 downstream ports as well as two
USB 3.0 upstream ports audio line-in and
a microUSB port for the control puck
that I'll talk about shortly the other
rear end of the display houses the power
input and the AC switch the display
connectors are placed on the right side
of the panel and it features two HDMI
2.0 ports a full-size DisplayPort 1.2
port and a mini DisplayPort that's also
one point to complain the lack of a Type
C DisplayPort connector is disappointing
especially at this price point but on a
positive note Bank u does include the
necessary display and USB cables to get
you up and running oh and there's still
some more IO left on the right side of
the bezels the SD card reader is fast
and it performs similarly to my external
card reader plus it runs at USB 3.0
speeds so a very nice addition that
professionals can take advantage of
you've also got a couple of USB 3.0
ports and a 3.5 millimeter audio output
honestly these are all great inclusions
for display in this caliber I would
totally take advantage of that SD card
reader but I also need a type-c
connector so thank you if you're
watching this please fix that in the
next revision the five capacitive
buttons to adjust the display settings
are located at the bottom right-hand
side of the monitor when one of them is
pressed you're greeted with quick
settings like brightness input picture
mode and last option is to dive deeper
into the OSD which is where you can
adjust the contrast sharpness gamma
color temperature and the option to
reset the color the picture Advanced tab
is loaded with different profiles like
rec.709 srgb cad
animation low blue light output option
for darkroom setting and a custom user
profile there's also a dual view option
where you can set half of your screen to
display the picture profile of your
choice so for example I can have the
left side of the screen output an sRGB
profile and the
I can opt for a CAD profile really cool
thank you has also included something
called the hot key puck and this allows
the user to switch between different
color profiles with just a simple click
out-of-the-box Bank you has pre-loaded
the puck with CAD srgb and low blue
light settings but you're always welcome
to remap those buttons to other modes to
the OSD settings which by the way can
also be accessed via the puck just be
mindful that the puck needs to be
plugged into the micro USB port
underneath the display for it to fully
function and there are appropriate cable
cutouts to route the cables as well so
that's nice if you're working with
multiple computers the KVM switch
otherwise known as the keyboard video
mouse which can come in very useful
essentially it allows the user to
display and control the content from two
different systems using the same screen
and just a single set of keyboard and
mouse so this should help save space at
your desk and potentially boost work
efficiency and now to answer the most
important question how does a display
perform and what's the experience like
using one of these it's fantastic guys
the color reproduction was excellent
especially when consuming content
viewing angles were far superior than TM
panels or even VA panels out there a
controversy shio is just exactly what I
wanted on a professional IPS display so
I'm really happy about that although the
white seemed a bit warmer to my taste
after switching from my 27-inch dell 4k
monitor but that can easily be sorted
with calibration do note that this panel
does come factory calibrated out of the
box and they have ensured that it meets
the Technicolor color certification
standards given that this is a 4k
display the image was super sharp and
it's easy to get accustomed to and
perfect for content creators I spent the
majority of my time working with
premiere projects researching and
creating thumbnails for videos and given
the 4k resolution in a 32 inch form
factor I ended up setting the display at
a hundred percent scaling for the first
few weeks to see how the content would
look like it took me a while to get used
to especially the text within the files
Explorer we're a little smaller for my
taste but the screen real estate is just
insane
for instance take Premiere Pro running
at the native 4k resolution that program
monitor is essentially displaying a
pixel to pixel
1080p image that's super sharp and
perfect for editing because there's
plenty of room for the timeline and your
effects window along with other items
but Adobe still has a lot of work to do
with scaling the texts and the tools so
that it doesn't strain your eye while
looking at it and then there's Photoshop
an absolute mess when it comes to
scaling appropriately for a 4k display
the user can go in manually and set the
UI scaling to 200% which sadly is the
only option available so Adobe if you're
watching this please give us some more
options I eventually ended up scaling
the display to 125 percent which worked
just fine for me the image was still
tacked sharp and Windows 10 does a
pretty good job scaling the UI elements
quick tip though completely avoid the
150% recommended setting it's just not
worth looking at especially for a 4k
display although I'm curious to know how
this monitor would work well with Mac OS
since scaling on that platform seems to
be a lot better than Windows
at least that's what I think but correct
me if I'm wrong in the comments down
below okay so can you actually get away
with some gaming on this display maybe
but that ultimately depends on the
hardware that you currently have in my
case I was using a gtx 980ti and it was
easily able to drive modern titles at
that resolution but you have to keep in
mind that this is a 60 hard screen and
it does not come with free sync or
g-sync so don't expect miracles
however the displays color depth and
excellent contrast ratio makes those
games look really good one last note on
backlight bleed I was actually not able
to spot any with my review unit but what
you're seeing right now is basically
coming straight out of the camera at
base ISO and bumping that up all the way
up to 2000 still doesn't show any signs
so that's pretty awesome so to conclude
the PD 3200 you from BenQ is a fantastic
display for professional content
creators I definitely had a lot of fun
editing videos doing my research
scripting and of course watching content
the IPS display on this guy is
absolutely phenomenal you've got a lot
of color profiles to work with like
rec.709 srgb you know specific profiles
for CAD animation and of course you can
adjust them the flexibility is just
insane with this monitor I also need to
mention that the i/o on this guy is
probably one of the best I've come
across on any monitor you've got an SD
card reader that uses the USB 3.0
protocol you've got two actually four
USB 3.0 ports and a bunch of display i/o
connections so I think when it comes to
features standpoint this guy absolutely
nails every bit of it I should also
mention that
thirty-two inch display is just perfect
for the 4k resolution because you can
scale it to 125 percent or even just use
it at 100% and get that immense screen
real estate I was more comfortable with
a hundred twenty-five percent because
Adobe still needs to work with programs
and they still haven't updated it and
finally let's talk about pricing because
for eight hundred dollars is an
expensive investment but if you are
professional who's just serious about
your work then cost shouldn't be a
matter in fact I think what really
matters is the return of interest that
you get when you invest on something so
when you decide to purchase this monitor
you will definitely enjoy the color
reproduction and just your overall
experience using the 4k display now if
you're comfortable with compromising the
4k resolution for something like 1440p
you can definitely pick up the $500
variant of this exact same monitor but
that basically comes with the exact same
features that I mentioned earlier except
that you're getting a little resolution
I definitely don't want to recommend
this monitor for gamers out there
because it's 4k at 60 Hertz it doesn't
come with g-sync or free sync and of
course you need a beefier hardware to
run a 4k display in the first place so
yeah gamers up there
you should probably skip this one but
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the PD
3200 you from thank you what do you guys
think of this display if you're a
professional out there let me know in
the comments down below on how this guy
can benefit your workflow
I'm your card connects thank you so much
