the situation where you're outside
enjoying the nature the beautiful
flowers the blue sky the fresh trees and
just happen to have a hard drive with
you that has a lot of important
information that you don't want to get
ruined by other elements in the nature
like rain dust or potentially dropping
it due to a slip and fall well there is
a product for you which is what we're
talking about today
so let's check it out prejudice are you
ready okay watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P managed by
coolermaster check it out in the
description below now one of our most
popular storage videos comes through the
Silverstone MS online where you populate
your own M that to solder base SSD and
you have an elegant solution for
additional storage capacity you know
that you can take with you anywhere it's
awesome but what if you have spare as is
these lying around that you're no longer
using inside your main PC and don't want
to go the route of already like you know
these little external drives so
Silverstone has a solution for you and
so these are the MMS o2 and MMS o1b
Wow the name is Kim here they're water
resistant shockproof and there's a lot
of military-grade stuff in the marketing
name so we're gonna put this through a
little torture test for the elementals
the elements the elements yeah and see
if the internal drive survives because
with my previous test with the corsair
survivor USB the actual internal and
then completely fell apart while the
enclosure remained intact now i
appreciate the difference between these
two so the so1 is basically just a
plastic shell with a rubber housing so
it's good for like you know being rough
and stuff while the so2 is more elegant
but it's literally just two slabs of
aluminum combined together with some
rubber in between and the way you access
the drives is pretty similar but also
different so this one is rated for IP 65
which means it's water-resistant you
know i'll be fine for rains and splashes
and stuff like that but don't submerge
this in water and has this rubber
housing I'm guessing Institute just
prevents a little additional damage to
the actual plastic housing that is
underneath and it's got a little flap
that you can access for this USB port
has a USB cable that comes separately
you have a little tool so you can
actually open it up and insert the SSD
inside now my concern is that on the
interior the SSD is not being held by
anything in particular it basically just
sits in the cavity and we have little
padding so that it does have a little
bit of compression so that doesn't like
shake round inside it's a good
implementation because it can support
seven or nine point five millimeter SSDs
so regard
it's a thin drive or a thick one it will
fit inside the so1
now the so2 has the same idea for
external storage but totally different
approach so not only this thing more
elegant because it's literally just an
aluminum slab but it has an IP 68 water
resistance so it can withstand for 60
minutes and water up to 1.5 meters so
that's awesome in case you know this
gets actually submerged in water this is
fresh water by the way it has an actual
USB cable that's built into the around
housing which is type C so that's the
one difference because the speeds on
this one are USB 3.1 gen2 versus Gen one
on the sl1 and so here you access the
internals by unscrewing six screws all
of which have this rubber grommet around
it to prevent any leaks and you open it
up and inside we have the SSD cavity
which has little pegs at the bottom so
it actually kind of holds the SSD in
place so it doesn't maneuver anywhere we
also get two foam pads that you can
install depending on the thickness of
the SSD and a thermal pad that you can
install because this entire aluminum
enclosure can act as a heat sink
now the type C cable here has a little
rubber tip in case it does set gets
submerged in water it's not completely
exposed so that's fine and the cable is
actually pretty long so it's not doesn't
have to be like super close to your PC
and I like this sort of built-in
implementation you don't have to bring
any additional cables it's all in one
unit all right it's time to torture
these things
now I didn't want to do anything crazy
with this one because it's still a
plastic enclosure we do have the rubber
protection on the exterior for that
additional drop protection but it's
really good for anti fungus anti most &amp;amp;
NT like really sharp spikes and
temperatures so that's good your SSD
will be protected but in terms of like
impact stuff this is not the way to go
but I am curious to know how the
aluminum enclosure is doing inside the
freezer let's go check it out man this
thing is cold let's go see if it boots I
just hope it hasn't leaked because of
all the drops well looks like the good
luck Drive is in fact alive now I was
hoping for cool temperatures because
this thing just came out of the freezer
and it somehow is 2 degrees Celsius
harder than my SSDs inside the enclosure
not sure what's that about now the
enclosure has withstand some damage on
the corners are we still falling on
concrete like that it's also quite heavy
so that also contributes the additional
force applied on it but just minor
scuffs the drive inside and the cable
are working just fine and so if you are
looking for something that can withstand
a lot of impact this is a good option
especially because it's fully waterproof
type-c gen 2 so the speeds are fine and
you can populate whatever capacity SSD
you want inside here while this guy the
plastic one is also a good option but
less so for impact stuff it's also
lighter so potentially a little bit
better for travel but this guy not so
good for travel because it's quite heavy
but it will definitely withstand
anything that comes its way alright so
that is how you create your own external
two-and-a-half inch enclosure that is
waterproof and can withstand quite a bit
of damage so let me know if your guys
