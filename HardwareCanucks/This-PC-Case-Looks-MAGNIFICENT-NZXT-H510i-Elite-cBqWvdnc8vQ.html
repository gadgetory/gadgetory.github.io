thing it's time to go to NZXT now
finally here at NZXT it is bit rainy
outside but to continue with the
tradition of the peal at Computex and
NZXT we have something a little special
over here we got ourselves a glass panel
and let's all enjoy the delicious peel
satisfying alright let's go check out
the new updated aged series of cases
right after this huge thanks to fan text
and SteelSeries for making our comput
extract possible alright so moving on
from that satisfying peel NZXT at
Computex is announcing and upgrade to
their aged series cases so it's no
longer it's the H200 the H500 or
the H700 now there are the 10
edition so the H210 H510 and the
H710 minor upgrades that are
cosmetic and functional and a H510 elite important thing to note all
the prices remain the same as the
previous generation of H Series cases
which is awesome so you're not paying
the premium to get these little
additional upgrades and things so the
first upgrade will be the tempered glass
side panel no longer do we have the 4
thumb screws that we saw with the H200
the H400 and the H700 now they all
have the same mount as the H500 so the
tempered glass panel has pegs at the
bottom that insert into the frame for
support and a single thumb screw at the
back for that clean look and also
minimizing the cost and also minimizing
the risk of the tempered glass being
broken because you don't have those
pressure points in the corners and
apparently that was a bit of an issue in
the past next up are the ventilation
holes on the power supply shroud no
longer are they used to mount your SSD
caddies like we saw in the previous
cases I actually like that approach
because it gave you a little bit of
flexibility on exactly where you could
mount that
dakari but now we have a new rail system
that goes around the power supply shroud
that looks a bit cleaner and the
installation of the mounting SSD caddies
is just as simple and also because of
this new mounting mechanism beside this
is the amount does not require any holes
like we saw on the previous version so
if you're not using it on the power
supply shroud then it looks cleaner
they've also added USB 3.1 gen2 support
which is now called the USB 3.2 Gen 2
support or the type C connection now the
entire H series has an I version that
includes a smart device and now the
difference here the smart device will
include two RGB channels so you can
connect strips or fans or something like
that that has lighting integrated in it
they have included vertical mounts but
no riser cable so you have to purchase
that separately but the work amount is
very very close on the cases towards the
glass panel so probably not going to be
very popular for air cooling maybe just
stick to blower style if you go in
vertical while the non I've urgent don't
even have the vertical PCI slots it's
completely bare
so no option vertical GPUs on non
divergence now I'd like to clarify
something the underglow you see here on
the bureau is only for them purposes
it's not actually included with I and
non-ai cases which is unfortunate it
would be really cool to have that
additional value add for the eye
addition case so they can push people
towards these smart device and the extra
RGB fans and there's no lighting - but
nope and now the star of the show my
friends would be the NZXT
h510 elite it is one of the coolest
cases that we saw a Computex is just so
elegant and so simple and yet so
beautiful and then it's basically just a
glass front panel at the front instead
of it being totally closed off with the
metal piece this is actually based on
user feedback people wanted a tempered
glass in the front because otherwise
maybe it's a little bit too bare for
some people and the H510I includes two
air 140 Miller RGB fans - to really
highlight that whole tempered glass
front section the front panel is
removable with a single screw from the
side if you need to access those front
fans for some reason and the front
bracket sits on the thumb screw so the
whole cooling contraption installation
is pretty convenient and
two more exhaust fans one on top and one
at the rear now important thing to note
here are the front fans have been
brought in towards the front panel by
just a few millimeters and they're
saying that won't affect air flow too
much it won't be like a significant oven
inside the case and based on my previous
temperatures of the original H500
cooling was actually really fantastic
with a single fan included because the
side ventilation is pretty deep
but here the side ventilation is still
only on the one side on the right I'm
guessing that's the whole point of the
elite it looking premium and the airflow
won't be performance based but it won't
be a choking hazard either and I'm
really happy with the overall simplicity
of upgrades they're not redesigning the
frame they're just adding slight
refinements to the frame in terms of the
side panel mount and the SSD caddies
while everything functionally remains
the same and design wise you're getting
and then zxt enclosure there's simple
lines hard lines some right angles and
some glass that's pretty good I guess
we'll have to wait and see to make sure
it is not an oven but that side
ventilation has been plenty in the past
and I'm thinking it's the same here -
all right guys let me know what you
think of the enclosure and the entire H
series upgrades I'm Dimitri thanks much

other relevant content I'll talk to you
