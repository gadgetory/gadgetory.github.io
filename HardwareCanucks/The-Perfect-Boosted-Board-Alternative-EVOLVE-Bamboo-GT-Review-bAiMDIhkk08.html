longboards have gotten popular with
everyone wanting a taste of that nice
out lifestyle but let's be real
we're not tasting nice that and when I'm
going to be so instead of the Brewster
board let's take a look at one of the
most popular alternatives the evolved
Andrew GT so let's look at board which
offers something a bit different it
brings to the table range power and
versatility it seems to have the keys to
stack up against the likes of Brewster's
but does it fall down in the details
let's find out after this message from
our sponsor check this out the fan decks
p400s which is one of the best mith
hours on the market get a sexy upgrade
now with a tempered glass side panel
with a comfortable rubberized mount to
show off your gorgeous system with an
RGB LED strip included get a glass song
with the fans XP 400s plans not included
to give context to this board you need
an idea of the market right now
currently we've got boosted on top they
have very sleek and refined boards they
have decks and manufactured by loaded
and they started around $1200 boy then
the smaller companies like evolve
evolves a smaller Australian company but
they've got some competitively expect
forwards outperforming boosted on paper
across the board below these companies
it gets murky you have smaller
manufacturers funding these boards on
Kickstarter often with delays that turn
into years before product ship and
production issues seem to be the norm
something which isn't as much of an
issue for manufacturers like evolve and
boosted
here we have the mid-range offering from
revolve it's cheaper than the $2,000
carbon but also more expensive than the
$1,000 evolved one it's coming in at
1450 with one set of wheels or 1650 for
the two-in-one kit which is what I have
one of the main downsides of electric
longboard is that it's a longboard this
thing is massive with a 38 inch maple
and bamboo deck and it's also really
heavy it's 8 kilos with the street
wheels on it or 9.5 kilos with the 87
but it makes sense with how much they
pack in with the massive 36 volt 6.5 amp
battery but when the main advantage of
an electric longboard versus a bike is
that you can take it with you no matter
where you are you're not going to want
to take this on the bus or to the
supermarket it's just simply too big and
you're going to want to smaller board
the good thing about having a massive
board is that it can supply some massive
power with the 3000 watt motors on the
board being able to get it up to 35
kilometers now with ease and also climb
up to 25% gradients with no power loss
you can also climb steeper gradients
than that still a very very respectable
speeds the acceleration is also
something not to be trifled with if you
accelerate too hard even experienced
riders are prone to be kicked off the
board
it's impressively fast and there's no
complaints here
one of the more subjective points but
for me the aesthetics of the evolved
bamboo GT leaves something to be desired
the clear grip tape on it looks a bit
tacky when you compare it to something
like the Brewster Board and overall the
shape is fairly safe and the board's
just a bit boring to look at and the
exposed motors just make it look
unfinished and when you've got the
granted super fun 80 wheels on it the
whole board just looks ridiculous it
would have been cool to see evolve go
for more defined color scheme and
overall aesthetic
all right so this might seem a little
obvious but it's actually a big point
about it how fun is it and the answer is
it's probably one of the most fun boards
you can get it goes fast with that 35
kilometer an hour speed and the 80
wheels are one of the big things that
can make this stand out being able to
ride it on grass or dirt it's just so
much fun and the acceleration is nuts as
well
the bamboo GT is a complete powerhouse
it'll just chew through hills and I'll
get you to 35 days now with ease the
only thing there is that for this to
happen it has to be pretty much fully
charged and that's because of voltage
sag voltage sag is because of all this
battery can only supply power quickly
enough to certain cells which means once
they depleted it can't power the board
enough this means that you're in reality
you're anything getting something in the
range of like 40 percent of the battery
usable if you're riding fast while it
technically has a 35 kilometer range on
the street set up you're going to notice
that below 75 percent battery you're not
going to be able to go up hills at the
same speed and below 60 percent you're
not going to be able to hit full speeds
on flat this is further reduced if you
use the 80 set up this is a point that
ties in with size but it's something
that comes up every time we want to use
this board it's just simply too big to
carry your if you're going to go to the
shops to the movies to see friends or
whatever else you're not going to really
want to lug this around not a very
enticing prospect and unlike a bike you
can't easily just lock it up there's no
way to lock this board up which means
you can have to have a safe place to
store it and if you're going to uni
order the shops you can't really do that
so lugging it around it really is the
only option in a lot of cases
and this pretty much sums it up for me
the evolved bamboo GT feels like a
hobbyists dream project that's been
shipped to consumers it's powerful and
impressive but it's not complete whether
it's the damn it or full remote with
unintuitive profile switching and poor
design the acceleration curve which
almost kicks new riders off the board
the duel belt motors that you have to
manually adjust when switching wheels
the questionable dual kingpin trucks
which is just a poor choice or the sheer
size and the looks of the board and
unless you're going to be using this
purely for recreational use where it is
heaps of fun you're going to be sorely
disappointed by the lack of usability
with the board so there are my
conclusions about the evolved bamboo GT
