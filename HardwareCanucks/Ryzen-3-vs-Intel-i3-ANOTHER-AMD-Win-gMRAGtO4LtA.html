an exciting journey covering AMD's
rising CPUs we start off the year with
horizon 7 which offered fantastic
multi-core performance while also being
relatively inexpensive a few weeks later
rising 5 came to the horizon showcasing
great performance compared to intel's
mainstream set of processors like the i5
7500 and 7400 in some cases it even
knocked out intel's $350 7700 k which
was awesome say hello to rise in 3 this
is AMD steak on a sub $150 CPU or CPUs
because we'll be taking a look at two of
them the 1300 X and the 1200 we'll put
them through their paces compared to
Intel's low-end I three variants and
sort of judge for ourselves or analyze
where it stands within the market
especially for gamers on a budget but
before that a quick message from our
sponsor the end XD hue + sliding control
hub is now available in the white frame
to complement the white NZXT monta case
or other white theme builds for best
hardware color coordination with enough
extensions included and is used to
control the four very bright RGB LED
strips or the air RGB fans all through
the hue + hub check it out in the
description below
alright before I move on if you're
interested in learning a lot more about
the bass lines and architecture and its
various intricacies I recommend you head
over to a launch day coverage because it
has everything covered link will be in
the description down below at the top of
AMD's rising 3 stack is the 1300 X
priced at $130 which sports for physical
course and for threats 2 megabytes of l2
cache and 8 megabytes of l3 it's very
much similar to the baseline rise in 5
1400 CPU except that processor has eight
threads and lower bass boost coke clock
speeds basically this is a 1400 without
SMT enabled from a price to performance
ratio the 1,300 X could run head-to-head
against the horizon 5 1500 XM scenarios
that don't necessarily require a large
number of course Andy has given a very
generous 3.5 gigahertz base clock speed
for this CPU and it can also run at a
nominal 3.6 K Hertz on all its course
provided adequate cooling is supplied
meanwhile the two core booster 8 hits
3.7 gigahertz while AMG's extended
frequency range
or xfr can pump things up to 3.9
gigahertz if we start throwing single
thread workloads at it on the other hand
Indies risin 3 1200 looks about the same
except it has significant cuts to its
frequencies its base cloth of 3.1
gigahertz is still quite low and unlike
the 1300 X which allowed for a higher
all Corbeau speed that base line would
still remain at 3.1 gigahertz until only
when 2 cores are required when that
happens you should see it boosted 3.4
gigahertz since this isn't an X series
part of the 200 megahertz of additional
Headroom for xfr is cut down to just 50
megahertz so this CPU will run at a
maximum of only three point four five
gigahertz even in single product tasks
while this may all sound confusing
here's a quick chart which shows how
both of these processors react in
different scenarios
now when compared to what Intel offers
the 1,300 X is $130 price point aligns
with the $140 for thread eye 370 380 u
whereas the 110 dollar wiesen 3 1200
would go against the $120 eye 370 100
CPU in addition with TDP s-- of just 51
watts
the Intel i3 processors seem to be quite
a bit more efficient as well that
doesn't mean that wiesen 3 would require
beefier PSU it would just run a few
degrees warmer than Intel but that would
be a topic for another video on paper
the thread counts on both Intel and
Andes processors look quite similar but
AMD could have an advantage here since
their quad thread layout is achieved
through 4 physical cores whereas the i3
CPUs are actually dual-core chips that
have SMT enabled remember SMT can add
some latency into the equation another
bonus feature is that Rison 3 is fully
unlocked so you can overclock it without
a problem but if you we're on Team Blue
you will need to pull out $160 for the
i3 73 50k which honestly still doesn't
make any sense these days at least not
with Verizon 5 around just to quickly go
over memory support since it remains
something of a minefield AMD has indeed
improved memory compatibility and
stability with their latest micro code
updates but they still support
twenty-four hundred megahertz with dual
rank ddr4 and 26 66 megahertz with
single rank modules you can get higher
frequencies through overclocking or
potentially using Rison certified memory
kit but for maximum compatibility I'd
recommend sticking to twenty six 66
megahertz and tightening timings to
achieve better performance now with
rising three processor is achieving
affordable levels there is no doubt that
AMD's bt-50 platform is a perfect
companion for these chips these
motherboards have quickly become
mainstream for folks who want access to
all the benefits that Rison has to offer
like native nvme storage connected
directly to the CPU and a chipset that
boasts USB 3.1 gen2 capabilities AMD has
also included a full stack of
overclocking options on their more
affordable motherboards which is so
refreshing to see when compared against
intel's much expensive z2 semi platform
do note that X 370 does have support for
dual graphics cards at x8 speeds a few
more chipset drive SATA ports and two
more USB 3.1 gen2 on nodes but the vast
majority of users won't need that extra
productivity anyways be through fifties
real selling factor is its price with
most well equipped examples going for
between 80 to 110 dollars
take this gigabyte d3 15 mini IX
motherboard for instance it's got all
the bells and whistles that most gamers
on a budget are looking for like dual
channel memory support a 2 PCI slot USB
3.1 gen2 type a built-in RGB lighting
and much more it's a solid foundation
that one can build an amazing system
moving forward you know what's even
awesome
unlike the higher-end Rison 7 and Rison
5 lineups all-wise and 3 processors come
with weight stealth coolers now many
tend to disregard this inclusion but if
you're strictly and I mean strictly on a
budget these coolers are quite decent
and it should even provide some more
thermal Headroom for overclocking I
would not consider picking up an
aftermarket solution simply because you
could use that money towards other
components like a faster GPU or a
nice-looking case ultimately it's your
call and now I think it's about time to
reveal the benchmarks so prepare your
bodies are you ready BAM
let's kick things off with a little bit
of Ida a benchmark suite that
uses high-level algorithms to simulate
different processing scenarios here we
see that the 1300 X and 1200 compete
pretty well against the I 370 300 and I
3 70 100 respectively except in
Photoworks which tends to use a single
core other benchmarks show the usual
rising highlights and multi-threaded
environments particularly in a DES
decryption and hashing algorithms these
Cinebench multi-core results have quite
a strong showing for AMD's and new chips
with the 1300 x handily beating intel's
7300 and actually coming close to the i5
7500 the Bison 3 1200 did pretty well
too but there's a massive gap between
the rising 3 CPS due to the 1200 very
low frequencies moving up to PC mark and
there's not really much different to
talk about with the 1300 accent 1200
trading below the Intel i3 series
depending on the workload W prime backs
us up too but again the 1300 ex shows
some amazing results while the 1200 lags
quite far behind even though it does BP
7100 by a narrow margin
moving on to single core results and
this is an area where a m-- DS Xen
architecture may have made some big
inroads but it still can compare to what
Intel can offer it is great to see these
very affordable processors competing
with higher and rising CPUs but Intel
really does dominate here next up we
have some benchmarks a few more of you
may be able to relate to 7-zip shows the
rise in three processors exactly where
we would expect them ahead of the 70 370
100 meanwhile Adobe Premiere really
likes those two rising processors since
they score very well in our 4k media
encoder video test as a matter of fact
with a little bit of overclocking the
1300 X shouldn't have any problem
achieving results that are pretty close
to the horizon 5 1400
however blender shows that the rising 3
1200 just can't keep up with the
competition due to its lower clock
speeds that's a bit of a problem since
these rendering tests have been a
strength for AMD luckily the 1,300 X
performance very well given its price
Corona has pretty much the same results
as blender with the 1200 lagging behind
the 1300 X really showing some strength
but when we move on to programs like
GIMP which uses between 1 and 2 full
worker threads as it processes an image
things don't look good for Rison
processors however this is absolutely
nothing new since intel has always been
ahead in lightly threaded workloads hand
brakes video conversion tool seems to be
a great fit for AMD's since the 39 of X
and 1200 both come up with some amazing
results as a matter of fact not only
does the horizon 339 index handily beats
the i3 7300 but it also comes close to
matching the 8 core FX 83-70 guys that's
pretty awesome
even pov-ray shows these very good
numbers so it looks like there are
certain applications that really do
benefit from for physical cores while
others seem to prefer intel's higher
clock speeds and SMT winrar is a bit of
a mess for AMD unfortunately since it
has integrated optimizations for Intel
processors and it only uses a few
processing threads that's the perfect
storm for AMD and they lose by a big
margin and now onto some game tests
starting with 5 strike and the scores
are actually very very good indeed the
Reisman 339 Ardex keeps ahead of the i3
7300 while the 1200 does the same
against the Intel 7100 the DX 12 times
by benchmark brings things a bit closer
but even in that situation the AMD
processors are still able to come out
with a narrow win but what does that
really mean for in-game tests well let's
find out
Rison just can't seem to catch much of a
break in games and despite being a game
that was heavily sponsored by Indies
battlefield one shows the advisor 3
processors very close to the back of the
chart here the i3 7,300 is more than 10
percent faster on average than the 1300
X and the i3 7100 is nearly 15 percent
faster than the 1200 Dale's ex sees a
graphics cards become a lot more of a
bottleneck so the top end of the
processor is between the horizon 5 1400
and I 777 from UK
literally offer the same performance
that includes the surprisingly fast
Verizon 3 1300 X as well the 1200 shows
some respectable results - I have a
funny feeling that we will see these new
rising 3 processors in quite a few
entry-level more
and FPS rates so performance and
overwatch is pretty important well
neither rising three CPU can directly
compete with the i3 processors they do
put up quite the effort that twelve
hundred dose in plea doesn't have these
stock clock speeds necessarily for
adequate gaming performance Call of Duty
on the other hand exhibits a game engine
frame rate cap so pretty much all the
processors perform equally so let's move
on
much like Call of Duty doom has an in
engine rendering cap that limits
performance to two hundred films per
second however while the rise in three
thirteen hundred X is able to keep up
with the big boys as is the more
affordable rise in three twelve hundred
rounding out the game testing is a bit
of an oddity
even though Grand Theft Auto game engine
is dx11 based it absolutely loves two
things many threads and Intel processors
that means the rising 3 1300 X and 1200
come a bit short against the usual eye
crease but not by a huge margin as for
power consumption I wanted to spend a
bit of time explaining these results
there is no denying both of these new
rising 3 processors are quite efficient
but they are also showing what happens
when quad-core parts go up against dual
cores remember these are essentially
eight core chips that have half their
logical processor nodes cut and that
itself leads to some efficiency losses
as a result against Intel i3 s rising 3
really doesn't fare all that well in the
power consumption department this isn't
to say the rising 3 is inefficient since
its its electricity when compared to a
Indies lineup of 6 and 8 port chips but
it won't win many performance per watt
competitions against Intel ok so now on
to overclocking and I definitely have a
lot of fun playing around with a 1300 X
and the 1200 let's start with a 1300 I
got it to about 4 gigahertz with a core
voltage or offset voltage of 0.15 and an
SOC voltage offset of 0.1 0 the
sentiment score is significant compared
to the stock score that we were able to
achieve I was only able to get the 1200
X to about 3.7 with a core offset
voltage of 0.14 and an SOC voltage of
0.1 0 and for CH initely I wasn't able
to memory or overclock the memory for
some reason even 2666 or even 2400
my cards did not work so it is something
that aims you still need to address I
guess we just have to wait for
motherboard or bundle board updates for
the for that BIOS for the respected BIOS
in my case I was using the ACS prime B
350 plus it's nice an option for a be
350 based motherboard but I guess you
know since this is a new series of
processors we just have to wait for a
future update to fix memory overclocking
oh hey there NCI XCOM is Canada's
leading a tailor for anything your mind
desires just keep within those
categories which are plenty and get
tempted by the weekly deals visit ncx
calm for all them sweet deals alright
guys so this has been a long one so I'm
going to wrap it up here with fear my
own thoughts and recommendations
personally I enjoyed my time testing the
rising 3 1300 X and 1200 which is
actually sitting at my test bench over
there it exactly shows how AMD is going
after Intel where it counts while also
providing excellent performance for
people on a budget now before you hop
into the Rison 3 bandwagon there are
some things that you need to be aware of
for the most part these processors will
be beaten by Intel's I 3 Series in
gaming and some lightly threaded
applications and simply the nature of
the Rison versus cable ache equation
right now but I personally feel like
Rising 3 offers a better value for
gamers than what an i3 good you see
overall platform cost is extremely
important and when one of these new AMD
processors is combined with a be 350
motherboard it becomes nearly impossible
to beat for someone on a budget remember
that unlike the i3 series rising 3
processors can easily make up any
performance deficiency by overclocking
and overclocking is fully supported on
v3 50 even though both of these
processors have their strengths and
weaknesses
I feel like rising 3 1300 X is a lot
more appealing than the 1200 it's high
frequencies go a long way towards
competing against the i3 7300 and at
some points it even starts knocking on
the I five seventy five hundreds door
honestly I can't recommend the rise in
three 1200 simply because the 1300 X
only cost $20 more you could suck
provides a few Starbucks coffees to
afford that because I think that from
its stock performance to its
overclocking Headroom and price the
13-under tax is still one of the best
processors available in the market today
and that's one of the reasons why we're
giving it the hover connects damn good
end to end good value award well that
concludes this review of rising 3 I hope
you enjoyed let me know what you guys
