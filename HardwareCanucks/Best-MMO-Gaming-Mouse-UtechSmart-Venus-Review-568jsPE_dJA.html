great technology selections and service
how's it going guys Eber here with
Harbor Canucks and you techsmartt has
released an interesting product for
those gamers who rely on multiple
controls at the tip of the thumb
specifically for MMOs and strategy
gaming this is the Venus MMO Mouse
priced at hundred dollars you tic Smart
has gone with a nice ergonomic shape
like proper ring and pinky finger
support plus a small lip for your thumb
that could be larger but it does help to
separate the thumb from hitting these
side buttons the soft touch rubber
surface in the mouth feels excellent
although it will wear out as time passes
and we've gotten accustomed to aluminum
frames on gaming mice so the Venus feels
weak and at this price point we'd expect
more at 150 grams to weight is average
but it's always great to add a few more
grams for those who prefer a heavier
Mouse so you can twist the bottom
circular plate which exposes little
inserts for additional weights plus a
weight storing cartridge is included so
they don't get misplaced an additional
set of teflon feet is included in case
you'd require a replacement so that's
considerate the mouse has a high
precision laser sensor with dpi up to
16,000 400 a perfect example of
pointless specifications on the Box
higher dpi does not mean more accurate
tracking nor it is an indication of
sensor quality and my usual 800 dpi gave
me the best suitable tracking experience
the mouse does track on white surfaces
but not on glass so that's something to
keep in mind there are 18 programmable
buttons on the Venus 12 of which are
located on the right side as you can see
each column is angle that makes
differentiation between buttons easier
plus the most part they all have a
uniform click with a really tactile
registration if you enjoy macro
recordings you'll love this the first
two columns are imperfect to reach for
your thumb plus thanks to the variable
angle on each set with some muscle
memory you'll easily adjust to clicking
the right button the two rear columns
were a little more difficult to press
requiring some grip readjustment as my
thumb sits naturally more forward but
overall they have nailed the side button
placement to be effective for MMO gamers
the left hand right clicks have a short
travel distance with a very light press
there is an additional button for your
pointer finger located at the tip of the
left flick as well as the DPI shift
buttons placed behind the scroll wheel
with five dpi settings and clearly
visible dpi indicators the scroll wheel
is quite loose without clearly defined
scroll steps that's disappointing but it
is rubberized and easy to press the
profile shift is placed at the bottom of
the mouth so it's slightly inconvenient
needing to flip it to change your
profiles but it helps to have a physical
switch rather than software only we have
four lighting zones so the logo at the
back and the macro buttons on the right
side then the scroll wheel and this cool
illumination at the front
now you can't individually adjust the
color zones which I don't think is a
problem as you'd want the lighting to
stay uniform anyway and the five
profiles are color coded on the scroll
wheel so that's the only thing you don't
have to control over the included
software could be less cluttered and
modernized but at least we get all the
needed options such as button mapping
for the six buttons on the top as well
as the twelve buttons on the side with a
pretty good selection of predefined
settings I think the fire key is useful
for burst fire mode with delay in
between macro recordings of course are
needed with pretty simple configuration
and many others that could come in handy
there's the acceleration pointer speed
scroll speed double clicking speed and
the polling rate options for your
preference with five profiles that are
not stored on the mouse unfortunately
that is disappointing for the price
there's also the DPI adjustment where
you can set the d-plan levels with five
steps and in lighting options you choose
your color preference
brightness levels and breathing speed so
I'm happy to see these standard options
available so the Venus MMO gaming mouse
hits the market with a lot of positives
like the excellent ergonomics shade 18
programmable macros provide flexibility
for different games that might take
advantage of it and the excellent
tactile response of the buttons really
adds onto a much better gaming
experience weight adjustment is a bonus
and the additional included Teflon feed
pads are much appreciated the only thing
lacking is the build quality
and I definitely would love to see a
sturdy frame but what do you think would
you prefer an MMO style gaming mouse or
would you go for a less cluttered design
