at Legion Lenovo and look what we found
the new Y 740 laptop let's take a look
at it but first huge thanks to our
sponsors thermaltake fantex MSI Razer
and Corsair for making this trip
possible so this is the Y 700 series
refresh for the l√©gion line of notebooks
now with our TX graphics from Nvidia
with the RT X 2060 and our TX 2070 max-q
for the 15 inch and up to 20 80 max Q
for these 17 inch larger screen models
these will start at $1600 a very
competitive price point for than RT X
you know equipped notebook and will have
plenty of unique upgrades like a Dolby
vision HDR panel option that goes up to
500 minutes of brightness and that's
probably not full panel brightness but
just like short flashes during really
bright scenes and HDR mode and HDR
content they are g-sync ready at 144
Hertz and only 1080p resolution so
nothing tire and well it kind of looks
like a really solid gaming panel
especially with an RT X 2060 and you'll
basically fly with fps and another
hardware change is an option for
overclocked memory up to 3200 megahertz
if you opt out for this 16 gigabyte
model and I really like this chassis
design it's all practical as you have
some USB ports on the side and audio
ports on the other side but majority of
i/o is actually located at the back with
illuminated signs so you can see the
port selection illumination on the
ventilation ports looks awesome on the
sides and in the back to the keyboard
illumination is controlled via coursers
IQ software so it's a nice collaboration
and the trackpad is precise with smooth
navigation the webcam isn't a bit of a
poor location but the bezels are quite
thin and the hinge feels robust and you
know while their slogan is kind of
terrible with the style meets average dy
740 and y 540 notebooks kind of need
that balance of design and power and
then there is this monitor the widest
thing that we've seen the show for right
now the Y 44 w dash tank keyboard what
are your thoughts it's a very wide
monitor
and I think there's a lot of screen real
estate that you can play around with
most particularly if you want to do a
picture-in-picture mode you can have two
displays or two different systems plug
it into the monitor and like do your
thing Wow very impressed Michael I think
it's a great motor for productivity
provided you can take care of the body
of 100 and say I have no idea what I
want to say it's great to see freesync 2
on this monitor
if only they had an AMD GPU option it's
all of their systems why do they not
have any games installed like I don't
get it I do agree with you guys
and you know I would love to see some
games install and PC just so you can get
the true experience I don't know if we
are going to be seeing something even
wider than this later but that would be
kind of extreme and hilarious hilarious
not low-larious its file areas it's wide
larious all right we got to get out
because they are having a private event
and we got ok but for real the specs on
the Y 44 w monitor are kind of unique so
it's a 44 inch panel with a pretty
substantial 1,800 our curvature so it's
almost the size of 2 24 inch panels it's
got an odd resolution of 3840 by 1200 so
the aspect ratio is 32 by 10 and it's
great for multi window workflows but
what about game support the refresh rate
is 144 Hertz that's really nice it
supports AMD freesync 2 it has HDR 400
specifications so it's not too bright at
only 400 nits there is a detachable
speaker built into the stand that is
Bluetooth I find that really interesting
plus this convenient drop-down IO with
an audio jack and some USB ports and for
the back IO we have duo Type C so you
can charge other accessories or use it
for display output we're not sure about
the price yet but for a curved ultra
wide gaming monitor it's got some
interesting characteristics so let us
know and this is your style thanks for
watching we'll see you guys in the next
