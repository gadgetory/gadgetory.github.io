gigabytes factory in Taiwan and this was
our first experience exploring the
facility as well as how components are
manufactured from start to finish so
without any further ado welcome to our
gigabyte factory tour video huge thanks
to our Computex sponsors for sending us
out here
shoutout to nvidia fan techs and CIX and
msi the staff warmly welcomed us with an
interesting and fun little activity of
manually and starting io components
capacitors in pci brackets by hand onto
the motherboard I definitely enjoyed
this part then we moved on to the
presentation hall where the presenter
took the first 10 minutes going over the
history of gigabyte the factory was
established in the year 2000 and it
turns out the gigabyte is the only
Factory in Taiwan to manufacture
motherboards interesting now one of the
factory does make graphics card power
supplies laptops and mobile devices just
for presentation purposes they decided
to showcase how motherboards were made
essentially the process is broken down
into four components SMT di P testing
and packaging SM T stands for surface
mount technology and this facility is
where smaller components are soldered
onto the motherboard it all starts with
placing the boards in a stack
configuration and the machine
automatically pushes a single piece onto
the advanced printer which reads out the
pre labeled layout and it goes to a
series of soldering tiny components once
that's done every single motherboard is
inspected for miss printing and they
have an integrated chip tester then make
sure the components are well placed and
after passing the best ones off it goes
to D IP or in other words dual inline
package this was one of my favorite
parts the process is primarily based off
manual insertion every employee is
responsible for a single component and
this includes larger capacitors IO ports
24 pin connectors unit
it they also had this advanced capacitor
installing machine that was so quick
that I secretly enjoyed the setup after
all the components are installed on the
board it has to be double check to make
sure that these components are installed
properly then these boards go through an
intense heat chamber I was told that it
goes all the way up to 265 degrees and
the board sits there for about four
seconds this is done to reinforce the
manual inserts and right after that they
all go into the testing facility they
use something called a function box and
as you can see literally every i/o port
is connected all the PCI Express Lanes
are in use it goes through several
stages of testing until the board passes
it should also be noted that there's a
serial barcode in every board and every
time they scan it it pulls up all the
information regarding whether or not the
testing occurred thumbs up gigabyte for
quality control last but not least is
the packaging this is where they make
sure all the contents of the board goes
inside and this includes the i/o shield
the manual SATA cables etc about 1200
employees work there and 70% of them
have more than 15 years of experience
gigabyte has definitely planted out very
well well I hope you enjoyed our little
factory tour of the gigabyte facility
let us know if you'd like to see more of
these factory tour videos and stay tuned
for more Computex coverage amiibo
retiree connects thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
