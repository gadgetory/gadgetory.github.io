and welcome back to another review
all-in-one desktop PCs are still lagging
in popularity because they compete with
ultra books that are a lot more portable
and price wise they just don't offer the
same performance if you were to build
your own for example and this leaves the
question then where do all-in-one PCs
fit in considering more powerful options
exists like a conventional desktop well
for compact and tight spaces all in ones
are certainly best for stationary
machines that look clean and best of all
are very simple today were going to take
a look at an arrow from delq which they
claim to be the thinnest and lightest
solution within this category this is
the XPS 18 now the variant configuration
and pricing so be expected to pay around
$1,400 for the i7 version eight gigs of
ram 500 gigabyte hard drive plus a 32
gigabyte SSD while the lower models
include weaker processors and less ram
and they do not feature the SSD nor the
power dock while the third gen Ivy
Bridge CPUs are adequate for casual use
there are unfortunately no Haswell
options at the moment from the name this
is an 18 point 4 inch touch I P s
display with full HD support and given
Windows 8 is pre-installed you get to
experience the rest with all the finger
gestures the way it was meant to be the
viewing angles in this machine are
pretty good so is the contrast overall
the display is beautiful although the
bezel could be a little smaller like
with any touch display though the
fingerprint Magnus is certainly present
and there's really no way around that if
you constantly use the touch interface
the unit itself is actually quite light
weighting just under 5 pounds and
surprisingly thin at 0.69 inches it does
stand out closer to the top which makes
a big difference if you're holding this
in portrait mode and given its size it's
actually quite portable you can use it
on your lap or lay it on a flat surface
just remember this is not meant to
replace your tablet but instead
complement tight spaces now one thing I
would have loved to see as a wall mount
I could see a lot of potential use for
commercial purposes something customers
can interact with while in the store for
example and this feature however is
emitted which is a letdown there are two
USB ports headphone and power jack
hidden card reader and the full
Walker on one side and a power button on
the other we also have a front facing
webcam and capacitive windows button at
the front of the device stereo speakers
are located on each side so projection
is good regardless of how the device is
positioned plus it comes equipped with
Dells own sound drivers to boost the
volume adjust equalizer and set your
presets but honestly the audio out of
this thing is very harsh it likes any
bass response and the highs in the mid
range is so overly emphasized it is
extremely unpleasant take a listen here
this is the highest volume without any
enhancements and now even boosting the
volume introduces very harsh sound for
comparison take a listen to how my
travel notebooks sound with a much
improved bass response in overall listen
to my favorite tunes and explore the
world of audio so informed AIO pc
speaker quality i think is crucial to
avoid having to opt out for a dedicated
set so a little disappointing from Dell
all models of the ex PC 18 comes with
its own Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to
keep up with a portable factor for
$1,400 I was expecting something less
plastic perhaps a backlit keyboard would
be nice I didn't experience any issues
with the keyboard nor the mouse so aside
from expecting more they function
perfectly fine at the back we have a
pair of smooth rubberized feet that
allow the unit to stand at an
appropriate angle but if you do decide
to get the optional power dock you get a
more conventional style all-in-one with
the display lifted and with angle
adjustments the power cable is routed
cleanly through the rear cut out and is
basically hidden and once placed on the
dock the X PC xviii will charge with a
subtle LED to indicate its point in and
charging you can easily lift the device
off the dock as it's not on any clips
but sits tight on magnetic backing I
like this dog it's heavy and doesn't
wobble but it is quite low with no
height adjustments and a few extra USB
ports also would be nice and I ran into
this very annoying issue while either
taking the screen off the dock or
lacing it back on now what happens is
the charging notifications starts to
play in loops and the touch interface
stuff yes the mouse and keyboard work
just fine but requires a restart or
sleep mode to be enabled to resolve the
issue
it happened on both the replacement unit
and the first one we received and they
actually discovered this issue
completely by accident by plugging in a
USB from the side and the screen
slightly lifted off the dock and went
back down
this is either a driver issue or
hardware but about three out of the five
times I took it off the dock I had to
either restart the machine or put it to
sleep which is unacceptable for a
product in this category the ex PC 18
however does perform as advertised the
i5 version we have here was totally fine
handling blu-ray video stream online
browsing and office work which this is
intended for it doesn't do well for
gaming with the HD 4000 graphics card
and with any heavy load the fans were
certainly audible also another issue I
noticed was with the headphone jack
there was a slight hiss loud enough to
notice with low volume and I wasn't
expecting amazing audio quality but I
would have settled for clean audio now
I'm trying to place the X PC 18 within
the market of all-in-one PCs as this to
simplify is a tablet on a stand and
would serve perfectly fine as the family
PC in the living room on being able to
carry it around off the dock has its
benefits not for me personally but say
you place it in your kitchen counter
while making dinner on your balcony for
a show or a coffee table for a Skype
call this certainly is not for everyone
especially those who don't care by the
touch screen or work mainly from a
laptop but suit compact spaces for
stationery purposes as the five hour
battery life doesn't exactly serve the
needs for portable users and to conclude
Dell managed to create a very stylish
and simple ayoh with a decent touch and
full HD display it is very light and
compact solution for tight spaces and
performs like it should for the specs
however the issue with the charging dock
is a major turnoff especially after the
two of the review samples had
experienced the same
issue and at this price point that's
absolutely unacceptable also I wish the
sound card was improved to get rid of
the hissing headphones and focus on
better quality stereo speakers so users
can enjoy the compact nature of the AIO
without having to use dedicated speakers
also lower models are way too expensive
for the type of performance they offer
so if you really love the style you
better opt out for the i-5 or in the i7
models now does live up to the hype of
being the world's lightest and thinnest
AIO so it really comes down to the
performance compromise given the price
as more powerful notebooks exist of
course building your own desktop for the
same amount would equate to better
performance but what the XP
lacks and future expansions and upgrade
ability it makes up this very compact
package as long as you don't rely on
audio playback so things guys for
watching let us know what you think of
the XPS 18 and a IO is in general where
do they fit within the whole market of
custom desktops let us know in the
comments below and we'll see you in the
next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
