basic 2.0 desktop speaker system by
Razer and they're targeting this to
consumers who are looking for something
a bit different than traditional
bookshelf type speakers you offer a well
balanced sound stage without emphasizing
too much on the base hence the lack of a
dedicated subwoofer now razer offers the
Nomo in three flavors there's a standard
model that comes with a 3.5 millimeter
jack and a headphone output and that
costs $100 the Nomo chroma that I have
over here costs 50 dollars more and it
comes with everything from the standard
Nomo plus a USB connection with a DAC
and RGB lighting because it's 2018 and
then there's the noma Pro which cost
five hundred dollars and it comes with
all the bells and whistles like THX
certification dedicated subwoofer you've
also got larger drivers we actually did
get a chance to listen to that at CES
and quite frankly I was blown away
buying how they sounded we're not
expecting those until later this year
but today we're gonna be checking out
the Razer Nomo and what it offers to the
table but most importantly is it worth
$100 or $150 depending on the other two
models so let's find out right after
this the new OC CTR 200 from Toshiba is
a great value SSD if you're considering
upgrading your hard drive and get a nice
boost in performance with cutting-edge
3d flash memory and ultra reliable
controller with built-in power
management available in different
capacities check it out below okay so
from a design standpoint the Nomo
actually looks very stealth I love the
different approach Razer took to design
these speakers because they look out of
the ordinary there are not a lot of
gamer elements going over the main
chassis and the branding is very subtle
so you can easily accommodate this in an
office space if you desire just remember
that these are meant to be desktop
speakers and not something that you'd
put in your kitchen or somewhere else
the build quality is respectable for a
pair of hundred dollar speakers it's not
made out of aluminum or other premium
materials but rather it's plastic and
it's put together really well after
all these are meant to be stationary at
your desks so I don't think bill quality
should be of any concern one thing to
take note of is that the speakers don't
pivot upwards on their stands this could
affect taller listeners i prop them a
bit higher to see if there was a
difference in projection of sound and
from my non-scientific observations it
was minimal but that's something to be
aware of the stands are pretty stable to
hold these lenders all drivers so I
don't think you should be worried about
tipping them accidentally because the
weight distribution throughout the
chassis is balanced feature wise you get
a dedicated volume and basic just knobs
and as you control the volume the subtle
lining underneath the right speaker
gives a visual representation on the
levels and they have just in two step
intervals same goes for the left side of
the speaker that represents bass just
which is a nice touch
remember the LED indicators are only
present in the chroma version and not
the standard model the bass knob can be
used to adjust the intensity of the bass
output so if you like listening to tunes
that emphasize a lot in vocals or if you
like watching a lot of movies to get
that extra immersion this is an
excellent feature to take advantage of
I'll get into sound quality a bit later
ask for aisle you get aux-in power in a
headphone output but as I mentioned
earlier the chroma version of the normal
speakers comes with a USB connection /
doc so you can connect that to your PC
plus take advantage of the different
effects within chroma through the
synapse software that's something you
can't do with the standard version of
the Nomos so do keep that in mind let's
talk about the tech powering these
speakers Razer has implemented a custom
Vohland glass fiber 3-inch drivers which
are designed to deliver a more
pronounced and consistent sound
especially in the highs without being
too sharp now the cylindrical form is
meant to channel a lot of air into its
we're facing bass ports which in turn
increases the bass response and reduces
distortion at higher volumes and just so
you're aware both the standard version
and the chroma version of the noma
feature identical drivers so they're
gonna sound exactly the same but how do
they actually sound in person
in one word phenomenal and I was not
expecting that for a pair of speakers
that cost $100 I think the last time
that I looked at a system at about the
same price was from Logitech
and that was the MX sound the main
highlight for that speaker system was
the easy switch feature that essentially
lets users switch between different
audio services seamlessly without
fiddling around controls the noma
doesn't feature any of those fancy
characteristics but it sounds a lot
superior to the MX sound you can take my
word for it there's fantastic detail in
the highs and you'll love listening to
vocals the maids are also well within
reach plus the bass is pronounced it
doesn't get distorted at higher volumes
plus I didn't feel like I needed a
dedicated subwoofer to experience the
full-bodied sound because the Nomo
surprisingly delivered balanced stereo
imaging for a 2.0 setup I also had a
great experience in gaming with the Nomo
the stereo imaging is very clear and
easier to follow along especially when
you're moving around through the
gameplay
it also helps zeroing in on enemies
depending on which side they're at
gunshot spelled boo me which was awesome
and I'm really happy with what razer has
accomplished here with the Nomo
fantastic performance or the price Razer
synapse has been through a visual
overhaul and I'm really diggin it so far
it's cleaner it's easier to understand
and navigate around for instance you're
greeted with the dashboard that
showcases the devices you've connected
in my case I have the Noma chroma but if
you have other Razer peripherals they'll
show up here once you click on the Nommo
you can adjust a volume play around with
different audio presets I prefer the
default setting but your taste might
vary since the sound is always objective
the lighting tab is where you can adjust
the brightness of the leds you also have
the ability to turn them off you can
also change the effects and the user
also has the option to create his or her
own lighting effect through chroma
studio and it features a lot of
customizable options which is pretty
cool
so overall I'm really impressed with
what Razer has done with the Nomo I mean
I love the design of this guy because
it's so unique and it's definitely
different from a traditional you know
both bookshelf type speaker or any other
desktop
2.0 speakers that you have or you you
can find in the market right now the
build quality might not be the best out
there but honestly for its price I can
give it a pass what really surprised me
the most was the sound quality in the
soundstage these deliver
I prefer 2.0 desktop speaker systems
rather than having a son before but in
some cases I do miss having that
dedicated subwoofer because currently my
daily driver is the Sound Blaster katana
sound bar and I have it paired up with a
subwoofer and the the immersion is
unreal but it kind of makes sense
because that thing cost like $300 and
this is $100 and I can totally you know
understand the difference between both
of them because they're priced
differently I do have a few suggestions
razor could perhaps out in the next
revision bluetooth you know if you could
give us Bluetooth connectivity on both
these you know that both a chroma and
the regular version of the chroma
that'd be great I'm also if you could
implement a dedicated subwoofer port
that would be great too so you can
connect your own subwoofer depending on
brands and an experience or expand that
set up to you know give you a little bit
more immersion that would be pretty cool
but other than that I really don't have
anything to complain about the razor no
mom no one thing that I feel like a lot
of users might be confused as to which
one should I pick the Nomo the standard
Noma or the Noma chroma speakers I would
say you know if you don't care about RGB
lining and if you don't want to play
around with lighting effects and whatnot
pick the standard and no no speakers
because I did test out the sound
differences between USB and the auxin on
normal chroma and I was not able to find
a difference between the two but that
could just you know that's just personal
preference if you really want RGB lining
if you love having that subtle LED
lighting around and if you want to sync
up that lighting with your razor
peripherals because you could do that if
you have a razor keyboard and a razor
mouse this could be a great addition to
your setup but other than that I would
love to hear your thoughts on the razor
noma what do you guys think about the
speaker is it really worth a hundred
dollars do you see yourself picking one
up let us know in the comments down
below
I'm Ebert with hurricane axe thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
