are coming up and among this wall of
goodies there's one particular special
goodie that I'm super excited to check
out this one right here oh yeah
it's then you define our six from
fractal wow this thing really brings
back some memories not much has changed
but only refined thus the define here
comes the peel so it has been a while
since the last generation of the fine
series I'm super excited to see what the
r6 has to offer let's check it out the
new master liquid all-in-one coolers are
available in 120 and 240 millimeter
stylish radiator sizes with air balance
fans included for best air flow and RGB
sync on the pump and the fans that are
controlled via this hub or through your
motherboard check out the ML 120 ln 240
l down below alright guys I am NOT going
to spoil any surprises that you will see
later in the video but I have a feeling
a lot of people are going to love to
define our six because it's a
combination of basically everything
users have been asking for in 2017 and
fractal have clearly been listening so
you're looking at the mid tower format
available in four colors priced at the
same 129 which is awesome with a TG
Edition at the $20 premium now I kind of
appreciate fractals approach to avoiding
risk you know there's no RGB and there's
no at a single exterior logo because the
case doesn't really need it you know it
looks like any other defined case with a
staple aluminum front plate and the side
ventilation wide bladed fans unless you
get the black out edition and as with
any other defined case the r6 feels
awesome from
quality perspective and it also feels
fresh for example notice the temporal a
side panel in the lack of the side thumb
screws for the mount that is present on
like 99% of cases with TG instead the
thumb screws are located at the rear out
of sight and the glass has mounted on
basically this metal interior frame that
also has two pegs for this two-step
mounting procedure creating this tooless
mount that is super convenient and looks
better without the thumb screws sticking
out from the side they also get more
fresh points for the inclusion of a
removable five the quarter inch drive
bay because a lot of people still find
use for an optical drive the door can be
swapped to open from either side and it
opens just to ninety degrees there's a
fine dust filter with angled vents that
I'm not sure is either for airflow or
noise purposes and it covers dual 140
Miller fans
plus there's a third 140 millimeter
exhaust fan at the rear for a nice
out-of-the-box cooling the i/o is basic
with audio power reset and four USB
ports that are fully black with dark
illumination on the power button and the
middle crack now you might question the
lack of a type C port but they are
selling this optional $30 IO panel that
includes one because based on their
market research people wanted by default
but they don't want to pay for it more
now 30 bucks to get your type C port is
pricey considering the price of the case
and I wish fractal offered some sort of
a rebate program let's say if you return
to the stock IO because what are you
going to do with it otherwise coming to
the top we have a new form of a module
and that spends the entire ceiling and
has a built in dust filter a nice chunky
button releases the panel and the entire
mechanism and the springs feel robust
and with this top panel you have two
options either fully closed or fully
open with that another fine dust filter
with angle or ventilation it's a
fantastic route for either airflow or
silence but detaching the metal cover
from the dust filter is a complete pain
that I could only detach with my knife
and I wish the two pieces were not so
tight together
also the angular filter adds a different
character to the case now it looks more
industrial but unfortunately it doesn't
match up to the front side ventilation
and also the gap between the filter and
the frame is quite large and you can
actually see through inside and
it's a glaring oversight as for the fan
bracket they are one of the best in the
business for water cooling support so
we've got flexible rails for the entire
length of the bracket
there's even a fill port cutout for your
convenience the bracket is super sturdy
and can easily hold the weight of the
case and my only complaint are these
tiny screws that need to be removed to
get the panel out a 360 rad is not a
problem here you even have two mounting
positions for 120mm fans either closer
to the side panel or to the motherboard
eight to 80 rad can fit to that you can
slide along the bracket and triple 140
member fans have enough clearance but be
cautious when reinstalling the fan
bracket and the top panel as the
mounting holes are close together so
insert them into their appropriate
levels okay so now for the interior at
first glance it looks odd with so much
room occupied with that large panel but
it's all here for a reason
first I like the pre-installed
motherboard standoffs with the middle
one to cache the board the power supply
shroud is the perfect height it's fully
perforated with two large cutouts below
the motherboard with dual SSD mounts
only one of which is appropriately
placed for clean wiring that I think
might be by design because the left SSD
is in the exact spot where you could
mount this PCI riser cable for a
vertical GPU mount now it is a $40.00
accessory and I had trouble mounting the
GPU into the frame because the alignment
wasn't exactly perfect with the riser
card but spacing is enough for other PCI
devices on your motherboard to clear and
there's also a little bit of room
between the glass panel for the GPU to
breathe and by way check out our video
on why not to use vertical GPUs right
over here so behind this large front
panel is our storage facility with white
metal drive caddies that our SSD ready I
love this approach because it's
completely modular so the six larger
trays can be moved around and because
they're so slim you can stack three of
them right at the bottom four SSD mounts
and not use that much vertical space and
we have four centimeters of clearance
from the front fans so a radiator will
fit without causing issues with these
caddies and I love that there's a fan
hub here for nine fans it is SATA power
and controlled via PWM connector on your
motherboard and I simple an effective
combination for proper fan control now
this whole front section reminds me of
the H 440 approach from NZXT but that
similar closed off front part but check
this out
the front plate that hides the mainframe
can be moved all the way back to open up
this front section and you have to
remove the fans and the top bay but a
few screws later and we have a more
familiar open interior frame this is
mainly targeted for water cooling now
that we have 17 centimeters of clearance
for push ball or thicker radiators from
that front panel or you can use that
open space to mount radiator on the
floor a 240 rod will fit no problem
but be cautious about power supply
clearance and now it makes sense why we
have such a large dust filter removable
from the front the five new quarter-inch
bacon still be mounted with this
configuration and the only compromise is
storage as now we can only get dual
three and a half inch drives behind that
panel overall I really like this
flexibility on the r6 to open it up but
unless you're mounting water cooling
Hardware I really like the panel up
front to make the interior more intimate
and this is where I ran into my first
clearance issue trying to mount a 360
rad up top so it turns out the side
panel interferes with the closest
mounting strip so in this configuration
you can only mount a 240 rad up top so I
decided to relocate one of my front fans
for top exhaust and get that 360 rad
nicely hidden at the front there is no
interference with the larger caddies so
I can mount more hard drives and all of
my fans are routed into the hub at the
back for easy fan control that then I
route into my motherboard cables are
easily cleaned up on both sides with
lots of room beside the power supply and
general routing behind the motherboard
tray is fine with built-in velcro straps
and cable tie points in good locations
once the side panel is mounted back you
have nice showcase of your components
without revealing that hard drive area
now you might say what's the point of
glass panel then if so much of the
interior is covered but I would say
reflections are nice and the lack of
that intense interior lighting makes it
look more elegant and finally I wanted
to see if the front panel would choke
the fans in the 30-minute stress test
seeing that's been like the pattern for
cases in this year and having the panel
open the differ
in CPU temperatures at load was only
three degrees Celsius with slightly
lower rpm so nicely done on the front
ventilation design experience every
pixel with the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti and
enjoy these awesome new games and full
4k resolution at over 60 frames per
second and get destiny 2 for free
for a limited time for details in the
description below and so the definer 6
is like the perfect two-in-one enclosure
you can either go heavy and storage yet
still have room for front and top
radiators or go with a full custom loop
with more room to play around with but
less storage and more importantly it's
not compromising any of their existing
cases like the more compact mesh fic
they all have sort of their roles to
play with in the case market without
sort of approaching on their own turf I
love the direction that the r6 is taking
and it deserves our damn good at work so
guys let me know if you share the same
thinking of this thing feeling fresh
even though it's a defined serious case
it looks the same to all the other
defined series
I just loved all the you know
incremental revisions that they've added
that makes this case really stand out
from 2017 so thank you so much for
watching make sure to subscribe and
watch this other relevant content it
will see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
