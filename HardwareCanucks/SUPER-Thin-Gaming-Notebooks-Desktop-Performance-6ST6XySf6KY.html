recall a few months back and video
officially launched their max key
technology which endeavored to offer
desktop class gaming performance in an
ultrabook size portable form factor the
resulting designs we're a significant
step forward in the notebook sphere but
most importantly it also gave us a
little glimpse into what the future had
in store for gamers now Nvidia promised
excellent gaming performance along with
great battery life an acoustics and I
was really curious to test out some of
these new max key notebooks because I've
been on a hunt to find a portable
editing notebook ever since Computex and
this is just perfect timing because CES
is just a month away and I have these
two notebooks to test out on one hand
there's the rog zephyrus that features
an i7 7700 HQ cpu 16 gigabytes of RAM
GTX 1080 in its max Q design a 512
gigabyte Samsung nvme SSD 15.6 inch
1080p 120 Hertz g-sync IPS display
that's wide my friends g-sync at 120
Hertz and it retails for $2,700 yikes
but on the other hand we have the
gigabyte arrow 15 X featuring the exact
same specs except for the GPU in this
case it comes with 810 78 Oshima and me
me SSD and a 1080p 60 Hertz IPS display
and this retails for $2,200 which is
still expensive notebook now think about
it this way these notebooks are designed
and geared towards a specific type of
audience the one who cares about
performance Portability and efficiency
in a compact form factor now there's
obviously the argument that you can
build a much better gaming desktop PC
for less than half the cost of these
notebooks but you know ultimately comes
down to your preference if you really
want performance and you know efficiency
in a compact form factor there's gonna
be a premium price to pay for that so
let's take an in-depth look of the rog
Zephyrs and the gigabyte air or 15x
right after message from our sponsor the
new master liquid all-in-one coolers are
available in 120 and 240 millimeter
stylish radiator sizes with air balanced
fans included for best airflow and RGB
sync on the pump and the fans that are
controlled via this hub or through your
motherboard check out the ML 120 ln 240
L down below
all right let's get being soft with the
ROG Zephyrus because it's a unique
notebook in every aspect when compared
to the competition the first noticeable
difference is the design of this
notebook when you open it up you'll
notice that Asus had to make some
structural sacrifices namely embedding a
desktop class GPU into a thin and light
chassis and as a result the entire
keyboard had to move downwards that
means most of the mission critical
components are closer to the screen
along with cooling intakes now organ
Amma Klee the keyboard placement didn't
really make any sense especially when
placed on my lap it felt far too close
to me and it was an uncomfortable typing
experience moving the notebook further
away isn't feasible either since it
would partially hang off my knees same
story goes when you're working off a
desk
make sure you have ample amount of
vertical space to push the notebook
further away but be mindful that could
increase the viewing distance which may
or may not affect visibility of the
screen but generally speaking this is
just a non design but I'd love to hear
your thoughts on it in the comments
quick mention on the keys they deliver
excellent tactile feedback they don't
require a lot of pressure to actuate and
the keys are LED backlit plus they have
received the RGB treatment and
customization can be done through
software the trackpad is surprisingly
well thought-out and it's amazing too
while the amount of lateral space is
restrictive the dedicated left and right
buttons are so much better than
integrated buttons found on other
notebooks the responsiveness is spot-on
again this is thanks to the use of
windows precision drivers and the
trackpads inherent resistance ensures
its learning curve is gentle asus has
also implemented a numpad within the
trackpad with the touch of this button
in the upper left corner the LEDs light
up and it works great the rest of the
design language is pretty minimal Asus
didn't go too fancy with the aggressive
red and black accents although I do have
to point out that the brushed aluminum
material picks up grease and
fingerprints easily so to keep that in
mind the underside of the Zephyrs is
pretty interesting as well the entire
bottom plate lifts itself slightly off
the tabletop at an angle once the lid is
opened it's called the active
aerodynamics system that allows the
notebook to breathe a little bit better
which should also theoretically result
in lower temperatures because a souza is
crammed a gtx 1080 inside this slim
frame the included screwdriver can be
used to remove
bottom plate if you need to clean the
fence but unfortunately getting to the
rest of the components is extremely
difficult since they're locked tightly
in areas where you can't access them
without that screwdriver now the
implementation of a s is an excellent
idea on paper but I feel like it could
also cost longevity issues you see the
bottom plate flexes and it's quite
flimsy as well one wrong move could
break the hinges at least in theory but
I guess time will tell the IO is
respectable on this notebook on the
right hand side there's Kensington lock
2 USB 3.1 gen2 on ports and a USB 3.1
gen2 type-c / Thunderbolt 3 connector
switching over to the left there is
power in hdmi 2.0 2 more USB 3.1 gen2
and a headphone / mike jack now if you
need to get a DisplayPort output from
this efforts you can use a thunderbolt
to display port adapter which
unfortunately doesn't come with a
notebook plus you sacrifice on the only
type C Thunderbolt port so do keep that
in mind the lack of an SD card reader is
a bummer so is the exclusion of a LAN
port but Asus does include a USB type a
2 rj45 adapter out of the box ok let's
switch gears and discuss the gigabyte
Aero 15 X and right off the bat this
thing looks like a normal notebook
unlike the zephyrus it's a lot more
compact and space-efficient than Asus
offering since gigabyte has managed to
fit a 15.6 inch matte display in a
smaller footprint and the end result
ultra thin bezels along with maximizing
the keyboards horizontal space across
the entire chassis and visually this
thing is thin and lighter than the
Zephyrs it can pull double duty as a
gaming station or a mobile creative
power horse which is kind of what I'm
looking for in the first place I also
like the design of the Aero 15 X it's
pretty simple without any gamer elements
added to the body and I appreciate that
on a gaming notebook simple on the
outside beastly on the inside the
keyboard is fantastic to type wood
seriously it's one of the best that I've
come across in a notebook
they exhibit great tactile feedback plus
there is good amount of child distance
which almost makes it feel like typing
on a hybrid mechanical keyboard and I
really enjoy my time with it but the
trackpad is downright atrocious now
don't get me wrong the surface is super
smooth for navigation and the integrated
buttons are
no but it's the parable eland drivers
that come out of the box now supposedly
you could replace the existing eland
drivers with Windows position drivers
and I'll leave a link to Dave today's
video in the description down below
where he walks you through the process
of updating you know existing elion
olson attic drivers to windows position
i followed the exact same procedure for
the arrow 15x and it was a day and night
difference like honestly the e line
drivers that come out of the box are
absolutely horrible again this is where
you know hardware and software comes
into play if you have good hardware and
the turbo software it's just not gonna
work well but if you decide to update
that software and make it a little bit
more efficient say you know taking
advantage of those gesture controls
within Windows 10 it's just an awesome
experience
but do bleep be mindful though this is
completely at your own risk I tried it
on the air 15 X and it just works fine
so I'm just gonna you know leave that as
a disclaimer the keyboard also features
RGB lighting and can be controlled
through the fusion software there's a
lack of lighting cohesion with some keys
glowing much brighter than others and
the outwards glow is only visible at
certain angles upgradability on the
arrow 15 X is someone easier than the
Zephyrs but it still voids your warranty
plus you'll need a Torx screwdriver to
access the bottom but if you'd like to
add more storage to the unit there's a
spare m2 slot that supports nvme drives
as well taking a look at the i/o this
notebook offers a lot more than the
Zephyrus so on the right hand side we
had Kensington lock a pair of USB 3.1
gen2 a USB 3.1 gen2 type-c / Thunderbolt
3 port and a full sized SD card reader
Thank You gigabyte switching over to the
left there is a LAN jack USB 3.1 gen2 on
HTML to buy no a mini DisplayPort 1.2
connector with native g-sync support and
a combo headphones - mic output so
there's a lot of i/o on the arrow 15 X
that content creators and gamers can
take advantage of which is awesome now I
do want to spend some time and talk
about the displays on both the Zephyrs
and the Aero 15 X both are equipped with
15.6 inch 1080p IPS screens but from a
gaming standpoint the Zephyrus does have
a distinctive advantage with its 120
hearts and gsync display more
importantly that notebook won't have any
problem maintaining frame rates that
take full advantage of the hundred Hertz
refresh rate
gigabyte on the other hand seems to have
geared this display to appeal to
prosumers and gamers alike it comes
calibrated straight out of the box with
Pantone certification and a number of
presets revolving so users can you know
pick and choose the optimal color space
where lacks is in the refresh rate
Department and sixty Hertz it's
definitely not gonna give users a
smoother gameplay experience like the
zephyrus but stunning rich colors make
up for it color uniformity was very
consistent throughout both panels the
arrow 15x does have a slightly richer
color hues and a more robust color space
but when properly calibrated the Zephyrs
can display very similar outputs however
both panelists couldn't reach adequate
brightness output in relative violence
so you may have a tough time viewing the
displays outdoors given both screens or
IPs the color reproduction is fantastic
with good contrast ratio gigabytes
enhance color depth did look slightly
better than the Zephyrus but if you
prefer a display with the highest
refresh rate along with support for
g-sync asus is the way to go okay so I
think it's about time to move on to the
performance segment and compare both
these notebooks kicking things off with
synthetic benchmarks the results show
that the notebooks run neck-to-neck with
only a few variations here and there in
some cases certain slight changes in
hardware or the reaction of the CPU
memory GPU can contribute to the
variations nonetheless they aren't
significant in the least
the drive speeds are just insane on both
these notebooks but gigabyte takes a
lead here there Toshiba nvme SSD simply
blows the doors off Samsung's offering
within this Efes it isn't even close as
a matter of fact this happens to be one
of the fastest storage subsystems I've
ever seen in the notebook running the
GIMP benchmark that zephyrus shows a
very small lead which is likely due to
the fact that gigabytes notebook has a
ton of bloatware installed whereas a
SUSE device has a relatively but not
completely clean Windows install
handbrake and WinRAR involve some
storage subsystem intervention and as
expected the Aero 15 X and it's insanely
fast Toshiba SSD leap to the forefront
switching gears to some gaming
performance and this was pretty much a
foregone conclusion the GT X 1080 wins
by about as much as it would on the
desktop I do want to point out though
then the Aero 50 nexus benchmarks
certainly aren't anything to sneeze at
either the first one out gaming
benchmarks show that both systems are
able to throw out some impressive frame
rates despite being thin and light
notebooks we are talking about
substantially more than 60 frames per
second in every title even at their
highest detail setting the second set of
tests show much more of the same but in
even more impressive fashion since both
the Aero 15 X and Sepphoris easily post
playable framerates
in Warhammer 2 one of the Suites most
graphically intensive titles honestly if
you're playing at their native 1080p
resolutions either notebooks will be
perfectly suitable for gaming but what
happens if you choose to output to a
secondary monitor say 1440p well
maintaining playable frame rates at this
high resolution is certainly a challenge
but both competitors seem more than up
for it now with Warhammer 2 we'd see a
minor slip for the gtx 1070 and of the
GTX 980 max-q since it requires a
copyist amount of system resources to
run even at lower resolutions other than
that gigabyte and asus continue to
deliver great overall results
all right let's move on to battery life
and what you're seeing here isn't
anything wrong with the Zephyrus it
really is that bad however there's a lot
going on underneath those numbers since
the Zephyrs very capacity is nearly half
that of gigabytes and it doesn't
actually have optimus enabled supposedly
the extra trace routing and components
necessary for that feature needed to be
left off to save space in my opinion and
based on the battery life that was a bad
decision since that gtx 1080 is always
on gigabyte on the other hand has
delivered on the very essence of what
max q was designed to offer high
strength gaming performance and with
amazing battery life results of 5 and
over 6 hours in these two tests are
usually reserved for true ultrabooks
which don't come equipped with discreet
GPUs let alone one that would give most
desktop cards a run for their money the
hits continue here for gigabytes and
Socrative test doesn't really make use
of the GPU but once gaming is factored
in the era 50 Nexus larger capacity and
more efficient graphics card still allow
it to lead by a significant amount now
meliha to some temperatures we have to
remember that these are thin and light
notebooks with limited cooling
assemblies but they're also packin GPU
cores that are pulled from the desktop
arena that means that neither really
runs cool but it does look like gigabyte
manages to the thermal load just a
little bit better even though it doesn't
have aces his fancy push up air intake
assembly I also noticed the Zephyrs GTA
X 1080 ended up hitting lower clock
speeds more often than the gtx 1070 in
the air or 15 X this was likely due to
temperatures but it didn't really show
up in any of our gaming results since
the 1080 has more than enough graphics
horse power to overcome slightly lower
operating frequencies
okay so I think it's about time to wrap
up my thoughts on the ROG Sepphoris from
Isis and the arrow 15x from gigabyte now
both of these notebooks are fantastic
the zephyrus is just it just blazes
through gaming performance because it's
got the GTX 1080 in its Massacre design
and you've got 120 Hertz IPS juicing
display so overall you're gonna get a
much smoother gameplay gameplay
experience in that ultra slim chassis or
the problem of the ACEF res is the
battery life and just the way how asus
is just designed a notebook in general
the keyboard is in an odd placement
you're definitely it's ergonomically
just not gonna work out that well if you
decide to take it with you to school or
just work in general but I guess you
know it's some of the downsides that
you'll have to give when you decide to
pay that premium for gene Kings to an AV
inside that's not slim chassis now
switching gears for the gigabyte air 15
X and I think this has won me over in a
lot of ways for one the Isle is pretty
much loaded it's got an SD card reader I
can definitely take advantage of that
for events like Computex and CES but
most importantly that it's it's a fully
functioning laptop the keyboard is right
exactly where it needs to be the
trackpad is well out of the box it
doesn't come out that great after
updating to Windows position it was just
usable and it was great it was a day and
night difference the gaming performance
while I'm not significantly looking
forward to gaming on it that often I
think it should blaze really well
through video editing and I'm really
looking forward to using that throughout
my trips in the upcoming future but you
know what's even interesting is the
display on the gigabyte I just prefer
having bezel to screens it's just hard
to go back to a notebook with thicker
bezels like this zephyrus because you
know from an aesthetic standpoint I
would prefer the gigabyte arrow 15 x
over this is that first any time of the
day and the design is also a lot simpler
on the air 15 X compared to the Zephyrs
lastly the battery life the air a 15 X
destroys the Zephyrus it's just a lot
better than the ACS notebook so if
you're looking for a Mac secure notebook
with the best possible battery life
pick the gigabyte air 15 X it's just a
much better option compared to the
Zephyrus and obviously it's also a lot
more cheaper than the Zephyrs as well so
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the
gigabyte air or 15 X and the ROG
Zephyrus from Asus what do you guys
think about the design and the
performance that it brings to the table
but most importantly which one would you
and why now don't start commenting on
you can build gaming desktop PC but I
just wanted to put that out there
which of these two notebooks would you
pick or are they any alternatives that
you might want us to take a look at that
feature this new max cue architecture
