honest I haven't but now that I'm
spending way too much time staring at a
computer screen writing scripts editing
videos and doing my research um I
thought it was about time to maybe take
some time off and start reading dot tag
domains have recently crossed 100,000
registrations used by all types of
brands startups and YouTube influencers
and now you can get your own dog tag
domain at just 399 for the first year
with our discount code canucks on get
dog tag fortunately Kobo sent us out
their newly announced or r1 which due to
a price of two hundred and thirty
dollars can really be considered a
premium device when compared against
more basic offerings like the Kindle
paperwhite and Kobo zone touch 2.0 let's
step back for a moment and approach this
device from a person who likes to read a
lot perspective since spending that much
on a new reader may actually be
beneficial for them now before I move on
I need to put this device into the
proper context because many of you will
start comparing this directly to less
expensive alternatives from my
perspective the aura one is not meant
for anyone who's just slowly starting to
shift away from physical books because
it's just too expensive and it doesn't
fit well for beginners it's just like a
high-end car cobos flagship isn't meant
for first-time users but rather someone
was looking to upgrade their current
eReader that's why when creating it Kobo
consulted some of their longtime users
externally the aura one is a pretty
good-looking reader it sports a
seven-point eight inch card at eating
touchscreen display with a resolution of
1872 by 1404 or roughly 300 dpi
that's quite a high resolution in the
e-reader market but the one also happens
to be quite large as well think of it as
a size of a hardcover book rather than a
paperback size of something like the
Kindle paperwhite it doesn't come with a
glossy finish rather it's coated in a
reflection cutting matte finish which
also is less prone towards attracting
fingerprints the super slim body weighs
a little north of 200 grams but most
importantly I love the
with texture at the back they should
eliminate accidental slips plus it helps
with ergonomic s-- holding it in one
hand wasn't any trouble at all due to
its low weight it should be easy to
manipulate for just about anyone the
build quality is also very good and it
doesn't feel flimsy at all and it's not
made out of aluminum rather it's crafted
in a hard plastic material that feels
rigid I did drop it a few times and I
didn't notice any scratches or cracks
which is nice and that means it should
survive being packed into a suitcase or
a beach bag if you're afraid of damage
Kobo will happily sell you a fifty
dollar cover for it though one of the
main selling features of this reader is
its ipx8 certification which
theoretically means it's waterproof for
up to 60 minutes in two meters of water
and from my testing it survived the
number of seams is also kept to a
minimum so dust and other particles
won't make their way into the chassis
this could be a perfect reader for beach
vacation on top of that Kobo has
equipped the aura one with their Comfort
pro light technology which essentially
adjusts the color temperature of the
display according to the ambient
lighting I'll go over that in a moment
around back there is a blue power button
and once you've turned on the device
you're greeted with the home screen
that's fairly simple and easy to use you
can monitor your current progress on a
book and weirdly enough it also displays
how much more time there is left to
complete it based on your reading habits
there are different categories that you
can browse through and buy to along with
a review section which is helpful when
you're making the decision you can also
access quick settings at the top right
hand corner but what's really
interesting was that I was able to try
out a web browser under the beta
features it's a cool addition to the
device because you can check and respond
to emails or view online newspapers but
you can't watch videos which makes total
sense because the order one doesn't
support flash with this edition it does
feel like Kobo may be trying to slot
this device between other ear eaders and
low-cost tablets I haven't used an
e-reader with physical buttons to
navigate around the book but the
touchscreen on the ORA one is quick to
response flipping to the next page can
be done by sliding your finger to the
left and vice versa it takes a second to
load up the next page because you have
to consider it does take some time for
the pixels to shift on an e-ink display
Kobo has equipped this unit with a power
full and power efficient processor to
mitigate some of the lag these devices
typically exhibit but it can only do so
much
Kobo also partnered up with overdrive to
offer a borrowing strategy for local
libraries you do need to set up an
account and add your local library card
number but after that it's pretty
straightforward to borrow books it's
just like checking out a physical book
from your library and returning it
within a certain time just remember that
this service will vary by region the
unit comes with 8 gigabytes of internal
storage which according to Kobo can
store up to six thousand ebooks it
doesn't take too long for books to
download but I would have preferred a
network adapter that supports 5
gigahertz bands so oh now the process
from finding the right book to buying
was a non tedious process but you can
technically do the same thing on a
smartphone so why spend two hundred and
thirty dollars on an e-reader I spend
some time reading the same book both on
my Nexus 6p and the aura one and I can
wholeheartedly say it was a day and
night difference but that is to be
expected given the fact that Kobo is
tailor-made for reading books while the
smartphone is more of a device that can
do many things but does very few of them
well you see the 6p has a 5.7 inch
AMOLED display and while I appreciate
the deep blacks and the sharpness of the
screen feels like there's so much
information packed into a compact size
the aura feels like reading an actual
book the lack of a micro SD card slot
for expandable storage is not a
deal-breaker to me since you can
transfer documents via the included
micro USB cable and the six thousand
book capacity should be more than enough
for anyone speaking of that micro USB
cable it also happens to be the only way
to charge the e-reader but Kobo didn't
include a wall plug while it is nice to
have a standard charging interface and
Kobo claims that up to a month of
battery life I would have liked to see a
wall plug included with such an
expensive reader the aura one does
support a variety of secondary books
formats including PDF RTF cbz and CBR
some of which even the $400 Kindle Oasis
doesn't support the inclusion of native
support for CBC and CBR formats could be
a game changer for comic readers -
speaking of comics the high resolution
display is perfect
for that as you can see the texts are
clear to read but the eating display
could be limiting for images Cobos
comfort like pro technology comes into
play here in a big way - and it really
helps make the reading experience more
pleasant
since the aura utilizes a Carta eating
display the pixels are extremely energy
efficient which in turn prolongs battery
life on top of that the sensors in the
device adapts to the ambient lighting of
your environment and automatically
reduces the blue light exposure which
helps reading before bed a much more
pleasant experience this is a game
changer for ear eaters because exposing
yourself to blue light right before
bedtime has been proven to cause some
health problems to be precise blue light
reduces our body's melatonin a lot
quicker than other wavelengths which in
turn affects sleeping habits which can
ultimately impose health issues this
despite technology ensures the aura one
is never too bright or too dark to read
to my eyes they're just a perfect
exposure and it's so comforting after
switching back to my phone I had a hard
time adjusting my eyes to the compact
colored and overly bright display plus
I'll be honest the extra real estate and
the high-definition display on the
e-reader made reading a book feel more
natural some mention needs to be made of
the eco system - if you purchased ebooks
on Amazon
sadly they cannot be accessed on the
Kobo reader and vice versa unless if you
find a custom ROM but be aware that's
against copyright rules it's also hard
to make the switch from one platform to
another because you've already invested
money into these books pricing through
both Amazon and Kobo's own online store
is similar for the most part I caught a
few books priced cheaper on the Kobo
store at least here in Canada but once
again it's a few bucks here and there
and that's not a big deal I did download
a few free to read titles but compared
to the Kindle Store and Amazon the
collections are much more limited which
is disappointing but I hope Kobo expands
on that in the future and so my
concluding thoughts on the Kobo ro1 is
that for the premium price you are
paying premium features like ipx8
waterproofing a solid build great screen
and low weight the Comfort light pro
technology works just as it should and
it works great
I'll guarantee you you have a fantastic
experience reading at night the white
support for different file formats is
always a welcome feature to especially
if you love reading comics is the Kobo
ro1 right for newcomers to the online
book market I don't think so since it's
quite an expensive investment for
first-time users imagine you can buy
about 25 regular softcover books for the
price of a single or a one but if you
are someone looking to upgrade their old
Kobo e-reader and want to remain in the
same ecosystem this thing may be a great
fit if you like reading and you're
looking for an e-reader would you
consider the Kobo or a one or would you
still continue reading from your phone's
keyboard warriors start the race and I'm
looking forward to your responses I'm
eager with hurricane axe thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
