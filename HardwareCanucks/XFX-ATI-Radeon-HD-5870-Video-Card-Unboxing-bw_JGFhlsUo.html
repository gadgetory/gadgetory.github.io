canucks unboxing sort of preview video
what we have in front of us is the XFX
Radeon HD 5870 now this card is the talk
of the town right now we've actually
done a full review which you can see
over at triple WR Canucks Calm it has
all of the benchmarks as well as an
in-depth look at the new card so I'm
really excited for this let's get
unboxing so let's take a look at the box
we have the usual funky XFX style styled
in ATI red on the right side we have a
quick description of some of the ATI
technologies that are included on the
card and then then on the back we have
sort of the marketing material and a
general description of what is included
with the card as well as their five-star
support description on the right side
there is the key features of the cards
such as the one gig of ddr2 memory api's
new infinity technology with support up
for up to three displays and if you've
ever seen a demo of that you'll know
that this is some pretty radical stuff
ATI stream technology offloading CPU
tasks on to the GPU they still have an
improved folding mind you but we have
DirectX 11 GL crossfire a vivo dynamic
power management now this is kind of
cool down here what they have included
is along with HDMI and the dual DVI we
have DisplayPort which was a port when
picked up by AMD they've adapted it in
order to be able to use the eyefinity so
you can have three monitors attached to
a single display using DisplayPort and
the PCI Express 2.0 support on the far
side of the box we have these system
requirements for the card and what that
is is obviously need a PCI Express slot
and a 500 watt or greater power supply
and if you take a look at our review on
the unit you'll see that that's probably
not a bad recommendation and you'll need
a dual 6 pin PCI Express power
connectors crossfire you'll need for it
also a quick description of what is in
the box which we're gonna take a look at
so let's open it up now as we open up
the unit I'm just gonna Yammer on a bit
about XFX is warranty they are one of
the better warranties for ATI what they
offer is off the bat a lifetime
guarantee for the card for
original owner on top of that they also
offer a transferable warranty which is
great if you're going to be selling the
card after you're done that warranty
transfers off to the buyer also they
have a modder friendly warranty which if
you're gonna be adding like a water
block or a heatsink and fan or whatever
they will still be able to cover the
card in the event of a manufacturing
that's the key manufacturing defect so
let us open it up and see what we have
we have a box inside a box obviously at
the top we have a quick install guide
which is the this is the physical
depiction of how to install it we have
an installation guide which basically
teaches you how to install the drivers
if you're not familiar with how to hit
the next button
we also have a CD here which I assume is
going to be drivers and maybe some sort
of overclocking utility we have the door
hanger which you'll find in a lot of XFX
cards now what's cool about this is
they've included both the part number
and your individual cards serial number
along with a username and password thing
so anything that you're going to need in
order to arm a it if you have to
you also have dirt two which is one of
the premiere titles for DirectX 11 so
most every version of the 5870 is going
to include that be it XFX or another
company I'm not going to show you the
product key because I want to play it
and then in here and no not quite yet
let us take a look at we have a molex we
have a molex to the PCI power connectors
we actually have we have two of them
there's VGA into into DVI and there is
the crossfire connector alright and now
it is time for the highlight of the show
XFX Radeon HD 5870 video card and while
this thing is huge
right off the bat oh you see it has the
front has the same style as the box
which is a really nice design and boy is
it a big card let's just move this out
of the way quickly pull over we have a
9800 GX 2 which previously is one of the
largest cards on the market will match
it up with a 58 70 here and as you can
see well the 9800 is trumped
5870 is by all means the largest card
that you're gonna be able to find so I
hope that if you're getting it you have
a large case you're gonna need space for
a ten and a half inch video card so just
looking at the card here we have a
plastic sort of PCB there on the back we
have a little bit of venting on the side
here as it goes in like so you have the
PCI Express the power slots as well as a
little bit of venting here you have the
crossfire connectors here on the back
you actually will have a cover over the
PCB this is hopefully to eliminate some
ESD if you're going to be touching a
card like I am also we have on the front
we have our two DVI connectors HDMI and
there is that DisplayPort we're talking
about and then at the bottom just a
little bit of venting you'll be
interesting to see how that affects the
temperatures with that little amount of
room other than that that's about all
there is to the card it's really big
it's going to be a big weight in your
system but it looks pretty cool so let's
take a look at the benchmarks and we'll
be back
all right so there we are the XFX Radeon
HD 5870 I must say what a great card
it's looking like it's going to take the
crown as the single best GPU solution on
the market and with a price tag of 399
dollars it falls right in line with the
competition now ETI is also producing a
cheaper version of the card which
features sort of the same the same
advancements in technology for about
$299 and that is the HD 5850 now both of
which are going to be really hard to
find on the market right after release
so if you wait a week or two hopefully
more gonna start to filter into the
retail channels other than that that is
it for this unboxing video and have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
