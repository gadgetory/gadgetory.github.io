you by fantex nvidia corsair and CI x
silverstone and in win make sure to
support them for helping us bring this
great content to you
during Computex when we stopped by the
Intel benchmarking suite they showed us
this the new Asus zenfone 2 it's got a
quad-core Intel Atom inside but they
wanted to show off this slightly
modified version the world's first 65
core smartphone
they've crudely figured out how to
install the 61 Korg Xeon chip on the
back of the device that consumes zero
power so it's incredibly efficient and
you get a medal for the bragging rights
of having 65 cores in one hand so the
message that Intel is trying to send is
clear you've got four cores on the
zenfone 2 for performance and 61 cores
for marketing
we all had a laugh obviously now that
Intel atoms are finding their way into
consumer devices and start to compete to
a Qualcomm chips they wanted to
emphasize that 99% of apps and the Play
Store do not utilize the fourth core 95
percent of the time and the specific
benchmarking apps do not actually
reflect on real-world usage now what I
took away from this is obviously Intel
has its own agenda to acquire a larger
market share but even still remember
that it's not all about the course
especially since the apps are not even
designed to fully take advantage of all
of them and another message they wanted
us to take away is reminding builders
and PC users that system balance is
crucial while having a fast GPU matters
a ton for gaming other pieces of the
puzzle should not be ignored
and obviously Intel should not worry in
the sphere of CPUs but they have been in
the storage game for some time and
reminding users that having a fascist SD
will improve gaming performance and they
demonstrated that with loading
Assassin's Creed unity where that insane
750 series SSD was loading all the
textures all the crowds all the building
assets with over 40 gigabytes in total
without anything popping off screen and
having to 1.2 terabytes
as as these for gaming of the 750 series
is absolutely overkill but they wanted
to make the statement that system
balance is important and it's clear that
Intel is prepping the crowd to realize
that
count is less important and with launch
of 10 new 5th gen CPUs at complex they
are proud of their quad core eight
threaded chips and the performance that
they deliver</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
