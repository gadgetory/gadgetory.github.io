in the past and you have to appreciate
this drive towards improvement the
switch 8:10 for example had introduced
some new standards for the Chasse C's
market and we are very excited to check
out their new flagship case the Phantom
820 this full tower holds a lot of
features that is reflected in the
relatively steep to $150 price tag so
there's lots to cover let's dive right
in so the exterior is one to impress
with its armoring characteristics
there's plenty of plastic incorporated
into the construction but it is of high
quality
you also have three choices of color all
of which are the same price the gunmetal
gray the matte black and a glossy white
so let's start off with the front panel
here we have a swivel door that opens
just past 90 degrees and from what we
have seen in the past this is not the
best design as it might get broken and
behind the panel here we have for
optical Bay covers that can easily be
removed from the front and also the
controls to fully adjust the lighting
system for the p8 20 now this is
something new and we haven't seen
anything like that that comes standard
within the chassis so let's go over the
lighting system well you have different
lighting modes you have the rear LED on
the back to allow visibility in the dark
for the i/o shield you have the color
wheel so you can customize the exterior
and interior lighting based on your
hardware configuration and really just
your color preference and an included SD
card reader is also a bonus and this
level of lighting customization is very
welcoming so you don't have to fiddle
around with all the wiring as it's all
already set up the LEDs are located
above the windows so it illuminates the
interior in a very appealing way and the
top also has some lighting which is just
extra icing on the cake and it is all
wired through this LED hub now
unfortunately some of the connections
were faulty and some LEDs didn't light
up I was expecting all the wiring to be
top-notch for that price and hope NZXT
makes appropriate measures with regards
to quality control and all the
connections are at the top and being
this is a full Tower it is quite tall so
you might run into trouble placing this
under the
desk while maintaining clearance for
those USB ports and in total we have six
USB ports included two of which are USB
three on the other side we have the
power and reset buttons buttons for the
integrated fan controller for adjusting
the speed and switching between the fans
in the system and of course your audio
jacks the fan controller supports up to
15 watts per channel and the fan LED
corresponds to the speed of that fan
which is very nice and you have the
option to completely shut off the fan
and moving on the front panel can be
removed to reveal and include it to 100
millimeter intake fan with the removable
dust filter on the panel and a dual dust
filter for the bottom next up is a side
panel this gives a hint of what's inside
with this acrylic window with the
included mesh to allow for an additional
200 millimeter intake fan and taking a
look at the back we have an adjustable
mounting system for the exhaust fan in
case you're doing any water cooling this
would allow you to have enough clearance
then the i/o panel nine PCI expansion
slots water cooling holes and then
bottom mounted power supply with a dust
filter and the top panel can be removed
to reveal a third 200 millimeter fan
with the same sized filter on both slots
and the top also supports triple 120
mils or a dual 140 millimeter fan and
finally it's really what's on the inside
that matters when it comes to enthusiast
configurations so this scene looks very
familiar that's because they've kept an
almost identical layout as on the switch
and ten that's because it was successful
in pretty much all the aspects here we
have four tula secure brackets for your
optical drives very clever design for
the hard drive cage and an abundance of
rubber grommets that can accommodate for
extra-large and extended ATX
motherboards looking in the back a very
large CPU cutout is available we have
plenty of Kabletown notches for clean
wiring and an inch of room to work with
in the back so no problems in cable
management department and it's always
nice when the full Tower comes with its
own 8 pin extension and it's especially
nice when it's braided alright so let's
check out the drive system they're all
facing the back meaning you only have
three
of one side panel when trying to switch
the drives and n61 back to the drawing
board and redesigned their drive trace
unfortunately there's nothing special
about these except that SSDs now are in
the center and they appear to be a lot
more flimsy and weak for example one of
the brackets snapped as I was putting in
the 3.5 inch drive so just make sure to
be careful with these the drive cage
itself is divided into two sections the
top housing four drives and the bottom
only two it's nice to see they've kept
the same angled fan bracket to direct
the air flow towards two main components
which supports both 120 and 140 million
fans so the bottom portion of the cage
can be completely removed to allow a
dual radio or fans to be installed and
as this is mainly targeted towards
enthusiasts let's see how well it stacks
up with water cooling and hardware so
installing a dual radio at the bottom
there's still plenty of room above and
below the radiator to pull on air and
power supply is up to 200 millimeters
will still have clearance graphics cards
up to 13 inches are supported even with
the additional fan installed so you get
the scale of this massive interior and
what are cooling support to the top is
really well thought through first the
triple rater is supported with the
ability to do a push and pull
configuration and you can move down the
rear exhaust in case it's on the way now
native triple support for full towers is
declining and it's refreshing to see a
full tower that can finally handle two
sets of fans a thick Raider in between
while all being housed inside the
chassis and if you wish to mount the
triple rat at the top you can take the
top off completely by removing some
screws mounting the rad onto the panel
and placing it back now this would
appear to be the easiest method also
NZXT has made some holes in the top
optical panel so the fan closest to the
front can still draw air from below and
as we start the assembly we notice that
the all screws and zip ties are held in
this plastic toolbox it's not your
conventional cardboard box so they're
really trying to add as much as possible
to make this worth your money
and fitting in our standard ATX
motherboard it looks miniscule in this
massive enclosure so getting everything
set up as I'd expected was absolutely
hassle-free you might run out of
hardware before you run out of space to
fill inside the 820 and with lots of
room to work with at the back cable
management becomes almost enjoyable to
do so the new phantom 820 is one
impressive case from NZ XD that brings a
lot to the table with an awesome
customizable color system water cooling
capabilities they take advantage and
fully utilize its large stature plus an
integrated fan controller that always is
a bonus and obviously future proof in
the hardware department but I can't help
but notice a huge resemblance between
this and the switch 810 now they have
obviously improved on construction
quality slightly modify the hard drive
gauge and added more icing to the
already sweet cake with their lighting
system and fan control and that's all
for an additional $80 when compared with
the price of the switch 810 and also the
new and redesigned hard drive trays are
weakened flimsy and the circuit board
for the LEDs had some faulty connections
which didn't light up all the LEDs so in
terms of a practical and the fully
loaded full tower the Phantom 820
definitely fits that category but at
$150 there surely competing with their
own switch 810 as it's an almost
identical case but from an overall
market perspective I would say NZXT
holds major grounds when it comes to
market competition for full towers and
desserts the hardware conducts damn good
a word and that concludes our review for
the phantom 820 from NZXT thanks guys
for watching they will see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
