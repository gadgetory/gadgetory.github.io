great technology selection and service
pleasure to finally get the chance to
meet you Sean now I'm up until now known
as fast movement confirmed for ps4 yeah
is there a news you have for me yeah we
were actually going to release a degree
but we recently found will announce
release takes their wondering that's at
least eight it will be for here or and
possession is important that would be an
addition of this game is massive happy
to see us I mean the trigger was amazing
that's really cool in itself
festival like sort of florals what's
happened to them la so find that very
funny I don't play testing something
that's solely based on procedural
generation and when you feel like normal
union by testing and we talked about
this a little bit before that we
actually have effectively false we run a
server and they they are bugs they don't
visit planets I'm actually employed a
little animated gifs make you crap brain
right they said not so we we send out a
little may I chrome spiders they come
back from the cosmos telling us how
crazy I things going again
any when treated without earlier she
talked about Jennifer game the biggest
concern was he been soaked under control
howdy I mean he didn't we didn't get it
I mean just went with something this
massive walk me through what the process
is of how to decide what goes in the
game what doesn't go in the game what
you're trying to hit because when I look
at no man see it seems almost like an
everything here yes somebody said that
to me it sounds like a game designed by
a child basically yeah I don't know how
to take that I guess yeah probably
that's true and but i think you know we
grew up playing games like a week that
you know and and i guess this was the
game for me at least that I imagine you
know and actually they were all going
through a lot
Commodore 64 days and you seemed a
little freer open and kind of you know
almost white like I remember you would
get your keyboard you would have no idea
what a little button right exactly and I
said don't worry three sides like this
so much since then I mean I think there
has been weight of them to make great
especially in early access and fix it
are more open more boxes and that's
definitely where we found places I'm
sure it's going back on top of it once
more than you thought could really pull
this off I'm not sure that's a right now
I like I think we grow more and more in
confidence I thinking what we're doing
but this freeze from when we've been
showing people
going on hands-on press conference just
swaying driving and showing people howdy
it's a weird feeling working again so
many people say
english for you though it is you play it
every day look like that 30 cause it's
80 s it is ambitious in some ways but in
other ways it's not a piece you know you
can see perfectly too goodbye small
teams we're using the computer to
generate everything rather than trying
to get everything myself well I'm you
serious really a feat of procedural
generation before I loved about your
heart cycle continues elements that
closely or final guessing and gentlemen
