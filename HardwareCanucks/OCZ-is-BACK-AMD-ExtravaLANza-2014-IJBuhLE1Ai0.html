we're here the AMD extravaganza to
showcase some of our products what some
people might not know about our company
is we were recently acquired by Toshiba
a lot of people are asking where's LCC
now so here we are we're showing in
similar products we actually did a
rebrand if you look at our new logo
these four lines they represent the four
pillars of a successful solid state
drive company we had the firmware we had
the software we had the controller the
one missing piece that we were missing
was the nand flash and with a toshiba
acquisition in February of this year we
now have direct access to that and what
that means for for our customers is that
all of our drives are designed in house
and we can push out drives we can push
out better quality drives one of our
products here is the vector 150 it has
industry-leading performance
industry-leading endurance the one thing
that we like to harbor bout with our
solid state drives is we have
best-in-class sustained performance so
now what that means is as soon as you
take a drive out and you put it into
your machine your performance is going
to degrade with art with our occ drive
with our vector drives we are controller
is using a barefoot three inner links
barefoot 3 controller and with that
controller is able to design able to
handle both types of data incompressible
and compressible and because of that
that controller we're able to have the
best in class sustained performance this
is our vertex 460 drive this is our
middle line product this one has a three
year warranty versus the vectors five
year warranty pretty much the same
performance is also using in delivering
sparefoot 3 controller is using a little
bit different firmware but in terms of
performance it's relatively the same
it's scott lot 3 year warranty and it
has a little lower endurance rating 20
gigabytes a day of host rights versus
our vector 150 which has a 50 gigabytes
day 50 gigabytes per day host rights and
a lot of our drives in the past they
were cutting edge and we're still going
to be around for quite some time now
that we have the backing from Toshiba
everything is like I said designed
in-house and we have
tight control of design over everything
