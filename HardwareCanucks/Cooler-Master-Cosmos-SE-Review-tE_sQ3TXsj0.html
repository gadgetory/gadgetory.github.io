back to another Hard Knocks review the
cosmos series from colormaster is one
very distinct and popular lineup because
of the design functions and those
aluminum case feet and handles that make
transporting the case very convenient
the cosmos s II is the smallest chassis
in the series while still considered a
food power I say it's more of an large
mid tower than the full Tower as the
internals are quite compact and it's the
exterior shell and the handles that add
to the size the cosmos S II is released
at $170 which in this market is quite
competitive but in reality like with all
the enclosures if you really dig the
style of the cosmos price may not be the
breaking factor in your decision the
chassis is made of combination of
plastic steel and aluminum and the SE
feels robust and sturdy and the front
panel is mostly meshed with three
optical drive slots the dust filter is
easily removable which lets you access
to included 120mm fans but also the to
draft caddies at the bottom the drive
caddies are very sturdy and instead of
flexing they widen to mount the
mechanical drive plus an additional SSD
support at the bottom which is an
excellent spot for extra dry storage and
both our two lists unfortunately the
drive cage is not hot swappable which in
this case would have fit perfectly for
easy swap especially with such
convenient front access another thing I
don't particularly like is the design of
the front intake now for one the bottom
optical cover blocks almost half of the
top fan and the cover is not filtered so
you're definitely losing airflow and
second there's just so much resistance
on the internal drive gauge that the
front intake will not appropriately
penetrate through to get to the rest of
the internals all the connections are
located at the top with four USB ports
audio jacks power and reset button and
an LED switch for the front fans now
we've got the windowed version here
which looks really sleek and fits in
with your well design the chassis and
the right side panel also has a
similarly shaped out and that will
provide extra clearance for all the
firing at the back usual scenery here
with an exhaust fan seven PCI slots and
a power supply bracket there are two
dust filters included at the bottom one
for your power supply and the other the
front which is quite pointless given
there are no bottom pain mounts also
important to mention the rubber pads on
the aluminum case feed to prevent
sliding and scratching the floor the top
panel is easily removable we just want
thumb screw which also has a built-in
dust filter here you can see the handles
are securely mounted onto the frame so
really no worries of carrying a loaded
build here you can also mount fans above
the frame which would be perfect for
pushing pool 240 or 280 millimeter ad
ators with strips instead of just holes
for flexible mounting so let's get
inside the cosmos se and take a look at
what type of functionality it offers for
a full Tower first thing to notice is
the built in drive gauge frame that has
a few tricks help it sleeve like the
flexible orientation on the drives and
taking off the front panel completely
and removing all the drive caddies so
plus a few screws the drive cage walls
are removable I would say this is not
the best system as you can see they're
quite thick and regardless of the
cutouts they will still be heavily
restrictive for the front airflow
removing all the cage walls and you get
clearance for front radiator and cool
master includes brackets that allow
installation of two forty to eighty and
three sixty millimeter radiators for the
case the brackets coincide with mounting
holes on the frame but unfortunately
mounting a 240 mm rod at the very top
position doesn't let you fully secure
the brackets because there are no
proprietary key to the middle which has
appropriate mounting holes
however removing the bottom cage lets
you securely mount it 240 or 280 million
rad but this means sacrificing all the
drive storage as cage walls don't fit
with radiator installed the bottom drive
cage can be mounted slightly further
back to allow the radiator to fit plus
some fans but this means getting rid of
the access to your drives as there's no
way to remove the drive caddies without
first removing the radiator so indeed
very end
you need the walls however our modular
so you can install one pair facing
inside and the other facing the back
while being able to mount drives without
issues you can also mount two optional
fans on the cage walls for improved
intake but this means having a clearance
of 10 inches for a graphics card which
is very limiting for a full tower and
turn it in case around it's good to see
you Toulouse ation of space for extra 2
SSDs with very simple mount and not too
much to say about the rear but the
cosmos s II is equipped with plenty of
cable tie mounts and rubber grommets and
cutouts underneath motherboard that will
sure be useful there's just under an
inch of room to work with and you can
easily tuck your cables so really no
issues with cable management and
starting with the assembly mounting the
power supply from the rear is very
convenient but it was a slight tight fit
and we've got only two minor parts
standoffs pre-installed hello lazier
from Kula master I think but we do get
the insert for fast installation of
those standoffs and putting our standard
ATX motherboard in and the case already
feels quite full it certainly doesn't
feel like working with a full power we
do get about 6 centimetres until we hit
the memory from the top and while not
bad it is going to be a very compact
system if you decide to water cool and
starting with cable management the build
cleans up very well to no surprise and
to fit our GTX 590 I had to remove one
the cage walls which brings back my
point that the whole drive system is
inefficient and still very restrictive
even if no drives are installed the
rubber grommets around the motherboard
were halfway blocked which made passing
the giant 24 pin cable a little
difficult but not impossible which again
shows this fits more of a mid tower
range rather than full Tower the cutouts
underneath the motherboard overcame it
very useful to route front panel audio
and USB and mounting the bottom drive
you kind of get an idea of how much
space there is until our power supply
unit and the hot swappable system here
would have fit that much better flipping
in case around all the cables are well
secured and really nothing negative to
say as the assembly went completely
smooth and to conclude with our pros and
cons list I think the cosmos line
certainly one of the best-looking cases
with aluminum handles that allow
portability easily removable dust
filters innovative drive caddies and
okay water cooling capabilities that
don't necessarily come without
compromise so you do lose out on all of
the front drive storage if you wish to
mount a 360 millimeter right at the
front plus an incredibly restrictive
front airflow with all the cage walls
and that one optical cover at the top
that covers pretty much half the fan and
all for one hundred seventy dollars is
still a little too much even for hours
like switch 810 or the Phantom 530 offer
a lot more flexibility for water cooling
without that many compromises honestly
the cosmos S II does not impress as it
really doesn't bring any new
functionality or features aside from the
clever drive caddies but other than that
it's just a mini full tower that relies
more than its looks
other than user friendly functions to
get recognized and if you really been
craving that cosmos look and wanting
something more compact it fits in very
well the problem I see here with
Coolermaster is they're not ambitious to
release something completely new and
even if it would have been released a
year ago the cosmos S II wouldn't really
have stood out but let me know what you
guys think of this new addition to the
cosmos series in the comments below we'd
love to hear what you think and as
always thanks for watching and we'll see
you in the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
