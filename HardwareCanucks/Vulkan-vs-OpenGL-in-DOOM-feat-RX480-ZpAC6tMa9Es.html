hurricane axe welcome to another video
two things before we move on I finally
received my rx 480 from AMD the 8
gigabyte version no need to peel the
sticker if you know what I mean and the
promised Vulkan API rollout for Doom is
finally here
utilizing a synchronous compute shaders
which amy has been long promising to
deliver high performance gains thanks to
a synchronous compute gaps between
rendering tasks li part of the GPU
idling which in turn reduce GPU
efficiency asynchronous shaders provide
a full solution as they operate like a
highway eliminating traffic lights and
scheduling issues and enabling tasks for
multiple sources to be submitted to the
GPU and process simultaneously and
Vulcan is that spiritual successor to
aim dismantle so let's jump into the
game and see how it plays out the Kraken
x61 liquid cooler by NZXT features a
variable pump speed to high static
pressure 140 Miller fans and beautiful
user control through the camp software
click below to get crackin and so the
first thing to show here are all my
settings which are maxed out enabling
nightmare wherever possible I've learned
my lesson and in order to utilize
asynchronous shaders our anti-aliasing
must be set to TSS AAA or no a at all
then under the API settings we enable
Vulcan or opengl 4.5 and here's the
first scene this is a 1080p and right
away we notice a 30 frame difference and
almost 30 frame difference between
OpenGL and Vulcan while bumping that
resolution to 1440p the difference is
just under 20 frames the second scene is
at 1080p as well difference here is 10
frames per second and that Delta drops
to about 8 frames per second at 1440p
scene number 3 is on and we again notice
a substantial difference between Vulcan
and OpenGL in high 20s and 1440p results
carry over with a high 15 frame
difference and in my last scene here we
see similar results with around 25%
boost in Vulcan at 1080p while around 15
percent boost at
in for TP and to put volc√°n performance
in perspective for the RX for 80 some
gameplay averages were crunched up by
sky and Montreal to give us this graph
at 1080p which shows a nice boost for
averages that is consistent with the
minimums as well and the same goes for
1440p results with a slightly lower bump
in fps percentage-wise
but still it's pretty awesome to receive
such a boost with a simple API change in
the settings and it looks like Vulcan is
on a verge to boost aim DS presence in
the gaming market especially with DX 12
coming out and asynchronous compute to
show massive gains for AMD and their
architecture and we're also receiving
reports of their older cards like the r9
290 receiving a significant boost in
performance with Vulcan in Doom and
that's pretty awesome and for those who
own doom make sure to enable Vulcan to
see what type of performance gains or
losses you gain and let us know in the
comments down below I'm Dimitri with
Huracan ox make sure to name a Vulcan
for AMD hardware and we'll see you in
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
