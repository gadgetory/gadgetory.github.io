knocks and welcome back to another of
you
the Raymond line from silverstone
carries something very special with me
as this was the very first case i've
reviewed for her onyx some two years ago
of course since i have learned to make
sure my white balance is alright but i
am happy to see a new addition to the
raven series with this our vo4 released
at $160
design-wise this feels like a raven with
the rotated mawa tray of course a window
to showcase the internals and a similar
angular characteristics on the exterior
plastics one of the unusual traits of
the RV f4 is the front door and right
away I could see this being a deciding
factor to look elsewhere now for one it
just feels flimsy it doesn't have any
rigidity and experiences a lot of flex
and the most annoying part is it doesn't
fully close it's not magnetic but
instead held in by clips that with a
whiff of hair would just fly open the
somewhat large gap between the door and
the top frame does disturb the uniform
look also the internal frame itself is
quite compact and the added length of
the front element makes the RV
unnecessary long behind the front panel
is a room of fine dust filter with dual
180 Miller intake fans that can actually
cool the RV or for very well with just
those two fans plus you can regulate the
speed of each fan with low to high
settings and there are two optical slots
above USB 3 in the audio ports are
located on the side it's the same side
as the window so it really shouldn't be
a problem for placement now the whole
idea of this plastic front element is to
provide the aesthetic Raymond look
without compromising on front airflow
the large gap allows those air
penetrators to intake air without
resistance but close to two inches of
clearance I like the concept but very
disappointed at the flimsy and poor
construction of the front panel the
power and reset buttons are located at
the top both can be accessed with the
panel closed and open the top panel
design is mixed in with that of a wing I
actually do like it and the limited
ventilation is there for your power
supply this is supposed to be installed
with a fan facing up and good news we
have a removable dust filter and take a
look at the back as I mentioned the
power supply is installed at the top
followed by eight PCI slots and exhaust
fan at the bottom with fan not included
and also this type of layout will
prevent any unwanted water coolers with
a 240 million radiators so the RV of
four is pretty much airflow exclusive
taking off both panels the first thing
you notice is the rotated motherboard
tray with your CPU cooler at the bottom
and you'll see the extra features so
there still includes to call
and this layout now storage wise
everything is right there in the main
compartment with 3.5 inch drive gauge on
the left that has a bit of padding on
the inside to prevent audible vibrations
also this isn't exactly to us as the
cage is mounted with screws and so are
the drives inside the drive cage this
isn't really hassle but we've gotten
accustomed to drive brackets and tools
assembly the two platforms at the bottom
can also house additional mechanical
drives these are two lists and once
inserted there is a very clever strap
that allows you to remove the drives
without any hassle just pull on the
strap and the drives will pop out
there's also a little hook where you can
put the straps once the drives are in
place so very innovative from
Silverstone I have to give them that all
the SATA connections are properly
accounted for at the rear with enough
spacing for your cables you can still
install the drives facing the front
panel but you are limited to 90 degrees
SATA cables because of that clearance
now the platform underneath the CPU
cooler has an implemented support
structure with this adjustable raising
mechanism that can be lowered or raised
depending on the width of your Tower
plus it's on a rail system that can be
adjusted for the length of your heatsink
or you can completely remove it if you
don't need it but I would say this would
certainly be useful during transport or
just provide additional support for
massive CPU coolers like the Noctua NHD
14 now both the platform's can be
removed from the bottom for installation
of solid-state drives now I'm glad we
have at least SSD support but this is
going against user friendly assembly as
stupid 5 inch drives are secured in from
the bottom which is alright but once you
place packed platforms wiring becomes a
bit of a challenge but in case you need
to replace any of this as these you have
to go through the entire process again
and for 2013 chassis this just isn't
right I do however love the fact that
our via 4 is cooled by just 2 fans so
the chassis is for cooling potential is
utilized straight out of the box the
shroud for the top fan is a bit
restrictive and so much plastic isn't
really needed luckily it is removable
and
I recommend in doing so flipping the
case around we find a lot of cat outs
unfortunately not grommeted again
something for a chassis of this caliber
in this price I find this a bit
confusing there isn't much room to work
with but enough or solid cable
management and to simplify your assembly
process here comes off the motherboard
tray it's actually very useful and not
easier to install big CPU heat sinks off
the case and here I begin with the
assembly mounting on the motherboard and
power supply at the top making sure the
fan is facing up of course otherwise
simply mangling in with your hard
graphics card the large cutout at the
top also helps to guide all the cables
where they need to go and check this out
the build looks very clean despite those
drives sticking out but this orientation
is necessary for proper airflow delivery
from those front intake fans also notice
how far the three-and-a-half inch drives
are sticking out and this will mean you
will have to deal with those SATA cables
or use some type of low profile cables
as otherwise they may interfere with
your fans on your heatsink now many of
you will be happy to hear no more saggy
graphics card with this GPU support
bracket you attach it with a thumb screw
in the top and it covers all eight PCI
slots which is awesome to see you then
attach this additional piece with
another thumb screw and your graphics
card is Sag free this is an awesome
feature especially for multi-gpu setups
I only wish this wasn't as bland of a
piece of plastic but instead
incorporated some type of raven design
GPUs up to 13 inches are supported this
is with the fan shroud in place and
after everything's connected the rear
looks alright and it sure can handle a
lot more and with the panel closed the
RV or four doesn't exactly scream
elegant internals the window could be
atop smaller to hide the bottom
platforms and those drives that are
sticking out now I do appreciate the
compact nature of the internals and
utilization of the space with support
for six mechanical and four solid-state
drives remove the motherboard tray to
help with assembly and its own power
supply chamber to help with clean cable
management
the two support brackets for CPU and GPU
are handy
and designed for excellent airflow
out-of-the-box is something the Raven
series is really known for however I
wasn't expecting that many drawbacks on
the chassis that I was so looking
forward to from two years ago starting
with the front panel that is flimsy and
honestly surprised to see something like
this from Silverstone it just makes the
chassis bigger than it has to be next
are the incredibly inconvenient SSD
mounts and they're sticking out 3.5 inch
drives that are the opposite of
user-friendly the chassis also doesn't
take it to account all in one water
cooling systems with that to 14-under
radiators that are becoming so extremely
popular and I feel like having a power
supply chamber moved to the bottom
instead with conventional motherboard
orientation with a lot more flexibility
with cooling now the or via for
unfortunately comes with too many
limitations for the price so if in two
years we are to see in our view five
I just won't keep my expectations that's
high so thanks guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
