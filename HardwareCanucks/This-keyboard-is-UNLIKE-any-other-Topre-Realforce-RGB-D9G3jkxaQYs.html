problem but should one let sound like
this Alison who throws up guys come to
meet you at Harbour Canucks and on the
review table is the king of keyboards
the real force RGB from top row there's
so many things to like about this
keyboard but first of all it Wow
expensive it closed with $300 but you
know what
keyboard enthusiasts will understand and
so forth
anybody who is perhaps thinking of going
into their first mechanical keyboard
this my friends is not it unless you
want to go to the highest end of the end
forever let's talk about this keyboard
more in depth right after message
mother-father the z9 Neal buy Zalman
brings all the right features on a
budget with a large window side panel
five included fans and the excellent
interior layout with super simple cable
management get it now link in the
description below but the real force RGB
it has so many unique elements I know
just the RGB lighting but the whole body
is built like a tank and I mean that in
comparison to my k70 from Corsair which
has the aluminum body and it feels solid
this just feels like it's a hammer I
could build a house with it you know but
the cool thing about the whole keyboard
is the variability in the actuation
distance so the switches here are toe
pro capacitive switches and being able
to change the actuation distance from
three millimeters to two point two
millimeters to 1.5 millimeters per key
is so awesome so for example the top pro
can be three millimeters the typing zone
can be 1.5 millimeters if you want that
quick actuation and that's actually a
very unique element that's present on
the top row capacity switches that are
linear and require 45 grams of force to
actuate but it's like having three types
of switches built into one I for example
love the MX speed switch because the
actuation force is very short at one
point two millimeters combined with a
very light linear key which is perfect
for FPS gaming and fast typing so being
able to configure at what point each key
actuates on the real force RGB means
this is a true chameleon within the
keyboard wildlife and we have
buttons for switching between the three
actuation points that are color-coded
but within the software that can be done
per key to create your personal zone and
to complement this variable actuation
point we have rubber keys spacers with
an adhesive bottom so they don't move
around and so they come and single
pieces of two and three millimeter
thickness ten pieces each plus a couple
of walls key spacers they are meant to
reduce the travel distance so for
example if you actuation point is set to
one point five millimeters using the
thicker spacers will complement the
shorter actuation point because of total
reduced travel distance reduction but
the problem is we don't have enough to
cover the full keyboard so if you were
to apply some in your typing area and
then you won't have enough and they will
not feel consistent across the entire
keyboard now I have configured my typing
area to be at one point five millimeters
along with the spacebar shift and
control but everything else is set to
three millimeter actuation points so
this means when I'm typing I can be a
little bit faster and avoid the forceful
bottoming out but you see the keys still
heavier compared to other 45 grams
switches so there's more resistance at
that initial point on when the switch
starts to move down for example MX Reds
also require 45 grams of force but have
a much lighter downward movement which
if I relax my fingers the key will move
down but not on the real force RGB which
brings me to the character of the
switches and they feel incredibly smooth
after that initial resistant point the
rebalance is fantastic they're excellent
for typing the heaviness element
compared to MX speed or red is something
that I needed to get used to but it's an
awesome switch regardless
the one thing is you'll notice in the
sound sample is the lack of any key
rattling for the larger keys like enter
or spacebar and generally I would
consider this to be a semi quiet
keyboard in the top right we have volume
buttons and media controls are spread
through the function keys plus some
useless windows shortcuts are there too
but something we don't see often is a
control and caps lock swap key for
economic use when control and other
functions or cost with the youth and I
know that controlling caps lock swap is
actually quite common among enthusiam
lighting on this model is fantastic but
only with a few effects in there and not
a super accurate representation on what
you select on the screen and the driver
software versus what you see on the
actual keyboard on the Blues especially
also white is skewed again towards the
blue but the main benefit here with the
light is the white backplate that helps
to diffuse the illumination between the
keys and not just shine through the ADF
key caps which I'm happy that they're
double shot which means that the two
plastic pieces are molded together for
extra durability but they're not PVC
caps something up there many super fans
will dislike also the cable is non
removable but that these cable channels
are available for best routing in either
direction with quality rubber pads
that's really secured the board on the
desk with a slight angle adjustment
option in here too and lastly I want to
cover the software that is very good
first letting me choose the actuation
point either for the whole keyboard or
individually the RGB section gives you
options for effects for the three
profiles saved onto the keyboard it's
easy to differentiate based on the color
of the lock LEDs and then you can select
which keys you want to disable during
the keyboard lock function and finally
in the last time here this is where you
select to save to the keyboard to
remember everything you've just done for
the three profiles now to be honest I
was a little bit skeptical on the real
world use of you know changing your
actuation point on the fly but it's
really a one switch fits all type of
keyboard and deserve a damn good at work
I would say so for the price I would
have expected to see more those rubber
key spacers so you can apply them to
more keys especially if you want to have
consistency across the
and perhaps an armrest would have been a
really nice inclusion to have for such
an expensive product so guys thank you
so much for watching make sure to check
out our keyboard switches guide video
where I test 14 keyboards and different
switches and how they function and
different user scenarios but this is
definitely going to be replacing be
placed on my computer desk and used on a
daily basis not just for editing but for
gaming as well because of that actuation
variability for KI which is so cool
but yeah let me know what you guys think
of this keyboard and comments down below
and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
