great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Harbor Canucks and Razer established a
strong reputation for everything gaming
pretty much everybody knows that and the
rising competition from Logitech and
many others is making it that much
harder for Razer to dominate as they
once did so the natural progression for
the brand is of course to expand into
different categories because putting
glowing snake orgies on the product
should satisfy your inner fanboy ISM for
the brand so this is the Razer siren
this is their first standalone
microphone it is priced at the hefty
$180 and this is no doubt in to compete
with the likes of the blue Yeti and also
the audio technica at2020
but with a few additional bells and
whistles Razer style the full black
metal build is outstanding the base is
solid with a soft pad underneath to
prevent scratches I am disappointed to
say that both the pop filter and the
shock mount are not included and must be
purchased separately at least the pop
filter should have been included to
prevent from all their breathing pops
but here's a little trick record at an
angle off-center away from your
breathing pops for the cleanest possible
vocals
I love the symmetrical look of the
microphone itself with perforated
matching top and bottom enclosures and
even the top surface follows in line
with the rest dual chrome lines in the
middle help to emphasize that symmetry
and overall razer siren looks fantastic
although it doesn't have to be this
massive
the tiding knobs are pretty standard to
angle the microphone in the right
position but also used to remove the
entire capsule at the bottom we find the
mini USB connection works with PC and
Mac dual threaded mount for mic stands a
headphone jack for monitoring and an LED
on and off button for the glowing stink
logo on the other side I do appreciate
the color match the green on the mic
mute button to maintain consistency that
also turns red when you did one thing I
do want to point out is how slippery the
knobs feel I think rubberized coating
would have suited better for the knobs
one of the distinct differences between
the siren and the Yeti aside
from the general physical layout is the
front or LED display that actually is
useful as it shows the volume of your
headphones and microphone gain and the
recording pattern so you always have a
visual on the settings however I think
they should have done so much more with
display like actually showing you the
sensitivity readings in decibels so you
can technically see if you're clipping
or if you gain is too low
during recordings as the microphone is
incredibly sensitive and anything past
1/3 of the gain will clip the recording
and monitoring the levels with the
headphone jack for sensitivity accuracy
is impossible forget about that because
you can hear yourself just fine
perfectly through the headphones but in
reality you could be recording a totally
unusable audio because your game is too
hot and everything is clipped and it's
also hilarious on just how many reviews
on YouTube of this microphone the
recordings are all clipped I would
recommend you reduce the microphone
levels in microphone properties to give
you the extra gain flexibility with the
actual knob on the siren the for
recording patterns are useful for
specific situations we have the most
common cardioid pattern for
unidirectional voiceovers and podcasts
this is what I'm using to record this
review then there's a stereo mode also
good for vocals and differentiating
between left and right channels next is
an omnidirectional pattern recording in
360 degrees check this out it's very
difficult for you to actually determine
what the direction of the audio and so I
mean the chances of you recording a
roundtable discussion are still slim but
the mode is there and lastly a
bi-directional suitable for interviews
maybe instrument separation and all
these modes are available right at your
fingertips and if you haven't ordered
you realize this entire review is being
recorded with the razer siren for vocals
without any compression applied it
sounds pretty dull to me it lacks the
clarity but compensates with goodloe and
pickup but I would still not consider
this for streaming or broadcast without
first passing the audio through some
type of compression and here comes
another disappointing find the synapse
software that's include
is very limited it only allows the
selection of bitrate and the sample rate
and this is where I would like to see
some compression filters or some vocal
effects as added value for streamers as
otherwise you pretty much stuck with the
default recording signature which is
pretty boring and this is what you've
been hearing so far the audio has been
untouched so now let's compare how the
sounds versus my personal recording
setup and what you're hearing now is
recorded with the Audio Technica 2035
pass through the scarlett 2i2 preamp
this is a bear track no compression
applied and only now I've added my usual
voiceover preset for clarity and extra
body for the lower frequencies and what
you're hearing now is recorded through
the razer siren with the cardioid
pattern this is a bear track no
compression applied and now I've added a
multiband compression filter in Adobe
Audition to bring up the clarity and in
my opinion significantly improve the
recording signature and if you can tell
a difference let us know which one
sounds better to you the Razer or the
Audio Technica in my opinion the
microphone sounds fine the noise on the
high gain is controlled well and passing
the recording through my standard
compression proves there's enough
latitude in the recording for proper
amplification and boosting the low-end
regions for that broadcast sound for
$180 I do appreciate the front o LED
display for convenient information
although it is very limited and should
have been utilized for so much more
information display all the controls are
right there on the microphone with the
for recording patterns for different
situations and overall a handsome and a
sturdy structure of the mic but I wish
at least a pop filter was included as
standard really the major drawback here
is the lack of any software integration
for effects and compression presets this
is a USB microphone it's easily
achievable and this is a huge oversight
on Razors part but what do you guys
think of the sound especially compared
to my own microphone the 20:35 from
Audio Technica
which one sounded better to your ears
