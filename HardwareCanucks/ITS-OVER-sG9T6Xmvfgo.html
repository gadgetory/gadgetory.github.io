now
yeah we wanted the hike actually I need
to also take off my shirt the last day
of Computex and then we go about to go
for a little hike with Ebert and a
couple of other friends so that we can
explore the city just a little bit you
were don't close the door on me
well the door doesn't like you so do it
man so we have these lines here that we
aligned the subway carts so when people
exit you don't stumble upon each other
TTC Toronto could learn something from
this type of configuration
look at this we're down
so here we are going to meet these jokes
we find yes hello hi Heather so we need
to insert this token from the mrt back
into the machine in order to exit yay
Paul that is the genius when I'm in
foreign countries it's my adventuring
head when I'm at home it's my yard work
I have no hat Eber has a hat oh really
let's see what he's gonna pull out of
the backpack
for our that is exactly what I need
inside-the-park hear that noise Kyle how
are you enjoying the weather here right
now I uh well I just take a shower five
minutes ago and now it looks like I just
took another shower thirty seconds ago
are you regretting that first shower no
probably yeah so we just stopped by this
spot because I really allowed cicada
inside the street trying to find it
rocks you know the spike board that you
lay down on with all the bed of nails
and everything you got to distribute the
weight amongst as many rocks as possible
so you have a carefully choose where
your foots gonna go next it's true and
then it hurts so we right here and we
need to go here this cloud Abomasnow
ain't looking friendly it's time to
dress a little bit it's nice and cool
so here's the beginning of the elfin
Mountie trail this is the map is gonna
take us about 20 minutes to get to where
we need to go and this is actually the
steps and he's seeing some people that
are coming down Paul what was the first
impression everybody's exhausted right
unpack this trail is actually designed
and built by elephants I wonder what
that means people in the comments please
tell me
so these beginning steps are actually
quite short so if you try to take one by
one it feels like it's taking a lot more
work then if you would take two at a
time
so you're gonna do two at a time for now
this is what it looks like yeah these
guys make so much noise the guys make
all that noise god Keita Sakata we
haven't even gotten to the top of the
trail but the view is already getting
better and better with every with every
10 meters of elevation
it's yellow god I can I can see it from
are you eating something and the giant
caterpillar right on this tree we're
just a caterpillar it's very hairy one
the Discovery Channel up in this bitch
we got spider well quiet at the top but
with the cloud coming in won't be able
to see much from the highest point in
the mountain trail this is good enough
so we're the middle point of the other
mountain trail
I just want to shut up and let you
listen to the whole sound of the rain
and the bugs
who did that we have one hour until we
check out but that was incredibly fun
totally recommended check this out this
escalator it blows it goes flat in this
location and then you're thinking you're
about you'd be exiting but no let's back
down again I wonder why that that is
that would be all for Computex let's
leave this hotel room yeah let's do it
Eber and I are just editing our last
videos before we heading out to the
airport so Eber let's let's check out
your workstation a little bit so look at
that mess man like all these things or
actually this is mine but yeah I mean
McDonald's even woody what were we
thinking last food just left the hotel
it's raining inside hopefully that
doesn't delay our flights but while we
get the airport enjoyed this this this
scenic route or these what are we gonna
try to achieve
so a little bit of an update right now
it's a big traffic jam on a highway
Ebers flight is in under two hours how
do you feel right now pretty strong
stuff he's stressing out you can't stop
talking about the traffic so let us know
the comments below of what do you do
when you're stressing out about getting
to someplace or you know what are some
of the techniques that you use to calm
yourself down and I'm who I'm sure that
they will be helpful for the future
definitely I'm looking forward to
reading those comments
finally in the airport man this guy was
class the air conditioning so much when
I get out my glasses got foggy what is
it with people and their air
conditioning
