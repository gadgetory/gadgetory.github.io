deep cool where they're showcasing some
affordable options and it's really good
to see something like in the $40 range
entering the market and it actually
doesn't look half bad so let's check out
the matrix mate Matt Matt ryx Matt
matrix right after I think our sponsor
thanks to fantex thermaltake and
coolermaster for bringing us out here
and making Computex possible are a good
people now it's averse time Dimitri is
not important but before we get to cases
let's talk a bit about something else we
noticed when arriving here I know that
all in when liquid coolers are
everywhere these days but deep pools and
gamers storm division was showing off
something slightly different this is the
Newcastle series which comes in two
forty and two eighty millimeter versions
what caught our attention was the CPU
block which uses double window panels
and an RGB array to create a unique or a
really unique look actually it looks
pretty amazing in person and it's great
to see the manufacturers are stepping up
their
AIO game with cool new offerings those
addressable RGB s can create up to
sixteen point seven million colors and
36 different lighting modes it isn't all
about the looks either since the water
blocks height hides a significant pure
copper contact area and he shaped micro
water Channel expect pricing for the
castle to run from one hundred and ten
dollars for the 120 millimeter version
and one hundred thirty dollars for the
two eighty millimeter version alright so
I know that this 240 memory i/o might
look a bit odd with that tube running
from the blocks a base to the top but
there's actually some interesting
technology behind this one gamers Tom
have integrated an automated pressure
adjustment function into the captain's a
240 pro which is supposed to
significantly increase its lifespan and
also stabilize temperature fluctuations
okay guys so now on to those cases which
Dimitri talked about in the beginning
they all make up the matrix series and
deep pool has been able to leverage
common construction elements to
drastically reduce their overall cast
they'll come in three forms a
lower-priced 255 series 70 series and a
75 series there's nothing fancy here
either especially since with the matrix
55 which is a capable bear most chassis
and if you want to upgrade later there's
always a 70 or 75 every one of these
cases here has a simple sleek design
with tempered glass and a thin
addressable RGB strip those amazing
looking
defense won't be included in any of the
models unfortunately but deep who does
sell those separately so let's start
with a smaller matrix 55 which is the
most compact case in this lineup but it
still natively supports 280 millimeter
wide ei ticks on the boards and cost
just fifty dollars in case you were
wondering
the smoke side and front panels are made
out of tempered glass rather than the
acrylic were used to seeing on such low
price cases airflow is pretty good since
perforations run on both sides and the
front panel from top to bottom and
there's also more enough space between
the fans and the T G panel to ensure
nothing gets blocked internally things
are pretty plain but there is a
removable drive caddy SSD brackets and
support for a front at 360 millimeter
and top to 80 mm or the radiator there
are a few cable type points but don't
expect things like a PSU shroud or other
frills this case is functional and
straightforward but it doesn't have many
secondary features the matrix 70 bumped
things up a bit but it also comes in at
a higher price of $60 and that puts it
into a very competitive market space
there's still support for ATX
motherboards and the 55 to 80 millimeter
top radiator mount is replaced with a
360 millimeter version there are a few
other additions like the space for a bit
longer graphics cards more removal SSD
brackets and an integrated fan
controller finally we have the $90
matrix 75 and let's be honest with you
I'm not quite sure how it'll fare
against cases like the Lanco one which
we also saw on the show of course is the
most feature-rich case of the bunch but
it keeps the overall aesthetics of the
others the big difference here is that
the front panel can be swapped with
either a mesh filter or a tempered glass
panel by pressing a button it's a really
simple process but I really do think
deep cool design e75 around the mesh
option since there are no side
ventilation holes like on the other
matrix cases instead when you install
the tempered glass the fan circulation
is completely choked off and then the
difference between this and the other
cases is the latch system that holds the
side panel to the case simply push the
plastic latches and the entire thing can
be removed at the top deep pool has
added three plastic covers that close
off the area in case you aren't using
fans up there the interior here is very
much identical to the 70 with the
exception of one additional SSD bracket
one more expansion slot and support for
a bottom mounted 240 millimeter radiator
if you use a shorter ATX PSU so that's
it from gamers storm and deep cool guys
it's certainly great to see more entries
into the affordable case market and the
addition of two interesting-looking
coolers stay tuned for more coverage
from Computex 2018 a kneebar with
hardware connects thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
