to another Harkin extra view EVGA is
widely known for their graphics cards
motherboards and power supplies but it's
always exciting when companies expand
their product categories so you're
looking at EVGA first ever chassis the
header on air the idea behind the hedge
on air was to minimize the chassis
without compromises on enthusiast
systems and I personally think this is
the future of enthusiasts enclosures
making things more compact yet space
efficient and the Hedren air is actually
quite compact making this one the
smallest cases we've looked at plus EVGA
is considering water cooling enthusiasts
so hedge on hydro will be released
shortly now many of you might
immediately get turned off because of
the price which goes to $200 for a mini
ITX chassis might be overkill
considering there isn't much material
that goes into the construction of the
case and the reason for what seems like
an inflated price tag is that every unit
ships with a 500 watt 80 plus gold
certified power supply which is highly
efficient and uses good quality
components now given EVGA excellent
history with power supplies we don't
expect anything but quality with the
unit's supplied within the hedge on
series aesthetically the chassis is very
modern with curved angles large window
panel and notice the case is on an angle
with a front slightly elevated but still
with rubber strip at the rear to prevent
sliding and noise the front panel is
very minimalistic with tinted reflective
plastic with the power button in the
middle and the company's logo above the
right side panel does have ventilation
holes throughout along with two USB 3
ports and audio jacks the header layer
does support a slim slot loading optical
drive which is located right above and
EVGA includes a bracket onto which the
drive would be loaded as part of the
accessories we do get a cool case Cal a
power cord and two 90-degree SATA
connections at the rear we have water
cooling holes given this is a mini ITX
case only two PCI slots and a slim 500
watt power supply at the bottom notice
there are no ventilation carrots on
this portion of the case so keep that in
mind for orientation of your CPU cooler
now you most likely will be installing a
low-profile cooler but the case does
support towers up to 140 millimeters
both the bottom and top panels are
perforated to provide sufficient cooling
removing the top panel is simple with a
couple of screws and fortunately the
mesh does not include a dust filter and
even though it is for exhaust dust will
settle when the system is powered off
the hedron air comes equipped with two
120 millimeter fans that should do an
adequate job for cooling given this is
such a tiny enclosure and the fans are
also routed through a single three pin
fan cable which is nice to minimize
cable clutter so finally let's get
inside the hedge on air and check out
how it manages with cable management
during a system build now first thing
only the window panel has thumb screws
as there is absolutely no room in the
back for cable management so really
there's no reason to take off the rear
panel now I was actually quite surprised
to find paint stains behind the main
panel if they no way affects
functionality of the case but the
premium price at least should reflect
attention to detail and perhaps
appropriate paint job I was further
surprised to find this adhesive plastic
spread in the back of the case and
really if they're going for an all black
interior they should do it right from
the beginning now the head gel air
supports two mechanical drives with SSD
support on the drive caddies and this is
also where you mount the optional SIM
Drive it is nice to have two less
brackets but the drive cage is not
removable and quite frankly occupies a
lot of room and now have liked to see a
more modular design the power supply is
located at the bottom it is not the
conventional ATX eyes but resembles a
server power supply it is long and slim
allowing the head John to maintain and
small form-factor the unit cools itself
with a 40 millimeter fan and giving its
high efficiency rating the power supply
runs extremely quiet I hooked it up to
my main work station with 3930k and gtx
770 and under load the fan was working
but certainly was not the loudest
component in the system and the remember
the 500 watt capacity is totally enough
to run
a high-end system like that for
connections we have a 24-pin motherboard
cable an 8 pin CPU cable a total of 4
molix connectors and 2 SATA and - 810
PCI Express for your graphics card now
there isn't much for cable management in
this case we do get 2 hinges on the
drive cage that might come in useful and
also notice there is no CPU cutout but
instead the very particular shape with
mounting holes now this is for EVGA z'
all mini ITX boards as you see our test
board does not align with the
pre-drilled CPU holes this is really not
a big deal but I still would have
preferred to see a CPU cutout instead
the PCI brackets are locked in behind
this protective hinge this is probably
useful for land events and measuring the
length of the chassis it sure seems to
support 11 in your graphics cards now it
might be a little difficult giving all
the power supply cables are right there
but without reading the spec sheet I
assumed our GTX 590 measuring at 11
inches would be supported only to find
out there is no way to fit the card
because the side panel hinge is just a
few millimeters too long to allow
clearance for our GTX 590 only 10 the
half-inch graphics cards are supported
and mounting that inside the header on
air and you basically get an idea of how
a powerful system can get even in this
tiny enclosure the PCI cables are very
short so they don't interfere with the
side panel and there's very little room
between the GPU and the power supply but
luckily we do have perforated side and
bottom panels to help with cooling but
still exhausting graphics cards would be
more ideal for this chassis and looking
at the final assembly there's really
nowhere to tuck the cables and the
cleanliness of your build will depend on
the motherboard layout particularly the
location of that huge 24 pin cable but
it sure manages to clean up well
considering of how tiny this case is and
all thanks to that 500 watt slim power
supply without which the form factor of
the chassis would be completely
different so to conclude a VJs entrance
into the enclosure market looks very
promising considering they've designed
the case
targeted towards enthusiasts with an
impressive
small form-factor it sure is not a
boring case with reflective front panel
and window support for two mechanical
drives and a slim optical drive as well
graphics card supports with up to 10 and
a half inches and CPU towers up to 140
millimeters cooling in the header on air
is pretty decent giving size
restrictions but the two exhaust fans
should do an adequate job
they included 500 watt 80 plus gold
certified power supply is really the
winner here that is plenty enough for
enthusiast systems and the sole reason
for the Hadrian's compact design however
given this is EB jeez first chassis I
sure was not expecting it to be perfect
my first critique is the ok paint job on
the inside which looks unfinished and
unprofessional second I would like to
see more emphasis on module design
particularly with the hard drive cage
and third there is enough clearance for
11 inch cards there just no way of
putting the card in having the same
cutout on the left as on the right side
would allow hassle-free installation and
of course this is easily user modified
but EVGA should have thought of that
first so what do you guys think of EBG
aced first ever chassis I sure I'm
excited to see more small form-factor
enclosures on the market and perhaps
this will budge coarser and fractal
design or NZXT to explore the niche for
compact enthusiast enclosures now I
cannot give the heads on air and a word
just yet just because the case has some
missed potential and I'm really hoping
EVGA with consider feedback from the
community and apply appropriate
adjustments for this to be an even
better chassis alright there's been a
lengthy one thanks for watching guys
