fantex schoolmaster and Emma sign ah
guys guys guys guys guys guys guys we
are to around here and I've received a
surprisingly warm welcome so thank you
to whoever is watching this video from
the cooler master booth you guys are all
awesome
but this my friends it's finally the new
cosmos the galaxy I guess into the new
galaxy but the name here is the sea 700d
it has a lot of the traditional elements
of the cosmos lineup but they've
modernized it though the handles are
attached to the frame and the feet the
case feet are full the same design
pattern so now they're just like
slightly more flat but still remain with
a lot of the curves that the traditional
one have there's a lot of cohesion from
both the top and the bottom and that's
exactly what we want to see from the
cosmos lineup so just as with the
original cosmos the material choice here
has a good balance of plastics and
aluminium so the main front panel here
is plastic and same thing on the dust
filter underneath it but the good thing
is that it doesn't look like plastic
right you see this and it almost feels
like this is sandblasted aluminium which
is awesome because it has the cohesion
factor from the visuals but from our
material perspective it's slightly
cheaper and it's slightly lighter
because this enclosure is practically
giant so just as with the anniversary
edition the 25 years anniversary cosmos
this one also has a tempered glass panel
on this side that is curved and it's
curved twice at the front and at the
back and we are told that that success
rate for doing something like this on
the manufacturing scale is about 20% so
I was like we had a little awkward laugh
about how inefficient the curving
process would be but they're still
trying to fix the law inks on trying to
improve that yield it's one the only
panels that is curved on both sides in
the case in the street right now and
there's only one tempered glass panel on
the side on the main side and one plain
solid panel on the other side but the
cool thing is they are removable and
they swivel to open just like regularly
you can simply lift it over
they are swappable with the other side
so that's something that you want to do
that's a possibility because on the
interior you can actually either rotate
invert the model boards so it's facing
the other way
which is why the swappable side panel is
important and another cool thing is you
can actually rotate the motherboard to
face for the GPUs to face up so instead
of them you know going for the
traditional layout everything can go in
the back there you can use the
motherboard and rotating up to have this
90 degree rotation of the GPUs and all
the cables and stuff and that's pretty
pretty awesome because we haven't seen
something like this you know in that
type of modularity aspect we've seen
from the dark base 900 where you can
invert the motherboard but you cannot
invert it with a 90 degrees orientation
so it's really cool that they're
bringing some new innovative features
for the new cosmos well done so as I was
talking about the engineers about the
interior options and the interior
choices they've made so they do like
this curved approach to this sort of
shroud that blocks off this front
portion here and I do like it too it's
got the livers of an angular design so
it continues with the cosmos theme they
also have a power supply shroud and what
they will change though and it's
something that I suggested for them to
do is to have this slightly shorter so
it doesn't feel like this entire
interior is being so closed off by
having by opening up this interior a
little bit you'd have more room to work
with and I feel especially with the
glass panel that when is closed it will
appear well revealed more of the
interior there's an SSD caddy mount here
and they're trying to find ways to
utilize this cover made specially
installing Morris as these more drives
maybe potentially even having a magnetic
window over here so you can open it if
you want to reveal some of your drives
inside so what you seen here isn't
really final but it's really good to get
the feedback and then finally see what
the finished product will be like in
them trying to utilize this space as
much as possible to be visually good and
also just as functional and for storage
option they decided to go a completely
different route so note the cosmos you
know providing you like 13 hard drive
brackets this my friends this is going
to have more updated master K series
type of hard drive case where you have
little dots there and you can insert
different types room drive cages or
different drive brackets so it's all
good gone the 2012 drive cage and we're
back with a new alright so it's part of
the exterior ambiance so
a couple of things to notice here first
the LED lighting cooler master has done
a fantastic job with like just
delivering nice ambience LED strips that
in the passage you can connect and
that's exactly what we have installed on
both sides at the top and at the bottom
so there's a little that's really cool
cohesion there and the also the front
panel IO is illuminated around it and
something that will be changing is
making it a little bit more cloudy so
that the ambience here is more more of
the not as harsh you cannot see through
the plastic and it also will be swapping
out the nasty gloss over here that is
just a huge fingerprint grosse Ness it's
got 13.1 type C port which is Gen 2 so
that's awesome
with the new motherboards coming out
audio adapter power button a low and
high fan speed control and also a demo
color and motherboard mode for the
lighting so you can switch if you want
the color to cycle between if you want
individual colors so let me do this do
it on camera so as you can see I can
switch them however I want or you can
connect the LED which is goes to the hub
into your motherboard and that way you
can actually control the lighting of the
case through the RGB fan headers on your
motherboard so that lighting habits you
can see it's in the red right now it's a
prototype so don't worry about how it
looks but that will have your fan
controls and your lighting control and
from there maybe they'll also add a PWM
connector into the motherboard so you
can control that entire situation the
fans and the lighting three motherboard
instead of having to use the upfront IO
but also check this out they've added
this metal cover on the back so it hides
the cables and it's attached via screws
so it's not the most convenient to
things to remove but you know be nice it
was just on simple clips and stuff but
it does hide a lot of the cable mess and
potentially if you were to swap out the
panel to be installed here it will still
you know might give you the visual
appearance of the back that I like so
for airflow let's talk quickly about
that we have a removable front bracket
that says that supports 360 million
radiators and there's also an optical
drive at the top and right now ignore
the dual spots here AVO just be one the
dust filter is built-in and it's very
easy removable just like we see on the
master case these panels simply just
kind of open up like that and this one
opens up just enough if you have an
optical drive it will pop out without
interference for the top airflow with
the same same thing 360 million radius
support or 420 ml radiator so it also
sits on the bracket that you can remove
for easier installation and price-wise
well they reminisced site exactly price
yet because this case is still sort of
in this production stages but it's a lot
more finish than when we saw at CES so
they're thinking about $2.99 to 349 so
around the price of the original cosmos
because of materials because they
rotated multiple design I'm very curious
to see how they would implement that
mounting process because it has to be
easy and it has to be convenient for you
to actually utilize that you know
orientations benefit so guys let us know
what you think of the cosmos you need
700 peel that's a weird name my friend
but I like it I love the design
direction later taken to simplify and
streamline and modernize the cosmos
lineup and especially with this curved
side panels and very excited to see how
they change up the interior so that it
sort of suits the both the enthusiast
market and delivers everything that you
want to expect at this price point so
that's I'm Dimitri's I recognized a
first for watching and we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
