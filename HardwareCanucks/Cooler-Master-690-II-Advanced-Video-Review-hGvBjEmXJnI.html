canucks product showcase so here's a
case that is sure to get plenty of
people excited if you've been to the
computer building scene for any time
you've likely heard the name of the
cooler master 690 case thrown around
more than once it's arguably one of the
better regarded sort of budget series
style of cases as it offers practicality
and functionality for a very reasonable
price we'll check it out January 2010
after nearly three years as a
top-selling case in this category the
690 is getting a complete makeover and
will be reintroduced as the cooler
master 692 advanced which is what we get
to take a look at the case brings with
it an updated design including black
interior as well as incorporating many
of the features that you find in cooler
masters more popular cases the case is
set to be launched at under $100 making
this a very attractive solution for
regular users enthusiasts and modders
alike so let's take a look the case
keeps virtually the same dimensions as
the original and the exterior design is
somewhat similar but many of the
features have sort of been bolded and
more heavily accented there's a solid
mesh front panel with dust filters and
for external drive base the table posts
the power and reset buttons along with
two USB and audio input and eSATA
connector there's also a fan LED on/off
switch and the advanced model also
includes it's very cool hot swappable
drive tray right at the top the side
panel is covered but has space for two
fans and supports four different fan
sizes they also say there may be a
windowed side bottle sometime in the
future at the back we have holes for
water cooling tubes 120 millimeter fan
io area 7 PCI slots and an additional
vertical slot and then the bottom
mounted power supply the case is
constructed out of rigid steel that
doesn't feel cheap or flimsy and the
Tula's panels are very easy to access
the outside has dust filters behind
every bit of mesh for easy cleaning now
the black interior is a great surprise
on a case in this category well it is
hidden behind a covered side panel it
gives it that uniform look all around
and is one less thing for monitor staff
to worry about the case is raised by a
half inch by these truly massive rubber
feet the space at the bottom allows
users to fit in a
Archer than average power supply or
install a bottom mounted radiator which
we'll see later the front has a blue LED
140 mm fan and there are six three and a
half inch screw loose drive based now
there is a ton of cable management
spacing around the motherboard tray and
then up the back thumb screws for the
expansion slots we have the rear 120
millimeter fan for five and a quarter
inch screw list ROM base and to top it
off there's a CPU backplate opening and
space for a rear native millimeter fan
and we can't forget at the top another
140 millimeter fan with space for a
second right next to it have you lost
count of the fan spaces yet the cooler
master 692 advance supports one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven fans in total now most of the
fans are optional of course but really
it's like a giant fan held together by
bits of metal
starting on the installation we were
surprised to find that despite its
relatively small stature the case was
surprisingly easy to keep wire and clean
Coolermaster has included plenty of
cable management spacing throughout the
case and this means that there's a lot
of room to hide wires and it keeps the
front clear you'll notice the lack of
cables sort of down in front of the
power supply this is because you're able
to run them around the back through the
holes in the motherboard tray and store
them wherever you can make room the case
is also well designed for modern
hardware say like our 11 inch long 5870
video card they've taken the drive trade
design from the half series meaning easy
installation and they've also included
an 2.5 inch SSD drive tray now they have
moved away from the push-button five and
a quarter inch mechanism and the new
switch style is easier to understand but
it requires a little more fiddling to
get the drive lined up just right
another fun feature you'll find with the
advanced case is an innovative video
card retention bracket that works to
reduce the stress of heavy video cards
on the motherboard sockets this is
especially handy if you're going to be
transporting the system
last but not least we have water cooling
installation up the top there's room for
a 240 ml rad plus spacing for fans but
glue master has included as second area
for radiator if one isn't enough by
removing the four bottom harddrive base
you open up space for another dual rad
on the bottom and improved airflow from
the front so that wraps up our look at
the cooler master 692 advanced chassis
the evolution of the 690 into an
enthusiast modder friendly design that
offers some of the best from the company
really everything about this case just
comes together to make it a well-rounded
package you have the sub hundred dollar
price tag and this is the price point
where you really start to see many
companies make sacrifices on quality
when Master has tossed in a whole bunch
of new stuff not skimped on the quality
and still maintain the same reasonable
price as the original and they've
included features that you find on their
premier line of cases notably the
coolest design and black interior and
you can't forget about the exceptional
airflow the case likely has more holes
in it than actual material so the
airflow design and ultimately your
system temperatures are really up to you
but they've included things like the
dust filters the ability to mount
multiple sizes of fans and just the
general wiring layout inside the case
that all go into help making this thing
super modern friendly this is the first
case we've had the pleasure of reviewing
in 2010 and if it's a sign of things to
come we are in for a fun year the 692
advance is a damn good value chassis and
