just got to HyperX it's a rainy day
outside but beautiful on the inside and
HyperX is branching out with their own
mechanical switches which is pretty
awesome I wish they have many mechanical
keyboards but them making their own
switch is very exciting and they have a
new headset and audio is really part of
their identity so let's go check it out
but huge thanks to Phanteks and
SteelSeries for making our Computex
possible all right so it looks like
dimitri isn't really interested in
taking a closer look at the new keyboard
and the headset so he just passed over
that to me but i'm actually excited to
go over them i don't know what you're
doing man but none of the less I've been
using HyperX keyboard in the past you
certainly have and I've enjoyed them I
mean you certainly have enjoyed them I
love their headsets they're great and
I'm assuming that a lot of you guys are
actually interested in what they're
offering for now especially with the
mechanical keyboard that you know
they've designed basically a new switch
which is really interesting now at first
glance the design of the alloy origins
looks very familiar to the original alloy FPS keyboard so it's the same
compact design with the aluminum frame
and the plastic body underneath
unfortunately there isn't a TKL
version of this keyboard the cable is
removable as the original variant but
this time they've switched over to USB
type-c which is very refreshing to see
on a keyboard now there isn't a
detachable wrist rest included with this
keyboard and it sort of makes sense
because HyperX originally designed the
alloy fps and the alloy origins to
people who are really looking for a
relatively portable keyboard especially
for eSport gamers or someone who's you
know thinking about getting a full sized
mechanical keyboard that's fairly
portable now the main highlight of the
origins is the introduction of the
HyperX red switch not to be confused
with Cherry MX
so it still requires 45 grams of
actuation force just like the MX Reds
but the actuation point is at one point
eight millimeters versus two millimeters
with a shorter travel distance they're
also rated for up to 80 million clicks
so certainly a lot more durable than
cherry now after spending a short time
playing around with it I actually really
enjoyed this key design coming to think
of it they did feel a lot more like
Gator on gret switches
although HyperX you know they don't
claim that they've partnered up with
gator on in this case but either way I
really liked it and I can't
to get my hands on it to give you guys
sort of my full kind of experience using
this keyboard RGB lighting is here as
always that's more dynamic with
consistent spill across the frame it's
also fairly brighter which is nice
now there are three onboard profiles
built-in for on-the-go lighting and
macro settings and it also has support
for the ingenuity software so you can
customize perky lighting which is nice
pricing is not available yet and HyperX
wouldn't mention if these new switches
would cost more or less than cherry
equivalents personally I'm hoping that
the origins will be less since the Gator
on switches cost less than cherry
switches and like I said the new HyperX
red switches feel a lot like gear now
moving on to the cloud alpha gaming
headset I do remember taking a look at
the cloud alpha a little while ago and
if you're interested in checking that
out link will be right over here but I
really enjoyed you know what that had
said offered especially for the price
point it was super comfortable I mean
the build quality was fantastic and the
dual chamber driver design was just
fabulous now this is the Alpha s that
takes that formula and adds a few
upgraded features now it isn't meant to
replace the original alpha but it is
more expensive
unfortunately HyperX didn't tell us how
much it's gonna cost but you can expect
it to be a little north of a hundred
dollars when you look at the driver
design it nothing really has changed
with the Alpha s I mean you still get
the same dual chamber drivers there's
also the same removable microphone setup
as well as the removable cable as well
but there is a minor change here you
actually get an included or an
additional virtual 7.1 surround sound
inline control box that includes you
know your audio and game chat balance
controls now interestingly enough you'll
find bass slider adjustments on each ear
cups for some reason and I don't think a
lot of people will actually take
advantage of something like this I do
like the overall design of this headset
I mean first of all I do love the blue
accents it's certainly a step you know
different is step back from the whole
red and black design that hyperox is
going for in the first place so I really
appreciate that but that about wraps up
our coverage of HyperX let me know what
you guys think about the alloy origins
keyboard as well as the
alpha s I'm actually more particularly
interested on the keyboard because of
the new switches that HyperX has
designed which are the brett switches
again like i said they do feel a lot
familiar like gator on reds and I'm
liking you know the overall feel of it
so yeah let me know what you guys think
about it in the comments down below i'm
