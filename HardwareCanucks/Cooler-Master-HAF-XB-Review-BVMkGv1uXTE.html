always received recognition when it
comes to great airflow without
compromise the branding truly stands
behind its purpose and with quality and
practical chassis so cool master is
further expanding this popular line of
half series cases with the introduction
of this cube ATX case the half XB it's
ringing in at $99 which would make it an
appealing choice for mobile gamers now
this rather unconventional size
redefines what we are so accustomed to
and this cube design has many benefits
of Portability and features so let's
take a look of this new case lives up to
the great reputation of the half series
now the exterior still maintains this
industrial look
with the usual integration of plastic
and steel for construction
now cool master is also releasing
windows side panels for this case for
those wanting to show off your internals
and they will be sold separately and
starting off with the front panel we
have the main airflow intake that's
crucial for cooling your internals the
mesh includes a built-in dust filter and
behind we have dual 120 millimeter fans
and support for 140 mm fans as well now
the front panel connectors include the
power and reset buttons your audio ports
and 2 USB 3 ports at the front we also
have two hot swap trays that support
both 2.5 and 3.5 inch drives and the
tray itself is something unique and we
haven't seen before as it is extendable
so you don't have to bend the tray once
putting in the drive now the system is
actually quite clever and allows for the
trays to be a lot sturdier and lastly we
have two five and a quarter inch bays
that are included with removable covers
now the sides are identical and have
plenty of venting holes and we also get
these handles that make transporting the
half XP really convenient and the top is
designed for fan placement without
interference with your CPU cooler
however only the 200 millimeter fan is
supported it would be nice for them to
include the top fan along with different
fan mounting options for example like
your standard 120 or 140 millimeter fans
at the bottom we have large case feet
along with venting holes for your lower
of the chassis and in the back we have
an exhaust fan io area seven PCI slots a
power supply bracket and 280 millimeter
fan mounting options and more
ventilation holes and potential water
cooling cutouts and of course an
external removable dust filter for your
power supply sort of a standard for this
chassis market now assembling the case
does require a specific workflow first
removing all the panels that are secured
with thumb screws we get the cube
skeleton now the chassis is divided into
several sections to maximize the use of
space in an efficient manner we have the
top portion that houses your main
components where the two front fans as
your main cooling component while the
bottom house is your power supply and
all of your drives at the bottom we have
two optical drives with two lists
mounting the 2.5 inch drive cage
supporting up to 4 SSDs and Coolermaster
includes these single brackets that are
first attached to the drive again no
screws required which makes things a lot
easier to mount so the two optional 80ml
rear fans would probably be installed as
intake fans to keep the downstairs fresh
now on the other side the power supply
is slightly raised in a platform that is
covered in anti vibration foam and
thanks to the bracket the users with
longer power supplies are being
considered
we have about 190 millimetres of
clearance and not only that but having
that extra room as you wire your build
will prevent you from kicking your cat
in frustration and after installing our
1000 watt power supply we still had six
centimeters of clearance and also having
those hot-swap connections right in the
front of the power supply it is another
benefit for that additional space now
you probably know a certain individual
who would be ecstatic about the
removable motherboard trays and that's
exactly what we have here this makes
assembly a lot simpler both with
motherboard and cooler mount along with
setting up all your wiring for the
drives at the bottom now the trade has a
fairly large CPU cut out along with a
single cable cut out at the bottom that
would help routing those front panel
connections and to further a twith cable
management the entire bottom of the case
is covered with key
technologies along with more notches on
each side bar so a great commitment from
Kula master on cable management and by
keeping all the cable mess at the bottom
compartment you minimize resistance on
air flow now before installing the
motherboard tray prepare your 824 and
PCI Express cables to be routed into the
top compartment and after everything is
in place you get a clean looking build
graphics cards in length of 12.5 inches
are supported and will anything up to
10.5 inches you still have clearance for
a potential dual radiator now CPU
coolers up to 180 millimeters are
supported and clearance will vary based
on the fan configuration for the top
panel and once everything is put
together you do appreciate the
hassle-free assembly and those two hot
swappable trays do come in handy without
the need to mess around with wiring and
in case you need to replace any of the
2.5 inch drives on the side there's
enough room for your hand to fit and
deal with the connections so the new 1/2
X B is sort of a unique number it acts
as an enthusiast enclosure with all the
great features that we love including
easy portability great build quality
remove a motherboard tray and included
power supply bracket that simplifies the
assembly process we also have two hot
swap base with a clever bracket great
cable management that requires a
specific build sequence to it and we
have enthusiast hardware support along
with passive airflow that directly cools
your main components and lastly cooler
master has always been an excellent
competitor and with a release price of
$99 it's a sweet spot for the half XP
now the only thing I wish coolermaster
would have done differently is perhaps
that include 200 millimeter fan for the
top and additional mounting options for
the fans
so the half XP serves as a great case
and is well designed for what it is not
everyone will find the size or shape
functional but that is left for you to
decide if you are in the market for
feature-packed mobile-ready gaming
system the half XP is an excellent
option and we're giving in the hardware
canucks damn good a word so I hope you
guys enjoyed the view and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
