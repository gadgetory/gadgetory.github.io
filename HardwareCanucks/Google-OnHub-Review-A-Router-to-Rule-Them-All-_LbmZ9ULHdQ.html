there that are not particularly easy to
set up for first-timers especially if
you take advanced functionality for
tomorrow's connected home environment
but what if there was an easier way to
connect a variety of devices while still
keeping class-leading speeds the dark
bass 900 maybe the most innovative case
of the year with a built-in Qi charger
interior lighting tempered glass that
can be installed on either side and a
fully modular interior that can be
inverted if you so desire be quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below google's onhub
router claims to do exactly that and
also promises to support both future and
current wireless devices it does so by
using an eco system that can be easily
upgraded and expanded as time goes on it
basically evolves as technology becomes
available since its features set already
incorporates things that are even
broadly available yet the on hub is
nothing new since it has been available
for the better part of a year now
actually I'm reviewing it today since
some pretty serious firmware updates
have just been pushed through which have
changed and upgraded a bunch of things
that includes better integration for
home automation applications as I go
through this review it is important to
remember that the on hub isn't supposed
to be a router the networking veterans
love like some Linksys routers with DD
VRT Flamm where rather it brings
advanced setup options down to a more
user-friendly level without the need of
ton of knowledge Google calls it a new
way to Wi-Fi so let's see if it's true
priced at $200 the onhub certainly isn't
inexpensive but its exterior design
looks like a piece of artwork rather
than an obvious networking hub of course
there are less expensive options from
Netgear a SUSE d-link etc that are there
but not them look quite so good the
onhub i have is a collaboration between
Google and tp-link so coming from a
respectable brand I'm expecting good
things
there's also another variant of the
onhub made by hey-zeus which features a
proximity sensor that allows you to
boost Wi-Fi speeds to a particular
device by simply passing your hand over
its top I really want to try that out
let's dive into the design of this
huh like I mentioned before this is a
beautiful piece of artwork which was
expected since Google has always been
about simplifying things to make them
look sleek and elegant
remember the Nexus Q it may not have
been successful but it sure looked great
on top of that they want the user
experience to supposedly be less of a
hassle once you plug everything in
you're supposed to just be a few steps
away from being connected across every
device in your home if that's true
Google may be onto something here the
device itself stands on top of an
aluminum base and the router shell is
removable inside is where you'll find
ventilation for all the antennas and
other components if you don't prefer the
blue shell Google offers limited edition
shells that may suit your tastes I
happen to score the bamboo variant and
it looks even better let's touch base on
the specs this version of the onhub has
a dual core processor four gigabytes of
emmc flash one gigabyte of memory
Wireless support for a toe 2.11 a/b/g/n
and a c-13 high performance Wi-Fi
antennas and Bluetooth and ZigBee
antennas that all means the five
gigahertz band can take up to 1300
megabits per second whereas the 2.4
gigahertz band can do 600 megabits per
second so all in all this means today's
spec requirements but why should you
consider switching your existing router
to the onhub you might find the answer
to that question at the end of this
video since most of its best selling
features are actually software related
on top of the router you'll notice an
ambient LED ring which indicates the
current status of the router blue
indicates that the on hub is ready for
setup 2 means that it's on and active
and finally amber means that there's
something wrong and you should check the
Google on app for details I need to
point this out before I move on to the
setup process this router only comes
with a single outgoing LAN port that can
be connected to an external device and
that is strike one for me because my
workstation PC my inner home phone and
my Philips hue bridge are all wired to
the existing router so if you intend to
wire multiple devices to the on hub or
using it as a wired hub you may need to
look elsewhere I will be connecting the
on hub to my existing butter to just
have its features oh and there's also a
USB port that Google still hasn't made
functional the setup process was pretty
simple for the on hub I plugged in power
the included Ethernet cable and install
the Google
on app which is available for both
Android and iOS the built-in speaker on
the router produces an audio signal and
once the phone recognizes it you're on
to the next step to set up the Wi-Fi
name and password talk about simple
taking a closer look at the app it's a
clean user interface that is meant to be
the starting point for your interactions
with numerous devices that are
potentially connected to the on hub
you're greeted with the overview tab
that displays a virtual map of the
number of devices connected to the hub
when expanded it displays real-time
stats of the devices and you can
prioritize the Wi-Fi traffic to any one
of them for up to four hours you can
also perform a speed test within the app
which is a nice touch
sliding over to the Wi-Fi access tab you
can set up a guest network plus you can
review and share your password through
Twitter text what's that email you name
it but it's probably not a good idea
though moving on to the settings portion
which is more advanced but it's pretty
simple actually you can adjust the
brightness of the LED ring set the
device mode to either NAT or branch that
basically acts as a wireless router
whereas bridge extends the range for
your existing network but there are
limitations to that first you won't be
able to set up the priority devices DNS
and when things can be edited
you lose guest Wi-Fi it could also
hinder Wi-Fi speeds and finally you'll
be unable to pair home automated devices
to the hub there's also the option to
restart and factory reset the on hub the
advanced networking sections lets you
play around with DNS and when settings
the latest addition to the on hub is the
integration of home control within the
app as you can see I've paired my
Philips hue bulbs to the app and I can
directly control the lighting but the
features are limiting compared to the
proprietary hue app why is this such a
big deal the answer actually lies within
the routers name on hub in this case the
hub is a central part of an ecosystem
that can control devices connected to it
Google is working with companies like
nest August and various other home
automating companies to directly
integrate their control features into
need on app this is a smart idea to be
honest because you wouldn't need to
switch from app to app to adjust
settings which could be a hassle
sometimes being able to control all
devices at the same time is a more
convenient and viable solution I also
want to touch base on if'
tt-this essentially lets you create
simple commands to automate basic tasks
to smart devices in your home so how do
you use this feature
log on to ifttt.com slash on hub and
create an account
once that's done link your existing on
hub to the account and start creating
recipes or actions you want to perform
in my case I've created two basic
commands from my Phillips hue bulbs I do
need to point out that my phone is the
primary source of communication for
example I've set up an action that
states that if my phone disconnects from
the on hub then turn off my studio
lights and vice-versa just simple as
that but I wished for an option where I
could have enabled the setting during
the night
since triggering the lights on during
the day wouldn't make any sense you can
also do things like turn off air
conditioner and lock the main door while
your phone disconnects from network this
dis assume you have compatible devices
to make this happen but like I said
before this might post security risks
depending on your region and where you
live
but the best part is that all these
devices can start talking to each other
through the onhub router and you'll get
notified instantly if something goes
wrong think of the onhub as a spider at
the center of a web of connected devices
for now and into the future I'm
fascinated by the way how technology
changes from time to time stepping back
to the era where Wi-Fi changed the way
how we connected our mobile devices to
the Internet and now we're connecting
lightbulbs speakers TVs air cons and
various smart devices to the cloud to
enrich our lives at its best and the key
to all of this is software and I think
that IFTTT is just the beginning but
there are a few limitations if you
experience power outage your network
will be down unless if you have backup
but all in all you won't be able to
monitor your devices from your smart
phone and then there's the price I'm bet
most of you will require a router with
at least four LAN ports and the onhub
certainly can be on your list I believe
that the on hub was designed as a true
proof of concept a product that shows to
developers that it is entirely possible
to have a smart secure and easy to
control home automated service right at
your fingertips when Google launched
this last year developers started
working right away to improve its
performance and integrate
home control to the app now with IFTTT
support all you need are things like a
smart thermostat smart home security
cameras and smart lightbulbs basically
anything that can be connected to the
Internet and the good news is that if
you browse through various recipes
within the IFTTT website most smart
connected devices are compatible and I
do see myself using these features on a
regular basis what do you guys think
about this router in fact is it even
worth calling it a router even though
the honor features router like specs to
me it's just an extension to my existing
router and I want to hear your thoughts
on home automation perhaps are you
willing to jump onto the ecosystem now
