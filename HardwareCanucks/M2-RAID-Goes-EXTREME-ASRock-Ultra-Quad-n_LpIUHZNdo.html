and look at all these motherboards I
feel like me and the team on motherboard
heaven and thanks to our sponsors for
making this trip possible thanks to fan
fics coolermaster and Corsair but aside
from all these epic motherboards we
found this guy it's what they're calling
the ultra quad and up to card and let me
tell you this thing has the potential to
be one of the fastest storage devices
around
so what asrock has done here is pretty
straightforward but its design it's
purely focused on delivering inside the
read and write performance through the
PCIe x16 slot the ultra quad has a
simple brushed aluminum housing as well
as a small fan to draw in cool air and
move it across the internal SSDs and
then exhausted through the backplate
which also includes for activity LEDs
for individual drives so taking off the
shroud reveals the force loss which have
been angled to not only offer space for
a longer type and the two drives but
also increase air flow for each SSD and
now the benefit to this layout is
shorter PCB trace length between the
slots and the PCIe connector which
should result in faster and more
consistent speeds and just in case you
end up using next-generation and VM e
drives which will draw more power than
the PCIe can provide as rod also
includes a single six pin power
connector and while the ultra quad may
look like an interesting option for
adding extreme storage to any system it
doesn't have any onboard rate
controllers so its use will be strictly
limited to the X 299 and X 399
motherboards but not only that you'll
still need a viewer key to use with
skylight X systems luckily aim these
thread Ripper has a pretty decent free
utility for nvme raid so this could be a
good option for that you also may have
noticed there are a few switches on the
card so there's one for the fan power
and the other four are actually used to
place the card if you want to use
multiple of these cards in a single
system so basically the DI piece which
indicates the card number so if you have
two installed the primary one will be
switched as the one position while the
second in the number two and as rocks
included utility allows for further
control of these cards so another thing
we saw was this little I TX X 299 e AC
motherboard now I know it's already been
announced at Computex and you actually
can buy it right now for about $400 so
it's a bit expensive but
the extra and II still has the
capability to run an 18 course colic X
processor without any problems of course
you will end up sacrificing on some of
the connectivity that the Intel platform
typically provides but as Erick has
worked really hard to limit the impact
of their small motherboard so the memory
is used to free up space for two riser
cards that add six SATA ports three
ultra m dot two slots and two USB 3.1
gen2 connectors and of course there's
only a single graphics card slot and the
last thing on the agenda is this
brand-new micro SD X motherboard which
is based off a miniaturized Z 370 chips
and design this adds support for higher
and coffee-like processors by improving
PWM cooling there's also higher speed
xpm memory compatibility and as with all
STX motherboards this one uses an MX m
GPU which will add to the overall cost
of this platform but it also ensures the
system remains compact and we would
expect this to be rolled out into their
upcoming desk mini Refresh launching in
just a few weeks alright guys so that's
it from azrog this ultra quad M de 2
card is super awesome for people who
want the best performance with the M de
to storage and this thing is pretty
compact and what allows you to expand
your storage addiction and this is new
z3 70s DX motherboards for bear born
species brings better performance and
yeah really happy to see that
improvement so guys thanks so much for
watching make sure to subscribe and
check out this other relevant CS content
we'll see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
