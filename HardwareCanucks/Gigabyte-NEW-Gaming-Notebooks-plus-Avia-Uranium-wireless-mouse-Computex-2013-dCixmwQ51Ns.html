here at computex 2013 living just
announced two new gaming notebooks one
of them is the 15.6 inch notebook this
is actually the world's thinnest gaming
notebook at 21 millimeters in height
while it's closed so it's very
impressive for sort of the hardware
that's installed it features the latest
Intel Core i7 the Haswell clocked about
2.4 gigahertz it has the GTX 765m with
two gigabytes of gddr5 memory so
excellent for graphics performance as
well what's cool about this laptop at
the features four in total for storage
slots in total so two SSDs and we also
can install two hdds in there it has an
optical drive that can be swapped out
for an additional HDD in there so again
you know we have all the storage options
in this guy pretty good coming up
display this is a 1080p display IPS very
very thin great viewing angles from
gigabytes one thing though is the panel
is slightly flimsy as you can tell there
is some resistance while opening up so
you can't position it in a way that you
want but it still slightly is a little
bit flimsy coming onto the keyboard this
is illuminated keyboard has pretty good
feedback in here obviously it's a
notebook everything is pretty flat so
the keyboard sits in its own little
section here aluminum body very nice to
touch we also have the speakers with
power button coming to the side here we
have two years be three ports HDMI out
and the VGA port on top of the screen we
also have a webcam with the built-in
microphones have a standard thing and on
the other side
we have two more USB ports these are two
point O headphone jack and an SD card
slot and of course your Ethernet port
overall very cool gaming notebook from
gigabyte again some of the impressive
feature is very powerful core i7 a very
great graphics card lots of storage
options obviously 1080p display let's
see how heavy this thing is it's
actually fairly light with the battery
installed I don't know the exact weight
but it won't if you are buying a 15.6
inch notebook I'm sure the waiting is
very competitive to what is out there
also given this is the world's thinnest
gaming notebook it's a great advantage
so moving on to the notebook front we
have the second gaming notebook from
gigabyte this is the p34 G also very
thin design it looks like it's a brushed
aluminum body so none of that plastic
stuff here so it won't wear out with
time usually these parts were now
because your hands rest illuminated
keyboard but one thing is you can tell
the keyboard does submerge a little bit
so not a very good thing to see on this
product it will retail for about a
thousand dollars plus depending on the
configuration with your storage options
but it has an SSD and HDD slots so
pretty good features the intel core i7
latest has wall and great graphics
support as well the gtx 760m with two
gigs of ram so pretty cool stuff as you
can see the speakers there the namm pad
is very responsive with your left and
right click sort of integrated into each
other so in Windows 8 is included with
the computer so obviously we have all
the windows 8 Touch integrated controls
into the touchpad so on the side here we
have Ethernet port vga to USB threes and
headphone jack no microphone jack
unfortunately but I guess there is one
integrated in here on top of the screen
also with the webcam have a standard
thing here to come to display this is a
14 inch display a really cool thing to
see 1080p on this type of model so again
the very small package and it's really
cool to see 1080p display incorporated
into such a notebook this is the also
very thin device only 21 millimeters
over to this side we have two more USB
ports HDMI port and SD card slot so
great things from my gigabyte here we
have the two new gaming notebooks cool
thing is very thin 1080p display in both
models starting a thousand dollars for
the little one and in thirteen hundred
dollars for the big brother so moving on
with gigabyte some of the gaming
peripherals they're announcing this time
and computex is the AVR uranium wireless
gaming mouse what's good about this
mouse is that not only is it wireless
but it comes with its own ghost macro
station so now let's go about the LCD
screen is that it shows you all the
information about the mouse and you can
configure that on the fly without having
to exit into the software menu also cool
because this is an actual separate unit
you can take it with you on the go
anywhere and it will work just as fine
and will save all your profiles they're
so pretty good stuff now coming to the
mouse unfortunately no wait adjustments
here something would like to see on the
gaming mouse but at the bottom here we
have two double A batteries charge rate
goes up to 10 hours so pretty good and
you can also plug this in into USB port
here for charging has an on/off switch
so you can save battery this way coming
to the buttons pretty stand forward we
have your side the browser buttons two
more buttons for your point finger as
you can see they are labeled g1 g2 g3 g4
so and the actually programmable the
scroll wheel is pretty responsive it is
feels a little too light though I would
like to have a little bit more
resistance pressing the middle button
that switches your profiles so you can
either go up or down pretty
straightforward we've seen this type of
design on a lot of mice in the past so
pressing the middle button and we get
access to these to the ghost macro
station we can change our DPI here as
you can see it does change on the fly so
you are aware what DPI setting you're
using your also where each profile
you're using so you know it's a cool
gaming gimmick most of you have the
battery life over here so 95% keep track
of your battery life I'm pretty pretty
cool new product from gigabyte this is
the avia uranium the ghost macro station
bundle with
mouse so that concludes our overview
some some of new things at gigabyte so
we have two new gaming notebooks this is
the smaller brother one bigger brother
right behind me and also the mouse the
wireless thing's pretty cool things from
gigabyte here at computex 2013 thanks

more complex coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
