great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
higher canucks
and based on many requests to remove my
current editing PC off the floor and
onto desk I'm talking to you Paul and
Kyle and I decided to take this
opportunity to do a workstation
upgrade revision 2 and change a few
things around that would complement a PC
on the desk off the floor let's get
started so my current case selection is
an awesome one the white fantex
and deluxe but I don't particularly like
the giant full tower on the side and
wanting something more suitable for this
sort of showcase environment this is
where the lien lead PC await a cube case
style comes in that not only has the
appropriate capacity to fit all my
drives and hardware but it's a beautiful
enclosure with glass panels and built-in
lighting I love the dual chamber design
and I haven't worked with an Lian Li
enclosure in a while so I'm really
excited to see how this will turn out
and if you'd like a full view of the PC
oh wait let us know by leaving like on
this video I will also be substituting
my reference 980ti
for a card that I am super pumped to use
the 980ti Seahawk by MSI that features
the Corsair age 55 cooler on the GPU so
I can go crazy with an overclock and
dump all that heat away from the case
and hopefully maintain a completely
silent operation and that's important as
the entire build will be less than a
meter away from my face plus the glass
doesn't exactly isolate the noise but
before the build begins we must complete
the teardown
you
now I initially did not want to part
with my x61 cooler from NZXT because I
love all the manual controls through the
km software but the case will be using
does not support any 140 millimeter fans
so we'll have to stick to 120 modes and
this is where the corsair h 105 comes in
and this is all the hardware that if you
think about is the sort of the daily
driver for everything that i do on the
channel starting with the mountain board
this is an asus x79 pro 1 32 gigabytes
of Corsair Vengeance Ram and I'm still
rocking the sandy bridge-e CPU the 3930k
at 4.5 gigahertz that is still going
strong but you guys know it an X 99
build is definitely in order so we'll
leave you suggestions on my future
potential hardware now I'm super excited
to substitute the reference 980ti with
this water-cooled Seahawk card from MSI
that has a beautiful aluminum backplate
that perfectly fits with the aluminum
enclosure this is a hybrid cooler
meaning the blower style fan is still
present to cool the V RMS and the rest
of the components spread on the PCB but
for the main GPU msi has teamed up with
Corsair to release this edition of the
gtx 980ti this means much lower
temperatures and quieter operation
specifically at load as the reference
card on idle is already damn quiet for
storage I'm running dual Samsung 850 Pro
SSDs and a whole lot of mechanical
drives that I seriously need to upgrade
as I'm quickly running out 10 terabytes
of storage so if you have any NASA jes
cheon's leave them in the comments below
powering the system is a Coolermaster V
750 power supply with black module
cables and reliable power delivery I'm
excited to use the Lindley PCO 8
particularly because of the glass panels
and all this integrating lighting so
they get to work and rebuild my
workstation PC
I am super happy to say that the first
boot goes successful and I'm extremely
happy and how this bill turned out I
like that the case is equipped out of
the box for airflow with six fans
included if only we had a fan controller
so they don't blast to 100% but I was
able to set the fan profiles inside the
motherboard anyway I really love the
dual chamber separation it's so
refreshing to just admire the hardware
and all my fans in the main chamber I
said to exhaust while the three front
fans deliver cool air to the rear
chamber that houses the power supply and
all the drives and this sorry to say
mess of cables that thanks to this
separate chamber allows the main visible
portion of the interior to remain
totally clean and beautiful
Lele supplies a few adhesive RGB LED
strips that have spread on each front
column and at the bottom rear to have
the background glow that looks fantastic
the MSI text on the 980ti stays
illuminated in the yellow that doesn't
fully suit this build but it's a pretty
minor thing and doesn't worry me at all
finally it's time to put those front and
side glass panels on and the exterior
fact the glass creates is truly unique
not only does it create this
cool-looking reflections off the
environment and trust me it looks even
better in person than on video but the
custom lighting combined with glass
panels is absolutely stunning in the
dark and this is exactly the showpiece
system status that I wanted to achieve
for my main workstation PC and while
it's a bit wider than the interlocks
it's both shorter in height and length
that sits on top of that white cabinet
just perfectly so guys thank you so much
for joining on this very fun workstation
upgrade project revision 2 we hope you
enjoyed and make sure to subscribe and

review of the leonie PC o 8 case is
released
im3 tree with harbor Canucks we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
