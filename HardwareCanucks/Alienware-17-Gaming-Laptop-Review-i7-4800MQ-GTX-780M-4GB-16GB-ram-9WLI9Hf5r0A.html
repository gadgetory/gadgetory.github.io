more hey guys this is dimitri with
haruka nuts and welcome back to another
view we're taking a look today at one of
aliens where his latest gaming laptop so
I'm really excited to put its through
its paces with gaming and see exactly
just a portable this powerhouse is but
this is the Alienware 17 and by the name
you're looking at a 17 inch display
1080p and when it comes to pricing it's
all about user defined configurations
starting at $14.99 moving all the way up
to 3k plus the model we have here is not
3d ready but you can opt in for a 120
Hertz display that will also include a
pair of 3d glasses this level of
customization I think is very appealing
especially for a mobile system like this
one and when I say mobile I don't mean
you take this on the road with you on a
train to play games this is a desktop
replacement that you can carry it just
over 9 pounds it's not particularly
light but light enough for a mobile user
so what does 2700 get you for a laptop a
lot actually we get a quad core i7 4800
MQ 16 gigabytes of RAM GTX 780 M with 4
gigabytes of vram plus an SSD and
storage drive for your OS and files
respectively the custom form factor is
also part of the deal so the entire
exterior shell screams Alienware with
angular design and of course the alien
head on the lid that lights up we also
get an LED strip running around the
belly that's the whole incorporation of
alien effects that we'll cover later but
this machine certainly feels incredible
many owners of the previous generation
of alien wear laptops would not be happy
with the new design changes gun is the
alien head power button we no longer
have a numbs the cater and the screen
there's no longer glass it is matte and
anti reflective so from a functionality
standpoint it makes sense but to be
honest it's sort of lost its Alienware
appeal on the right side we get a
Gigabit Ethernet port a pair of USB 3
ports and 9 + 1 SD card reader and a
slot loading optical drive on the other
side a power plug kang's is unlocked
HDMI out and in mini displayport two
more USB threes and audio jacks the
speakers are located at the front and
are one of the best speakers I have
heard in the laptop alright so now let's
take a listen at the sample of how the
loud kiss speakers can go this is the
hundred percent volume is you can hear
I'm speaking in my regular tone so it's
going to play this file so you guys can
get an idea of how loud this laptop is
hey guys this is Dimitri with her
Clarkson welcome back to another view on
the table today we've got a gaming
headset from SteelSeries this is the
five hb3
retailing for around $80 I think the
sensor so you can hear the projection is
excellent absolutely amazing speakers
are located right in the front exactly
where they should be place for really
clear Direction very crisp sound exactly
what you need from gaming the bass
response could be butter is very poor
but for in-game sounds and immersion it
was totally satisfying and I found
myself to use the laptop speakers more
instead of the headphones so a big plus
to Alienware for not forgetting about
this very essential component in such an
expensive package as you can see at the
bottom we have a lot of intake and large
exhaust vents at the back that will
divert the heat away from your body and
in my experience with gaming heat was
never really an issue nor did the laptop
heat up and none of the heat was
transferred onto the keyboard so overall
I'm very happy to report that cooling is
not an issue having said that the fans
inside the machine have to work really
hard to keep the temps down and every
time was gaming the noise levels was
quite unpleasant now I'd like you guys
to hear how loud the laptop gets right
now it's not doing anything so it's an
idle mode and high performance mode the
fans acuity are not spinning so the lot
was very quiet in this idle mode try to
have been playing for a little bit with
now 1/5 for now this is maxed out so
it's hopefully pushing this GPU to sort
of its limits and I'm going to be quiet
so you guys can hear how loud the laptop
is compared to what I was running it
went on idle
the fan is spinning you can clearly hear
that if you're just playing at normal
volumes obviously if you're wearing
headphones it's not gonna be as
noticeable and if you're using the
entire 100 percent potential for the
speaker as well it's going to be
absolutely not an issue at all
opening up the laptop does require both
hands to be used and I do like that the
screen is very tight and it won't budge
unless you intend to change the angle
that actually goes pretty wide it is
very nice panel with pretty decent
viewing angles it does exhibit slight
pink overtone from side to side viewing
and the more bluish hint from top to
bottom but everything else from the
brightness to clarity to pixel density
is pretty excellent we also get a webcam
that's located in its usual spot and
it's actually quite nice with full HD
recording available the interior of the
Alienware 17 is coated with a slight
rubberized layer which is nice to touch
but it does tend to leave finger marks
the illuminated trackpad is a welcome
feature does blend in very well with the
overall design and has a smooth touch
interface with two separate physical
buttons with great travel time and
appropriate press feel I do wish though
the trackpad was slightly offset to the
right as accidentally touching the
trackpad during gameplay was very common
of course the same willing it is an
option when using a mouse now the unit
we received shipped with Windows 7 of
course later versions of OS are
available for configurations so finger
gestures aren't native to Windows 7 but
you are able to customize sensitivity
areas for vertical and horizontal
scrolling that works very well now for a
gaming laptop one of the most important
features I think is the keyboard sure
you can customize the colors of four
zones it really isn't all that practical
but as long as we have backlit keys I am
happy
this backlight is also quite vibrant a
visible and daylight but we don't have a
keyboard shortcut to dim or turn them
off completely all that done is through
the software the keys are reinforced
with aluminium underneath and feel a
little heavier than my MX cherry-red
switches and also exhibit very decent
amount of travel time with excellent
bounce now not only was this perfect for
typing but WASD gaming zone was
automatically natural the surface of the
keys is also slightly curved
better a finger precision and prevents
your fingers from slipping we do have
four macro buttons as well located above
the numpad but with very limiting
options available for built-in functions
throughout my testing with gaming and
also productivity I wasn't entirely
happy with the height of the laptop
particularly the somewhat sharp edge
that was irritating my arm but this is a
gaming machine and when came to testing
I wasn't entirely happy with the results
for a particular configuration with the
780 M I wasn't getting the frame rates
that I'd expect from a $3,000 laptop
BioShock Infinite was handled properly
but demanding games like Metro last
light on ultra wet physics off and no
AAA we averaged at 44 fps which is
playable but it doesn't hit that sweet
spot of 60fps battlefield 4 at the
highest possible settings averaging at
36 FPS core of duty ghosts' averaging at
44 of course it wouldn't be a gaming
review without Crysis 3 again delivering
ok results on ultra and what my
favorites is ARMA 3 which is extremely
demanding and averaging at 31 fps at
high settings now these results will
vary based on configuration and of
course bumping the settings too high
will deliver even better frame rates but
to be honest I was expecting to hit over
60fps considering the specs and the
price battery life is very limiting on
this one with an 8 cell battery reaching
just under two hours for web browsing
this is at the hundred percent
brightness in high performance mode kind
of like your worst case scenario and
gaming results were even worse at just
over an hour of gameplay before needing
charge I also liked the option to switch
to integrated graphics card to save you
power so if you're not gaming and just
browsing the web it is an excellent
option plus you get over three and a
half hours of browsing time now given
the size the way the thickness and the
poor battery life this won't really
satisfies anybody portable needs
especially since the power brick is so
massive the Alienware 17 really is meant
to be a desktop replacement and anyone
contemplating on the pricing of this
machine should really consider the
advantages of this over conventional
desktops
now while initial configure
raishin is totally flexible when you
order your gaming laptop Alienware
really makes it easy to swap drives and
memory just by removing the bottom panel
so future drive upgrades are totally
possible
now before we conclude the last thing on
the list is alien effects it's a custom
API they changed as the lighting effects
on the whole machine while you're gaming
so it's another way to make your gaming
fun at least when it works list of games
is still very short that many times it
was rather annoying and glitching then
dynamic for example playing Battlefield
3 any time you deal damage the whole
machine lights up in red and slowly
recovers to white in Metro last light
the colors are different and actually
change out based on the in-game
atmosphere which I did enjoy but there
are many times when it just doesn't work
and starts to flash and totally glitch
and just ruins the experience even for
games that are supported I ended up
turning it off most the time to just
enjoy my gameplay alright guys it's been
a lengthy one so let's wrap this up this
Alienware 17 I think hits the perfect
spot for a portable powerhouse with many
user-defined configurations based on
your budget such as the 120 Hertz 3d
display option everything from the
screen to the keyboard to the clips
integrated audio is absolutely amazing
plus the adjustable lighting system is
cool especially the backlit keyboard
that is also functional built quality is
nothing short of amazing exhaust is
located at the rear exactly where it
should be plus the upgrade option for
your drives or memory is welcome now
don't be expecting to hit over 60 FPS on
the highest possible settings with some
of the most demanding games but bumping
them down just a little bit and you will
see smoother gameplay now on the flip
side the exhaust does get quite loud
during gameplay I was not entirely happy
with alien effects the supported games
list is still very short and the API is
very glitchy they really should address
this and of course pricing is going to
be an issue for many considering it's
not just the hardware you're buying into
but it's the entire alien we're branding
which in a way is justifiable
considering you won't be able to build
yourself a laptop and desktop equivalent
is just not comparable considering the
form factor I'm
