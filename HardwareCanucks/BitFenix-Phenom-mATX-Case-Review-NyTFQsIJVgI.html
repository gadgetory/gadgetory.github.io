great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry and welcome back
to another hard work NOx review then
make sure to subscribe to our channel
and share your thoughts on this case in
the comments down below
for a chance to win the actual case
we're about to review now beat ratings
has been on a roll with new releases
that aim to bring a lot of flexibility
with cases that suit specific purpose
and over the next few Big Finish case
reviews you're going to see that each
case has its own right either for water
cooling or multiple expansion slots so
today we're going to take a look at the
FINA micro-atx a $99 enclosure capable
of packing a punch in this boxy and
rather unattractive design if you're
looking for something with a bit more
character than the Phenom series won't
be for you for micro ATX case though
it's actually quite compact it may
appear to be a lot wider than it
actually is because of its short height
the front and top panel covered in beat
Vinick says soft touch treatment which
brings that quality feel to ordinary
plastic the chassis is minimalistic
aesthetics don't bring much to the table
with a bare front panel with the logo
peeking through and ventilation strips
on the sides after taking off the panel
I notice that ventilation strips weren't
fully open but just a few circular
cutouts and since this is the intake for
your power supply I would have liked to
see less restrictive design all the
connections are located on the side with
two USB 3 ports audio jacks and PR
buttons at the back since the
motherboard is flipped we get a total of
five expansion slots with some venting
area above the PCI brackets utilize a
job down clamp that locks all the
brackets a place which is actually quite
convenient for tool free assembly we
also have an exhaust fan and a power
cord insert that will cover a bit later
the key stands on quality rubberized
feet and then we also get this magnetic
cover that's supposed to prevent warm
air from the power supply exhaust from
re-entering the chassis from below but
say you're only exhausting air from the
case using the top pins this would
create positive pressure and this
Hannah would prevent all the dust from
getting picked up and then the top of
the case we have a removable dust filter
with support for those 120mm fans now
there's a lot to talk about when it
comes to features so let's pop that
panel open and let's check out the
interior first I would like to cover all
the drive storage starting with a side
panel that has all the connections
mounted on there but also supports to us
as these next as a drive bracket that is
removable with four screws that can
house three SSDs at the front and two
mechanical drives at the back
simultaneously which means stock drive
storage is actually pretty good
mechanical drives use the sliding method
with rubber grommets and say quite
securely in place now after mounting the
bracket you do lose a bit of clearance
on the inside for your CPU cooler so
measuring the space until the three and
a half inch drive the Phenom will
support towers up to 150 millimeters so
that's something to keep in mind behind
the front panel it's less strange to see
an optical drive slot but it also has
its own purpose
which can house extra drives with this
Bakke converter this allows installation
of a single mechanical or a solid-state
drive it does however come with a few
compromises now first mounting this
bracket in place is quite easy however
it blocks one of the top pins and you'll
need all the airflow you can get to stay
cool so it's a rather unpleasant
compromise second because it sticks out
you lose clearance for the top three PCI
brackets so if you need all the storage
you can get it certainly is an option
quite a wobbly option but it's
nevertheless there I would recommend
just removing the five in the quarter
inch dog to get just a little extra room
for all your wiring moving on to airflow
the Phenom comes with two 120 millimeter
fans both of which are set to exhaust
one at the rear and one at the bottom
and you'll certainly would want to
utilize the top fans to cool your GPU
but only if your motherboard allows and
you don't require the last PCI slot the
second fan is supported at the bottom
this would mainly be used for exhaust
for positive pressure and plus there's
no dust filter so intake is out of the
question
and the 200 millimeter fan is also
supported if you want to utilise higher
airflow at lower
also another feature is support for two
mechanical drives at the bottom in case
you really need to cramp the Phenom with
storage and they use the same mounting
with rubber grommets although I really
wish Bettina could have included
something of higher quality or perhaps a
bit larger as they ripped in pieces as I
slid the drives in place which isn't all
that Pleasant now given we have a rather
unconventional spot for the power supply
its own power outlet is included at the
back with the power cord extended and
routed through the power supply bracket
this is a very simple installation of
first mounting the bracket onto the
power supply plug it in and placing the
bracket back and it will intake air from
the front and there's also plenty of
room above the power supply for cables
plus even with the five and a quarter
inch drive bay installed there's still a
good amount of clearance for all your
cable routing now our unit is 180
millimeters long and it does just
slightly block the first pci bracket so
anything over nine inches
won't fit but otherwise 12 inch cards
are supported no problem which is
actually quite impressive so let's get
on with the assembly and let's see how
the Phenom micro-atx handles the loaded
system and for one there isn't a cable
management system in place for example
you cannot route any cables behind the
motherboard and there's no way to secure
the cables inside the case and that was
ready for some mess of a chassis and
well it's pretty close with all the
cables just hanging out like the eight
pin or the 24 pin motherboard cable and
plug in or GTX 590 it seems everything
is in place and ready to go and as you
can see there is no way to route cables
at the rear because there's no cutouts
there is some space at the back and I
would have liked to see in the 8 pin CPU
cut out just to make things a lot easier
the GPU however is fairly close to the
top utilizing those two top PCI slots
and cooling really shouldn't be an issue
considering its proximity to the intake
area now here comes the challenging part
the side panel and all the connections
on it I had to remove the GPU in order
to access the connections on the
motherboard and D Phenix includes a USB
2 adapter which came in handy and
starting with all this cable mess first
the drives inside the panel the
all the audio and USB and only then I
was able to put a graphics card back in
then comes the side drive bracket which
in itself is a whole lot of challenge
simply because of the wiring now there's
no clearance issues even if you populate
all of the available slots on the side
panel and the bracket which is good news
I'll just be a nightmare for all the
cables you'll have to deal with but
everything fits in well and the chassis
is ready to crunch some numbers however
I wasn't completely happy at the
assembly process it's not very user
friendly but it turns out that you can
mount the side panel with all the
connections on the other side you just
have to flip the panel which is not a
big deal and this way you get more
convenient access for all your
components and no longer do you have to
redo all your wiring every time you have
to remove the side panel now overall I
think the fina micro ATX from BitFenix
has a role within the micro ATX options
as it provides a lot of Drive storage
spots like on a bracket or the side
panel without compromise we have long
GPU support even with large power
supplies dual exhaust at the top and the
bottom while keeping a very compact form
factor but like with many small shot
sees you run into problems with space
efficiency and I feel the Phenom could
have been designed slightly better to
allow a more convenient cable routing
which i think is the biggest downfall of
this case as it's quite difficult to
work in but flipping that side panel
sure simplifies things and I would
highly recommend doing so the Phenom
certainly makes the most out of its size
though and without a doubt can house an
enthusiast system and BitFenix are
certainly on the right track moving
towards smaller designs but we need to
see more space efficiency and more
emphasis on user friendly assembly so
thanks guys for watching and again we'll
be giving away this exact case all you
have to do is be subscribed to the
Haruka Knox youtube channel and leave a
comments down below share your thoughts
on this chassis and we'll see you in
