exterior and completely silent they
define their five from fractal design
link in the description for pricing and
availability hello everyone I'm Dimitri
with Harbor canucks and it's really
fascinating how fast Hardware is
improving particularly and the GPU front
and the power efficiency of GPUs thanks
to invidious Maxwell architecture so
they will be comparing the current
top-of-the-line SLI configuration on x7
line of Oris gaming notebooks featuring
invidious gtx 970m on the X 7 Pro versus
the previous generation top the line SLI
configuration featuring nvidia gtx 860m
on the x7 v2 and we have a full review
of the Auris x7 pro so click my face to
go check that out but there's about a
400 dollar difference between the two
machines
one of the main exterior changes is the
display that is an IPS like LCD on the
x7 pro and a standard TN panel on the x7
v2 with more limiting viewing angles and
less accurate colors both feature 1080p
resolution and aside from an IPS like
upgrade on the x7 pro I wish there was a
bump in pixels on the more premium model
both notebooks are rocking the same 22.7
millimeter thick body with metal top
shell illuminated keyboard with 5g keys
that they're awesome and specs wise they
both vary slightly aside from the GPU
configuration so the i7 quad core 4870
HQ with 3.7 gigahertz turbo on the pro
versus the 48 60 HQ with 3.6 gigahertz
turbo on the b2 16 gigs of ram on each
with total of four slots with identical
storage potential of 3m SATA drives and
one two and a half inch drive the x7 pro
features dual 256 gigabyte M SATA drives
in raid 0 while the x7 v2 has three 128
gigabyte M SATA drives in raid 0 and a
single 1 terabyte 2 and a half inch
drive stashed in the corner for extra
storage both have 802 11 AC Wi-Fi and
killer LAN and the main powerhouse
change are the
we use so nvidia gtx 970m with three
gigabytes of vram in sli on the x7 pro
and gtx 860m with four gigabytes of vram
in sli on the x7 v2 and so now let's see
what type of performance boost you can
expect with the new GPUs
so the 970 m versus the 860 m in sli
even told the 860 m has four gigabytes
of vram instead of the three gigabytes
on the 970 m see if there is any battery
improvement thanks to the power
efficiency of Maxwell architecture and
whether or not the price premium on the
x7 pro is worth it and so starting with
some generic benchmarks there's quite a
large gap in the graphical performance
so 3dmark firestorm extreme preset saw
sixty percent lower score on the 860 m
model or the newer 970 m and the same
trend continues with Unigine heaven
benchmarked with 61 percent lower score
on the 860 m firing up some games it is
pretty impressive the frame rates we're
getting on the x7 pro and the difference
between the Pro and the v2 is still
pretty much double the performance on
the 970 m with extremely satisfying
results of course you could reduce the
graphical settings on the 860 m machine
for smoother frame rate as far as
temperature the 970 m ran a bit harder
on both GPUs just a few degrees but not
a big deal but the CPU is much cooler at
load hovering at around 90 degrees
Celsius versus the 98 Celsius that we
saw on the x7 v 2 heat signatures on the
two machines are practically identical
as it is the same fan and cooler design
but it looks like the fan profile on the
x7 pro is a bit more efficient to cool
that GPU and one of the advantages of
the earlier x7 v2 model is the drive
capacity and speed as the raid 0 array
is set up with 3m SATA drives versus the
2 on the x7 pro giving a slight speed
advantage to the v2 plus the included
one terabyte drive is awesome for
storage and the last thing to test was
the battery life and see if Maxwell
architecture the improvement in that
architecture comes into play both have
the same
73 want our battery and as it turns out
the x7 pro lasted a whole 41 minutes
longer and based on all of these results
the significant improvement of max will
architecture really shines through this
comparison the frame rates you get with
the 970m in SLI on such a thin machine
is how the obsession starts with having
so much mobile power this is true
desktop replacement type performance and
well that is it for this video I think
it's so much for watching make sure to
subscribe for more similar content and
give us a like if you were as impressed
with the performance increase on the 9th
900 series cards over the previous 800
series Maxwell GPUs so I thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
