great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Huracan acts and the Ora's gaming brand
is something new but they have already
made their name known with the extremely
thin and powerful gaming notebooks like
the x3 and the x7 so it's only a matter
of time until they saturate their
product line with gaming peripherals to
complement the rest of their offerings
so on the review table today we've got
the Thunder m7 and MMO style Mouse
retailing for $89 and because we already
have so many outstanding mice on the
market you can check out our top five
mice here it might be difficult for
horas brand to wow us / although it does
come with a carry pouch so how was the
last time your mouse came with a carry
pouch that unfortunately will never be
used in the history of mice now starting
with the form the Thunderer m7 is fairly
compact and given the tall nature of the
body this would be more ideal for claw
grip this compared to my daily driver
the pnei of 7000 you can see how the fur
with the m7 having a more narrow form ie
not as much support for your ring and
pinky fingers and this support on the
side is built out of transparent piece
that reveals a little bit of the
internals you know mimicking sort of in
this engine showcase and I don't mind it
but I wish it was slightly wider for
additional support thumb support is
present with just a small dimple inside
the body that houses the thumb pretty
well actually but without any grippy or
rubber surface it's all plastic
also notice the dual plastic texture on
top of the surface with the right-click
feeling slightly less refined and more
coarse than the left portion of the body
now Oris
certainly pimped out the mouse with
plenty of bling first with the
illuminated headlights that are only
visible from the front and stay blue you
cannot change the color then this
transparent window on the top of the
body revealing internal illumination
that is color matched to the scroll
wheel and the angle and position of this
lit up Oris is so that it's visible when
using the mouse pretty cool actually now
let's talk about the buttons since this
is targeted for MMO users the primary
left and right click are quite light
easy to press with
last actuations the scrollwheel is non
textured it's non rubberized and would
really loose scroll steps with extremely
heavy middle-click so not very impressed
here the DPI changes right behind with
four levels but regardless of the grip
they are so far down the body it makes
it really difficult to reach so you need
to readjust your entire grip to shift
your dpi levels not very intuitive it
favors claw grip more so that's one
advantage but still not pleasant to use
there's a profile button on the right
side for your ring finger that has zero
tactile actuation and is really simple
to accidentally press this was very
common throughout my testing after
having spent some time configuring my
profile only to realize I've switched
the profile some time ago and need to
cycle through to get back to my correct
profile and finally let's shift our
focus onto this entire array of buttons
on the left side two of which are easily
accessible with your point finger that
offer clicky feedback good job and six
buttons for your thumb that are shaped
to complement the form and thumb
location as you can see the rear buttons
thin out but I was actually surprised to
find great reach for all six buttons
with light and click actuations
so it doesn't affect your grip when in
use
the cable on the Thunderer m7 is braided
but it is very tough and kinks are
difficult to deal with but there is a
velcro strap to deal with any excess
length and the logo on the tip for
easier distinction coming around to the
bottom we find three glide feet that
have not peeled head during testing and
proved sufficient for smooth surface
interaction and a set of replacement
Teflon feet is included now for tracking
we have an infrared laser sensor with
dpi range up to 8200 with my usual 800
dpi setting I had no issues with
tracking accurately and it was just a
matter of the grip that didn't fully
satisfy my large hand and moving on to
the software or definitely needs to
improve this as everything is in tiles
and not really intuitive requiring you
to constantly scroll to find the correct
button and macro commands or whatever
the five default profiles are somewhat
configured already you can click on each
button to view additional options that
covers the basics plus you have the
media controls which is nice going into
key mapping the entire keyboard is here
basically as well with numbers letters
even the F keys and the numpad along
with shift control and end your alts and
finally the macro tab where you select
your recorded macros and macro manager
is pretty straightforward you just
record your desired execution rename it
and there you go under the settings you
can disable and change color of each
profile plus enable breeding effect of
the LEDs standard sensitivity controls
for the four dpi levels per axis is
available you can set how many lines one
scroll step execute change your polling
rate clean your built-in memory to
restore to you know your original state
as profiles and macros are all saved
directly on the mouse and finally you
can adjust the brightness of the
headlights which is a little bit
pointless is you can never see them and
so in conclusion this is very much
targeted and built for claw grip and for
individuals with small hands and they
have to give them the excellent button
layout on the left side for all the
extra commands for you know what this is
designed for
MMO gaming how our dpi shaped buttons
are poorly located with difficult access
regardless of the grip and profile
switch button on the right side is
really easy to accidentally press with
zero clicky feedback scroll wheel is
alright but nowhere near what you would
expect for this price range and all the
thunder m7 you know it's not terrible it
doesn't particularly excel in any
category either and while that concludes
this review of the Auris thunder m7
