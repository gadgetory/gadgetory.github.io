compact enclosure that is space
efficient because I'm not running in SLI
I'm not using mechanical spinning discs
I just want a nice efficient cooler
single GPU bunch of SSDs and the power
supply that fits it's this nice compact
package but it's also about space
efficiency because I moved away from
having mid towers and full towers beside
my you know my desk and stuff because
having this tiny little enclosure here
that is super powerful without any
compromises is awesome and today that
case changes looks like customs have
gracefully opened the package for me
thank you for ruining the unboxing
experience and ripping this whole box
open come on this my friends is the
street comm that
and so this case is all about a style
this is what's three cameras known for
with their aluminum designs nice compact
form factor - I think it's slightly
smaller than my eighth one from in wind
and also having a modular interior
design it's not necessarily needed for
an ITX form factor because you have so
little room to work with but it is there
regardless so you do have the
flexibility of mounting your motherboard
and mounting all your other components
in a non-traditional way that is a
possibility
all right so let's check it out right
this it's time to join the RGB Club with
team group delta SSD with gorgeous
addressable or standard RGB illumination
with simple connectivity in the huge
lighting area to spice up your system
with some color check out the team group
delta SSD down below man what an
experience for the system is now
assembled I have successfully replaced
the in with a one with the street come
tattoo and the experience was
satisfactory obviously when it's over
because ITX is always challenging
especially when you're dealing with
something that you know with the
components that you normally would not
put in such a confined space but once
it's all finished and it looks beautiful
in my space you do appreciate and
there's a nice sense of accomplishment
when the whole thing is complete and
pretty much all ITX enclosures have some
form of challenges for assembly process
and hardware compatibility and streak um
tattoo is not an exception and before I
proceed check out the description below
for all the links for parts and
alternatives for awesome ITX systems so
this case is coming from streak um a
company that brought us the DB for a
fantastic fanless cube aluminum gorgeous
art piece of an enclosure while the two
is more targeted towards a little bit
more towards mainstream but still kind
of like confined to that niche target
because of the price point at over $200
so it is competing with the likes of Dan
case and many other you know a similar
size and approach in terms of this
beautiful aluminum
elegance that you would normally not be
able to get with a standard ITX
enclosure and that's okay because
variety is awesome and so if you're just
thinking of building an ITX system this
is most likely not for you but if you're
thinking of doing something special that
is kind of part of your space it's not
just there to house components then you
kind of you know you have many options
and the street home is one of them now
design wise it is simple and elegant
nice symmetrical approach to perforation
and the curves top and bottom left and
right side so it's quite awesome but
putting it beside like a gaming router
you can see the striking difference
while putting it on a shelf as a
showcase piece makes more sense the one
thing that is kind of a double-edged
sword for me is the front IO I
appreciate the simplicity of it with a
simple power button and a type C port
however the type C is not gen - it's
still gen one speeds and I actually
don't have any type C accessories to
plug into that so that's kind of an
unfortunate thing where I cannot use the
IO over here and have to resort to my
standard USB ports on a motherboard for
any connection there and so while we all
want the type C implementation to really
spread when it's just type C you know
connection that is a compromise where
you cannot plug any of you USB
accessories unless you have a dongle so
it looks like we approach the dongle
life for the desktop looking at the back
this is the only place where you can
find the actual model name we have two
PCI slots and a 92 millimeter fan mount
okay so the side panel mount is pretty
neat because as you can see they don't
use any thumb screws for design purposes
instead these side panels are almost
pressure mounted so you push on one of
the corners at the top and pull one in
the corners at the bottom one at a time
and then this the side panel simply
comes off they have rubber pegs on all
four corners to help with that pressure
point and to absorb any vibrations if
there are any so this mount is awesome
because it's functional and it's super
easy to do and it also helps with the
whole design thing but also I appreciate
that the panels are totally refined
you're handling like almost you know
really hard edges on the aluminum but
everything is nice and smooth
it's not sharp so I'm not worried about
cutting myself open reinstallation by
the way is just going in Reverse put the
top ones in first and then nice
now moving inside you can really
appreciate Street comms totally
different approach to mounting your
hardware using universal brackets and
they've taken this from their previous
enclosures and really refined it here so
we have two Universal brackets
horizontal and vertical and they can be
used to attach anything like up to 180
millimeter fans single hard drive or
multiple hard drives SSD or multiple
SSDs again and that gives you like a lot
of flexibility in terms of what you can
populate inside there without needing
additional like specifically tailored
SSD caddies or hard drive caddies
because you know with simple to
universal brackets you can do a lot with
them and the cool thing about the
universal brackets is how they're
mounted to the frame so there's a rail
system on both the top and the bottom
that attaches to the universal brackets
with a nut and a screw so that's how
it's being held in there's also a little
cutout here so you can remove one of the
nuts
so it's pretty cool because it gives you
that total flexibility on exactly where
the universal bracket is attached it's
not necessarily locked to a certain
position because of that entire rail
system both on both sides actually that
works with both the vertical ones and
horizontal two furthermore we have this
additional power supply and drive cage
bracket that is further attached on more
of these Universal brackets so you there
again modular so with the drive cage for
example you can install multiple SSDs on
there without occupying any of the other
Universal brackets and that's for the
power supply here you can mount an SFX
or NSF X L power supply without
interfering with that drive bracket or
you can go full out with an ATX power
supply I would definitely recommend
sticking with a smaller power supply
unit so you can have more room for
radiators beside the motherboard more
room for those SSDs because with the ATX
power supply mountain in there it
basically occupies that entire chunk of
the front section which means no
radiators that are larger than 140
it means no SSDs and it also limits your
GPU compatibility depending on the power
supply length and the cables exiting at
the bottom so you have about 8 inches
for GPU clearance with this type of
power supply unless you're going with
something really short that would allow
for the GPU to span across so recommend
the power supply length is 140
millimeters that would allow you to span
a GPU at the bottom now I'm sure many
people will be interesting doing custom
loops and here especially because you
can mount a 280 millimeter radiator on
the side which is awesome and having
those Universal brackets and having that
high flexibility allows you to position
the braid either slightly higher so it
does not interfere with your GPU or
select a lower depending on where your
power supply and SSD sit so flexibility
is definitely there especially when
you're dealing with something of so
compact size that any additional
millimeter or centimeter of clearance in
either direction is definitely going to
be helpful and with a 280 rod installed
it does block the rear fan mount which
is unfortunate but it's kind of cool to
see this type of hardware support in
such a tight compact enclosure the one
thing that threw me off completely Ito
are the screws which are not magnetic so
they completely fall out and they don't
attach to your screwdriver so just keep
that in mind as for those filtration
there's one large filter on the side
that can be moved to the other side
because it is magnetic so that would
depend on your hardware configuration
and also top and the bottom are also
covered the earth sandwich between two
acrylic pieces one thinner at the top
that can bend easier so you have to kind
of press it from the inside so it bends
and the clips pop out but as I was doing
it I guess I was not doing it the right
way but the little low beam on both the
front and the back
snapped now my initial idea for the
system swap was to keep all my
components the same but unfortunately
the dot 2 is thinner so the CPU height
our clearance is lower so in this case I
can you know fit the dark rock 3 no
problem or s with the dot - it's not
gonna fit I can only fit 145 millimeters
for the CPU tower clearance so my next
choice was to go with this knocked or
9l it's pretty beefy but I'm oral
clocking my 80 600 K which is why I've
decided to just go all-in in terms of
coolant compatibility inside of that too
and just stick without maximum 280
million radiator support with the X 62
from NZXT and it's definitely going to
be tighten them especially my tight neck
speed but because I'm using an XFX
L power supply it is thinner so there's
plenty of space inside the case
hopefully for all the components as they
advertise and I think right now we
should start with the assembly process
and during the assembly I noticed that
one of the motherboard standoffs was
misaligned to the motherboard itself and
that kind of highlights the nature of
the modularity of these Universal
brackets because using a hex screw which
is not included by the way I was able to
loosen it up a bit and realign the
Universal bracket to the motherboard and
I was on my way the cool thing about
this enclosure as well is that you can
invert the motherboard layout so
removing the screws in the back and
rotating that plate and also relocating
the universal brackets to the other side
for motherboard mounting so you can have
an inverted motherboard layout and so
here is my system installed without the
radiator for now so you can see the guts
of the build everything is fine it is
very tight near the power supply area I
am using an SFX L power supply there's
140 millimeters in length but because of
the modular cables add like additional
two centimeters in there and it does
press on the GPU at the backside which
is you know it's it's fine but you can
see the GPU is slightly angled because
of it the one thing to keep in mind is
that power cord extension right in the
center of the motherboard the good thing
is it does not interfere with the GPU
but it might interfere with like a wider
CPU tower so just keep that in mind it's
not an ITX case if it's not a
challenging build so I was almost
finished everything is routed my GPUs
installed my drives are in there as if I
power supply but as I was about to mount
my 280 rather than there I realized that
I have to diverge from that original
plan not because the actual radiator
doesn't fit everything is fine but the
tubing interferes with the SSDs because
this is exactly where the tubing exits
now the thing is I could remove the SSDs
but because they are kind of in the same
bracket as the power supply I have to
redo my entire wiring remove this
bracket via you know these clips over
here and that's just not convenient so
instead of redoing that entire thing
let's just populate a slightly smaller
240 rad on the side and that should fit
because I have a bit more high clearance
so I can maneuver those tubing where it
exits in this section over here instead
of to being like really high up on top
here and after swapping out the 280 rad
for 240 rad I still was not able to
mount the tubing exiting from the front
near the SSDs because they just
interfered over there unless I remove
the SSDs but I was still able to mount
it with the radiator and tubing near the
backside and because the tubes here are
much shorter versus what I had on the X
60 tube they they can bend no problem as
long as you rotate the block accordingly
so the tubes are exiting in the
appropriate position now just to be the
biggest troll I was going to populate a
bunch of RGB hardware inside because in
the manual which is awesome by the way
they say RGB lighting seriously No so I
was going to install these two
Thermaltake ring fans because their RGB
is absolutely gorgeous on both sides and
because this perforation panel you'll
definitely be able to see some that
shine right through but the problem
however are the cables and the cable
here so long that I was worried that you
know it would just cause me a lot more
trouble in terms of routing everything
and especially because these fans have
their own hub which is awesome for an
ATX enclosure or something bigger but
when we're dealing with something this
compact these really didn't fit I was
also going to mount the leonie streamer
cables which is that 24 RGB cable which
looks fantastic and also would deliver
that beautiful RGB spill on the interior
but the 24 pin cable is just so close to
my power supply that there's absolutely
no way I was able to route that RGB
cable and so the only RGB component I've
settled with was the team group
Excalibur Ram because it is absolutely
gorgeous with that RGB stuff I can
control it with my Asus software and
it's running it super fast
3,600 megahertz and streak ohm is going
to be releasing an additional TG panel
so if you are after that beautification
element of your interior components the
TG panel will suit that type of RGB
direction nicely now as for cooling
performance of course having that raid
leader inside the enclosure and all
those components being in close
proximity of each other and not having
that much airflow to breathe is a
significant hit on cooling over 10
degrees Celsius versus when the radiator
is outside the case but still I'm
getting better temperatures versus what
I was getting on the a1 with an air
cooler so I'm pretty happy and so when
it's all said and done you know I'm
gonna tie back to my original point of
that working with any ITX case
introduces its own set of challenges and
data to my main sort of critique is with
the mounting of the SSDs on a drive
bracket because that bracket is attached
to the other bracket for the power
supply and then let's say removing one
of the SSDs requires you to remove that
entire thing and that's just a lot of
work for simple swap of drives and that
could be mitigated by using one of the
universal brackets potentially for your
drives instead of using the drive
bracket that is attached to the power
supply bracket and you kind of have to
plan your build accordingly in case like
if you have to replace one of the
components what is gonna be needed to be
removed first as well but you know many
people prioritize on one the case looks
like inside your space and it looks
absolutely gorgeous
it's a elegant system and it looks
awesome in my space it's not too big it
still packs in the 80 600k a nice cooler
Titan XP you know lots of ram in there
lots of SSD storage and that is exactly
what you would expect
from an ITX system that is targeted for
these like enthusiast builds I still
miss my regular USB ports in the front
you know it looks awesome here but I am
never going to use it because actually I
probably will have to buy a dongle and I
will say that having the radiator
exhausting air from this left side is
awesome for winter because I can feel
the warm air but that is one good
alternative to having the inverted
motherboard layout if you want to have
the exhaust on the other side and
looking back in the entire assembly
procedure I wish that that interior
frame was able to just come off from the
aluminum shell that is outside giving
you so many more access points for
cables and working that isn't so
claustrophobic feeling when you're
looking at tiny little shell and access
you know from both sides but having
access from the top and bottom as well
would be so much more convenient the
Newmark two coarser strafe and k70
keyboards are fully loaded with custom
illumination convenient media buttons
USB pass-through extra set of key camps
and economic rest rest for each keyboard
so you can type or game comfortably with
a variety of MX switches available so
you can check out which keyboard suits
you best in the description below
and so that is it for my system for now
I am doing a dual build very soon so
stay tuned for that but for now let me
know what you think of the streak of the
two if it's something that you guys are
interested in and yes it is an expensive
enclosure that's challenging to build
but the priority here I'm guessing would
be that flexibility of mounting your
hardware as long as you know how to
approach it and what type of you know
components you'll be using most likely
just avoid any SSDs just stick with and
the two drives SFX or SFX L power
supplies but yeah let me know what you
think of this entire building experience
