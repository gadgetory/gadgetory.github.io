thanks for the following sponsors show
them some love for helping us get here
to Taipei so Nvidia is really pushing
hard this computex season with so many
announcements and really cool things
with VR the 980 TI launched marked not
only a step closer to proper 4k gaming
on a single card but this GPU will
enable more demanding VR applications to
flourish and Nvidia's GeForce experience
was an awesome indication of just how
close we are to amazing VR experiences
so first things first g-sync has made
its way into gaming notebooks and that's
right g-sync is now on mobile and that's
so exciting as g-sync is a perfect fit
for mobile gaming machines where
triple-a titles are very demanding on
mobile GPUs and you might encounter
stutter and most annoyingly tearing so
there are many partners that join this
push including msi asus ARS and gigabyte
the panels will be 75 hurts so finally
we're seeing higher refresh rate than 60
on mobile and you no longer need the
g-sync module installed inside the
machine as the GPU communicates directly
with the panel and we've waited a while
for this now we can bump in the game
settings and experience much smoother
gameplay the technology is built into
the GPU directly and NVIDIA has a
certification process through which they
guarantee a smooth gaming experience
where g-sync on mobile might become the
standard next is invidious game works vr
something they are really interested in
and letting the 980 TI push for
advancement in VR applications they've
developed multi rest shaders that allows
the edge pixels of an image that's
rendered for a VR headset to be rendered
at the lower resolution while keeping
the center when your eyes are focused in
perfect quality and we've spoken with
Tom Peterson where he discusses the
advantages of multi Raiders okay so what
we're looking here at Demetria is a new
piece of technology that we call multi
reading and what multi red shading does
is it allows us to take advantage of
the way vr works to improve performance
that's pretty easy to understand it
starts off with you got to look inside
the headset and there's actually lenses
inside the headset and what they're
there for is to change the focal
distance so if you imagine if you didn't
have lenses you'd be looking at a screen
that's basically three inches in front
of your face and it'd be really
fatiguing and very hard to focus and see
things so by having the lenses that
actually moves the focal distance out
and your eyes can relax and you can
actually focus without like dialing down
your eyes to a three inch distance now
because of those lenses it actually
distorts what's seen on the screen and
so what we have to do on the GPU is to
sort of anti distort and that's what
this pic this demo is showing you this
image up here is what a GPU would render
it's nice and square all the lines are
straight but if you look down here this
is the image that's actually going on to
the screen in the headset and the reason
it's all kind of rounded out and
distorted is because remember there's
going to be a optic that sits in front
of this between your eye and so that
optic actually reedus towards it and
makes it straight again now because of
that it becomes very clear that this
picture is bigger than that picture and
what's happening is during that
distortion certain pixels are being sort
of de-emphasized because there's there's
only so much screen real estate and if
you distort things you effectively lose
information so with multi very shady
what we've done is said okay if we're
going to distort it and lose information
anyway might as well do that upfront and
actually never overspend effort and
render pixels of Duncan scene so that's
what I'm showing you on the right on the
right is a little image that represents
what we call multi-bear shading that's a
little hard to see I'm going to go ahead
and use the headset and I'm going to go
and turn it on okay so now the headset
is controlling the display and what's
interesting is if you look over here in
the light let me reset that real quick
to get car me alive
okay so if I move the head set up and
down what you're actually seeing is this
weird sort of fracture that's because
this edge is being rendered at a lower
resolution than the center okay and so
because we're spending less effort to
render the edges we can improve
performance and then when we take this
image and rework it you can't see any
difference so the idea is the
combination of being aware that most of
the time you're focused in the center
and the fact that there's a lens there
that's going to warp this image back to
your iris you can actually do
intelligent things and using this
technology we think we can save around
fifty percent of the pixel load for for
VR now one of the coolest demos that we
played a geforce experience was with
Hydra CCP the guys who brought us EVE
Online where they are using the Kinect
to scan your body and when inside the VR
you actually see your body when you look
down and you see your hands and
everything is scaled pretty much one to
one and whenever an anomaly enters your
Kinect space they start to glow orange
so other people feel like they're out of
matrix and this was the first time you
actually feel like your body and other
people around you are in this virtual
world eibar and i played this
multiplayer the tron discs where you
actually had to throw with one hand and
block with the other it was amazing
because I saw eber on the other side of
the room in front of me and he was
rendered to scale and the work these
companies are doing with VR is just
amazing allowing your body to actually
interact with objects in VR world so
there was a blocks demo where you can
punch or kick the blocks with incredible
accuracy where even the speed of body
movement translates so well into the
force applied onto the object you
couldn't pick up the boxes yet and move
them around but that is something in the
works perhaps build your own fort but
getting such a high accuracy for your
own body interacting with virtual
objects is something incredibly cool and
finally we get to see a Mac demo with d
x 12.1 features powered by the gtx 980
TI that showed some incredible graphics
with interactive smoke
effects so when the robot was walking
around the smoke particles would bounce
around based on the robot location
lighting reflections that takes into
account surface texture and surfers
direction with beautiful rendering of
light and how it interacts with
everything when he fires his weapon and
how even the color output of the source
changes the color of the shadows and the
light bounce and also realistic shadows
that are not just blurred out but
everything is taken into account like
the distance from the light source
shower of displacement shadow color
depth and just the amount of things the
GPU has to take care of in this mag demo
scene is amazing and we really can't
wait to see the x 12.1 features roll out
with actual games something inferior is
really proud of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
