axe and welcome back to another video
AMD's rising thread Ripper in nineteen
fifty X this is their top-of-the-line
CPU cost a thousand dollars and I'm
pretty sure most of you might be
reluctant to spend that kind of money on
a processor unless if you're not
power-hungry for 16 cores you know I
thought to myself now that rising 3 is
an excellent option for people who are
just looking to casually game at 1080p
when you build a system a compact based
system for the same amount as the 1950 X
$1000 so I did that and here's what it
looks like but before we move onto the
parts list and the benchmarks and force
my experience with the build here's a
quick message from our sponsor it's time
to try something new with the K 900m
mechanical keyboard by Zalman with Cael
brown switches on board macro recordings
and absolutely gorgeous
RGB illumination with the white frame
even your dog will go nuts check it out
in the description below if you're
looking for more information on the new
rising 3 CPUs aka
new 1300 X and the 1200 we'll leave a
link to our performance review video as
well as a written article that's on our
website in the description down below
let's kick things off with the CPU
that's going inside this build the
rising 3 1300 X it's a quad core quad
threaded processor priced at $130 and it
offers the best bang for your buck for
one it's got a base clock of 3.5
gigahertz and a boost of a particular
point 7 and you can easily overclock
this thing to 4 gigahertz no problem and
we'll talk about that momentarily AMD
does include a rate stealth CPU cooler
to complement this chip and that's what
we'll be using to cool the 1300 X I
didn't go for an aftermarket solution
simply because I was strictly on a
budget of about $1100 and this is
including the operating system plus it's
actually a great way to test how well
the stock cooler could handle
overclocking inside a compact case
housing the CPU and cooler is the
gigabyte a B 350 and gaming Wi-Fi ITX
motherboard it's priced at $150 and it's
actually one of our first ITX based be
350 boards that we've taken a look at I
mean we did give a little glance at it
back at topic
a lot of you guys were interested to see
how well this would fit inside a compact
system so here it is now the board is
pretty much packed with features like
built-in RGB lighting and nvme and two
slots at the back that you could
seriously take advantage of if you're
into fast storage the dual channel
memory modules can support up to 32
gigabytes of ddr4 memory there are two
USB 3.1 gen2 type it parts at the we are
IO for faster storage expansion
you also get Intel's 802 dot 11 dual
band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 which is
awesome
but there is a huge caveat that you
should be aware of here take a closer
look at this board for instance notice
anything weird about the connector
layout now first time builders might not
recognize it right away but having built
numerous systems for the channel I found
the placement of the 24 pin connector
the USB 3.1 header SATA ports front
panel power and reset pins and even the
four pin CPU connector have been odd now
traditional ATX or even micro ATX
motherboards have these connectors
shifted 90 degrees meaning the CPU 4 pin
would be placed at the top the 24 pin
along with the USB 2 upon 1 header and
SATA ports are located right beside the
memory modules and the rest at the
bottom
in fact many cases have been designed to
properly route cables to these
connectors for a more simple and cleaner
look this gigabyte board will definitely
give you a tough time with cable
management so be well prepared for
memory I chose g.skill ripjaws 16
gigabyte ddr4 kit clocked at 2400
megahertz now memory prices have
increased quite a lot since the last
time I built a mini ITX PC we're talking
a $30.00 increase for the exact same
ranking so now we're looking at around
$130 that's a huge jump in price guys
needless to say there should be a pretty
good option for gaming as we've
conducted multiple tests comparing 16
verses 32 versus 64 so if you're
interested in that comparison I'll leave
a link to that video in the description
down below as for the case so still
hooked us up with their new RV zo 3 slim
form factor chassis if you recall there
the wave in series of cases this is
their third iteration to that lineup and
they've included a cool feature this
time built in RGB lighting
friends it's a great implementation in
my opinion because you can color match
it to the rest of your setup and as a
bonus the gigabyte board comes with a
four pin RGB header so lighting controls
can be done through a gigabytes fusion
software although be prepared to justify
its $110 price tag from a physical
standpoint nothing much has changed from
the previous our VCO 2 case that Dmitry
reviewed a while back other than the
front panel design shift the interior is
sporting the same layout but silverstone
decided to eliminate support for a three
and a half inch hard drive and I found
that to be really odd which brings me to
my next point
storage I chose the OC GTL 100 240
gigabyte SSD as my primary boot drive
and for my most used applications to
expand the game library I had to take
the hit for slower rpms because a I was
on a strict budget and be 2 and a half
inch hard drives was the only option to
go with since this case lacks support
for 18 a half inch hard drive so I
decided to go with Seagate's one
terabyte 5400 rpm 2 and a half inch hard
drive now expect longer game load times
when you go for a hard drive that expect
at 5400 rpm but there are a few ones in
the solutions that you could opt for one
is that you can eliminate the dual drive
setup and go for an all-in-one solution
so like a high capacity SSD that can
host your operating system and your game
library but again take into account and
higher capacity SSDs are still
ridiculously expensive so you can
definitely go over the 1100 of a budget
the other option is to go for
Silverstone's our vzo 2 case because
that case comes with support for a
community I think I'll Drive but the
downside to that case is that it does
not come with RGB lighting so if that's
not a deal-breaker to you then by all
means now also the best part of the
build the GPU and this was a tough
choice I picked the EVGA GTX 1060 super
clock video card simply because it was
the least expensive bang for your buck
solution but it also happened to be
readily available which can't be said
for many graphics cards these days now
I'm completely aware of the mining
situation where gamers have to pay a lot
more for GPUs than what they would
normally do due to demand and in some
cases it seemed hard to find GPUs in
stock in online stores or even local
stores it's
a huge crisis point for gamers I'm not
sure how to address this issue or I'm
not sure how companies are going to
address this problem but I'd like to
hear your thoughts about this where is
mining going to go and how is that gonna
affect gamers looking forward to the
responses powering the whole system is
the silverstone SD 45s f small
form-factor psu with an 80 plus bronze
certification and it retailed for about
$60 there should be plenty enough to
power the 1300 x and the gtx 1060 plus
it's also super quiet during idle and
load operations so here's the final
build I think it turned out pretty well
I mean from a physical standpoint the
only thing that shines through this PC
is that RGB lighting at the front it's
very subtle and I love the way how it
looks like I mentioned before lighting
can be controlled through the gigabytes
fusion app and there are different
effects that users can pick you can go
all out if you so desire however I'm not
that happy with the cable management
inside the chassis it's just a mess guys
and I tried my best to make it look
nicer but the layout on the motherboard
was just too hard to overcome it's one
of the downsides if you're planning to
go mini ITX so be aware of the
compromises solar Stone has included
magnetic dust filters and a couple of
120 millimeter slim fans for good
airflow so that's welcoming to see on
$110.00 chassis so here's a closer look
at the parts list for the build along
with the operating system the total
price rounds up to about $1,100 without
any sales taken into account but there
are a few things that I need to mention
the inclusion of the operating system is
important since Windows 10 home eats up
$120 of our budget that could have been
spent on other things if you already
have a Windows license then I'd suggest
putting that money towards an
aftermarket cooler and maybe a GPU
upgrade or even step things up to
horizon 5 1600 CPU another thing to
point out is that I'm actually using
average retail prices for every
components rather than some vague
suggestion BTL price with that being
said it is crazy to see how component
prices have shot up in the last few
months just take the SSD the memory and
the GPU into account this bill cost me
$200 and more than what it would have
been back in May so let's switch gears
and talk about overclocking because I
had a very interesting experience with a
1300 X 2 star cooler and
gigabyte b250 motherboard so I started
with four gigahertz unfortunately I
wasn't able to do or I was able to get a
full successful boot with that setting
and then I tone it down to three point
nine I ran to the bench multi-core and
the three mark firestrike test got is
significantly higher score than the
stock settings so that was awesome
but I ran the premier Pro 4k render test
and the system just crashed about
halfway through rendering that video
then I turned on the settings 23.8 and I
ran the Cinebench multi-core test along
with the fire stripe test I got a
slightly lower score than what I got
with the Q point 90 yards overclock but
surprisingly I ran the premiere pro
render test and it passed no problem the
last thing I did to ensure stability at
3.8 gigahertz was to run the item 64
stress test and disappointingly or I
guess the sad news was that the system
crashed about 30 minutes into the test
and I we voted the system open to beta
and noticed that the CP temperatures got
at 95 see it almost reached 95 C so I
guess the CPU cooler was the bottom like
with this overclock so ultimately I left
the settings that stock and I just ran
the benchmarks so here are the results
Cinebench r15 in the multi-core test
dished out around 544 points whereas
OpenGL scored roughly 81 frames per
second our standard one-minute 4k video
using Premiere Pro CC 2017 took three
minutes and ten seconds to complete and
as you can see that's how well it did
compared to my previous bills and my
workstation PC
this isn't geared towards content
creators although you're more than
welcome to upgrade 2005 or even lives in
seven down the road provided you figured
out the cooling situation CPU
temperatures were respectable out of the
box the 1300 X ran about 36 see during
idle and under load it was reaching
about 66 degrees not bad for a stock
cooler actually now on to gaming
battlefield 1 at 1080p set to high
averaged around 83 frames per second
overwatch at NDP Center Ultra averaged
well over 150 frames per second Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon which is a slightly
more demanding title taxed out on the
GTX 1060 at 1080p set to high settings I
was averaging just a tad above 60 frames
per second
finally do my 1080p set to ultra
did really well averaging around a
hundred games per second so overall
you're looking at a really capable
gaming PC for 1080p gaming and in some
cases you could push it to 1440p but be
mindful of the settings the gtx 960
super clock was idling around 48 c and
during gaming it reached a max of 74
degrees celsius it's not too bad for GP
of the size and surprisingly the core
speed went all the way up to 1962
megahertz and this was during the Ghost
Recon benchmark say goodbye to tables
it's time to enjoy wireless audio with
the Corsair avoid RGB gaming headset
with the light and comfortable frame low
profile mic on headset volume control
and my kneeled + dual side illumination
check out the void RGB by Corsair the
perfect way to hear your game well there
you have it guys a mini ITX rising PC
for $1,100 I know a lot of you guys
might not agree with my component
selections here but again I'd like to
hear your thoughts on alternatives for
example the CPU of the stock cooler
didn't really make any sense for the
budget but one of the downsides to going
mini ITX is that the cost obviously
increases for example the case we get
expensive many ATX motherboards are also
expensive so again that's one of the
factors that you'll have to take into
consideration but nonetheless I'd like
to hear your thoughts on the performance
that I was able to get out of this PC
also stay tuned for more bills featuring
X $2.99 perhaps X $2.99 I really don't
know but the rest of 2017 looks really
promising so I'm just gonna leave it
there
