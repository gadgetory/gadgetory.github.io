great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry and today we're
taking a look at the Razer Kraken in
black now there's also a green version
too which looks like something out of a
toy store so we're happy to see a
grownup version of the headphone the
Krakens on average are priced around $60
which is decent for a pair of stereo
headphones considering we have 40
millimeter drivers and perience of 32
ohms so you don't require an amp to run
these and frequency range from 20 to
20,000 Hertz sensitivity wise the
Krakens can reach 110 DB which is plenty
loud so no issues in that department in
the box you get an extension cable and
the usual razer documentation the cable
is non removable and connects through a
regular 3.5 millimeter jack from the
first glance the Kraken seems to be an
open headphone because of the grill on
the ear cup but make no mistake this is
a closed ear headphone they provide a
good amount of noise isolation so you're
not disturbed and don't disturb others
as there is almost no audio leaked when
it comes to build quality the Krakens
are well built the joints feel robust
and there is no cracking plastic while
being very flexible the ear cups have a
good amount of tilt and swivel action
going on for a better fit and they also
fold inside for a more compact travel
and while it's all plastic we're happy
how Nick Krakens feel also a 293 grams
these are fairly lightweight and once
broken in we had no issues with using
these for extended periods of time the
headband has sort of a breathable
material but most of the weight is
concentrated in the ear cups themselves
so the Krakens turned out to be quite
comfortable now are these the most
comfortable headphones in the world as
razer health self acclaimed absolutely
not you cannot claim such a title with
audio experts like Sennheiser great oh
sure bar dynamic and audio technica to
name a few
the actual hear cup is plenty soft and
provides a good amount of cushion but
the actual driver isn't deep enough and
that is an issue as my ears would make
contact with the flat surface of the
driver now given these are closed head
I was actually quite surprised to find
that these headphones breathe which
means they don't make you ear sweat as
much as they may appear to do so all
right now on to audio quality these were
left to burn it for 24 hour period with
a good mix of Earth Wind &amp;amp; Fire Mumford
and Sons and their very talented ronald
jenkees paired up with my Asus DX sound
card upon putting the Krakens on you
immediately feel the bass as that is one
of the built-in enhancements it is very
rich and deep and the highs are crisp
but not too sharp the really major
problem here is the lack of any
distinguishable mid tones the Krakens
are very muddy in that regard I could no
longer hear very clear instrument
differentiation which was also partially
muffled by the rich bass fortran's house
and hip hop these would suffice as the
lows are well distinguished and the
tremble is better balanced than your
mid-tones when it came to gaming there
were two things I was looking for the
overall enjoyment of audio reproduction
and obviously to see how the Krakens
could handle positioning and
directionality the first I very much
enjoyed the sound of powerful gunfire
and explosions and all the chatter from
my teammates came through clearly
but the drowned mid-tones were a
complete letdown as we have music and
many other audio sources in the game and
when everything is joined together the
Krakens cannot provide a clear
separation between audio elements now
I'm a believer in good stereo headphones
for gaming and these just did not
deliver there is no good balance between
left and right drivers to pinpoint
location of your enemies the bottom line
is the soundstage is not at the gaming
level I mean they're OK for gaming they
provide rich bass and clear highs I like
the build quality and as long as you
wear them in comfort won't be concerned
however the major letdown with the
Kraken is the lack of balance between
the lows and the mids much of my music
selection sounded dull and unpleasant I
quite enjoyed the bass but when that's
all to it
the Krakens aren't going to crack my
wallet so we would like to know about
your audio setup what you use for gaming
for music leaving comments down below
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
