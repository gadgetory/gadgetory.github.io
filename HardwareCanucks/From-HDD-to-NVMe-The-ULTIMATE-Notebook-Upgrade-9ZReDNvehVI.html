connects and a few months back we teamed
up with Samsung to bring you guys a
guide on nvme MDOT - SSDs and how one
can significantly improve your creative
workflow especially if you're coming
from a slower spinning hard drive and
the results were phenomenal
in fact the upgrade process only took
roughly 10 minutes because we were using
the 960 process D and we're cloning the
existing hard drive or the existing data
on the hard drive - the 960 process D
and it was you know smooth super smooth
no hiccups or what not if you should
learn more about that you can check it
out right over here but today we're
performing the exact same process on a
notebook and that can get a little
tricky sometimes depending on how oh mmm
their warranty policy remember if your
laptop is still under warranty I would
highly recommend you check their
warranty guidelines in terms of user
upgrade ability most notebooks come with
a warranty void if remote sticker but
either way I would still you know make
sure that you're allowed to do this
before even running into any warrant
issues down the road another key factor
to consider is compatibility if you're
planning on upgrading at two or three
year old notebook it might not support
an nvme drive in fact it might not even
come with an m2 slot to support the
drive in that case upgrading to a SATA
base SSD might be worth taking a look at
since it features the exact same
interface as a spinning hard drive plus
if you find an extra two and a half inch
drive bay within the notebook you can
convert that hard drive to just manage
your data and make the SSD or primary
boot drive most modern laptops do come
with an m2 slot but that doesn't
automatically translate into nvme
support because it might only end up
supporting and m dot 2 SATA base SSDs
rather than nvme SSDs so once again I
would make sure to go through your OEM
website a double check compatibility and
then proceed towards you know getting
one of these insanely fast drives now
for the purpose of this video I'll be
using the eurocom q 5 gaming laptop
because it doesn't come with any
warranty restrictions in terms of
upgrade ability I should also mention
that if you're buying a notebook look
towards configuring it with a hard drive
rather than an nvme SSD but also make
sure that it comes with an nvme capable
slot this could save you a lot of money
from the usual system integrator markup
and you can later on by the nvme SSD
from a retail channel and
graded on your own it's not rocket
science folks but also make sure to
check the warranty guidelines I talked
about earlier in this case the q6 comes
with a standard two and half inch hard
drive and a free and dr. slot that
supports nvme drives now if you're
looking to upgrade to a SATA based SSD
like this
Samsung 850 Pro and if there aren't any
extra two and a half inch drive bays
within the notebook you can pick up a
USB 3.0 two SATA hard drive adapter and
clone the SSD before replacing the
existing hard drive or you could pick up
this blazing-fast 960 pro nvme SSD you
just pop it inside the notebook clone
the drive using Samsung's data migration
software and voila you have an insanely
fast boot drive for your applications
and you can set the hard drive to just
manage your data switching over to the
software side there are two ways that
you can install windows on the SSD the
first and easiest option is cloning your
existing hard drive to the SSD and that
can be done through Samsung's data
migration suffer it's free to download
you just have to make sure that you've
installed a Samsung based SSD the
process is fairly simple Samsung has
done a really good job of the UI so for
some users won't have a problem spotting
things and as you can see I chose my
source disk and then the target disc and
proceeded with the cloning process the
second way to approaching this is
performing a clean install of Windows
using a USB Drive
all you have to do is download the
Windows 10 installation media tool while
you're using the hard drive follow the
steps and boot into the USB and perform
a clean install of Windows on to your
new SSD alright so let's talk about
performance improvements and just so
you're aware I ran the same number of
tests on the 960 Pro nvme SSD and the
850 Pro SATA based SSD and the stock
spinning hard drive so how did the
drives do well all I can say is that
both the SATA and nvme SSDs were
incredibly faster than the hard drive
starting with the cold boot test a stock
drive took roughly 30 seconds to boot
into Windows while the nvme SSD took
roughly 14 seconds so that's half the
time when compared to the hard drive now
if you're a creative professional
upgrading to the 960 pro nvme SSD or
even the 850 proceeded base SSD might be
money well spent
here's why I did a quick test loading up
a Photoshop project that I worked on
recently and the stock hard drive took
two minutes to complete that task
whereas the 960 pro took 10 seconds to
get to the work and so did the 850 pro
as well same story goes for Premiere Pro
users both SSDs blaze through loading up
projects with the 960 Pro taking the
lead but man that stock hard drive is a
serious bottleneck plus that's a lot of
time saved if you're constantly working
on client projects and that requires
deadlines
I can guarantee you upgrading to an SSD
will make a world of difference my next
test involves zipping a 30 gigabyte
folder using WinRAR this folder contains
a ton of small files so it's a great way
to test random read and write
performance on the SSDs and as you can
see the results really do speak for
themselves the 960 Pro takes the lead by
just a few minutes when compared to the
850 Pro SSD but the stock drive is at
least 11 minutes behind to complete that
task but what about gaming well I was
excited to test Ghost Recon because for
one it's in graphically intensive title
and loading up a game along with
missions take a chunk of time so it's a
great way to test each drivers read
performance I started with the
discovering files test where the drive
fetches and validates game files and as
you can see the 960 pro takes the lead
here by 3 minutes when compared to the
850 Pro andthat's tanks to the insanely
fast 3.5 gigabytes per second
theoretical read speeds but check out
that stock hard drive it took about 30
minutes to complete the validations so
imagine performing the same tasks with
your larger Steam library the
performance improvements would be
significant moving on to the initial
game launch I threw another curveball at
this test by running the same
compression scenario in the background
and the 960 pro was only four seconds
faster than the 850 pro but the stock
drive took way more than four minutes to
get to the game loading of a mission
followed the same trend while there is a
significant difference between the 960
Pro nvme SSD and the 850 proceeded base
SSD the stock HDD doesn't even come
closer to those fast drives well there
you guys have it a quick user guide on
how to replace your existing hard drive
with an SSD you want an nvme pace SSD
remember I would highly recommend
checking your warranty guidelines before
um proceeding with any of these but if
there is a green signal if you're good
to go in that department there are two
options you could either go for a SATA
base SSD which is a lot more cheaper
than going with an nvme base drive but
if you really want the absolute
in terms of performance say if you're
working with 4k raw files when if you're
a video editor
I think the 960 Pro will come in really
handy because the theoretical read and
write performance on this guy is a lot I
mean a lot faster than this SATA base
SSD which is the Samsung 850 Pro so I'd
love to hear your thoughts on the
results would you consider upgrading to
a SATA base this is D or an nvme SSD on
your notebook let us know in the
comments down below huge shout out to
Samsung for sponsoring this video and of
course providing us with these drives
I meet with Harbach connects thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
