one pick up that phone Demetri
what's up lily yo you might want to sit
down for this one
it better be monitor related man okay so
it's a 34 inch ultra wide curved gaming
monitor I am listening
with support for free sync whoa keep
going and it comes with a hundred Hertz
refresh rate yeah you bet you too man
but you haven't heard the best part yet
the price it's $600 dude but it's got a
terrible stand though why
you can only rely on the pro to do the
job with every keystroke satisfying like
the millions before it
quality feel with every key regardless
of your space Kula master master keys
bro
take it with you make it yours well I
hope you enjoyed that little skit in the
beginning and if you were wondering I
was not joking about this monitor this
is the real deal guys what you're
looking at is the pixie opx 34-7 sea
prawn ultra wide curved gaming monitor
and what makes us unique compared to the
competition is its price at $600
that's cheap for an ultra wide gaming
monitor for instance this LG 34 you see
seventy-nine G 34 inch ultra wide costs
$700 it features a 2560 by 1080
resolution would support for free sink
and it comes at a refresh rate of 144
Hertz the Acer predator Z 35 that I just
reviewed recently costs $1100 but when
you look at the specs in compared to
pick seals offering they're almost
identical meaning they featured the
exact same 34 40 by 1440 resolution a
curved display the Acer uses a VA panel
whereas the pic co uses Samsung's PVA
technology now in terms of refresh rate
you're looking at a hundred Hertz
versus a 120 Hertz on the Acer monitor
which is amazing considering the price
so what are some of the compromises that
the only to take when you decide to go
for a monitor of this caliber let's find
out
well first off let's address the obvious
deal-breaker the lack of support for
vasa
which means you won't be able to mount
this on a third party monitor arm if you
were planning on doing so
pixie uses their own proprietary stand
which unfortunately also lacks height
and tilt adjustments except for swivel
which is also very limited in range
the only workaround to this would be to
pick up a monitor rest or stand because
in all honesty positioning your monitor
appropriately to your eye level is just
as important if not more important than
specs Vixia took the design approach
with simplicity in mind unlike some
other gaming monitors that feature of
flashy wet and black accents the px 34
7c features an all-black chassis with
very thin bezels around the edges the
aluminum base is rock-solid so you don't
have to worry about tipping over the
panel Plus this should fit in with any
professional environment like your work
desk the build quality is mostly plastic
though I mean the
see by itself is made out of plastic
materials which is cheap but again this
is $600 so it's what it is in terms of
i/o we have DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI 1.4 and
DVI the lack of USB 3.0 or 2.0 ports
could be a deal-breaker for some of you
unlike the Z 35 P that relies on an
external power supply the pixie monitor
has that built-in so cable management
shouldn't be a concern now let's get
into the bread and butter of this
monitor the display and to be honest
that's what stood out to me the most
during my gaming experience I mean for
$600 one would thing that pixie would
have opted for a lower end TN panel but
surprisingly that's not the case they've
implemented SV a technology that's far
superior to TN to be more specific
expect great color reproduction albeit
not as great as IPS since the colors did
look a little less vibrant compared to
my Bank u 4k display but that's expected
at this price point that being sent
content still looks great on this
display viewing angles are alright
because I did notice a little bit of
contrast shift while tilting the display
to its limit but it is far better than
TN you could get away with some content
creation but I wouldn't recommend this
to professional creators although this
is an excellent option if you're looking
to do productivity tasks like taking
advantage of that massive horizontal
screen real estate where you can arrange
windows the way you desire plus you can
also get to experience native 21 by 9
content which is awesome but the real
question is how does this guy handle
gaming pretty freakin fantastic if you
ask me once again considering the price
you see the PX 34 7c comes out of the
box with a 100 Hertz refresh rate so it
does involve manual overclocking unlike
acer self wings it also supports a m--
DS freesync technology meaning you can
experience a tear-free and smoother
gameplay provided you have any an d GPU
now my test system consists of an Nvidia
graphics card so I wanted to see how it
would cope up with a free Singh monitor
and surprisingly I didn't notice any
screen tearing or any sorts of weird
artifacts of course a more in-depth
scientific test would prove me wrong
easily I guess if you're too immersed
into the gameplay it may not be as
noticeable but do know that this is
strictly my personal opinion battlefield
one look terrific on this display and
mind you I was using
GTX 1080 to drive the 3440 by 1440
resolution at Ultra settings and I was
getting roughly 75 to 80 frames per
second which is perfectly playable I
would highly recommend turning off vsync
especially if you're planning to pair
this monitor with an NVIDIA GPU now I
did manage to pair this monitor with a
begger GPU to see how fleecing works and
it does involve a few steps to get it up
and running the first thing you want to
do is download the latest drivers from
AMD then what you want to do is go into
your monitor and enable fleecing mode
through the menu system and the last
thing you want to do is check mark the
facing option within the Crimson's
software and you're all set I fired a
battlefield one once again and I did my
usual thing and surprisingly I didn't
notice a significant difference
switching between the 1080 and the Vegas
64 GPU and I guess part of that had to
do with lack of me trying to notice any
screen tearing or any weird artifacts
throughout my gameplay now if you end up
testing the GTX 1080 and in Vegas 64 GPU
with this loosing monitor in a much more
scientific method you could prove me
wrong but this is just my personal
opinion with this freaking monitor and
the Vegas 64 GPU and you know throughout
my experience it was pretty smooth I
didn't notice any wear and tear because
I had freesync on but like I said when
pairing with the GTX nad I didn't I
almost had the similar experience now
one thing to note is that driving a 34
40 by 1440 resolution is a difficult
task for a GTX 1080 or even in Vegas 64
GPU I did notice a significant
performance difference between the two
so the Vegas 64 was dishing out roughly
65 frames per second and this is where
the free sync turned on and then with GT
X 1080 I was getting roughly 1180 frames
per second and this is without forcing
option turned on and with vsync off as
well so if you're looking from a raw
performance and framers perspective then
yes going with the 1080 and pairing that
up with this monitor would make sense
and I think it'd be just fine gaming on
it without experiencing you know weird
artifacts but if you can find a
reasonable justification to pick the
Vegas 64 GPU and use the facing option
to get to guarantee that smooth gaming
experience then by all means but
personally I just wouldn't recommend
that GPUs just in my opinion however if
you're looking for a 1080p tear-free
gaming experience and I highly fresh
rate pick CEO has it covered here as
well me
PP x32 5c priced at 350 dollars it's a
32 inch curved gaming monitor featuring
a resolution of 1920 by 1080
I had 144 cards refresh rate support for
free sync and it features the exact same
sv a panel technology as the ultra wide
so you're not compromising our picture
quality which is awesome also a great
feature for that monitor is that it
supports
Vasia so if you want to mount it on a
third party monitor arm you don't have
any restrictions whatsoever however
that's 32 inches of 1080p and I'm gonna
let you guys take a moment to think
about that because what I'm already
starting to see 4k resolution monitors
in that same form factor and you know
coming back to this 1080p resolution
makes absolutely no sense personally
I've been using this Venki 4k monitor
for a few weeks now and going back to
the study 2 inch monitor I had to give
up you know straight away so it all
comes down to user preference if you'd
want something with a huge form factor
and if you're okay with that 1080p
resolution then that would be fine or
you could also go for something like
this the PX 24 5c a 24 inch variant of
its bigger brother featuring a 1080p
display which is also curved by the way
144 hours to refresh rate 3 millisecond
response time compared to 4 on the 32
inch model and support for free sync
personally if you're strictly on a
budget I would highly recommend this 24
inch monitor because a it only costs
$250 and B it doesn't require an
expensive GPU to drive the 1080p
resolution so you know you can easily
get away with an Rx 580 a 480 or even a
GTX 1060 if that's something that you're
looking into also if you're building a
gaming setup this is a great way to save
some bucks and invest in some other
components always stay charged with
linky power up power banks houston
gorgeous aluminum enclosure with dual
USB and type-c port with support for
quick charge 3.0 to get your device's
recharged fast available up to twenty
thousand one hundred million power
capacities check them out in the
description below so having mentioned
those two alternatives to this Altoid
monitor I'd like to hear your thoughts
on the pixie o bx 34 7 C what do you
guys think of this monitor
of course it's priced at $600 would you
consider picking one of these up
regardless of the compromise
that you'll need to take for example the
lack of support for visa and you know
the kind of cheap quality let me know
