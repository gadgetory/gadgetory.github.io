is brought to you by NCIX technology
connected so we're here at the Samsung
booth and we saw some pretty amazing
pieces of tech and just to give you guys
a little bit of teaser some of them went
like this so in other words their curves
and they looked absolutely beautiful so
just taking a look around us we're
taking a look at some beautiful 4k
displays including one which is just
over my right shoulder over here that's
110 inches that thing is beyond massive
as well we took a look at a couple
computer monitors which were very very
impressive and it looked like they were
plated or at least had a nickel nickel
casing or nickel housing so I have a
distinct feeling that they are going to
be considerably expensive but they
looked fantastic another thing that we
saw today was a bunch of curved LCD or
LED or LED panels because they won't
tell us which technology they're using
and we saw them in surround so what I
can tell you is that when you're
standing right in the center of it
you're even more immersed so it creates
this illusion where you're basically
seeing everything around you and it just
wraps instead of what we're currently
using which is just flat panels on each
side and end so it does create a much
more immersive experience and a much
more entertaining experience as well we
took a look over at some of the tablets
and they have a note 12.1 inch that has
a brand new UI called the magazine UI
and you can basically slide through it
and actually put in multiple different
windows so you can multitask when you're
on the go also one of the really cool
things about the tablets at the
resolution was a 1600 p res so you're
getting fantastic pixel density for the
size of the panel now guys there's a lot
more to see here at CES 2014 this is day
2 that we've had a little bit of time to
spend on the floor but it's what day
five days six I don't know they're kind
of like meshing
guys make sure you take a look at our
content going forward for the rest of us
es 2014 like this video if you liked it
dislike if you disliked that cuz we just
want you to engage with us make sure you
