everybody said they suits with a
thousand people we decided to come over
to MSI HQ and check out what is cooking
with the X570 motherboard rollout so
today we're gonna talk about their
entire lineup of motherboards from
budget side all the way to premium side
this is MSI X570 explained of course
one of the perks of coming over to the
HQ is that we get hooked up with some
bubble tea some water and some suits
some swag gaming tumbler yeah this is
this is gonna be interesting
she is this guy but first huge thanks to
our sponsors fantex
and SteelSeries from making Computex
possible I know who knew SteelSeries
right all right no one distractions guys
and so the third generation Rison
announcement was made today and we want
to highlight some cool features about
the whole X570 platform so let's begin
with msi so the first thing you'll
notice on every single motherboard are
these heatsink fans and every
motherboard vendored we've spoken with
has these and there is a lot of concern
about noise produced by these small and
noisy fans and that's because the new X570
chipset consumes 11 watts of power
whereas the older x470 only hits 6
maximum along with corresponding
increases in heat and a lot of that heat
is produced by having the availability
of all that ultra high-speed lanes
provided with a new X570 chipset now
msi hopes to remove almost all noise by
using technology from their Twin Frozr
GPUs so fans completely stop during idle
situations and uses msi propeller blades
for better airflow and it slightly
quieter operation okay so now to some
cool features and the entire X570
platform runs on PCIe jan 4 use have it
or need it at the moment but it's pretty
cool to have this future-proofing built
in at the start and even lower priced
motherboards like the msi X570 gaming
plus has a lot of bandwidth for GPUs for
the future nice so 16 lanes is dedicated
from the chipsets for the graphics so
either X 16 or x8 by x8 and it boards
like
the gaming plus gaming edge and the
gaming Pro carbon AC don't actually
support SLI officially but the higher
ends do and that is okay since SLI on
the lower end tiers probably is not
going to be something you're going to
pursue any way and some GPUs don't even
support it but the higher end
motherboards like the mag x570s and the
X570 godlike have full SLI support
though and they use multiplier to offer
full x16 by x16 speeds and there's
complete crossfire support across the
entire range of motherboards from low
end to high end of course
and while the PCI agent for won't be as
important for GPUs as it is for storage
right now eventually GPUs will catch up
but currently storage availability is
still pretty limited but we've seen some
SSD that run at five gigabytes per
second speed transfer rights and that
bandwidth is certainly going to be
helpful with PCIe gen3
but they will run superhot and of course
they will be expensive to and do to
enhance signaling rates because of all
this bandwidth MSI needed to drastically
upgrade their motherboard PCBs to
include reinforced traces between the
CPU the chipset and the PCIe slots so
every motherboard in their lineup uses
server grade components for the
motherboards to reduce any bandwidth
loss so what else do you need to know
about X570 features and its effect with
the third gen Ryzen
so MSI tells us that overclocking
capability has improved drastically
especially on the memory side and given
the sort of disappointing history with
overclocking on the first and second gen
rising platforms this is really good
news to hear and this is especially
useful for higher capacity kits and
higher clock kits as well
MSI has told us they've done some tests
with 40 400 megahertz kids on air on
their lower end motherboards without any
issue so that sounds really promising
and they've improved the internal memory
timings on their higher-end motherboards
so that all comes into the equation of
better stability and compatibility with
third row third gen Rison and I'm just
really happy to hear that they also use
upgraded memory VRMs to achieve 46
hundred megahertz on air as well and 5
gigahertz for memory or
clocking on liquid nitrogen and as for
CPU overclocking with third gen risin
we're told is going to be better but not
significantly better on traditional
cooling methods and I'm guessing that is
what we can all expect now due to power
needed by 12 cores and 24 threads
msi really has gone down town to their
vrm designs with IR sensors for ultra
quick response times so on some other
boards there's a huge heat pipe that
links together various heat sinks and
that is supposed to drastically increase
cooling capacity and also every one of
these MSI motherboards have either an 8
plus 4 pin layout or an 8 plus 8 pin
layout for the CPU and even though third
gen Rison is using the 7 enemy process
which is efficient but aim do you want
to maximize the power envelope for more
cores in higher clock speeds like the
Ryzen 9 3900X which is a 12 core 24
thread CPU with base clock of 3.8 goes
up to 4.6 on boost and that is a hundred
5 watt TDP part and moving on to the i/o
there's a lot going on from the chipset
16 PCIe Gen 4 lanes that are broken up
between our secondary PCIe devices and
vme storage and other accessories
there's native USB 3.2 gen 2 ports which
were natively USB 3.1 gen2 and there's
no Thunderbolt support on the X570
because it drives up the cost and the
difficulties surrounding the
certification process with Intel because
they require access to the microcode on
the CPU so yeah and let's quickly go
over the motherboard line them from MSI
starting with the MPG X570 gaming plus
just remember there's no pricing yet but
this is the least expensive motherboard
it's got this cool red and black design
but not over-the-top a single x16 slot
and 2 X 8 slots when running till GPUs 1
Gen 4 X 4 and the 2 slot and 2 USB 3.0
Gen 2 one for the front panel connector
next up is the gaming edge Wi-Fi
still a more affordable motherboard
similar to the gaming plus but adds
Wi-Fi support pre-installed IO shield
and goes with 4x USB 3.0 gen 2 ports 3
type a and 1 type C and now we're gonna
start with a slightly higher end boards
like the gaming Pro carbon Wi-Fi and
this one incorporates more our
Yeomans with the mystic light
integration adds upgraded vrm and larger
heat sinks and Wi-Fi six compatibility
now the flagship board starting with the
Meg X570 this one extends the heat pipe
for better cooling it's got this really
cool infinity mystic light on the vrm
heatsink beside the CPU it's got Wi-Fi
six pre-installed i/o shield three Gen 4
m dot two slots and note that
technically x570 can support raid with
nvme and not to SSDs that are connected
to the CPU lanes driver support will be
officially available after launch and
this board also supports double x16 slot
since it has an internal Lane multiplier
and now let's finish off with the Meg x570 god-like and this motherboard this
kind of nuts includes every feature
anyone could want and really represents
the flagship status on this new X570
from MSI it is an e ATX motherboard that
includes all the same features as the
ACE but we have an OLED panel that shows
the off status of the motherboard kill a
networking snag with Wi-Fi six and a
dial to control overclocking preset with
the maximum of 11 because that is one
higher than 10 and nice little reference
if you get it it also includes this 10
gigabit card if you want extreme wired
LAN speeds and a secondary card that
runs on PCIe gen3
interface includes a massive heat sink
and a fan because underneath are two
nvme and the two slots operating each
with 4x PCIe jen's four lanes and once
amy gets raid working on multiple and
the two slots this thing is going to be
absolutely insane for storage speeds
some it's kind of cool to see but you
know it's all it's all about the the
show off factor and so that is the
overview of x5 70 from msi not too many
motherboards so you don't get super
confused on what lower end to your
motherboard to choose or something in
the mid section or the higher end I'm
excited to see how overclocking will
react on the lower SKUs versus the
higher end stuff this is something that
will definitely push me towards the new
third gen Ryzen and X570 sounds very
competitive and exciting and if you're
been contemplating of getting an AMD
system perhaps this will push
away from the blue side and I'm probably
going to be one of those people as well
but thanks much for watching let us know
what you think of this whole rollout
