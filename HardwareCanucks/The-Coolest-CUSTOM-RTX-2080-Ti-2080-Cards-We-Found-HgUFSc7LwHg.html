games come it's all about the media it's
actually quite nice and grew me over
here last time I was here was completely
packed with people but right now it's
pretty chill we're going around the show
floor and trying to find some custom 20
series new cards from Nvidia the r-tx
series by UI check out the explained
video right over here
alright visiting Horace no custom cards
here only 10 series so the show floor is
only open to the media right now and is
almost completely packed tomorrow is
gonna be crazy but that's I see the ROG
booth
let's go check it out hopefully they
have an awesome card for us alright so
it is too awesome to see the r-tx 2080
strict submission 20% larger surface
area on the cooler versus last
generation it is now a 2.7 a small cards
instead of 2.5 so it's like a beefier
cooler I guess that makes sense to lose
that Dorothy X chip awesome could they
see a cards on the show floor and that
let's go play some games
the awesome thing about Gamescom are
these giant statues of games so you are
not here just to play but everyone has a
bit of cosplay and like a little bit so
much more energy about games like a look
at this giant tank behind me oh man I
see EVGA let's go check out the new
cards they're all on display so evj is
showing off three new cards that check
out the r-tx 28 EXC first so this one
you can see the shroud is slightly
transparent it's not plastic it's this
PVC material so it is durable it's not
flexible now the cool thing about the
transparency is that you can customize
you r-tx GPU with these trims they call
them so they're available in black red
and white
and carbon later on so you can customize
your car to look the way you want based
on know the color scheme which is pretty
awesome the XE is also double slot GPU
unlike the others so it's pretty compact
2080 and 28 ETI awesome stuff moving on
to the XC 2 so this one's a slightly
wider much bigger heatsink this is the
2.7 slot GPU has all the same features
the cool thing about this plan is that
it has full EVGA logo on the fans which
actually reduced the noise levels of the
GPU so the car is running quieter
massive heat sink over here so no
problem in cooling something like this
and then the FTW 3 so FTW 3 is probably
going to be the most popular out of this
lineup because it's got three fans
massive heatsink so this is uh I think
it's a triple small GPU yes it is also
features the same transparent design on
the shroud so you can customize the
actual law trims on the interior so the
cool thing about this one is that we
also have this aluminum shield that you
can put on top it looks awesome
customize the GPU a little bit more so
it's kind of cool how EVGA is branching
out into this customization element so
not only we have the
improvement on the heatsink because it
is 14% cooler and 19% quieter than
previous generation but we also have
this others no customization stuff that
we weren't seeing before they also have
the new boxes so once you receive a card
you pull off the lid it's a nice low
surprise waiting inside and new software
UI so not only is the bit cleaner
they're also new features like actually
setting the throttling frequency so if
the card is reaching a certain certain
temperature you can actually set the
frequency clock to how much it will down
the clock and we also have the full RGB
customization controls not only for the
cards but also for the SLI bridge which
is pretty cool something that we weren't
able to control before also I will say
the backplate is a new design looks
actually pretty sweet and the whole
transparency on the shroud allows for
that RGB illumination to shine right
through so it's not going to be in
certain sections and actually will or
supposed to eliminate the entire face of
the card which is going to look pretty
sweet alright so those are the new r-tx
cards from a VGA the XC XC 2 and the FTW
3 for the r-tx 2080 and 20 atti I am
personally excited for the 2080 like the
dual slot because it's compact obviously
is gonna have a lot of power but the FTW
320 atti is most likely going to be like
that the king of the stuff so you can
overclock that thing and it looks
absolutely awesome
the additional customization options are
pretty cool but let us know which card
you'd like us to review first and of
course
Jacob will try to deliver well well well
what's interesting is that we found an
msi card but we are told but how the
board partners is that none of them are
supposed to be running and that card is
running so this thing is a pretty
gigantic GPU but of course they have
multiple variations of that one I think
that was the gaming trio X gaming extra
or something like that but full of RGB
goodness the heatsink is absolutely
massive and yeah you need a giant case
to dominate their new r-tx liner Wow so
the things that you see at Gamescom
cards heads and balls either you games
come you do you alright good people so
that is our games come coverage it's an
exciting place to be because we get to
see so many demos of the games that we
can you know test and play out for a
little bit and it's actually pretty
awesome to actually have this such a
significant hardware launch at Gamescom
and it kind of makes sense because you
know Jensen spent like 90 percent of
presentation talking about rate racing
that will be most likely port to games
with this whole r-tx platform an
ecosystem later on so they are really
closely linked together I was hoping for
more brand partners to showcase their
r-tx cards but it's good to see EVGA in
full force asus cards and one two cards
from msi but yeah i'm definitely excited
to see more on September 20th when the
Paul r-tx 20 series launches now a lot
of you have expressed your skepticism
about gaming performance which we are
about to receive tomorrow so a lot of
the information is still under NDA but
as soon as we are able to speak about
the performance and reveal the true
colors of this whole r-tx lineup of
course you'll hear that from us so
thanks much for watching I'm Dimitri
from games come and we'll see you and
be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
