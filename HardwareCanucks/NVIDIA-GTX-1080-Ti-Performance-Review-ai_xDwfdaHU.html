the new wives and processors launching
exactly seven days ago and now this say
hello to my newest friend for the past
few days the NVIDIA GTX 1080p eye and it
just so happens to claim to be the most
powerful graphics card on the planet now
here in my hands it may look like a
regular founders edition but man it can
power through games let's dive into this
right after a message from our sponsor
you can only rely on the pros booth job
with every keystroke satisfying like the
millions before
quality field every team regardless of
the faith Kula master master keystroke
negativity negativity
now even though Nvidia announced today
about a week ago the GTX tennety ty has
been a long time in the making it may
not feel like a long time but the gtx
1080 was released ten months ago
the titan next seven months ago gtx
980ti has been around for nearly two
years it was time to launch a follow up
to the successful gtx 980ti and that's
where this new card comes in in terms of
performance claims and via says that new
GT X 1080 ties should have enough
horsepower to beat the super expensive
1200 US dollar Titan X but for a
fraction of the price as a matter of
fact we wouldn't be surprised to see the
Titan X discontinued altogether while
its cores are repurposed for quadrille
and tesla cards and about the price it's
$700 which is still a lot to spend on
graphics card but for that money you get
some extremely high performance why well
as you can see by the specifications the
gtx 1080i is basically a titan x which
has been massaged in an effort to
heighten yield and likely cost nvidia is
also doing away with their practice of
selling the founders edition for a
premium but coming launched this will be
the only version of the card available
both partners will have their products
launched in a few weeks so you may want
to wait for that the GT X 1080 ty uses
the same 16 nanometer Pascal GP 102 3584
CUDA cores and 224 texture units and the
Titan X but it has one less 32-bit
memory controller one less ROP partition
and a bit less l2 cache to ensure
optimal memory performance each of the
GT x 1080 Tai's 11 memory controllers is
paired up with a single gddr5 x IC
granting it a total of 11 gigabytes of
video memory that's access to a 352
based bus
according to Nvidia this maximum memory
allocation will become a key factor as
more buyers look towards the VR 4k or
even 5k screens achieving tight next
beating performance while still
maintaining a TDP of 250 watts meant
increasing bass and boost clocks while
also up
gddr5 X frequently 211 gigahertz to
compensate for the narrower 352 bit plus
the reference or founders edition of the
gtx 980ti looks great but other than the
logo on a shroud it's pretty much
indistinguishable from other Nvidia
cards it is ten and a half inches long
it uses milled aluminum shroud with an
integrated illuminated GeForce logo and
there's a full colored backplate to
dissipate additional heat the only major
difference between this and the other
NVIDIA GPUs is the lack of a dedicated
DVI connector on the rear i/o area
instead nvidia is using this space for
additional ventilation and this version
of the gtx 1080i will ship with a
DisplayPort two dual link DVI adapter
board partners are free to design their
cards with that missing connector I can
understand where this is coming from if
you're spending $700 on a GPU you'll
likely have a display product but
monitor what you can see with your bare
eyes is that NVIDIA has thoroughly
revised their internal heating design so
it has doubled the amount of surface
area while also updating the PWM to a
more advanced 7 phase all digital layout
but will this lead to lower temperatures
or lower fan speeds when compared
against the Titan X well blowers out
coolers are known for their silence but
hopefully these revisions will help I'll
check up on that later
all right now with all that out of the
way let's start off with the benchmarks
at 1440p and then move on to the full 4k
resolution make sure to hit pause if you
want to study all these charts a bit
more if you want more information about
frame rates over time and test system
specs head over to the hover connects
website review a link will be in the
description starting things off with the
2560 by 1440 resolution and px 11 there
is a hiccup right away there just isn't
much difference between the standard GTX
1080 and much more powerful gtx 980ti
and Titan in Call of Duty why because
this games engine is limited to 125
frames per second and the two expensive
cards couldn't push beyond that so
things look much closer than they really
are the rest of the test showed just how
powerful the gtx 1080 ty really is it
trades below with the Titan X and
remains a good 25% to 40% ahead of the
GTX 1080 meanwhile the last generation
ty card isn't even on the radar
wish I could say that I was surprised by
these results but Nvidia already pull
the covers of the fact that the gtx
980ti would be at least as fast as they
type next that's exactly what's been
shown here with the newer less expensive
GPU actually pulling a full percentage
point ahead I should also mention that
doing vulcan results are also game
limited to 200 frames per second so
imagine what this card could do without
that block in place rounding things off
with gears hitman quantum break and
wives of the Tomb Raider reflects the
same thing as before without any
competition these charts are becoming a
bit boring however there's one odd
misstep with quantum break which seems
to benefit from the tight nexus wider
memory bus and additional ROP units now
we get into a big-boy resolution of 4k
the dx11 results show a repeat of what
we've already seen with one exception
since Call of Duty is no longer
artificially limited we can really see
what the gtx 1080i can bring to the
table and that and other games it didn't
even have problems chewing through
fallout 4s and new high-resolution
texture pack and titanfall 2's crazy
8x MSAA setting amazing stuff rounding
out the game benchmarks there's a bunch
of DirectX 12 which only cement the fact
that the GTX 1080 ty is an ultra
powerful graphics card it trades blows
with the Titan X sometimes winning by a
Miller margin and sometimes losing by a
bit one thing I do want to mention is
that in some games it didn't exactly
display playable frame rates but
remember almost every title here was
pushed at its highest settings getting
playable frame rates would be as easy as
disabling anti-aliasing which is
something that's not really needed for
such a high 4k resolution moving on to
temperatures and there's not really any
surprise here and videos cooler and fan
speeds algorithm are designed to keep
the graphics core around 84 degree C and
that's exactly where domains for my
testing this ensures that there's enough
thermal room for this car to hit maximum
boost clocks without sacrificing noise
speaking of noise even though I didn't
open up this gtx 980ti there are
obviously some improvements going on
behind the scenes even though the core
and the memory are operating at higher
temperatures this card isn't any louder
than a type next don't mistake this for
silence though since it's actually a bit
loud and if you want a quieter
experience
you will need to wait for custom cards
with the same performance as the type
next comes a very similar power
consumption make sure you have at least
a good 650 watt power supply before
buying the GTX 1080 tie since it still
does require a lot of electricity and
now finally for overclocking pumping a
bit more voltage boosting fan speeds to
75 percent and upping the power limit
allowed me to hit a constant speed of
twenty fifteen megahertz while the
memory didn't have any problems going a
bit over 12 gigahertz however I wouldn't
recommend too much overclocking on the
stock cooler since that increase in fan
speeds resulted in a very noisy gaming
environment once again I'd recommend you
wait for the custom cards for better
overclocking experiences of course with
those higher frequencies comes even more
impressive performance so what do I
think about this card well that's a
tough one there's no doubt it's great to
have less expensive alternatives the
Titan X and I have to credit in video
for keeping the price somewhat decent
even though they don't have any
competition right now and we still can't
forget the fact the GTX 1080 tie costs
almost $700 and will likely hit $1000
here in Canada but do we get good value
for the money again it depends on what
you're looking for at 1440p there isn't
a game in existence that can bring the
GTX Kennedy tied to its knees and that
even goes for fallout 4 with its new
memory gobbling high resolution texture
pack not only does the GTX 1080i do well
in current games but there's more than
enough juice left in its tank for ultra
smooth performance well into the future
however you shouldn't forget that the
regular GTX 1080 which is now $100 less
expensive also provides excellent frame
rates at lower resolutions especially at
1080p
moving on to 4k and frame rates do of
course suffer but this card is instantly
better positioned to tackle such a high
resolution than something like a GTX
1080 also high resolutions are where the
GTX 1080 time makes the most sense and
anything less it's pure overkill but you
know what sometimes or kill is a good
thing too right so what do you guys
think about the GTX 1080 ty will you
jump into it right now or are you
waiting to see what AMD has coming if
they ever get around to launching Vega
or is this simply too expensive for your
taste let us know in the comments down
below
I'm Evo retard connects thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
