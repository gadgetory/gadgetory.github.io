today's SteelSeries is launching their
new arctas Pro line of headsets their PC
and ps4 compatible I have the game dak
and the wireless versions in-house but
there's also a standalone pro version
and today I want to mainly focus on the
game dark Edition and spend some more
time with the wireless one and deliver
my thoughts on that later finally an
ultra slim body keyboard with mechanical
red or blue switches designed and
perfected for work and play that the
sorrel gram excess evolved to fit right
in check it out below ok so it is clear
that SteelSeries is trying to target the
slightly higher end consumer base within
the gaming industry because of the price
so the game dark Edition costs $249
while the wireless one sells for 329 but
also because this is their first high
res audio certified gaming product this
is a certification that is done through
the Japanese audio Society it means that
the drivers can reach 40 kilohertz or
above incapable of delivering 24-bit 96k
low hertz for the entire system so for
the interface and the DAC and I think
the certification badge is a good
marketing move to like separate
themselves from this perception that
gaming headsets and audio suck and more
companies are now trying to follow suit
so like this msi GH 60 also has the high
res audio certification but this one is
a significantly cheaper product and so
I'm hoping that this entire high res
audio badge will not come at a
significant price premium because of it
so the arctas Pro physically is almost
identical to the previous Octus pairs
but they have fixed some of my previous
complaints so you can still interchange
the fabric headband the RGB illumination
is awesome with that soft perimeter glow
but the still serious logo is no longer
illuminated so they look a little bit
more tasteful this way the retractable
microphone is the same with a mic mute
LED but the mics which is larger and
easier to press the volume wheel now
matches the color of the body but it's
still way too easy to spend and I always
unintentionally change the volume when
taking the headset on or off and we get
the refined aluminum hinge so they are
stiff enough for rotation but don't
freely wobble around and they can rest
on the table flat or on you
neck and now with a slightly larger
angle so they don't really choke you
like on the previous pairs the side
plates are now magnetic and are
removable I'm guessing we'll see some
accessories for game specific side
plates but this is also necessary for
the wireless addition so you can access
the removable battery the headphone
sharePort is still here and I find it
useless because you know listen to your
own music comfort wise the ear cups are
thick and pleasant to the touch but the
headband is non expandable so you can
only relax the fabric piece to a point
where it needs the headband so for
individuals with smaller heads this is
not a problem
and I'm personally fine with it as well
but in no way will this fit larger heads
if you have lots of hair wear a cap or
hat and also like to wear the headset at
the same time so unfortunately this is
not an accommodating design for everyone
alright so this was the mic sounds like
on the arctas probe
there's a lot of detail it's not too
nasally you can still hear the
compression because it's tries to noise
cancel out the background so for example
right now let me type on an MX blue
keyboard which are you know super loud
switches you can hear them but they are
slightly muted I wish there was a bit
more bass in my voice with this
microphone but the good thing is that if
you're constantly yelling at the
microphone you can obviously adjust the
volume of the microphone pickup which
you cannot do for many other headsets
what you're hearing now is the game one
headset which I've been using as like
the benchmark for microphone in this
field this one has a bit more bass
pickup which I prefer it sounds a little
bit more full but it's not as detailed
or clear as the arctas pro plenty of
things come in the box because this is
entirely modular system so replacing any
broken components is easier down the
line but their choice of a USB mini-b
a pin cable is of course on purpose it's
not a common connector and you're locked
to only using the SteelSeries headsets
with the included DAC I do like their
approach to the interface of the game
docto so it's an elegant monochrome
display not high-resolution but it's
fine it's not too bulky it's easy to
navigate it has a good i/o but you
connect the headset to the left side of
the DAC which means placement of this
thing on your desk will be limiting so
for my space it cannot be on the right
because it interferes with my mouse
cable it can all be above my keyboard
because the
cables are just awkward so the only
appropriate place will be on the left
side where I can more comfortably around
the cables and I like my headphones an
audio on the right side so I can route
it kind of like below the table but now
because this thing on the left I have to
deal with the additional cable work and
that's just not pleasant and there's no
other way around it unless you go fully
wireless with the rest of your
peripherals now the initial setup and
menu guidance for navigation is super
simple
you finally choose your source and good
luck have fun the wheel and the back
button feel great with nice tactile
bumps during rotation and easy presses
but the volume level starts at zero and
decreases and I found that weird because
normally you'd want to turn the volume
up now a few things to keep in mind for
that initial setup there are two ways to
adjust the volume on the headset and on
the DAC so when I plugged it in the
volume was super low even to 100% on the
DAC so make sure to adjust the volume on
the headset as well if you're you know
volume is super low second thing is that
volume adjustment in Windows is locked
when the DAC is plugged in and if you
want to go to the high res audio setting
it will be grayed out initially so you
have to go into the windows audio
settings and choose your appropriate
sample rate so 24-bit 96k hertz for that
actually to show up on the deck and you
can see exactly what sample rate you
have on the monochrome display switching
sources will kill the audio for a few
seconds until Windows changes that in
the background the main advantage of a
pc mode is that you have the chat mix
basically allowing you to balance out
the volume of your incoming voice versus
in-game volume so you can balance that
out with nice visual graphic there you
can enable surround sound if you don't
want to navigate into the menu here we
also get a few EQ profiles and the
custom calibration for the equalizer the
microphone side tone levels and the
microphone volume which I would suggest
for you to leave at 8:00 and have a
microphone about an inch away from your
face
we can even customize the RGB
illumination with a few color options
that you can sync to the mic mute led as
well now you do have a bit more control
inside the driver software like
gainsaying function and saving your
desired EQ settings but the software is
not really required to take the full
advantage of the game deck and I think
it's well thought out so you can control
everything
the game doc about the probe just keep
in mind that it is a glossy so keep your
fingers off and have some sort of dust
particle cleaner nearby because that
thing gets dirty superfast and finally
my audio experience with these has been
excellent but not exactly perfect first
the drivers on these are incredible not
like the overly harsh treble type but
like a controlled spectrum with nice
bright sound the bassist it-it's
powerful like goosebumps level when
listening to the Bladerunner score
I love this theory signature out of
these the layering of the different
elements is impressive in the blind test
I could not tell the difference between
the high-res versus PC mode but when I
actually sat down and tried to listen
for the differences knowing which one
was what I felt like the high res gave
me slightly fuller trouble
that was less dry so I think maybe there
was something going on or could have
been just a placebo
whereas in games I was not able to hear
any difference whatsoever the important
takeaway is they sound fantastic for
games whether it's for competitive so
you want to hear every little bit of
detail to know exactly what is going on
in your environment or for simple casual
strategy it's a super clean signal it's
bright with a nice bass extension to my
only two complaints are surround sound
it's still not right for me it pushes
the mid-range way out and the details
compromised you do get a slightly larger
soundstage but I prefer the detail over
feeling something delivered further in
the distance and the second load
complaint is that I wanted a little bit
more power in volume running these at
100% on the headset and on the DAC
listen to something epic you know when
you want to just like turn up the volume
slightly a bit more
well that wasn't present here it's still
very loud and it isolates everything
very well but I wanted a little bit more
alright so conclusion time I think the
pro name makes sense they've done some
refinements on the body so it's like the
more premium versus the darkest three or
the five or the seven even and the DAC
the game DAC have seals the deal it's a
fantastic clean signal you know lots of
customization it's almost driverless you
don't really need the drivers for it so
as a total package I think they've done
a really good job making sure to deliver
to the quality that the gamers don't
really expect but it's like an
audiophile you know high quality audio
experience that is now available for
gamers from a gaming company
the catch however is the price at two
$49 this is an expensive package
especially because it's kind of like
locks you down to their own ecosystem
let's say you cannot plug in any other
headphone into this thing because it's
using that USB connector aside maybe
from like the artists v headset but the
DAC is not even sold separately so if -
$50 is your price range potentially look
into like a standalone $99 headset with
analog connections and then by a
separate DAC that you know the hundred
$50 you can find plenty of those so that
would be like a more open ecosystem that
would complement upgrade ability down
the line whereas this does not so share
your thoughts about the artist Pro Plus
the game DAC edition stay tuned for the
