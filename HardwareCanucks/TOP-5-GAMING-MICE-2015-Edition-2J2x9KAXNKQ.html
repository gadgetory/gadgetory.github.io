great technology selection and service
alright
third time's the charm right a place
that's what they say
that's not I clean the table hello
everyone I'm Demetria with Harbor
Canucks and welcome to another top five
video the subject for today is gaming
mice and if you think about gaming mice
is such a significant element in our
everyday computer tasks because the
cursor is our navigation Atlas and it
allows us to get to places where we need
to go
it's almost as important as if not more
important than a keyboard and the rest
of the hardware that we you know use
within the entire computer sphere so
gaming mice are so subjective in terms
of the shape because everybody's hand
size is different everybody uses
different grip style depending on if you
move your mouse a lot or you like to
concentrate it in a smaller region and
you know have a higher dpi and because
of all those factors we've teamed up
with a couple of youtuber friends so
they can also provide their insight on
their favorite daily Mouse aside from
the top 5 that we've picked here so it
will broaden your options if you're
looking for a gaming mouse in the near
future so without any further ado let's
outline what we have here on a table top
5 gaming nice people let's begin at
number 5 the best budget Mouse in my
opinion goes to the SteelSeries rival
100 it only 39 dollars which offers all
the basics like the textured side grips
with a good shape for claw or finger
grip with an easy to reach dpi shifter a
very satisfying scroll wheel but with
the tab heavy middle quick pleasant side
browser buttons and it's also fairly
light at 120 grams with a good balanced
distribution through the body plus we
have to illumination zones with an RGB
Suite which for a $39 mouse is just a
bonus they did sacrifice a bit on the
build quality side as it doesn't feel
nearly as nice as other more expensive
options in our list but it sure does
make up with that awesome sensor the
rival 100 comes
custom optical SteelSeries sensor the
SDNS 30:59 SS which is based off depicts
art 3050 sensor there is no acceleration
tracking is awesome and I felt
comfortable very quickly with precise
aim the only real downside is the
inability to adjust liftoff distance so
if you want to lift the mouse often you
might need to develop a new way to use
the mouse because the liftoff distance
is around half a centimeter which still
moves your cursor when the mouse is
coming back down the primary left and
right clicks fit a good balance between
distance traveled and the weight so the
rival 100 is the Gaming Mouse to get at
under 40 bucks at number 4 the best
wireless mouse of the year has got to go
the razer mom but chroma body-wise it's
fantastic amazing shape for palm support
it's not that heavy at 125 grams even
with the built-in battery but you have
to keep in mind it's kind of back heavy
which makes lifting the mouse a lot more
difficult as its slouches back we have a
really nice feeling rubber texture on
each side smooth glide feet one of the
best scroll wheels for gaming with
proper side scrolling and distinct main
scroll steps while offering a light
mirror click for other functions if
you're into customization of the
actuation force of each primary click
that is possible on this mouse from 45
grams to 95 grams which drastically
changed the way this mouse feels for
whatever game that you play and that is
one of the premium features that you
don't find often and the razer delivers
one of the best lighting implementations
that is for the pretty visuals only but
man the illumination of the charging
dock and the mouse look fantastic which
brings us to wireless performance I
honestly could not tell the difference
between using the mouse in wired versus
Wireless mode so the lack of cable does
bring that extra sense of manoeuvre now
if you are after a wireless performer
you'd be happy with the Mamba as long as
you are aware of its limitations which
you can find in our full review link
below coming in at number three one of
the gaming communities fan favorite is
the logitech g502 and there are many
things to love about this mouse first
the buttons primary left and right click
are light and satisfactory pretty much
everything is well
laid out from the side browser buttons
to the DPI shifter for your point finger
with that three-step visual indicator to
the sniper button which enables custom
dpi when pressed and you can easily
train your thumb to move into that
position when necessary to the profile
shift which sits right beside the
infinite scroll enabler for the scroll
wheel which in my opinion could be the
best scroll wheel on the mouse it
features light side scrolling that you
can work with without spinning or
pressing the wheel and is super useful
for editing it has a metallic coating so
it feels kind of slippery but that
doesn't take away from the super
distinct scroll steps and light middle
click and I'm sure you'll find proper
use with that infinite scrolling a
feature that is missed on so many mice
today also it comes with adjustable
weights if you find 121 grams to be too
light and the shape beautifully supports
your thumb and the palm I have pretty
large hands and I don't find the slim
profile an issue and combine all that
with one of the best optical sensors
which has no acceleration the Pixar 3366
which has a load of customizations in
the software and you have yourself one
of the best mice of the year and at
number two one of my most recent
additions to the mouse collection is the
Zoe FK one this is the best ambidextrous
design that I have ever seen that works
very well to support your hand
especially because the browser buttons
on each side are not on the way so you
can hold it properly without
accidentally pressing the buttons on the
opposite side glide feet are fantastic
and the driverless nature of this Mouse
is refreshing with 4 dpi settings that
are color coded at the bottom for that
visual indication with 400 800 1600 and
3200 dpi we perfect to very low lift off
distance and an amazing accurate optical
IR sensor the 3310 I really appreciate
their approach towards a competitive
arena with no lighting effects no body
customization so it all becomes kind of
about the shape the weight the sensor
and the switches the weight balance is
amazing so if you tend to lift your
mouse a lot you love the FK one and the
same goes if you move the mouse over a
larger area my aim has
never been this good and that's after a
very short practice period the
scrollwheel also came here has got a
good middle-click but these scroll steps
could be more defined and now something
to keep in mind are the primary switches
that are known for their heavy nature
especially compared to every single
Mouse in this stack but they've listened
to feedback of gamers and are refreshing
their entire lineup from now that will
use the lighter
Omron switches that will be used to
satisfy a larger spectrum of users and
coming in number one my go-to daily
driver for all my cursor needs in the
office and when I'm away is the my onyx
caster I picked this mouse as the mouse
of the year because of the price the
shape the switches the scroll wheel the
sensor driver customization because this
thing has it all although it's only for
right hand users now for my hand this is
the most comfortable Mouse because it's
fairly slim yet with the right curves to
support all the fingers thumbs support
has the textured side which helps to
seamlessly lift the mouse when needed
the side browser buttons have that
satisfying light tactile actuation the
scroll wheel is rubberized with an
awesome light middle-click but actually
it seems that over time the scroll steps
have become less defined the omron
switches here are awesome whether you
click fast or slow they feel amazing and
the DPI shifter behind the scroll wheel
comes in handy all the time the two
illuminated zones are just a bonus with
accurate colors that don't take away
from the main function of the caster
which is outstanding sensor performance
with the text art 3310 you can quickly
perfect your aim for accurate shooters
like csgo and combine that with the
extensive suite of driver customization
and you have yourself a mouse that is
all about craftsmanship no gimmicks
required and thus deserves our number1
spot for the gaming mouse of the year so
that was my input on the top 5 gaming
mice from our side now as I said earlier
because my eyes are so subjective and
how you use them what your hand size is
like we've included a few youtubers here
to also share their insight on their
favorite daily driver mouse so here they
are what's up guys my name is Edgar
I want a tech channel called tech source
where I do monthly PC builds host
competitions where people submit their
desk setups and custom PCs and lots of
other tech related content running a
tech channel full time is not an easy
task which is why I need a mouse that
can handle this major responsibility
after cycling through dozens of mice
throughout my entire lifespan I've
landed with the Logitech MX master which
is a wireless mouse aimed at
productivity the ergonomic design with
an arched back is really comfortable to
handle especially for claw grippers like
myself I do love the thumb wheel on the
side which makes editing videos
extremely easy and although it's mainly
used for getting work done I do use it
for casual gaming from time to time I do
have to say one of the best things about
this mouse is the hyper scroll feature
which helps me scroll through long pages
quickly and that's especially effective
on Twitter but yeah this is basically
the mouse I use every single day I want
to give a huge things to Dmitriy for
having me in this video
and I'll see you guys later so my daily
Mouse is the final mass because it's
light compact and it just seems to work
there aren't any drivers to mess around
with it has some buttons unlike other
light mice and I just feel like I have
an aimbot built into the mouse I don't
know why but that's how it feels it uses
the 3310 sensor like a lot of other mice
but it just seems like it's faster it's
not hindered by clunky software or
driver implementations final Mouse
really optimized this sensor for
participer gaming and that's why I use
it what's up guys I'm Kyle and I'm not
Kyle I'm Josh fractal design oh I should
probably say where I'm from from
awesomesauce Network and Thank You
Dimitri for having us in this video
we're here to talk about our favorite
Mouse I don't know if it's particularly
for gaming or just all-purpose but I use
this everyday as my daily driver it's a
logitech g502 it since 2011 when I built
my first computer ever and it's still
holding up it's doing an awesome job
it's really simple it's not like
necessarily a really aggressive gaming
mouse but it has all the features I need
really nice weight balanced weight
system weight tuning and the software is
really nice as well
and that's that your all-around right
game is my Allah rounding all that sort
of exactly yeah when I'm not using this
if I have my laptop and I'm on the go
the rock Italian is also a pretty good
Mouse I like the little shark Trin on
the top so I can like do side scrolling
and stuff when I'm you know doing side
by side web browsing things like that
MLG web browser and LG none yeah sure
yeah um so mine is well not here um my
favorite my daily driver is kind of
mouse is that it's invisible it's it's
totally India it's like well it is it's
carbon fibre nanotubes visible cloak to
knowledge anyways um so the Logitech G
700 s is my daily driver um basically I
don't need a ton of buttons even gaming
I never use all of them I forget where
they're at but I like the fact that
obviously it's Wireless but you just
plug in and run on powered mode because
I've had mice before where they're
wireless charging cradle you forget and
then the one time you need it you've got
to sit there crap when it charges for 45
minutes before I can do anything
it fits my hands pretty well but as you
can see my hands are rather large so
they don't fit everything perfectly I
don't think there is a perfect Mouse out
there one of my other favorites though
was the funk ms3 had the wider platform
fit my hands better wasn't my preferred
mouse for gaming but for like daily
driver use comfort that sort of thing
worked really well but those would be my
two favorites if I can have two
favorites sweet yeah you're pretty good
liar yes I know you hate both those mice
and you yeah alright I do love some
infrared mice so this is the me onyx
cast or I love this Mouse it's one of
the most accurate mice out there on the
planet the braided cable is not my cup
of tea
I love the sensor in favorite sensor PWM
3310 they do some dpi doubling don't
care for that also love Zoe products but
I've had to ec1 Evo so far and the
button stopped working on one sensor
stopped working on the other so I'm like
whatever anyway we're and each engine
decided to make our own mouse using the
PWM 3310 sensor that I love this one's
no nonsense we decided no software just
a few buttons Omron switches rubberized
coating decent ergonomics and I've try
to shoot for like a lower price point
with this mouse so that's why we just no
bells and whistles just simple amount of
RGB here and
me nonsense like that in using this as a
daily driver for the last six months
we've gone through six different
revisions on this mouse to make it you
know change this button change the
change this or just little things like
that and I'm pretty happy with it as far
as just the tracking and the accuracy
it's probably the most accurate Mouse I
have because we didn't do anything to it
it just put the sensor in there and so
I'm really happy about that you jump
into quake live and I feel like I'm
doing better than I normally would I
don't know when I was a QuakeCon this is
when we first started using this
everyone was calling it the god mouse
because I was getting like first or
second place every time and that's not
normal for me I'm usually like third or
fourth place so I don't know maybe it's
a little bit of a joke but anyway we're
getting like a few of these made and
mainly just to see how things go in the
factories we went and took a look at the
factory that's always important for me
when I check this stuff out and I think
you know a lot of the companies in
Shenzhen are doing a good job right now
so it's sort of the Silicon Valley of
manufacturing and it's interesting to
learn how things work and also you know
when you're done have a product we'll
have a few of these pretty soon but I'm
enjoying it it's my daily driver at the
moment hey I'm Brian from sergeant
ballistic gaming and when it comes to
gaming mice over the years I've always
found myself going back to Logitech for
the great balance of features comfort
and performance one of the Great's in
their lineup and still my go-to daily
driver is the G 500 it's a great
successor to the venerable g5 and mx518
before it and adds to them some great
features including ten programmable
buttons weight customization on-the-fly
dpi changing between five custom dpi
levels from two hundred and fifty seven
hundred as a nice heavy scroll wheel
with great pronounced intervals hyper
fast rolling for productivity side
scroll button switches and all those
features are tied together with some
nice no-frills software that lets me
customize all the inputs per game and
store some onboard the mouse itself the
Bergin anomic still can be seen in
logitech gaming productivity lineup
today and even though this mouse is six
years old it's still able to hold its
own against a lot of the new kids on the
block and that even includes some of
logitech's new offerings but it's going
to take a hell of a mouse to supplant
this as my go-to daily driver mouse hey
how's it going guys my name is Dave Lee
and I have a youtube channel called Dave
Toodee so Demetri asked me to make a
short clip on what Mouse I use as my
daily driver and that's this guy the
Logitech MX anywhere 2 so this is like
the smaller sibling to the super popular
MX master Mouse and I like it because it
fits my hand really well and it's a good
great wireless mouse so I try to avoid
wires and the Bluetooth connection is
really solid and I switch computers a
lot so I use a Mac Pro at work a MacBook
Pro at home and once a while I use a
Dell XPS and having a mouse that can
instantly switch between all three of
these devices is really nice another
thing is that there's no drivers or
software that you need to download all
of the software from Logitech is
entirely optional and lastly this thing
performs really well it's not as good
for games as a wired mouse but for
casual gaming video editing and for my
day-to-day work this thing is super
reliable and I can go like three to four
weeks in between charges so thanks
Dimitri for having me on it's been nice
I'll see you guys next time
hello hardware connects viewers my name
is Paul my youtube channel is Paul's
hardware and thanks to Dimitri for
inviting me on this little Mouse
comparison video first off apologies to
all of you for the way my set looks and
probably the audio is not that great
right now either
I'm in the middle of a big
reconstruction project and remodeling so
bear that in mind
also Dimitri asked me to talk about one
Mouse and I have six here so I'd better
get right to it let's start with my
daily driver that's this one right here
the my onyx naos 8200 and as you might
be able to tell I've used this quite a
bit for this one it really just comes
down to the shape the ergonomic shape
really fits the contour of my hands so I
really like how it feels I can use it
for a long time it's got a nice solid
sensor on there this is a laser version
I actually kind of like the optical
version of this mouse a little bit
better but this is what I use when I'm
editing and that kind of thing so that's
what I can legit call my daily driver
but since I have multiple computers
I have other mice that I also use on
those so here's a couple more this is
the corsair m65 which is actually just
picked this up recently and this has
just been a longtime favorite of mine
ever since they came out with this
whether or not it has the the tramp
stamp logo on it I still think it's a
great Mouse really solid construction
and I do like a sniper button find that
to come in very useful not just for
gaming but also when you need to do
precision stuff like in
I can adobe or something like that
here's a mouse from rocket this is the
Nith I also use this on actually this is
currently connected to my streaming
system although I'm strongly considering
switching this over to my editing system
because of all the modular buttons on
the side to set those up with macros so
I can shortcut to different editing
functions that I do while I'm editing
videos but really been a big fan of this
mouse the NIT since it came out although
it is quite expensive I also have a
rocket tie on and this is actually the
mouse I've been using to game with most
frequently recently because it's the one
that's actually plugged into my main
gaming system aka Arctic Panther my
custom water-cooled build anyway I
really like this mouse - I think I like
the Neth a little bit better as far as
the flexibility and the features and
everything this one's nice and
comfortable it's got a nice finish on it
and again tracking is beautiful on there
I also have a couple floater mice these
are mainly mice that I bring along if
I'm taking like a notebook on the go or
something and I know I need to edit this
is the main one that I use which is the
old-school classic Razer DeathAdder
which just has amazingly accurate
tracking and it's it's just a classic
Mouse that plugs you just plug it in and
it works that's why I have these mice as
my floater mice as they they pretty much
work they track really well I found that
they work in like system bios's and
setup areas the wrap on the cable here
on the sensei row actually wasn't as
good so I don't necessarily recommend it
for that but as far as just a standard
plug-and-play Mouse those both work
really well but yeah I gotta give it up
ultimately for me it always comes down
to the mouse fitting in your hand and
being comfortable to use for a long
period of time and for that reason this
is the Manics nouse nass is still the
one that I've been using most frequently
anyway thanks for having me on the show
Dmitry so before I skedaddle huge thank
you to everyone who was involved in
making them this video Josh Paul Kyle
