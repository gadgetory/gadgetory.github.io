possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex and NCIX without them we wouldn't
be here I think hands down one of the
coolest builds and enclosure concept
presentations came from fantex suite
with their project 9 16 9 representing
the size category and 16 the year of
production this is taking the enthusiast
level on a rocket ride beyond the
atmosphere seriously this thing is so
cool and I cannot wait to see what the
community will be able to achieve with
such a unique case so first this case
reminds me of the end to primo which was
a fan takes first enclosure and has a
similar curved piece at the bottom that
continues all the way to the top which
is actually one single piece of aluminum
so if you're looking for that premium
look and feel this case surely has it
there are also many unique features the
Atlantic's has been pushing forward like
a potential for a dual system
configuration an awesome chamber
separation and that is exactly what we
saw inside the project 9/16 the entire
side panel is tempered glass with a
ventilated mid section built in which
gives this case really unique vibe but I
guess that could be just because the
sheer size of that thing
it really makes it stand out and make it
quite unique so on the inside the top
chamber is totally separated from the
bottom as you can see it would be very
water cooling friendly with a 360 rather
at the front a 480 rad at the top which
this case just seems to swallow no
problem but it is mounted on a removable
top bracket for easier installation
there is a main ATX system but with a
second ITX system on the floor and
clearly this case is targeted for those
opie systems with enough clearance for
giant reservoirs and while we didn't see
the back of the enclosure I'm hoping
layout efficiency is top-notch as it has
always been with their enthusiast
jassi's the bottom chamber is all about
hosting your power and storage capable
of dual power supplies and from this
design there are six three and a half
inch drive caddies and one unique aspect
about this particular bill is their
utilizing both the power splitter and
the power combo which means they're
collecting the power of a 750 watt and
the 1000 watt power supplies into one
of power that is then distributed
through the power splitter to both
systems which is pretty fantastic so
this is the project 916 it sure is the
biggest case fantex has showcased and it
looks awesome
remember that this is still a concept
project so if there are things you
definitely want to see fantex to include
here make sure to leave them in the
comments down below I'm Dimitri with
hark max thanks for watching our CES
coverage and we'll see you in the next
