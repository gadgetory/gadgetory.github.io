description to unleash your options for
true performance hey guys Ibrahim with
hard Rican accent typically gamers
attracted towards mechanical keyboards
that have a unique gaming eccentric
design programmable macro buttons RGB
lighting and last but not least the
price a company named WASD is taking a
slightly different approach with their
new custom mechanical keyboard that
offers a simple design with unique
characteristics that you might not find
on a typical gaming keyboard and for the
purpose of this review let's refer to
the brand as lost pricing starts at $150
and goes all the way up to $200
depending on the configuration you
choose and this is done manually on
their website where customers can
customize the type of MX Jerry switches
the type of sound dampeners for travel
distance reduction the text color and if
you want to take customization to the
next level you can upload your own
keyboard layout just to add that
personal touch there's also an option to
change the color of the key caps either
individually or as a group and there are
plenty of keyboard styles available
starting with the standard QWERTY layout
all the way up to a desert camouflage
look you can also choose what to imprint
on the function keys or leave them blank
and finish off the customization with
the preferred operating system key while
$150 may not sound that compelling it
actually is competitive for a completely
custom mechanical keyboard we chose the
plain black modern design with an
additional set of red keys and it looks
something like this
the chassis is made out of hard plastic
material that feels solid but the lack
of an armrest is a bummer for the price
and also it would be great to see
integration of an aluminum frame to
match the build quality of similarly
priced keyboards the key caps are matte
black and the plastic fields alright
nothing to complain about the bottom
comes with anti slip pads that do
exactly that and the rubberized flip
outfeed help adjust the height of the
keyboard and it does a fantastic job
preventing the keyboard from movement
the keyboard comes with a wire key cap
puller a micro USB to USB cable and a
USB to ps2 adapter that helps with a
true and key rollover a micro USB port
is hidden underneath the backside of the
keyboard and WAAS has included a
five-way cable writing system for
flexible connectivity and do note that
this is a driverless keyboard the media
playback features are built into these
special keys and they can be accessed
via the function key as I mentioned
earlier there's an option to install
sound dampeners inside the key caps to
minimize travel distance and since the
rings are made out of rubber they do a
great job of muting the sound of scheria
mix which and that was the first thing I
noticed when I started typing on the
lost keyboard
the right circular ring means point to a
millimeter travel reduction while the
blue dust point for one very unique
feature that I found on the wast
keyboard was a di please switch on the
back the lets you enable or disable
certain functions it comes with 6
switches and the keyboard must be
unplugged when switching modes when
switch 1 and switch 2 is off the
function is a standard QWERTY mode if
switch 1 is on and switch two it's off
the keyboard becomes Mac friendly
reversing them turns the keyboard into a
Dvorak mode where all the consonants are
on the right of the home row and the
wild on the left when both switch 1 and
switch two are on you're initiating
colemak mode which was designed to make
heavy use of the home row which will
then minimize finger travel distance I'm
not sure if people are accustomed to
these layouts presently but it gives
users the option to experiment turning
on switch 3 turns the caps lock function
to control switch 4 converts the scroll
lock to windows lock function which
comes in useful for gaming and the
included user manual is helpful to know
how and what each of these modes do and
so woz has come up with an interesting
mechanic okie board that features a
low-profile design best-in-class
physical customization high quality
gold-plated switches that were fantastic
to type on along with the DFP switch at
the back for changing modes the plastic
is fine but we might have gotten spoiled
a little with the other keyboards that
feature aluminum frames and so it would
be fantastic to see material options for
the frame itself we were also surprised
to not see RGB option for the MX cherry
switch but that perhaps would roll out
in the future if you're looking to
customize yourself a keyboard for gaming
the wasp version 2 is an appealing
choice given the simple organ aam ik's
and no nonsense functionality so what do
you guys think about the wasp mechanical
keyboard would you spend the extra cash
on custom switches sound dampeners and
customizable keycaps
