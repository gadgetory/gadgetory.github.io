so guys I have to admit I really love
this notebook ever has one and now I
have an even better one so welcome to my
full experience with a Razer Blade 15 2019
advanced model this is the fully
SPECT out three thousand dollar machine
RTX 2080 there 16 gigabytes of dual
channel RAM 512 gigabytes of nvme
storage so you know we're gonna go over
performance cooling my experience with
the body 2
let's begin right after this the
legendary hyper 212 CPU cooler from
cooler master now comes in this
breathtaking matte black finish the
included Silencio 120 millimeter fan
delivers great airflow and reduced noise
plus you can pick up an RGB version of
this cooler as well learn more about the
hyper 212 Black Edition and its RGB
sibling down below alright let's dive
right in build quality is first I would
equate this machine to be like a MacBook
equivalent amongst Windows notebooks
simply because that whole aluminium
shell is very reminiscent of a MacBook
but here we have that black color scheme
instead of silver and no flexing
anywhere the edges are super sharp
thus the Razer Blade a name is fitting
for this sort of body and compared to my
recent experience with the MS ip65 that
flexes anywhere you press it this
machine does not and that makes me happy
but the black aluminum shell while
feeling great leaves finger marks all
over the place on the exterior and on
the interior since that is also fully
aluminum so that's kind of unfortunate
it is impressive with how thin the
machine is considering it has an rtx
2080 maxq inside of it so portability
factor is absolutely not an issue and as
a desktop replacement specs wise it fits
perfectly now your port selection is
pretty rich with plenty of display
connectivity and type-c Thunderbolt 3
which is awesome plus those green USBs
and the combo mic slash headphone jack
for headsets and gaming headphones
however there is no Ethernet that you
find on the base model instead of the
advanced model and no SD card reader
which is kind of unfortunate I also
really dislike the new power connection
because the cable is so thick now the
thing is you can route it either facing
the back or the side but if it's facing
towards you it's blocking the most
closest USB port which is design flaw
and while the power brick
self is pretty compact the cable itself
isn't because it is so thick it kinks
easily and just really really unpleasant
to travel with now the keyboard is
fantastic for anything but gaming
because the travel distance is quite
shallow so for typing it's excellent
nice clicky actuations fast rebounds you
know we can get used to that quite
nicely but if your hand is constantly in
that wast zone then you expect the key
to travel a bit more into the body while
gaming but it doesn't a slight quirk
here would be the awkward error
placement on the bottom right since you
expect the question mark to be placed
beside the shift but that is where your
arrow key up is located instead but I
love the lighting integration in here
with perky lighting customization plenty
of awesome effects I love the fire one
and the keys are super bright and the
secondary keys are now finally
illuminated the trackpad here is quite
large and is also fantastic just like
the keyboard nice smooth navigation when
there's precision drivers and is so much
better than anything else I've tried on
the Windows machine or Windows notebook
aside from like the Dell options like my
MSI p65 also has windows precision
drivers but this thing is so much more
responsive now the speakers are properly
firing up with decent volume projection
and clarity Nicholas
I do enjoy the built-in windows hello
feature here so we can just login when
your face but it doesn't find me
frequently whenever light changes it's
like who you are you have to punch in
your PIN so that's kind of unfortunate
and the webcam is it's passive so this
is the lovely 720p webcam quality wow
it's terrible and just for comparison
here's the iPhone 10s selfie mode much
better and my favorite thing about the
notebook is the display it's 144 Hertz
so super fast and food for gaming but
it's so much better for regular desktop
use and while editing it is full HD so
resolution is not a problem for the rtx
2080 maxq but for key option is only
available with the -tx 2070 models so
if you're going to fool out RTX 2080
max-q then you don't have a 4k option
which is kind of strange but I don't
miss 4k at fifteen point six inches full
HD for me is plenty and so the gaming
performance on the fully decked out the
Razer Blade 15 is actually pretty
fantastic given we have only full HD
resolution so not that many pixels to
push and the rtx 2080 max-q and in
games where ray-tracing is available you
know performance hit with RT enabled is
pretty significant as it is on desktop
cards so I wouldn't suggest getting you
know in RTX 2080 to play bF5 with RTx
on or DXR on and metro Exodus with RT
on because the performance by itself is
pretty fantastic
but as long as the whole ray-tracing
the--is scene is out of the picture now
one major concern when it comes to the
RTX max q variant and laptop variant
GPUs inside these notebooks is that the
boost clocks are solely dependent on the
cooling which is solely dependent on the
brand and so it's Razer's job to provide
sufficient cooling for the GPU and the
CPU to hit highest clocks possible and
so the cooling in this machine is
actually pretty fantastic my max Q card
never went above 76 degrees Celsius at
load and bf5 I was
constantly hitting around 1600 megahertz
for the boost clocks
while in other games I was hovering
around 40 100 megahertz so the cooling
is dependent or the clocks are dependent
on the cooling and the ceiling for that
temperature is 76 degrees Celsius for
the graphics card and as for the CPU the
temperature was pretty consistent
between 87 degrees Celsius and 89
degrees Celsius and constantly going
between 2.5 gigahertz and 3.9 gigahertz
so nice overclock on some course but not
consistent 3.9 yoghurts throughout the
entire session and it did vary depending
on temperature and the scene and also of
course this machine is fantastic for
video production just look at those
render times compared to my main
workstation PC and the msi p65 so it's
almost equivalent to what I get on my
main 9900K and the 2080 Ti so for video
production this thing is awesome
now this notebook has three performance
modes balanced gaming and creator and
balancing gaming and they're pretty much
identical in terms of powering now the
GPU and the CPU about the same as you
can see based on the fire strikes course
but in the Creator mode it significantly
throttles the GPU to 800 megahertz and
channeling all that power to the CPU so
it can maintain higher clocks so just
keep that in mind as far now as levels
the machine is dead silent and like
casual operation but while I'm rendering
or gaming the fans a spin up and
especially if I max out the fan rpm 250
300 then yeah the Machine becomes pretty
loud upgradability here is pretty
straightforward remove the cover there
we have the two RAM slots the top one is
covered by the GPU ribbon cable so you
have to be careful removing that and
getting access to that top RAM slot and
we also have that nvme SSD on the left
side and that's for battery life with
light usage browsing scenario I was able
to get just over 4 hours of usage before
the computer went to 5% and went to
hibernation but this is with the screen
at 75% brightness and 144 Hertz and so
at $3,000 this machine is hella pricey
given you can find the same CPU in a
notebook that cost $800 but of course we
have the RTX 2080 max Q in there
the SSD and this whole build quality 144
Hertz display and the overall package
seems to be very well complete I am
especially impressed by the cooling
capacity of that vapor chamber cooler
for the GPU you know reaching 76 degrees
Celsius and that is its throttle limit
here while the CPU you know comfortably
sits like you're just below 90 degrees
but still clocking 23.9 quite regularly
regularly I regularly and really my main
point of frustration believe it or not
would be the power plug cable that
sounds ridiculous but why does it have
to be that thick it kinks easily and
really does not suit the overall like
design that's been you know a thought
process that been placed behind this
machine and also the whole max-q boost
clark's depending on the notebook
manufacturer and luckily I think Razer
has done a really good job here to
maximize performance without too many
compromises alright guys so that is my
experience with the Razer Blade 15 this
thing will definitely be travelling with
me wherever I go because the performance
in this form factor is simply amazing
and yeah very happy to have this thing
in my collection now for video
production and also on-the-go gaming
alright I'm to me dream thanks for
watching we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
