all news gaming battle station desks is
where it's at
and so this is the level 20 GTR GB
battle station gaming desk for $1,100
are you want to go for motorized $1,100
RGB nests mouse mad built-in hyper desk
let me know in the comments there's also
a motorized less or manual version of
the same battle station desk without the
RGB all right so now let me give you a
live demonstration of this entire
ensemble of RGB sync goodness so we've
got the electrical desk we have the
keyboard we got the mouse we got the
mouse mat we got the headset stand we
had all the fans inside this in case we
got the RGB memory the tea forest memory
that now works with thermal takes our
RGB software and soon the zotac GPUs so
right now a thing is synced up in blue
and with a few clicks let's see yeah
boom you change it into purple it's very
interesting to do to have this sort of
like massive synchronization happening
across all these devices it's very good
to see you know thermaltake working with
many brands to just make sure that
things like that are synced up so like
the t force memory we change the GPU
separately but yeah everything
everything is working fine it has only
crashed on us once but that we're told
is potentially due to Windows but see
the keyboards synced up Mike how does it
feel with all the with all the RGB stuff
in your face it's intuitive but it hurts
my eyes
I don't like RGB are all that much give
me a give me a good self desk and I'm
good to go
yeah it is very bright we actually have
to turn it down because as you sit in
front of the the screen this area here
just blinds you your eyes a little bit
alright so this is of course a motorized
desk right now we have all the controls
on the right side nice little profile
controller box we have four memory
profiles you just hold one to remember
you're setting everything is visualized
in numbers so you can kind of know
exactly how far and how low you want to
go so the gaming desk has this giant
mouse mat spending the entire way so you
kind of have to go with it you know you
can't really remove it because there is
a kind of like a midsection right here
somewhere in the middle and this kind of
this like plasticy material but
the entire frame is contracted
constructed out of steel it can hold up
to 100 kilograms or 220 pounds so they
shipped a bunch of really heavy systems
on top of it it did not display any
bowing or anything like that so uh a
very powerful motorized desk now these
RGB light tubes are slightly soft and
squishy surrounding the desk so if you
have our hand over here it's not an
irritant you know it's not like a hard
corner so that's nice this would not be
a gaming desk without some chemo
measurements we have three holes at the
back one over here one somewhere in the
middle and one on that corner so you can
discreetly pass all your cables for
peripherals down below where there is a
cable catcher so you can you know just
have some cable organization and yeah
that is the panel station gaming desk
and two-component the gaming desk we
have a whole new lineup of level 20 RGB
gaming peripherals so starting off with
the level 20 RGB keyboard so this one's
kind of based on the x1 from thermaltake
it's got an aluminum faceplate with
floating key cap design dedicated volume
and mute and multimedia controls so
that's always appreciated there is an
audio and USB pass-through port at the
back of the keyboards there is a
dedicated iOS and Android app that you
can use for AI voice control so you can
say like you know okay Google or Amazon
Alexa turn my keyboard red or whatever
else color and it will do that so that's
kind of unique for thermaltake but not
really necessary it will be available in
three switches type so Thermaltake is
working with razer to deliver razer
green switches for $129 there also be
delivering cherry blue at 139 and cherry
silver switches at 149 so plenty of
variety for switches and price points
and one really interesting element about
the design is that sort of mid section
so there's an LED strip there but also a
little bit of cutout that follows up so
it tries to kind of mimic the whole
level twenty chassis design so that's a
bit more consistent and cohesive on the
entire level twenty series so let me
know if you like this design next up is
the Neptune Pro keyboard at $69 it
follows the same look as the more
premium x1 has multimedia controls you
know very kind of like stealthy design
nothing too outrageous definitely more
traditional look versus the level 20 but
still a nice new option next up is the
level 20 RGB mouse so hopefully they'll
have a nice quality optical sensor it
does remind me a little bit of the
SteelSeries rival 600 series it's got
nice buttons RGB illumination of course
and the mouse matt has the same type of
rope light around it as the battle
station gaming desk it's very large its
RGB this is kind of the target for
thermaltake and finally the ns1 RGB
headphone stand so it has USB and audio
pass-through on the side which is
awesome it's got an all aluminum the
actual holder because the base is
plastic has got an RGB strip at the
bottom of course and included detachable
cable so you can remove that if you're
traveling alright so those are the
thermal take gaming goodies gaming
battle station desk all the new
peripherals good stuff thanks so much
