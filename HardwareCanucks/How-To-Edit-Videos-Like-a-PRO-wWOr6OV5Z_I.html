all cleaned up so it's time to show you
my video editing workflow
I actually don't wear these these are
gaming glasses they eliminate the blue
light that make everything orange so
sometimes I wear them during the evening
just to make sure that I can go to bed
right after doing an intense edit and
never wear these when doing anything
color related so many of you have
requested to see my editing workflow in
Premiere and I have four main tips for
you today
organizing storyboarding cutting and
color grading so let's begin right after
this so it was kind of a love at first
sight you know there's really nothing
like this exterior I love the metallic
color the tinted glass panel the RGB
fans at the front it's basically a
see-through case and who doesn't love
that your graphics card can convert a
cool the top is radiator friendly and
the right side is so unique when exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
aged 500 P my cooler master check it out
inscription below alright guys so today
we'll be talking about something that's
natural to me but I understand that many
people's editing workflows are super
different so bear with me in terms of me
outlining my steps exactly how I would
start a new project from start to finish
so I have a main SSD onto which I place
all my current live projects and then
that gets moved into an archive but
right now I have a different folder for
this particular project so my editing
workflow and then into that I have a
footage folder into which I import all
my jh5 footage and I would label them
accordingly if let's say I'm recording
with multiple cameras those files will
be placed into its own folder so that I
can differentiate between the footage
and obviously one major advantage of
having everything sort of compact into
one nice folder is that if you were to
archive that thing it can be easily just
copied pasted into your you known as or
whatever storage solution you used to
backup your footage and your files and
that way if you want to reiax s those
b-roll shots or project files or final
rendered video files it will be all
contained in one folder instead of what
Ybor does having the three different
folder
for your footage for your project files
and then for your final rendered videos
I think that's a bit of a mistaken way
to kind of organize your files and can
be easily get lost and confusing if
you're trying to find something more
specific and so starting with Premiere
Pro every single time I create a new
project and this is to eliminate any
potential issues that Adobe might throw
at me and the name is Kim follows in the
same footsteps of the actual folder and
to which this project is in and ended
with PR indicating this is a Premiere
Pro file in case I need to search for
other projects that say in the past and
it also allows for that visual
distinction between a different of Adobe
projects so if it's an after effects
file I would call it a E if it's no
audition file I would call it a you just
easier distinction when I'm viewing
things inside the folder as lists in
just setting is this is something quite
interesting so there are multiple
options you can work with in your
footage so I actually create proxies but
multiple people transcode their footage
of taking something that your cameras
captured entrance quoting it into an
easier to edit Kodak I do not trance
cold because the amount of space the
transcoded files require is 4x versus
the original files so that means if I
should let's say 100 gigabytes of b-roll
that transcoded footage would be to 400
gigabytes and then just way too much in
terms of archiving so I create proxies
for better and smoother editing instead
and so I choose 720p centerfolds proxies
which are super small they're really
easy and smooth to work with and yeah
annachi is super easy and fast to
actually render out and they actually
have a separate SSD for proxies
specifically that way when Premier's try
to access files
we're not bottle linking any of that
bandwidth so inside the new project and
create a new footage folder into which I
place all my files and I don't use the
project media browser inside premiere I
just simply import them from a folder
inside my window browser and that way
actually allows me to see what files
I've recorded and I go through them and
I delete the things that I know I will
not be using so let's say I have
multiple takes of one shot that I know I
won't be using I simply delete that from
the folder and then I import everything
into premiere and so that opens up the
Adobe Media encoder which will render
out those proxies that I've
to do as an ingest settings and so this
allows me to do this automatically so
that anytime I import any new files into
my project those proxies will be
rendered automatically and I don't have
to worry about having to select it and
render the proxy for particulars
everything is being rendered in proxies
as soon as they are imported and while
this is happening I don't touch premier
because sometimes with crashes and they
would not recognize my rendered proxies
I would have to redo the entire
procedure again so it's just a little
bit of waiting time but the actual
smoothness that you get after you know
editing with proxies is excellent now
here's a tip dropping any of your files
into this little thing creates a new
sequence based on that footage
specifications so I'm using 4k 24p and
it automatically creates that thing and
then just rename the actual sequence and
I reposition it inside outside of the
footage folder so that I can access it
easily and you can see its main 4k at 24
P just a little distinction that I know
if I have to create something at 60 P or
1080 P time lines those will be labeled
accordingly and for videos where I am on
camera that would be its own folder
called on cam and that way it will have
the actual video file and the audio file
because I'm recording that externally
the clap
always helps to synchronize audio with
video and I used to do this manually
like align the audio file to the video
and Link the audio from the video file
and then do this whole process but now
you can just select all your files and
click synchronize and boom all you have
to do is clean up the handles in the
beginning and the end and you're good to
go
so now the organization aspect is
covered making sure that your proxies
are being rendered making sure your
footage is organized inside the folder
on your computer and inside premiere and
so now let's talk about the second most
important thing about video editing in
my workflow is storyboarding this is by
far my favorite feature about Premiere
and any other video editors that I've
tried Final Cut and resolve don't have
this built-in so storyboarding allows
you to organize your footage in the
order that it will be actually displayed
in your timeline and this way you don't
have to find the footage and drag it
into the timeline and then drag another
one that you think will follow up well
you can do that all inside a very
organized folder
you can even increase the size of the
thumbnail and your in and out points
inside the projects folder before it
gets inserted into a timeline so you
basically complete your entire edit or
almost entirely without being inside
timeline and it helps to save me so much
time and that way when it's actually
inserted into the timeline all I have to
do is just like refine those edges and
make sure that my handles and
transitions are all good and just for
reference final cut does not let you
organize and sort manually footage just
like you would in Premiere and that
means that despite its rendering
performance is much faster actually
editing procedure it's not as good as
Premiere and that is of course for me
personally
now many people get confused as to how
the proxies actually are displayed in
your timeline and when they are being
used by Premiere so by default the proxy
toggle is not inside the window so you
have to click on the plus and you have
to drag and drop basically customize
your little menu here underneath the
preview window and that way you can
enable and disable toggle proxies at
your wish so if you want to see the full
resolution file you can but if you want
to be editing smoothly enable proxies
and then when that's in blue that means
that proxies are being used to preview
your files and that means that you can
edit smoothly it's very slow to edit in
original 4k files and if you have the
proxies you can fly through that edit a
few misconceptions even if the toggle
proxies is enabled and when you're
exporting the file it will still use
your original file premier is not dumb
it will not you just start using your
proxies to render out your final thing
and just yeah make sure that your toggle
proxies
icon is inserted into your playback
controls so you can see when the proxies
are being used and when they're not used
and now the huge advantage with working
with proxies if they are on and you
reopen the project all the thumbnail
previews for your footage will load
instantaneously so you can resume
working and finding your files and
everything like that just
instantaneously as soon as the project
is open if the proxies are disabled all
the footage thumbnails will take forever
to load with original
files at least for my GH 5 footage that
is 8-bit at 4k in the 24 P or 30 P and
so that takes a while for it to load and
may take a while for you to resume the
edit even if the project is fully open
and so now with storyboarding out of the
way you've compiled all your footage in
order that you will see it in the
timeline let's talk about cutting and
color grading at the mi get yo in 20
minutes it's better to edit in chunks
anyway so I'll be back shortly and I'm
back yoga was great gotta cut my body
some slack I said so much speaking of
cutting let's talk about my cutting tips
so first of all if you're not using the
ripple trim tool you're wasting your
time instead of you know cutting a
certain portion and then cutting it the
next portion that you don't need and
deleting that file and then moving
everything over you just simply use
ripple trim and then move your file to
point where you want to continue on from
next without having to do that whole
thing manually I always insert audio
fade between clips and I set it by
default to do like 10 frames and you can
change the duration of that easily just
so that we don't have any hard cuts in
audio and just to helps to smooth out
any variation in volume for extra
dynamics between Clips I like to extend
the previous clip by 5 frames letting
the audio from the next clip to already
start to play before the video resumes
and this creates this proper visual
breakdown between my talking points
without slowing down the overall pacing
I also like to change out the zoom just
to emphasize the next talking point or
to bring your attention to my emotion
now you see this blue icon it tells you
if the footage or the audio are used in
your timeline and clicking it shows you
where it's already been used and I look
at this icon all the time to see if I
have any b-roll unused and I want to
populate it in certain sections of my
timeline so that I don't waste footage
for visual groupings have you seen get
into a habit of color coordinating your
Clips inside your timeline this can be
easy to assign to a keyboard shortcut so
for example my intro is one color my a
roll or my own camera portion is another
and my b-roll is another and this way if
you accidentally move one the clips
outside of where it's supposed to be it
might potentially signal your attention
to that area and potentially highlight
that air so you can fix it
now while cutting you want to avoid
using
crossfade transition especially if
you're doing things on camera it does
not look make sure that you're doing a
hard cut when you're talking to the
camera or actually just get into a habit
of using hard cuts more often so that
your composition and your pacing aligns
better to those hard cuts while cutting
avoid too much breathing room see that
was way too long a pause between that
cut so make sure that if you are talking
and there is a pause to continue the cut
now kind of appropriately so that the
spacing is natural and you don't have
those very long pauses that makes
everyone very uncomfortable to watch and
once the on-camera edit is finished I
insert my b-roll
that's already been storyboarded
previously so that all the files are in
order all I have to do is insert them
into the timeline and clean up between
the cuts and so a casual five to ten
minute video would take me about one to
two hours to complete in the timeline
that's cutting everything making sure
everything is flowing well and that is
because I storyboard in advance and just
simply insert everything into the
timeline and clean out those handles so
that things are properly aligned and the
pacing is good so now we're going to
talk about color grading so the number
one tip I can give you regarding color
is to use adjustment layers so instead
of color grading individual Clips
anything you apply to the adjustment
layer is already automatically applied
to anything that's below it so you can
easily do a blanket grade throughout
your entire video or like certain
portions of the scenes that you know are
familiar for example for me I shoot in
the studio with the same light all the
same settings so my white balance
doesn't really change and so that means
that I can apply the exact same grade
across pretty much my entire b-roll shot
and then be pretty happy with it
so I use lumetri looks that's built into
Premiere it's super powerful and I use
my white walls as the benchmarks for to
get that perfect white and I use the RGB
parade on the left side to adjust my
white balance between the tint of the
like temperature and then the tint as
well to make sure that I'm not too green
or too purple and then making sure that
my graph the RGB parade aligns
accordingly where those Peaks happen now
in terms of exposure adjustment I
normally just crush my shadows on my
blood
bring them to contrast a little bit so
that we have a little bit of pop in the
scene because I shoot in a slightly
flatter profile with my jh5 and to make
sure my exposure is correct I refer to
the luma waveform because my monitor is
color accurate and it's calibrated but
sometimes you need to know when you are
clipping the highlights and when you're
crushing your blacks too much and the
lumen waveform shows you exactly that
and once I create that blanket grade
using adjustment layers I would normally
go in and make sure that my clips match
up an exposure and color and do little
tweaks here and there if needed for
example in these white scenes one is a
bit darker than the other and making
sure that they match creates a seamless
cut instead of you noticing that one was
not properly exposed out of camera and
some of you may be wondering how I
decide on my grade normally I would just
add a little bit of teal or blues into
the shadows and lit with oranges into
the mid-tones to warm up that scene and
don't touch the highlights at all
because they're perfectly white already
and sometimes I would send in some
screenshots to some people and wondering
what they think about certain grains and
that way you get a little bit of an idea
on like what people like not just what
you're looking at but some people may
give you suggestions on like make this
scene a bit warmer it's too you know too
cool or something like that that happens
in my work for quite often the most
important thing is the skin tone and so
that could be a reference point it is
why I add a little thing on the creative
side because it like makes my skin a
little bit more pink than it is out of
camera it's like two yellow outer camera
which is not which is not what I look
like anyway but making sure that your
skin tone is fine in the grade it's kind
of like your reference point and then
from then you can add little things here
and there to spice it up if you want to
go for a particular look and so the
final thing is obviously to watch your
entire creation I normally do that
render it out send it over for a little
approval within our team so that if
there are any mistakes they're being
picked up by other people and so that
gives us a little bit of leeway from me
finishing a project and then from us
actually publishing it on YouTube and
for the export settings I use the
YouTube 4k preset because it's quite
standard quality is awesome but I do
bump up by the bitrate to 60 minimum and
maximum up to 90
and I renamed the file following
resolution the name of the project and
revision number so that if I have to
rerun the things in different
resolutions or different revisions I
know exactly when things have been
rendered and it's not just like a copy
of your final project copy copy copy of
your final project it is all by
provisions all right so that's how I
edit I hope this workflow video has been
helpful for you to maybe learn something
new and if you have any tips on how I
can improve my overall efficiency in the
timeline or whatever let me know in the
comments and in terms of archiving I
just you know once the project is
finished and it's uploaded
I just cut that knife folder into mine
as for archiving so that I can access
anything from that entire project later
on so I say absolutely everything for
future use potentially but I don't know
like 95 percent of time I never open any
folder once it's been archived so maybe
I should rethink my archiving strategy
but yeah that's it I'm Dimitri thank so
much for watching we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
