and today i'll talk about Intel ops and
memory in what situations it should be
used and in what situations until my
face challenges so in though often
memory aims to accelerate performance of
your system by Ram caching bits and
pieces of a most frequently used program
so things loads faster now it's not a
new concept by any means of imagination
but it is a new hardware implementation
that is fast it's affordable and it's
adaptable so let's talk about all that
right after this
you can only rely on the pros to do the
job with every keystroke satisfying like
the millions before it
call it close every key regardless of
your state kula master master keys bro
take it with you make it yours and so
this is what the Intel obtained memory
module looks like it's using a standard
ender to interface that is available in
16 and 32 gigabyte capacities inside of
which is intel's new 3d xpoint memory it
is only single sided so as you can see
only the memory is on this side nothing
here so until often is supposed to
actively learn your usage habits and
accelerate the load times of programs
that you use the most it uses algorithms
that are very similar it's not identical
to intel's older SSD caching
technologies and it's still not much has
changed you cannot select which programs
are accelerated nor does it have any
more features than as a d-- caching
you'll pay forty-four and seventy seven
dollars for those capacities and we find
that the 32 gigabyte module to be in a
challenging spot as its competing with
similarly priced 120 gigabyte SSDs while
the 16 gigabyte opting module sends free
of competition and just because your
motherboard might have and ends up two
slots it does not mean that it will
support obtain memory because you
require a z2 70 motherboard and a7
generation Intel CPU for opt in memory
to work because the microcode is
compatible only with that hardware
specification another most notable
limitation Intel opt-in memory is it
will only accelerate your primary boot
drive so where your OS is installed if
you have secondary drives in your system
when it has your game library or other
applications it will not accelerate your
secondary storage so primary only which
I would see is limitation enthusiasts
like to spread their stuff through
separate drives but this really comes
off can reveal the question of the
target audience for not really the
mainstream audience but system
integrators and the notebook space will
definitely you know benefit from Intel
obtain and I say this because Intel
often aims to address the slow
performance of spinning hard drives
without that chunky price premium well
hello people this is the sleeper PC that
Intel sent us with this in salafi module
a very unique
I might say you know quite old Wow look
at that paint job mmm
so anyway this beeper PC here well that
sound
Linus would be proud but anyway so if
respects here we have an ace USB 250
motherboard we have 16 gigabytes of RAM
wasn't there's the 1 terabyte hard drive
and then until octane module which is 32
gigabytes we have 550 watt power supply
very basic system so it's booted up see
how fast this thing boots with obtained
on and off and launched some games to
see if we can feel in your real world
acceleration three two one go alright so
the first test is the Windows boot test
and I decided to leave this one running
in real time as I thankfully forgotten
how long a system boots off a hard drive
since moving to an SSD only workstation
machine but was often enabled this is
after like a fourth boot here we're
actually pretty speedy at 21 seconds for
the desktop to appear while with opting
off it's a bit slower to get into
Windows but only about 10 seconds slower
and now for some gaining test now we
launch the game and load the save games
twice so things in cash into opting so
opening your hammer is much faster with
octane it's very close to a savvy
performance while loading a game save is
a little bit slower versus a hard drive
only but significantly slower versus how
fast the game loads from an SSD
launching virus that one shows similar
results with opting matching the speed
of an SSD while loading a game save
gives us only marginally faster load
versus the hard drive only but an SSD is
still far superior and this leads me to
believe that
opting is only caching some information
one is trying to load save games versus
caching a lot more into opting when
loading the game engine itself and you
can see that by the significant in
acceleration when trying to launch the
game is much greater with octane on vs.
what we see in the acceleration when
trying to load game saves and then
opening Adobe Photoshop CC with almost
all toolbars enabled there is a
significant speed increase to load this
program with octane enabled almost just
as fast as an SS V so that was all fine
and dandy and you can definitely see the
performance improvement with the
spinning hard drive and until octane but
we have some concerns primarily there's
no way to know of how much memory has
been already occupied by the caching of
your most frequent programs so therefore
you cannot you know how do you choose
between 16 of the 32 gigabyte models
there's no bar graph to see how much you
filled up and I would say for the
consumers that's fine because it's a
simple plug-and-play solution but it's
also is a sort of a compromise for the
enthusiast market who potentially want
to tinker with exactly what applications
you want to accelerate but none of that
is available so it's a simple
all-or-nothing approach which is a
negative and a positive and the next big
concern for us would be price at $77 for
the 32gb memory module you can pick up
just for $13 more a 275 gigabyte SSD
that is both faster and just you know
has so much more capacity that you can
use for your OS drive or your gaming
drive so you know alongside the hard
drive so it really kind of makes a
difficult choice on whether
you should purchase the Intel opt-in
module to accelerate your hard drive
when you can just buy an SSD and lastly
it's simply not wise to pair an Intel
opting module with an SSD because value
is simply not there so guys thank you so
much for watching it's been an
interesting experience you know learning
on what this thing does and really the
main downfall would be that lack of
software customization on what software
and applications until often accelerates
at least for me that is but what do you
guys think of Intel opting let me know
in the comments down below I'm Dimitri
of the horican ducts Ebert so yeah
thanks so much for watching we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
