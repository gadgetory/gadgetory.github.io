been ignored lately with all the amazing
headphones in the market right now
outside of a few higher-end studio
monitor options there really hasn't been
all that much innovation or movement in
the speaker space for some time now well
things might be about to change
guys meet the Sound Blaster ex katana
from creative labs this is an under
monitor audio system designed for gamers
who want to experience the extra layer
of sound immersion along with a few key
features that might attract setup
enthusiasts but first quick message from
our sponsor this Black Friday ncx PC
impact our gaming pcs featuring GeForce
GTX 10 series graphics are an even
sweeter deal with big discounts a free
course avoid gaming headset a copy of
watchdogs 2 plus even more swag click
the link in the description to learn
more the katana is priced at $300 that
may appear high for a gaming sound bar
however given the feature set and sonic
elements it is fair before going too far
let me backtrack my experience with
desktop speakers my first pair was the e
to fire s 330d it was a 2.1 speaker
system and I absolutely enjoyed
listening to them I then upgraded to the
bose companion 20s which is a 2.0
speaker system and while audio wise it
was a downgrade from my previous set I
wanted to achieve a cleaner desktop
setup and the Bose did look quite pretty
and there were a much better fit for my
setup let me tell you looking back and I
think that's a perfect example of form
over function I certainly don't have in
a room for proper studio monitors so I
was grateful for what I had then out of
nowhere the katana shows up at the
studio looking for a spot at my desk and
at first sight I was a little intrigued
by the form factor it's roughly 24
inches wide and it weighs about 3 and
pounds which isn't too bad and it fits
perfectly in confined spaces it's
solidly built and the company has done a
fantastic job of the compact but still
great looking design now along with the
sambar you do get a dedicated subwoofer
that features a large five and a quarter
inch driver housed in a wooden enclosure
and this connects directly to the sound
bar via a proprietary cable in terms of
connectivity the katana is really
flexible you get your standard power
subwoofer Jack dedicated 3.5 millimeter
headphone and microphone connectors an
auxilary input optical in to take
advantage of dolby digital audio a USB
flash drive port that can play music
directly from a flash drive and a micro
USB port this micro USB is designed to
transmit high res 24-bit 96,000
megahertz digital audio signals directly
from a PC and my testing was done
through this port bluetooth 4.2
connectivity has made its way to the
katana in order to activate this you'll
need to hold the power button for a few
seconds and the integrated display will
output the pairing mode and from there
you're just a few steps away from
connecting your smartphone to the system
basically the katana is very very
versatile when it comes to device
compatibility while in control the
source switch and lighting preset
buttons are located right beside the
power button the cherry on top of this
is the inclusion of a dedicated remote
that consists of all the basic controls
you need the layout is fairly simple and
easy to use you have the power button
along with the mute button right beneath
there is a base button that can be used
to adjust base levels followed by media
playback controls and volume adjust
buttons there's also a dedicated button
that cycles through different audio
presets a separate display on/off button
a lightening preset that cycles through
different lighting effects that I'll
talk about in a bit and finally you have
the source buttons there are four
drivers in total integrated inside the
sound bar the top to upward facing
drivers are dedicated towards mid-range
and the last two tweeters are placed
behind the speaker grille this follows
creatives trying amplified design which
basically consists of three amplifiers
one dedicated towards higher frequencies
one for the mids and finally one for the
lows ie subwoofer in total you get a
continual 75 watts of rms power and a
peak of 150 watts
feeding all of this is a propriety
soundblaster multicore DSP and a
certified dolby digital decoder this
pairing is supposed to provide
everything from fully customizable
hardware powered audio restoration to
real-time voice processing and 7.1
virtual surround sound 2016 is all about
RGB and that has made its way to the
katana there is a single LED strip
underneath the device and what else can
I say if you're interested in color
matching your peripherals or your setup
in general then this could be it
there are sixteen point eight million
colors to choose from and they can be
configured to the driver software
speaking of the driver software I found
it to be a hit and miss while it kept
crashing on my workstation PC every time
when I tried launching the app my msi
gt72 gaming laptop had no issues
whatsoever
remember I'm working with a pre-release
driver software and the team over
creative are hard at work making sure
the actual release software is free from
issues when the software did work it was
extremely intuitive and allowed for a
massive amount of customization taking a
close look you're greeted with the
dashboard tab that displays a brief
overview of the lighting the EQ and the
blaster X the acoustic sound engine
setting now towards the left you'll
notice a specific selection of
pre-configured audio and lighting
profiles that are optimized for certain
playback needs for example there's a
profile for gaming concert cinema and
night mode which dynamically adjusts the
volume to sustain that calm and relaxed
listening atmosphere you'll also notice
specific profiles for certain games like
Battlefield 1 cod csgo and overwatch
which is nice but I'm hoping future
updates would expand the selection you
can also create your own personalized
sound profile by playing around with the
EQ and the acoustic engine and that's
something I ended up doing rather than
relying on the handy presets there's
also a scout mode that enhances
footsteps speech and weaponry handling
but unfortunately this beta version
doesn't come with that option if you
decide to connect the microphone to the
katana there are a few features that
might help streamers have some fun like
noise reduction and voice morphing
capabilities both of which are
interesting additions just having these
shows how much time and effort equative
put into this product
the lighting tab is pretty basic to work
around with there are six different
effects to choose from and you can
adjust the color this
depending on your preference do note
that the direction can only be altered
with the wave preset if you want to
experience the full potential of the
katana the driver software is a killer
tool which could place it about other
options in this category I can't in this
review without talking about the most
important factor of a sound system the
sound if you recall the part where I
talked about my experience with desktop
speakers there was one thing in common
among them and that was their price
points this is a $300 system and
honestly I was blown away with the sound
quality coming out of the katana there's
plenty of detail and the high ends are
treated almost perfectly with fantastic
definition I didn't notice any harshness
or distortion at higher volumes and I'll
caution you this system gets loud I mean
really loud almost to a point where you
can use this as your living room speaker
to complement your TV the subwoofer
handles bass really well and you can
control the levels through the included
remote control overall if I would have
put the sound quality in simple terms
it's just amazing I even thought to
myself why didn't creative labs come up
with the katana before I bought the bose
companion toys and just to compare the
two here's a sound test
what was truly amazing was that even
without the system at your level it
still outperformed my expectations if
you get a chance to listen to the katana
in person certainly do so I had a great
time gaming with the katana too remember
it's targeted towards gamers but I
enjoyed listening to my flak files and
watching videos as well regardless it
was an immersive experience playing
battlefield 1 ambient noise along with
vocals were well-defined
and there's a good sense of positional
awareness which is always awesome
gunshots were powerful and explosions
felt like explosions thanks to the
subwoofer so overall i fairly enjoyed my
time with the katana many other sambars
from companies like vizio samsung and
yamaha are meant to further distance
listening however creative labs has
managed to design a system that can
function extremely well in close
proximity for PC gaming and still not
lose much definition when sitting on a
couch watching a movie so I think it's
safe to say that you can get a fantastic
audio experience for $300 believe it or
not I'm selling my bose companions right
after this video goes live because the
katana has taken a spot on my desk as my
permanent desktop speaker or under
monitor audio system if I were to put in
technical terms
it's compact well-designed and most
importantly it sounds amazing I just
wish the driver software worked with my
workstation PC but I'm hoping the final
release version could solve the issue
RGB is a nice touch to the speaker and I
think those who are interested would
enjoy color matching their peripherals
what are your thoughts on the Sound
Blaster X katana from creative labs
would you be picking this up for the
holidays it's a great gift for gamers
I'd leave over with hurricane axe thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
