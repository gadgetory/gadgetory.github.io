alright guys so right here at the dell
booth at the venetian at CES 2014 and
right now we're actually taking a look
at the alienware section and i guess
that you guys want to know what I'm
holding in my hand right now now I've
been accustomed to calling us a steam
box but it's not the steam box it's the
steam machine that from alien right now
we can't talk about specs we can't tell
you price point but what I can tell you
something playing on it it's one heck of
a badass gaming machine and as you can
see we have a steam controller over here
and it actually is very very very nice
to play with incredibly responsive it's
got a lot of tactile feedback and it's
probably one of the most intuitive
controllers that I've ever played around
with I'm a huge fan and as of right now
actually we have we have rate with
alienware and rate just a couple of
really quick questions for you in
regards to consumer response what type
of response have you been seeing from
everybody with regards to the steam
machine and your upcoming launch um the
response has been phenomenal ever since
the launch event this past week we've
been monitoring our google alerts and
everything else and the responsible for
nominal everybody wants it they're
excited for it that they have access to
all of their steam games in their steam
library in the living room what more
could you ask for except bringing you
know your hundred plus titles to your
living room with a convenience of the
steam controller so in one word can you
describe the advantage that consumers
will have over let's say consoles
backwards compatibility I know it's two
words but you know what will hyphen it
well hyphen it backwards compatibility
you know what hashtag backwards
compatibility for the steam machine in
2014 now another really cool thing is
that I guess that you guys might have
multiple different trim levels with
keeping it pretty tight now what was the
reasoning behind doing this because
we're a gaming company valves a gaming
company we want to be in the living room
with everybody else we did great with
the extra few
this is the next iteration of that our
partnership with valve has been great we
shrank it down and the the steam machine
is what you got well guys I'm going to
tell you one thing I've been incredibly
impressed by quite a few things this is
probably one of the top things on my
list right now I'm incredibly excited
the second that comes out I'm probably
gonna be one of your first consumers I'm
probably one of the first early adopters
to pick one up thank you very much guys
now let's go take a look some of the 4k
monitors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
