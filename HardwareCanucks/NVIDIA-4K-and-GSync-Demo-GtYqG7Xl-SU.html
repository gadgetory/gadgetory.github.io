let's face it this is just absolutely a
great time to be a piece of gamer yet
brand-new monitor technology 4k coming
out
4k obviously obviously just puts four
times as many pixels in front of you
than the Ford even with today's GPUs
four times as many pixels puts a lot of
burden and so this is this is a great
opportunity and a great challenge for us
to bring a lot more GPU horsepower
if you take a look at what 1080p looks
like on a 4k display and then you look
at it and or K the amount of information
that you get to see that's just a huge
step forward but we didn't stop there
when you get a chance go in the back and
take a look at the combination of a few
technologies that made it possible for
us to bring for case around to the
enthusiasts if you want to see twenty
four million pixels all rendered silky
smooth in 4k surround take a moment
later and check it out in fact the Lord
to make this happen of course the GPU
has to be able to support to this place
the GPU has to have enough horsepower
and one of the most important things as
SLI has to work perfectly this is one of
the areas where we put an enormous
amount of energy as you know getting
multiple GPUs to run in a synchronized
way and with this little stutter as
possible is very very challenging and
that's one of the hallmarks of SLI the
software team the hardware team was so
much energy into tuning and
to optimizing for each game and making
sure that the architecture doesn't just
deliver high measured frame rates but
also delivers a silky smooth experience
all of the work that we do all of the
work that we do to optimize for frame
rate optimize for experience
in the final analysis in the final
analysis the gamer and their experience
comes down to I think all of you guys
would know these three words very well
stutter laga tearing this is the bane of
existence of PC gamers of any gamers
this is a fundamental symptom of
computer technology that I'm going to
talk about in just a moment stutter
lag and tearing that is that is as
frustrating as undesirable for a PC
gamer as hemorrhoids
foot fungus probably acne of the human
condition
you can survive it but you like it to go
away it doesn't kill you but nothing
would bring you more joy then these
three conditions were to disappear
now you're asking yourself
but he did say now this is fundamental
to modern computer graphics these things
stutter lag terry has been the bane of
our existence for as long as we remember
what you guys agree okay I think you
guys can applied for these problems I'm
not suggesting you guys have hemorrhoids
but stuttered lag and Terry is as
frustrated as you can possibly imagine
more brain cells has been dedicated to
the elimination of these three PC gaming
conditions than just buying it well the
problem is fundamental in the sense that
your monitors be refreshed be updated at
a different completely independently
from the GPU rendering the GPU is
rendering into frame buffer your
monitors scanning help from another
frame buffer
the two are autonomous of each other if
you will the monitor is sampling what is
being drawn the 3d world that's James
longer because the sample rate is
fundamentally different from the source
rate you will have no choice but to
experience stutter and lag and if you
try to overcome it you will see turn let
me try to illustrate this very quickly I
think you guys understand this very well
but let's take the moment and just
understand where it comes from
you know in the perfect world in a
perfect world the way computer practice
was intended to work the GPU would
render into one buffer while the monitor
is scanning out of another when the scan
is complete it flips scans out of the
other frame buffer that is now completed
when that scan is complete it flips
scans out of the other free buffer that
is now completed multi buffering in this
particular example were drawing faster
than the refresh rate the refresh rate
is every 60 Hertz used in this example
could be re Hertz in high-end gaming
monitors using 60 Hertz here so every 16
milliseconds we complete the scanning of
one frame we flip the buffer the other
buffer is now completed when we scan out
of that while we talk to the other
in a perfect world we're drawing faster
than we're standing out we're always
ready for the scan out and as a result
every single 16 milliseconds like
clockwork every single 60 Hertz at 60
Hertz we see a new frame this is your
flight simulation experience this is
your game console experience for Dragon
games because they can control how much
they draw games could decide to just
stop time that's one technique or you
can have so much performance that every
single frame is faster than scan rate as
a result you have perfectly smooth 60
Hertz that's the way it was architected
that was way it was intended and that's
the way computer graphics was hoped for
but reality doesn't work like that
reality is that the game frame rates are
highly variable it's highly variable
because what you locate look at and
what's happening on the screen it's not
something you can always control if
you're playing a multiplayer game all of
a sudden there's a big explosion all of
a sudden there's a lot more objects on
the scene every scene is a little bit
different in fact it could be
dramatically different in this
particular case this is battlefield 3
running on gtx 760 and you can see that
the frame rate varies between 60 hertz
all the way down to some 30-something
Hertz there is someone who frames per
second it is very rare in fact that it
got to 60 Hertz now what that looks like
using the chart from the previous the
first slide is this
sometimes I control afraid in less than
16 milliseconds in which case the next
scan comes the Burnham's vertical sync
vertical sync basically says the GPU has
to wait until the monitor is done
scanning all of its vertical lines from
the last buffer before it flips not only
does it have to complete its all frame
it has to wait for vertical suit in this
case we draw frame 1 as from 1 it's done
within 16 milliseconds however draw 2
took a lot longer than 16 milliseconds
and because you can't flip until you're
done join because you can't flip to the
other buffer until you don't wrong and
once you're done drawing you have to
wait until the next vertical sync excuse
me
you scan effectively onto the monitor
the same frame twice this is a
fundamental problem where the sample
rate of the monitor is different than
the frame rate of the GP unit this is
really no different than when you take a
24 Hertz film you put it on TV and you
pan is slowly across you experience this
Jenner
every so often you get a few free choice
that stutter or what TV talk juggling is
the same thing we'll experience all the
time in these sync on systems not only
does it create that extra frame because
the frame buffer has to wait until the
next vertical sync there's the extra
delay now you could improve the scenario
with
buffering but then you just have another
buffer to deal with there's still the
same fundamental issue that the draw
performance dubs robbery is
fundamentally different from the refresh
rate as a result you will have stuttered
and you will have leg stuttered leg are
the two fundamental experiences of
anybody who has vsync money it's
independent of which monitor you use
it's independent of which GPU you use
it's independent of which computer you
use every single game basically has it
it's something that you can avoid the
only way that you can really avoid it is
to make sure that you're rendering at
some incredible framerate so that the
minimum frame rate stays above 60 years
so all you have to do is to jack up this
entire curve update where the minimal
point is above 60 and it will go back to
your perfect world where you're always
done rendering before you have to scan
out but that's really that's really
unlikely and in fact that's undesirable
and the reason for that is because we
would like content to get better and
better than better not just higher
matter framing not only do we want games
to play well and want the production
quality to be high we like it the fact
that every new Ironman just seems to
have a better than their special effects
we like the fact that Star Trek looks
better every time we have ever
increasing expectations of production
value of artistic value of the
craftsmanship of the game that we're
playing
and so this is a problem that needs to
be solved on a fundamental level now
gamers are smart they say hey guess what
you know and start you know bummer but
what's really a bummer is the leg and
what I want to do is to win and so what
I'll do then is I'll turn off vsync
turning off vsync allows us to basically
update the moment the frame buffer is
complete we no longer wait for the vsync
okay so the basic state machine goes
complete my frame update my friend
however by not waiting for desync
the monitor could be right in the middle
of a frame update the monitor could be
somewhere in the middle of the skinning
of the last page of the last frame as a
result as a result you'll end up
scanning the part of the last frame and
part of the new frame it's an artifact
cult area and this is how you ella
straited draw one while you as soon as
you're done drawing one you update it
into the scan however the monitor is
scanning frame zero switched over it
flipped over and picks up where it left
off and scans the rest of the screen
with frame 1 meanwhile the frame buffer
has flipped its drawing into the frame
buffer as soon as that frame buffer is
done
it says I'm done I want to update the
screen it starts scanning out to the
screen the monitor stops scanning out
from the previous frame picks up where
the new frame is
Alstom president you get this artifact
called Terry
that's what Terry looks like Terry as
you can see the upper half of the screen
is the previous frame the lower half of
the screen is the new frame with vsync
off you're tearing all the time it's
very likely that you're tearing every
other frame if not every frame and
sometimes many times the frame you're
just tearing all the way places but your
blackness as Louis it could be your legs
as low as you okay so these are your
basic two trade-offs be safe on and
vsync off the benefit of vsync on is
that there's no tearing but you get
stuttering and you get higher leg as the
frame buffer is waiting to be skinned
out or you have a frame buffer with
vsync off however with vsync off you're
no longer waiting for vsync you
fundamentally get tearing but your life
has improved
and so there there are your two
conditions that's your trade off and
that trade off comes fundamentally
because the GPU and the monitor are
times one designed by one industry GPU
designed by another industry as a result
the two controls are completely
independent of each other for the last
several years our engineers have been
working on trying to solve this problem
I've described the fundamental problem
and therefore the fundamental solution
will be related to that it is only
possible to solve this problem by
creating a new GPU a new monitor
technology
and software that integrates the two you
simply have to take a step back and ask
yourself where are these artifacts
coming from why do they come and how can
I eliminate the bane of our existence
nothing frustrates us more than building
the world's most powerful GPU beautiful
special effects everything beautifully
rendered and the sucker is tearing all
over the place there is just something
fundamentally wrong about that and so we
decided whether just a fantastic team of
engineers went off working on the side
trying to solve this problem trying to
solve this puzzle and it was a huge
undertaking you don't solve a problem
that's been around for 40 years
overnight and so they went off and
studied the problem and they came back
with a solution today we'd like to
announce to you one of the most
important works that we've ever done for
computer graphics one of my proudest
contributions as a company to computer
graphics we call it the Nvidia g-sync
the Nvidia g-sync technology is an
end-to-end architecture that starts with
the Kepler GPU and it ends with a brand
new technology
the g-sync module this g-sync module
goes into a gaming monitor it replaces
the scalar and a result of this g6
module we're gonna achieve some magic
that we're going to show you the results
bring you so much joy and just watching
smooth buttery graphics the results
obviously cannot be projected on the
screen because the screen does projector
doesn't have GC this is one of those
things that you have to experience just
give me a moment I want to show it to
you
GC starts at the Kepler GPU ends with
this module that is going to be
integrated into the top gaming monitors
around the world a sous Thank You
Philips viewsonic have already signed up
my expectation is that Jason is going to
be an essential component to gaming
monitors in the future and so let me
show you how g-sync works I'm going back
to our chart here's basically what jisuk
does instead of the monitor controlling
the timing
instead of the monitor controlling the
timing every 60 hers is a refresh every
60 Hertz is a scan instead of the
monitor controlling the timing we
transfer two timing to the GPU and the
reason for that is pretty clear we
should update the monitor until the
freighters done drumming and as soon as
the frame is done drawing we should try
to update the monitor as soon as we can
does that make sense
the logic is so fundamentally simple but
the implementation of it is incredibly
complicated and the reason for that is
because LCD displays that art has been
captured into our G sink model how to
control how to drive how to maintain the
color fidelity of all these different
LCD displays as timing is fluctuating
all are in place the basic functionality
of GC is as soon as the frame buffer is
complete we try to update the screen now
if we have frame rate that's incredibly
high if we have frame rate that's
incredibly high of course we wait until
the maximum refresh rate for the update
the maximum refresh rate can now be
variable obviously and so will drive the
screen as fast as it can be triggered
one of the nice things here is that now
the refresh rate and the examples that
we will show you later is 100
for hurts even if your frame rate is
higher than 144 hurts your leg
statistically won't be but if a couple
of to three milliseconds so lag becomes
very reduced stutter is basically
eliminated because you're now completely
asynchronous to the frame buffer we
update the screen whenever the frame
buffer is updated it and tearing as
fundamentally gone okay and so this is
what you think is the what I was going
to come in just a moment when we show
you guys G's ink and operation now we've
set up a bunch of monitors and sitting
right there they were quietly waiting
for you guys you guys didn't even notice
these g-sync monitors are already out
here in front of you they look like just
normal monitors because in normal mode
you needed to operate exactly the same
way as you would expect them under to
operate however when you go into 3d mode
magic has to happen experience it's
gonna change how developers think about
creating content how they decide how
much content they decide to put into a
game has a lot to do with the frame rate
and the overall experience if it is the
case now that you can have wonderfully
silky experience with even more content
and more dramatic changes between frame
rates gosh who knows how great
look what you guys were experiencing
earlier was gtx760 usually when we guys
when we give you demos we start with a
GTX whatever is the best but we just
chose a mid-range GTX 760 something that
we're really first of all one of our
favorite favorite GPUs one of the most
successful GPUs today and connected to a
g-sync monitor look how wonderful the
experiences</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
