great technology selection and service
hello everyone i'm dmitri with higher
conducts and reference headphones are
very important in providing that
reference sound signature so you know
exactly how your audio edit is going
there's no coloration of audio and you
hear what you're supposed to hear the
k55 3 pro is one of the latest aeg
headphones to hit the reference market
bring us an awesome looking clothes back
studio design at 199
and so design-wise aeg is known for
large circular ear cups and that
translates well into this pair with left
and right lettering imprinted on each
side for easier distinction and i really
love the combination of matte black
almost this rubberized portions on the
ear cups and the headband with these
metallic accents as well and it's like a
headphone is made for work and mastering
without being too flashy or flashy in
any way the build quality is right on
point for headphone to live inside a
studio robust joints flexible nor
creaking whatsoever the ear cups fold in
to lay flat on the surface and the k55 3
pro feel durable and they feel they can
withstand some non delicate handling I
sure think AGG could have amped up on
the padding on the ear cups as it's not
deep at all it's soft and my ears made
contact with the internal driver the ear
cushions are removable and can be
swapped with another AKG pair for better
comfort the padding of the headband is
also limited however the shape of it
helps to eliminate particular pressure
points and the light weight of the
entire construction is awesome to
eliminate long-term fatigue seriously if
only the ear cushions were deeper then
the k55 3 pro would have been a
must-have as a reference pair the cable
unfortunately is non removable I think
that's a limitation for a studio
headphone and it's a super long one as
well at 3 meters
luckily the cable is thick and tangle
free and then noticed almost zero
handling noise with the cable that's the
noise that the cable produces when it
hits something so it does not translate
into their ear cup so that's a huge
positive and these being a studio
headphone you will most likely have them
plug them into an amp or a dock
somewhere within your studio and being
the 3 meter cable it's fairly long so
perhaps encourages you to walk around
so whenever the cable hits something it
not translate into an audible
interference inside the earcup and
that's a major positive I tested the k5
5-3 with our Oh - Oh doc + amp combo and
being only a 32 ohms headphone low
impedance helps with mobile devices so
the sound quality is exactly what I was
expecting out of a reference pair it's a
neutral sound signature no coloration
bass boost is non evident and you might
think it's a touch on the bright side
but that's the whole idea of a studio
headphone to be detailed and clear I
really enjoyed the treble extension that
exposes all the details and vocals but
without signs of harshness or that high
hats with appropriate roll-off the
mid-range is right where it should be
it's not disturbed by the base region
lets you hear everything that's been
placed there for you to hear the guitar
solo and time by Pink Floyd was
magnificent
I felt every note and could hear the
supporting guitar in the background
clearly and I had to go back and revisit
the entire Dark Side of the Moon album
just for the k55 3s and this leads me to
the lower frequencies and it might sound
underwhelming or flat to individuals
coming from non-reference headphones but
the bass is there remember there is no
coloration so if you are a trends or a
house lover you'll be hearing the track
just as intended whenever there is a
massive bass drop it is controlled
without booming the mid range also I'd
like to know that the fidelity of the
sound signature is preserved even at
lower volumes so it's not like you have
to blast out the volume on the k55 3 to
hear the proper mid range and the bass
and that's so that's a huge positive now
the K 5 F 3 Pro is not the most fun
headphone out there for example if you
prefer slight brighter extension will
Sparkle the treble or bass boost then
the the K 5 5 3 may not totally suit
your preference and I really wish that
the ear pads were slightly thicker to be
a bit more comfortable
however for sound signature alone I did
really enjoy my entire music collection
from hip hop to instrumental trance
house and a lot of classical rock as
well and the
5:3 really satisfies in that department
but like i said again if only the
earpads were slightly thicker for better
comfort and I really think that everyone
should experience the reference sound
signature so we've teamed up with mass
drop to give away a pair of brand new
AEG k55 three pros so there's going to
be a link in description for you to sign
