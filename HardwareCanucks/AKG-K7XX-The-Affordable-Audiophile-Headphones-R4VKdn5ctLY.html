late to this review but I just want to
make this quick video sharing my
experience after listening to the AKG K
7 X's these open back hands are new by
the way in fact this particular model
was a collaboration project between mass
drop and AKG a few years ago in fact
they're actually reopening that drop so
I'll leave a link to that in the
description down below if you're
interested but these are actually
inspired by the 65th anniversary edition
of the K 702 headphones because they
feature the exact same drivers and build
quality I'll get into that later on what
really interests me the most about this
pair is it's priced at $200 and what it
brings to the table in terms of sound
quality and comfort now we all know how
master up is highly influential and
we've seen that with the recent release
of the HD 6 xx from Sennheiser for about
the same price as this guy but I'm here
to talk about the k 7 xx and why this is
one of my favorite pair of open-back
headphones but first a quick message
from our sponsor hi I'm looking for a
case well look no further I got this
beauty with all steal premium frame with
a side of tempered glass - beautifully
showcase any cooling adventure you might
pursue and cable management system that
you wish you had earlier the age 709
this one's for you
alright so the first thing that grabbed
my attention was the comfort level on
these headphones the memory foam ear
pads feature plenty of cushion to
prevent your ears for making contact
with the drivers plus these are over the
year type of headphones and the huge ear
cups provide a good seal around your
ears resulting in a pair of open back
hands that can be worn for hours without
experiencing any fatigue so from a
comfort standpoint these guys get a
solid 10 out of 10 in my books the build
quality is not the best that I've come
across on an open back pair of
headphones because the dt9 any premiums
from very dynamic were a lot superior to
this given its metal construction that
being said the plastic materials used
here complements a lighter body and self
adjusting headband didn't give me any
reverberations due to that material
choice I really appreciate the design on
the case of a nexus it doesn't look too
fancy and the all black color scheme
throughout the body along with the
subtle imprints like the limited edition
looks sleek and elegant the three meter
cable is detachable and the headset uses
a mini XLR to 3.5 millimeter connector
you also get a quarter inch adapter if
you intend to use this pair with an
or external DAC which speaking of is
kind of necessary to properly drive
these the built-in DAC inside my main PC
didn't do a great job driving these at a
comfortable volume so did my smartphone
surprisingly my iPad pro today slightly
better job than the other two but it was
nowhere closer to the apogee duet that I
finally settled on so if you really want
to take advantage of the open sound
stage on the k7 X's I paired up with an
external DAC or amp and you'll certainly
enjoy the experience which finally
brings me to my last point the sound
quality and man they're so good
the k7x is deliver a clean and balanced
sound imaging there's not a lot of
emphasis on the bass nor the trebles
which i highly appreciate and that's to
be expected from an open back pair of
reference headphones I spent the last
few days listening to different genres
like jazz trance chill-out and even some
groovy tunes as well all I can say is
that I simply zoned out during those
sessions it's the little details in the
mids and the highs that makes a world of
difference when you compare these to say
something like the HD 598 from
Sennheiser the open back design
certainly leaks sound but that's obvious
so I wouldn't recommend taking these
with you outdoors say on a public
transit because you're definitely gonna
get those looks but on the positive side
this type of design creates a wider
soundstage that really immerses you into
the music that you're listening to I
also had a great time gaming with the k7
exes jumping into a quick battlefield
one session emphasized how much I've
been missing out on open-back headphones
since by nature the wider soundstage
adds that extra layer of immersion apart
from the visual side of things just
changing weapons felt real due to the
immense detail these drivers bring down
the higher in frequencies and the bass
was exceptionally controlled meaning it
didn't sound overpowering but gunshots
was definitely present so overall it was
a pleasing experience listening to these
now while master op is offering the k7
axis for $200 remember that quantities
are very limited and that could be super
frustrating for some folks who are
looking to pick one up for the holidays
because they could run out of stock
instantly depending on demand that's
just the nature of mass drop
unfortunately then you coarser avoid pro
gaming headset is comfortable stylish in
different colors delivers fantastic
wireless performance even for
competitive gaming with an
new microphone for clear communications
check out the void Pro Wireless or wired
in the description below well that
pretty much wraps up my experience using
the k7 xx from AKG certainly these open
back hands are awesome for its price and
of course the comfort level is just
insane like I'm wearing it right now I
don't even feel like this is on me right
now it's just super comfortable I can't
wait to start editing videos on it and
of course to listen to music because the
duet from Apogee is actually receiving
the Windows Update next week so I can't
wait to pair that up with my main PC and
blast out some tunes and just zone out
and I think that's kind of one of the
reasons why people prefer open-back
headphones is because you know they get
to experience the immersion and the
wider soundstage and of course being
able to distinguish certain elements
within a sound track is crucial for some
people out there and given these are
open back reference pair of headphones
the balanced sound signature is
fantastic you're not getting too much
too much emphasis on the bass mentor the
highs it's clean and I certainly enjoy
it so I'll leave a link to the drop in

good luck I'm ubirr with hurricane axe
