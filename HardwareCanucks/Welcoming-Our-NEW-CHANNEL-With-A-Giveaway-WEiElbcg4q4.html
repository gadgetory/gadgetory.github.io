welcome to another video there's been
something cooking behind the scenes and
we've teased it in a few videos
something called boot sequence you guys
may have heard it's a news channel that
we've started aside from the official
horror connects YouTube channel and yeah
it's been going pretty well it's been
going pretty well and you know we want
to develop the community there we have
fantastic Canadian creators knows hey
what's up Dimitri in the audience I'm
snow's your host for boot sequence who
has been doing a fantastic job there
like really good election allottee is
fantastic I love his interaction with
the audiences it's really nice yeah so
boot sequence is all about delivering
like quick snippets of information so
you guys can be caught up to world
events in technology and anything
relatable to the new section so it's
basically kind of like a way for us to
diverge a little bit from doing you know
like hardware stuff and to also
delivering you these like quick new
segments so that you know you can be up
to date
the logistics elements are obviously of
course is that we would appreciate your
subscription on that channel as well
link below now in order to like we're
approaching close to a million
subscribers which is insane it is pretty
amazing and so it's kind of like to tie
in with that a little bit of pre
celebration
we're doing a giveaway on this channel
and on the boot sequence a channel so
Eber why don't you tell us what we're
giving away so we are giving away an
asus strix gtx 1080i oh and a ZOTAC gtx
1070 yeah zolteck GTX 970 will be given
away on boot sequence channel so details
on how to enter will be you know in the
description below but anyway enough
about us you know you guys been watching
us forever so you know what what Evers
voice sounds like you know you know what
I'm all about right but obviously we
want to give you a little glimpse of
what snows is all about and what type of
things you guys can expect from boot
sequence moving forward so without
further ado
let us introduce you it snows well looks
like you're getting a little bit of an
upgrade since this is actually a 1070 TI
what's up guys I'm Snow's host of the
boot sequence and I'd like to start with
a small set of tour roll it
all right I know I still have a lot to
learn from the Metreon Eber in terms of
bureau but just to be 100% clear this
channel is a part of the hardware
connects family we've been refining the
show for the last couple of months but
we haven't been advertising it now you
might be saying who's this guy huh well
let me tell you a little bit about me
I'm a proud connect who lives in
Montreal just like another member of the
team I need enough this guy and I love
all things tech and gaming I also happen
to make a little bit of music just like
what you heard on the b-roll with the
set up tour and fun fact I built my own
PC case from scratch although I did have
to destroy it a few weeks later because
I needed the chunks of aluminium so
Dimitri and Eber already told you what
boot sequence is all about and it
happens three times a week Mondays
Wednesdays and Fridays we've been doing
this for a couple of months now and
we've got some cool segments like Q&amp;amp;A s
deals that we even got a specialty
segment called in case you didn't know
and honestly this really is a community
channel I try to answer as many comments
as I can and I love the interactions
that I see in the comments section so
just to come back to the giveaway where
you could win either this 1070 TI or a
1080 TI the link to enter is in the
description below and the giveaway is
international make sure you're
subscribed to both channels and as
always stay frosty and I'll see you on

simpler for you click right here to

bring you right there straight up and

Canucks although you're already there

to win this you have to click on both so
just make sure you do that and I'll end
this video like I end every single boot
sequence stay frosty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
