welcome to another video there's been
something cooking behind the scenes and
we've teased it in a few videos
something called boot sequence you guys
may have heard it's a news channel that
we've started aside from the official
horror connects YouTube channel and yeah
it's been going pretty well it's been
going pretty well and you know we want
to develop the community there we have
fantastic Canadian creators knows hey
what's up Dimitri in the audience I'm
snow's your host for boot sequence who
has been doing a fantastic job there
like really good election allottee is
fantastic I love his interaction with
the audiences it's really nice yeah so
boot sequence is all about delivering
like quick snippets of information so
you guys can be caught up to world
events in technology and anything
relatable to the new section so it's
basically kind of like a way for us to
diverge a little bit from doing you know
like hardware stuff and to also
delivering you these like quick new
segments so that you know you can be up
to date
the logistics elements are obviously of
course is that we would appreciate your
subscription on that channel as well

approaching close to a million

amazing and so it's kind of like to tie
in with that a little bit of pre
celebration

further ado

upgrade since this is actually a 1070 TI
what's up guys I'm Snow's host of the
boot sequence and I'd like to start with
a small set of tour roll it
all right I know I still have a lot to
learn from the Metreon Eber in terms of
bureau but just to be 100% clear this
channel is a part of the hardware
connects family we've been refining the
show for the last couple of months but
we haven't been advertising it now you
might be saying who's this guy huh well
let me tell you a little bit about me
I'm a proud connect who lives in
Montreal just like another member of the
team I need enough this guy and I love
all things tech and gaming I also happen
to make a little bit of music just like
what you heard on the b-roll with the
set up tour and fun fact I built my own
PC case from scratch although I did have
to destroy it a few weeks later because
I needed the chunks of aluminium so
Dimitri and Eber already told you what
boot sequence is all about and it
happens three times a week Mondays
Wednesdays and Fridays we've been doing
this for a couple of months now and
we've got some cool segments like Q&amp;amp;A s
deals that we even got a specialty
segment called in case you didn't know
