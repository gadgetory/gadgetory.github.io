another gaming product from courser this
is part of their vengeance series the K
16 mechanical keyboard this product is
more suited for FPS titles than MMO or
RTS gaming and priced over at $100 this
sort of limits the market through only
those who don't mind spending such a sum
on the keyboard but right off the bat
they will not be disappointed
the build quality for the entire
Vengeance series is pretty solid and
that's the case with the K 60 the frame
is made of aluminum which adds a rugged
feel but also this unique look as we are
only used to seeing aluminum on cases
and once placed on your desk it's quite
an enjoyable sight and the keyboard is
relatively compact which is really
convenient for not occupying too much
space on your desk and the real estate
is not wasted and is fully used up by
the keys the mechanical switches used
here are MX cherry-red which are
specifically designed to be used for
gaming and actually not the preferred
switches for typing they do not produce
any clicking noise and are purely linear
and require only 45 grams of force in
order for the key to be registered now
this is considered to be ideal for FPS
titles as keys are pressed frequently
for movement switching weapons crouching
sprinting and all the other stuff and
having the tactile feedback when the
keys click on each individual press may
actually become annoying and now due to
such low operating force you may
encounter typos if you are switching
from a non mechanical keyboard and if
that's the case give it some time to get
adjusted to the feel of the keys now one
of the cool features that would be
useful during gaming are these extra
gaming buttons that are provided that
have textured and slightly curved
surface that really locks in your
fingers and prevents from sliding but
also is really useful for finding the
keys fast and getting back to the action
and the spacebar also has this textured
surface and combined with the WASD Keys
your fingers will have no problem
recognizing your way around the keyboard
the K 60 comes with a smooth surface
palm rest that attaches to the bottom of
the keyboard and is meant to raise your
entire wrist and support your thumb but
in our testing it actually got
the way most of the time one not gaming
and the palm rest also conveniently
stores all the unused buttons and
coarser includes this little extractor
tool that is needed to remove the keys
for replacement now if you do replace
the numbers one to sixty do lose out on
the keyboard signs that are usually
printed on these keys such as the dollar
sign the pound key and all the others
but if your main purpose is gaming on
this keyboard actually leaving a
textured keys makes sense but if you do
a lot of typing as well switching back
to the standard keys may be more
comfortable the keyboard also features
all the media controls on the top right
corner with an aluminum volume wheel
that many will appreciate and the
windows key lock button that illuminates
when in use the keyboard can be elevated
with four feet at the bottom but this
makes the keyboard prone to sliding and
is not practical for any use but
otherwise the keyboard is really stable
and should withstand any moderate force
when pressing on the keys and the
keyboard has an unusually thick cable
that prevents from tangles and it's also
braided which is becoming more common on
pretty much all the gaming peripherals
and it connects to the two years B ports
one for the keyboard itself and the
other for the USB hub at the back so
testing it out with some FPS shooters we
are pleased to report the keyboard
performed flawlessly for what is built
for the textured gaming keys actually
prevent the fingers from sliding off the
keys and the slightly curved surface
helps put finding the WASD zone if you
remove the hand from the keyboard which
sometimes can be crucial for quickly
getting back into that action and
another awesome gaming feature is the
full anti-ghosting support which allows
the use of all keys simultaneously
so you'll never gem up in gaming and
some may find difficulty typing with the
non tactile feedback switches and it's
all about getting used to and we did not
have any issues with typing errors so
the keys 60 carries a relatively heavy
price tag but with an aluminum frame
dedicated textured gaming Keys a compact
design any fast response cherry red
switches making
an ideal candidate for FPS shooters the
only gripe we have with this keyboard is
the absence of key illumination which
would add a bit more gaming value for
that extra awesome look and the absence
of the special characters on buttons 1
to 6 is a minor design flaw which we
hope course--a will fix and to conclude
the k60 deserves the damn good award
which would make many FPS gamers happy
thanks guys for watching and we'll see
you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
