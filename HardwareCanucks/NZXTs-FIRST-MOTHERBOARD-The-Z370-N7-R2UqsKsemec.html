connects and we're gonna start our CES
coverage of something interesting for
you guys now you may be wondering why
I'm recording our coverage here in the
studio rather than you know Las Vegas
and the reason is NZT sent there a new
product to me before the show and we the
team here at Harbor Canucks want to get
this coverage to you guys as soon as
possible now in the past we've seen case
and cooler manufacturers moving to
simple secondary markets like
peripherals and gaming chairs but NZXT
is daring to be different with their
latest introduction this is the n7z 370
motherboard yeah it certainly isn't what
you were expecting from NZXT but this
thing sure looks good subjectively I
think this is one of the best-looking
motherboards we've seen in a really long
time but will it be enough to actually
compete with companies like ASIS MSI
asrock and Gabe byte who have been
around for a long long time and have
some serious experience with building
motherboards our CES 2018 coverage is
brought to you by fantex Corsair and
Coolermaster with that out of the way
let me say that this isn't a review
since I didn't have the time to test out
the n7 before leaving to CES however our
motherboard reviewer Patrick is hard at
work overclocking and testing this board
so expect that content really soon on
our website physically the n7c 370 does
look a lot like the Asus Tough Series
ports since it has an armor like
covering that covers almost all of the
PCB but unlike the EZ 370 tough these
metal pieces are completely modular and
they aren't designed to enhance cooling
keeping with the brand identity the main
covers are available in white or black
meanwhile the hits and covers will come
in a glossy blue red or purple finish
that will coordinate with NZXT these
cases basically the hope is that you'll
be able to buy all the most visible
components like a motherboard case
cooling fan and power supply front NZXT
so everything looks like it belongs
together from a feature standpoint I
would actually call this a bit of a
bare-bones motherboard that puts looks
and compatibility with NCATS ecosystem
above overclocking capabilities more
about NZXT ecosystem a bit later but
taking a tour around the board or two
PCIe x16 slots that operated 8 X 8 X
when dual graphics cards are installed
there are two empty slots below the
metal casing and underneath one of those
slots you'll also find an LED post
readout
it's been oddly placed below the lower
PCI slot connectivity is a bit challenge
to since the n7 only offers four SATA 6
gigabits per second outputs and no
internal headers for USB 3.1 gen2 the
lack of Gen 2 support is a huge miss in
my opinion since if NZXT decides to add
a USB 3.1 gen2 header to their cases
fund panels in the near future this
motherboard will natively supported
there are some good additions here
though like the onboard power reset
buttons a dual BIOS setup a ROM backup
button and a real tech a LC 1220 codec
with aneasha on gold capacitors the rear
i/o is a bit basic - and it doesn't
feature any USB 3.1 gen2 connectors or
type-c ports disappointing in my opinion
by this point you're probably wondering
what makes the n7z 370 special
well according to NZXT this is the first
motherboard to fully integrate their cam
hue plus and great plus eco systems with
those modules natively added to this
board you'll have quick and easy access
to two lighting channels through hue and
six independent fan channels through
great plus all of that can be control
through can't of course even though our
testing for the n7 isn't done I'm not
quite sure if NZ sees exclusive features
on this motherboard will be enough to
justify its $300 price tag it really
does look amazing but actually taking
full advantage of cam and hue means
you'll have to remain in the NZXT
ecosystem while they do offer a ton of
products that's a bit limiting you'll
also need to go without USB 3.1 gen2
Auto overclocking capabilities and other
things these more expensive z 370 boards
are known for but let us know what you
think about this motherboard in the
comments down below are the sacrifices
worthy of the amazing design do you
think NZXT will be successful with their
first venture into the motherboard arena
that's for you to tell us i'm eber with
harbor connects and stay tuned for more
content from CES throughout this week
