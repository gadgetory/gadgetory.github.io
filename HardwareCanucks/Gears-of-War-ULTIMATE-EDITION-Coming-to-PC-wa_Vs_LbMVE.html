great technology selection and service
very excited to bring out the studio
head bacolus rod fergusson
Phil I guess just gets to oversee a
larger audience base second base so I'm
gonna leave this relatively open ended
tell us what bringing the pc gaming show
i may be announcing that here's a world
edition is coming to pc
let's go ahead and take a look well I
mean here's Awards basically the first
offense doesn't matter to round up
consulate NP but pc four theories which
is support and refresh your abs go you
know this work out some people that are
being supportive and why was the
children do you relieve what I was
controller so there's gonna be a lot of
great computers from visual meet there
for the pc players then without some of
the gameplay canta mando get your 49
that's for the 2006 yeah here's one 2006
in that year's one consumes 2007 and so
we got a lot of changes my organizations
you know which one of those things when
you have a game like this you have to
walk this line of nostalgia like you
know it's nostalgia is great but when
you ask you about to look at what you
may note in 10 years later it business
but kind of more contemporary horse in
those challenges like for instance a
five plate here or franchise what's
doing it for me but from the pc
perspective all those things I just
found out where he went for you but I
mean essentially one of the things we're
doing is you're taking a lot of a secret
every night or this or so they need to
enjoy it but being able to expand on
what you have in terms again you know
all the different identities but from
just an overall gain respectability
between the original to the way the
remastered is just we rebuilt everything
from the ground up you know we haven't
started the core stimulation but why was
worth 3,000 RSS fully the place they
have 90 multiplayer maps we got a bunch
of new motor you know we looked at how
people play gears normal today and we
found that TM was the best place a
socially and female was the best place I
competitively and so we took those two
most from your street and brought them
back to the ultimate edition so that you
can play the way they were to play now
so things like that a lots of the pleats
that walk this line between nostalgia
and contemporary shooter in 2015 look
mostly or features you can take
advantage of know it's going to be home
windows and well you know the standard
stuff that comes with
all things you expect the or take
advantage of Alton additional well also
now of course are there other things
with future that pcs and to the 40 from
here for franchise nothing to announce
yet so obviously they have to talk about
a plan great guys thank you so much for
coming out ladies and gentlemen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
