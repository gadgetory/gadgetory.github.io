ton of Nvidia launches but we wanted to
narrow our focus a bit more and talk
about affordable graphics cards the GTX
1660 Ti and the GTX 1660 are both priced
under $300 so that puts them in the same
conversation as cards like the GTX 960
on the gtx 960 and of course the gtx 760
so that ends your comments in our gtx
1660 performance review video got us
into thinking about this little fun
video if we took all of these 60 series
cards from nvidia from the last few
years and benchmarked them what will the
results look like one of the words how
much of a performance improvement with
these newer cards provide if you're
still holding on to a GPU that was once
affordable but is still you know almost
half a decade old honestly this video is
more about satisfying our curiosity than
anything else
so we hope that you enjoy this one but
first let's take a quick look at our
sponsor the legendary hyper 212 CPU
cooler from Coolermaster now comes in
this breathtaking matte black finish the
included Silencio 120 millimeter fan
delivers great airflow and reduced noise
plus you can pick up an RGB version of
this cooler as well learn more about the
hyper 212 Black Edition and its RGB
sibling down below alright so I don't
want to drag this out for too long so
let's take a look at some of the cars
I'll be using to keep things simple I'll
be narrowly focusing on GeForce GPUs
that have been launched between 200 and
300 dollars to chart a possible upgrade
path from 2013
until now so this is EVGA gtx 760
superclocked which was launched back in
2013 for about two hundred and
sixty-five dollars so a bit more than
the $250 referenced version but it had
higher clock speeds it was also a good
replacement for the gtx 660 series then
in 2015 nvidia launched the gtx 960 for
$200 and it almost instantly became a
hit since it cost less than the gtx 760
while offering more performance and
double the amount of memory again i'm
going to use the EVGA superclocked
version since it ended up being pretty
close to $200 nvidia started running
into a bit of a price scrape for their
next generation since the gtx 1060 costs
250
but man did it offer a huge jump in
gameplay performance in some cases it
was over 50% faster than the GTX 960 it
did end up becoming one of the most
popular GPUs of all time and still is at
the top of steams hardware survey so
that covers the older cards that will be
put up against gtx 1660 ti and the gtx
1660 so let's get at the benchmarks
starting with 1080p right away at the
start of these benchmarks the gtx 960
gives pretty playable frame rates in
many of the games it's lower 1% times
are good too but as the tests go on it
starts to run out of memory capacity in
games like shadow of war Warhammer 2
Witcher and Wolfenstein the GTX 760 is
really starting to show its age though
especially since it only came with 2
gigabytes worth of video memory and its
architecture isn't optimized for dx12 I
think a lot of people with this GPU
ended up getting on the GTX 1060 wagon
but if you didn't todays GPUs will be a
massive upgrade even if the rest of your
system is a bit older moving on to 1440p
and it's pretty obvious that while the
GTX 960 is still a decent card in some
games it's one-dimensional there's just
no way it can keep up at 1440p though in
some well optimized dx11 games like Call
of Duty and overwatch lowering some
settings could still lead to over 60
frames per second gtx 760 though it just
struggled to 1080p which means you can
forget about 1440p unless the in-game
settings are turned way down I also want
to explain that those fails in some
charts was either locked up or and
simply wouldn't run likely due to memory
limitations the GTX 1660 and the
gtx 1660 ti of course offer huge upgrades
for the gtx 960 and especially this gtx
760 but like I said before anyone with a
GTX 1060 shouldn't even think about
moving up to the newer cards since they
don't offer enough of a performance
boost so far the benchmarks didn't
really show anything unexpected even
though it's great to see the gtx 960
still being able to deliver playable
frame rates and 1080p we can actually
see why the gtx 1060 was so popular the performance
difference between the 960 and the 1060
was just so massive in comparison to the
1060 and the 1660 but this all leads me
to another question with the gtx 1660 at
deunan $20 and it's TI variant going for
around two hundred eighty dollars and
higher which one of those is actually
the best value let's start by looking at
how much of an overall performance boost
you can expect straight up the gtx 1660
Ti and the GTX 1660 provided about twice
the amount of performance as the gtx 960
at 1080p compared to the gtx 760 they
offer literally the same frame rates as
three or four of those cards sometimes
even more at 1440p the newer cards
really do pull away even further due to
their higher amounts of video memory I
also want to bring them the fact that if
you already have a 1060 don't consider
upgrading right now to a similarly
priced 1660 card it's just not worth it
now that I've said this age let's take a
look at the value equation since it's
probably what matters the most to anyone
who spends just 200 to 250 dollars on a
graphics card actually from a value
standpoint it's pretty much even between
the gtx 1660 and the 1660 ti the EVGA
Black Edition cars that I chose go for
around two hundred and twenty dollars
and two hundred eighty dollars so
basically reference price points and
that makes the 1660 TI 27% more
expensive but it offers somewhere
between 25 and 28 percent more
performance so if you can afford one of
these higher graphics cards it's gonna
offer you you know a perfectly linear
frame rate increase for the higher cost
another thing that he gets brought up in
our last video is the gtx 1070 it isn't
shown in the charts here but if you can
find one for $200 or less that hasn't
been abused with countless hours of
mining that might be a good option but
buying one brand new is just too
expensive right now so there you guys
have it it's really amazing to see what
six years of development has
accomplished in these super popular $200-$300 GPU market if you're
actually interested in
comparing older GPUs or CPUs from the
past to the latest generation definitely
let us know in the comments down below I
definitely had a lot of fun with this
and I can't wait to see what you guys
come up with
I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you
