possible without the innovative fantex
world-leading nvidia graphics memory
partner corsair and the retail partner
NCIX
along with silverstone and in win so
corsair is added a new mechanical gaming
keyboard to their product line the
strafe
it's priced at $110 and shares some of
the key features with the k70 like the
100% anti-ghosting with a hundred and
four key rollover programmable buttons
and an onboard memory Corsair will offer
Cherry MX red or brown switches on this
model the only difference between the
strafe and the k70 is the build quality
and lighting featuring red backlit
instead of RGB the strafe is made out of
a black textured plastic that is a
change for Corsair and the move away
from aluminum frames that are found on
the key 70 and k95 first impressions of
this plastic frame is an impressively
solid build plus the texture I think
adds a bit to the quality Corsair has
also added subtle side lighting that
will add some ambience to your setup the
keys are individually backlit and there
are a variety of lighting options that
can visually enhance the user experience
with solid gradient ripple wave and type
lighting patterns nearly every key can
be programmed with a command through the
corsair utility program the corsair also
includes an extra set of caps with
contour textures for gamers who prefer a
better grip and a key pillar for easy
key swapping now aside from the
introduction of this new keyboard
corsair is keeping up with the GPU
market as they have announced the new n
970 cooling market for the gtx 970 or
960 and the n 980 that is compatible
with the gtx 980
980 TI and titan x both these brackets
must be paired with the hydro series
liquid coolers from corsair that will
deliver much cooler temperatures during
load and allow extra Headroom for
overclocking or if you are just looking
for quiet operation the bracket comes
with a low noise floor fan that can
provide quiet and efficient air cooling
for the memory and VRMs Corsair will
include appropriate mounting hardware
for the hydro coolers and a detailed
installation guide which should make the
whole process easier these brackets can
only be used on reference cards and they
are set to be priced at an affordable 40
dollars and it will allow you to
transform an air-cooled card into a
water-cooled monster</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
