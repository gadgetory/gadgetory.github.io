things happen hello everyone this is
Dmitry with hardware canucks and it's
been quite a while since Coolermaster
has been under such a bright spotlight
what they're trying to do now with a
master case concept that lends itself
perfectly by the way for the PC master
case hashtag is a fantastic new way to
let the end user customize the case with
adding options coolermaster is taking
the modular approach mainstream and I
think it's at everyone's interest to see
this idea fully evolved into something
massive this is the master case five
priced at $109 and it is vital for the
interior layout and modular elements to
make this case competitive as a defined
S from fractal design the enthu Pro em
from fantex and even the S 340 from NZXT
sort of dominate the mid tower sub $100
option and so let's see what makes the
mastercase 5 so unique in the
marketplace
and first let's start with the materials
and build quality the only plastic
pieces here are the front panel and the
optional top panel mesh that are covered
by this slightly glittering texture that
also feels kind of course to the touch
you will notice these handles at the top
are also covered in plastic but the
metal handles underneath are attached to
the frame itself feels really solid and
I gotta say that I've missed the ability
to easily carry a case and I really like
this approach that fits in well with the
design the i/o is at the top with audio
jacks dual USB 3 ports that are dark not
blue a reset button activity LED and an
illuminated power button the front
filter is removable but I was hoping for
a denser mesh than that but this way it
lends itself nicely for interior
illumination something that I've taken
advantage of with the a few magnetic LED
strips and for front airflow a 140 mm
fan is included and you can add the
second 140 or 120 mm fan there and for
those not interested in the dual 5 in
the quarter inch drive bay above you can
remove that and can install this bracket
at the top that would grant you triple
120 or 140 mm nerd fan support and the
front taking a quick look at the back we
find 7 PCI slots with one safe guard at
the bottom that would let you pass one
of the peripheral cables through there
so there's no way to take the peripheral
unless you remove the PCI slot could be
handy for land events a second 140 mm er
fan is included for exhaust with
flexible mounting strips to maneuver the
fan based on top cooling configuration
and the mastercase 5 is elevated with
awesome case feet that are stable and
slightly rubberized that allows the
power supply to breathe and access to
that removable power supply dust filter
and by this point I was questioning the
uniqueness factor of the mastercase 5
until I checked out the side panels
so first the thumb screws stay with the
panel and I've said this many times
before that I want this to become the
standard for all side panels so you
don't misplace them second the panel
does not sit on some annoying hinge
that's difficult to remove instead it
slides back and opens a little and
stays this way until lifting off not
only does this make the panel attachment
hassle-free but it eliminates any chance
of it falling off during the removal
process it seems like a minor
improvement but it is by far one of the
best side panel designs on the case
moving to the top on this stock
configuration we get dual 140 and 120 mm
outs that are centered which means
internal radiator clears without the
radiator bracket is non-existent because
the height of the case would not allow a
top radiator to be installed inside the
stock mastercase 5 there is a filter
installed but it is behind four screws
not easily accessible at all and here's
the caveat in order for this case to
support a top water cooling unit you'll
need to purchase the top cover that
comes with the metal support and the
plastic panel to cover it and overall I
like the design direction and simplicity
of installation plus the handlers are
not affected and here's that modular
approach colormaster decided to take
with availability of the following
master accessories hopefully with this
list growing as the master case involves
the top mesh cover is $12.99 the three
bit cage is $14.99 and $12.99 for the
dual Bay the SSD pocket is $4.99 and to
finish off this accessory list for now
is a side window kit that is $24.99 so
it actually makes more sense to buy the
mastercase pro 5-4 139 if you're using
it 240 millimeter all-in-one cooler at
the top instead of individually
purchasing these parts to make your
build complete the mastercase 5 has a
solid panel but I really love what
they've done with the window that is
revealing the panel is still sturdy but
notice the tinted portion for the
basement is just tiny bit see-through it
could be a cool way to inscribe
something into it and light it from
behind plus it is removable to turn it
into a full clear side panel and for my
build
I actually kept it to hide the bottom
chamber and so finally let's get inside
the immediate reaction is I love the
layout 2 main chambers open and
non-restrictive front intake three
excellent rubber grommets on the side of
the motherboard
with two cutouts above and the bottom
chamber that makes cable work so much
easier the floor of the main chamber has
a couple of rubber grommets to pass your
cables or tubing through and besides our
dual SSD pockets as the cooler master
calls them and these are actually
versatile and how you use them the
intent here is to stash the SSD so no
branding is visible but if you really
wanted to you could populate each pocket
with two drives like I've done here
this way you get extra storage options
plus you get to show off one of your
drives and if clearance allows because
the SSD on the top takes up the bottom
PCI slot you could just leave it like
this for showcase and these brackets can
be moved behind the motherboard where
the SSD has to be inside the pocket for
the main hard drive cage the drive
caddies are plastic and flexible enough
and here using thumb screws to remove
the cage and reposition them anywhere
along the height of the front of the
case using these circular mounting
joints the execution of this modular
system is excellent as you can almost
fine-tune the position of a drive cage
for least interference with the airflow
and in the event of a front radiator
mount you can offset the tube a drive
cage closer to the power supply in the
bottom chamber opening up this clearance
for a radiator to fit with fans on the
other side of the frame and here's what
the case might look like if you
prioritize on storage we have 29
centimeters or 11.5 inches for the GPU
until you hit the drive cage and I would
say it's fine
for a mid Tower and taking a look behind
the motherboard what do we see velcro
straps for cable management which are
nice but there are no staple cable tie
hoops which limits your routing options
for all the cables and while the
basement is hidden by the tent anyway I
would have liked to see some type of
shroud to fit in front of the power
supply just to make a job easier and for
that basement to look cleaner and so the
assembly process was a breeze I like the
inclusion of this motherboard standoff
tool and while piecing the system
together I really enjoyed that removable
top frame so I could pass the 8 pin CPU
cable and the rest of the fan cables
behind
radiator no problem and here is the
master case pro 5 is complete I've added
some magnetic LED strips you know I
really like the roomy interior despite
the mid tower foam factor there are no
cutouts directly underneath the micro
ATX board but cabling still looks clean
and my main point of this content is the
centered top radiator mount leaving you
zero flexibility for mounting thick and
wide radiators as I said earlier cable
management is fine but with no extra
spots to secure cables on that entire
tray and at the end of the day I was
happy with the entire process and the
potential of where this modular design
could go because right now let's face it
it's still extremely limited for what it
is I mean the optional side panels and
the drive cages have been around for
ages and the top mesh to support the
radiator is unique but we'll need to see
many more modular panels for the master
case to fully satisfy the slogan of make
it yours in an extremely competitive
marketplace Coolermaster is making a
bold move and I love that but where the
sound dampening panels inclusions of a
fan hub and how about color options to
make it mine to make a truly mine I
think the most important factor
coolermaster has to reconsider is the
price because the upgrade options are a
little pricey on the individual level so
how about price bundles to incentivize
the future upgrade also only dual fan
support the top is limiting so there's
that lost water cooling potential and so
first what do you think of this modular
concept of starting with the bare-bones
frame and finalizing it based on your
needs and second how do you like what
Coolermaster has done here with the
upgrade options on the mastercase 5
