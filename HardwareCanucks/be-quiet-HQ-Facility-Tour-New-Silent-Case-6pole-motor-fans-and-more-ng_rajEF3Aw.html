great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Huracan
ox and we get a chance to travel to
Hamburg to visit be quiet
this German brand has gained an
excellent reputation from their power
supply's CPU coolers fans and now adding
a full tower into the mix so we got a
first-hand experience to see how they
handle their product development and
testing and how they are tackling global
expansion into North American market and
others we sit down with Chris to go over
our tour and talk about their commitment
towards German quality control so enjoy
be quiet as a company was established
actually in 2002 and and we would just
care about like very much about the
German market and develop the German
market a lot and yeah here in Germany we
have 27 percent I guess around this is
pretty much it's basically like every
fourth power supply in Germany is gonna
be quite and I think it's it's pretty
strong I would say you know you don't
have like similar of brands like this
throughout the world coming now to the
international development I think it's
very important for us to show the locals
in other countries that about our
quality about our commitment to this
German engineering this German quality
is this a meticulous thinking you know
what every little in a small detail in a
product so one of the cool things that
we saw here is their testing Department
so there are may Department is actually
very integrated into the the whole power
supply testing because you you you have
these Croma very expensive machines that
do power testing they pass through
different types of voltages and
different types of electrical current
throughout the every single line within
the power supply to test out to see
exactly where are their issues if
there's any issues and it's very
specific it's very accurate and
you can really test every single power
supply like really accurate and I think
that's pretty cool and these machines
they are very expensive they're they
cluster almost like a hundred thousand
US dollar each and and you really have
you know the benefit from okay being
able to test power supplies on the glue
in a quick fashion and really accurate
it's very difficult actually
without these kind of machines to
determine if you are ma is actually arm
a or if it's just you know that the user
disconnected cable or or you know
there's all kind of kind of things that
can happen that that user puts in RMA
through and as we have seen actually all
of the power supplies we tested today on
the machines they were all good action
piece hell but that's the problem now
you see that the most of the RMA is
actually still working classify the RMA
is also a two-step process so they go
through this machine the grow machine
the test the power circuit through each
of the the lines but then even if it
passes so the this report that's printed
based on power supply it's not always
printed with very accurate information
and so that get passed on to any other
technical support that might need it but
then you also have the second step
verification where they actually plug in
the system they have three systems here
high-end system a mid-range system and a
low-end system to test out the pad to
see whether or not the power supply is
actually working in a fully loaded and
operational system on the chroma it's
it's it's like it's real loading and you
you have like the real functions of the
power supply but it still doesn't say if
it would run with with a system because
the systems are sometimes like like not
really according to this into design
guides or there's like
some timing some signals or something to
the power supply on this is just wrong
you know different so yeah that's why we
have the second step these three systems
to just make sure that it's really
really running or really not running
here yeah but from the forty thousand
power supplies that you sell per month
only what about a hundred one hundred in
yeah yeah like a hundred seen there on
the under trace probably hundreds it's
not really much you know we have which
is a very good thing to see out of the
40,000 that we sell only 100 some plus
come back in many European countries and
especially in Germany we have this
really amazing our a system that the
user can just you know within 48 hours
you can have a new passive but
installing the system so we're sending
him the new one he just gives the same
guy from the post he's giving the the
old one back and then he has a new one
right away and like this weekend we can
like do this RMA process really quick
into and so the warehouse that is also
in Hamburg that supplies your bright
yeah we have this the European Central
warehouses here in Hamburg and we have
of course customers that are taking
container loads but since we have this
warehouse here we are shipping basically
everything from here because you know
you know there's just no reason to ship
everything to the customers directly so
yeah we see here today quite a few 20
supplies by the big round since
unfortunately the the certain place 800
our new first case it's not it's not
arrived yet you know it's not here yet
we didn't see that one but a lot of
parts
you know since we have coolers and fans
of a small accessory so there's a lot of
no warehouse here one of the coolest
things that I think that what at least
to me was your little chamber for cooler
testing and that was very interesting
because you you have these three bases
one of them was not functioning by the
Dooku's that we saw we're being tested
where you can regulate the ambient
temperature of this chamber in order to
replicate temperatures inside a case
inside a specific situation depending on
temperature or like your environment and
you were able to also adjust the wattage
being passed to the base plate to the
where the cooler is attached to there
for replicating different wattages or
different tvp's of a certain CPUs or
lower end CPU or an APU would say or
some high-end until one and that was
pretty cool so it's a flexible way to
test out to see how much cooling you can
actually acquire from different CPU
coolers that you develop I mean now this
is this whole system we build it
ourselves
and it's pretty cool it's a cool setup
just to see you know to test the
difference as you say you know you can
simulate the different CPUs GPUs and and
you can Oh with it with a specific
certain environment you can always have
like simulate the same environment and
and all your testing is basically really
the same ambient temperature and
humidity and someone isn't since it's
very nice and the data is really easy to
compare it's not like you know the usual
way you know like you should test all
the coolest like in the morning or
something you know everything at the
same regulators you know like in the
afternoon you have like different
temperature in the room again
just like this we just create an
environment where we can really
accurately test coolers in the system
right now it's a very small cooler and
and you can see we load it up to a very
high 300 watts and that was actually the
first time as he was dialing it in he
was like a the wheels or that or you
know yeah never done that yeah now that
we also saw a couple things so there are
new case that is being released
yes I'm paying 800 which we actually
have a sample stay tuned for the review
and one thing I did not realize as we
were speaking with some some new team is
how expensive it is to actually
manufacture the whole the development
process of developing societies like
that's why you know it's like this today
you have a lot of companies doing like
like power supplies and cooling because
the the tooling costs are relatively low
for these kind of products but for cases
it's just just just really horrible hi
yeah it's over ten times more to develop
a case develop tooling for the case then
it is for cooler because you have so
many plastic parts on it you know and
even you don't have only plastic parts
you have also the metal parts you know
all this now this is the folding you
know and the pressing and so on is like
so much being done on these kind of
things and that's why it's so expensive
it is also awesome to see companies like
be quiet that are in the power supply
business in the cool business that they
are expanding the category to
potentially complementing or all the
other
exactly much like like this now we can
fully concentrate on on our basic
philosophy is the silence you know to to
bring the side of the noise of your PC
down to a minimum and I think that it
was long overdue that we did a case and
huh
now for the fan selection for big quiet
is also very diverse so there are two
things that I want to mention is one of
them is that you guys are potentially
thinking of adding a little spice to the
fan with the addition of this colorful
rubber band the general idea for us is
like stealthy silent you know something
you know let's don't see so we basically
like have everything in black and you
know like colorful options for us was
just not really an option for until now
you know and you've seen we developed
some in this direction and then you know
we will definitely try it at some point
and in this another thing is that be
quiet is the another company
aside from noir to our that is also
releasing this six-step fan but we first
had those in our coolers actually
we first took the technology and
implemented that into our fans and now
we designed the whole fan around it and
that will be the Solomons 3 fan right
now we still have the Sullivans 2 in the
market we have already the whole
Salomon's 3 fan basically inside it's
not like you know some shapes are so
different but it's like the six-four
motor and you can really hear the
difference because the six promoter is
just such an innovation you know it's
such it's it's dramatically less noisy
than than any other fan and so the six
promoter that means that the spacing
between the magnet is significantly
reduced therefore and that's one thing
that I was asking as to why that matters
but because the spacing as much is less
the friction between the fan yeah just
checking noise when the there's these
four magnets and when the magnetism
because that's trial that's creating the
rotation actually from the fan and me
when it's jumping to the next magnet
then it's just creating this ticking
noise yeah and when you have like six
one of those and it's like you make very
many many small steps so the ticks are
mantras it's just and we just want to
hear it you know it's just just less
audible to make many small steps and
that's why this day like this the motors
was definitely a really dramatic change
right and then one last thing that we
saw here was your new power supply
technical lab where there was all kinds
of it today Hardware everywhere but we
will also know the testing machine that
tests for power supply quality the all
the all the components and their
engineers here they pull things apart
and they modified some of the designs
based on what they think is more
appropriate than just a crude part we
have guys here in Germany
the technical people who are developing
the power surprise and and they have all
these ideas and they were basically the
ones for example who created this
straight design for the fan grills on
the power supplies before everyone else
copied them and and they were like like
designing with wood like different kinds
of fan grills you know and and tested
how the how the air is going through and
what noise it's gone to is going to be
created and how the airflow will go
through and so on they really tested
these ones and we had these plates and
they put them on the power supply to
really test everything how it's working
in and this is how basically the whole
new design was developed it is an
interesting insight as to sort of how is
something that consumers don't get to
see very often you'll get to the heart
of of the design process and or get to a
heart of seeing how a cooler has
progressed and how certain things you've
changed where you change the aluminum
backplate or the top plate that goes up
to a cooler or how you changed the
aluminum caps on top of the heat pipes
and how these kind of small details you
know that's what I said about this
meticulous thinking you know it's like
these kind of small details and I think
it's really important that in the end
you have a product that it's like just
like perfect and he's really awesome is
it's looking good and performance is
good and like every step on the way you
know makes the product really great and
when you take the black for example I've
seen the shadow of slim the development
stages there it's just looking phenomena
in the
you know you can see the difference yeah
and one cool thing is that you also test
out your competitors coolers and that's
a you have a big massive cupboard with
them and they're not afraid to show it
to say that yes we are testing them
versus our coolers to see exactly what
the performance is different you always
to know what the competition is doing
yeah it's like like no there's no shame
in hiding it right yeah I think that
that would be it for for this tour I
mean we've seen a lot of cool stuff here
