really get up cuz you wanna sleep over
but this CES has been quiet incredible
teamwork has been a hundred percent
thank you guys so much and this is the
first time ever like in our history of
show coverage that we have uploaded and
scheduled all of our content so this is
the last day yeah all right so now we're
gonna go have some fun
goodbye half suite no way of going back
you boys ready
and as usual big thanks to our sponsors
for making see as possible Razer
Coursera fantex MSI and Thermaltake so
this is our car rental let's go to the
Hoover Dam renting a car with average
stove they put no damage on our weight
waiver but we clearly see little Dinks
and car scratches on the hood so I'm
gonna keep the car someone keep the car
and also the rear bumper is slightly
damaged as well come on
so this would be the first time we've
ever gone out of Las Vegas
you know Las Vegas trip I'm excited to
see the Hoover Dam you guys yeah first
I'm excited first time just being
outside
I mean it's technically our very first
road trip but if you must mean it's
pretty awesome just the three of us
and we're here the Hoover Dam the dried
up here was actually pretty beautiful oh
oh well everything in here Michael was
just saying that everything looks like
it's a set in the movie it's all
monotone it's the same same color oh wow
the damage huge it's phenomenal we see
the actual fool damn baby oh yeah it's
huge it's huge
so Michael over here being a risk taker
has his phone above the bar it's only a
toe p3t so it's okay the people are this
big from where we're standing oh my god
can't I can't again watch this yeah it
is strange how everybody is on the other
side you know standing on top of the dam
I'm sure it's beautiful and you get that
huge roll off with a with the elevation
man the scale over here when you're in
this fastness yeah it messes with your
head because you're like I can just walk
over there but just miles and miles and
miles
the wall you don't know what seaboard Oh
God
all right I think this this needs a nice
Bureau sequence certainly all right
so far this day is damn good
I would agree 100% all of a sudden my
energy levels are like spiking up
anything I'm getting I know once you're
outside of them will travel you're like
mmm
let's do stuff you know it's all rock
and people and some palm trees of course
all these pictures you know when you
were looking over the edge it's so high
up not comfortable so right now we are
in between time we're in the middle of
the bridge we have a resort time in
front of us and we have Nevada time
behind us which is Pacific so there's
literally an hour between I don't know
these like a hundred meters the perfect
opportunity for panorama Mike's going at
it but look at this view it's a gorgeous
we are on the other side of the dam that
you don't lay to write one hour later
but the thing is it's just it's sold
it's so deep but you don't realize how
deep it is the barriers are not even
that tall I'm afraid to move the camera
yeah it's it's the cameras they don't do
justice at all it's you really have to
witness this in person so I would say
our first outing outside of Las Vegas
you know outside of the Las Vegas
Boulevard has been a success what do you
guys think it was amazing I really
enjoyed it yeah will you go back oh yeah
here no it's a great question yeah I
come here every day
it's Hoover Dam not the Hoover Dam
it's the Hoover Dam its Hoover Dam it's
not that okay it's keepers
so going to the airport in half an hour
but first we gotta have some lunch this
is the cheapest lunch option that we've
got me here in Vegas you know usually
spend like 60 bucks in Starbucks in the
morning all this versatility
Wow so it is exactly 3 o'clock or our to
58 and we set out for the Hoover Dam and
thinking we have to be here back for 3
o'clock the airport Wow I think we're
pretty fantastic with timing not just in
the end of the trip but throughout all
that Michael thank you
so sad to be leaving you guys
at least I'm leaving first and not like
saying goodbye to you you know
well not saying goodbye to you and like
having to wait for Mike stop let's do
one this boom by D safe flight by the
way ever get in the car alright see you
guys
you guys better drive off quickly
because you know so the tears don't come
down or I don't see the tears on either
I might like I know I should go I choose
get back inside my guy now we're gonna
watch them be all sad as they drive away
alright let's go check in arguing also
since Dimitri is off to Bulgaria we
decided to go bowling without I'm sorry
but we do this and
I'll let you know how it goes out for
its I totally smoked it
I've never bowled before us yeah and
this is my third time bowling know me I
go bowling with my family but Wow
but next time we have to equal T - so
you guys can see who's the best among a
few of us it'll be it'll be so yeah
alright so I will chin to plants we
decided to stop by the pre-match
experience
it's very wild its yeah
okay so we made it to the airports
surprisingly it's very it's very dead in
here
although I mean it's normally I guess
it's the weekend so we expect it to be
quite packed but that's not the case
next up is Montreal and we will see you
there yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
