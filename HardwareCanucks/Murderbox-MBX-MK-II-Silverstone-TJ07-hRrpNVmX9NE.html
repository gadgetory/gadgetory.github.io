thanks to the following sponsors
show them some love for helping us get
here to Taipei during our visit at
Silverstone booth on display they had
the latest built by Charles from X forma
so this is the murder box a mark - I
don't think I can call it just a build
or just the case but the entire motor
box project is an amazing piece of art
developed inside the iconic Silverstone
tjo 7 the murder box is 5 years in
development and the goal here is to
achieve the most perfect case in the
market and this collaboration between
Silverstone and X forma has given a
whole new meaning of merging art with
hardware some of the most noticeable
features is the aluminum unibody so the
entire bottom front and top is one piece
of sandblasted thick aluminium and gives
the case this unique look plus the
integration of front cutouts with
backlight to match the cooler of the
loop it just looks gorgeous especially
because of the fade on the inside
charles has built this awesome orange
themed water cooling system gtx 980 s in
sli with EK water blocks new ddr4 ram
from corsair and the orange themed
motherboard from gigabyte the x99
champion and of course the massive 420
million radiator the bottom chamber so
that's what the TJ o7 has become known
for the floor of the main chamber is
actually lit up so in darker
environments of the hardware will be
softly lit from below the entire back
panel has changed as well now
integrating this curved ventilation to
complement the rest of the design bust
check out that top panel and the
frameless fans at first glance I was
confused but I really appreciate the
beautiful execution
something else I was confused about was
the cable management behind the rear
panel or the ridiculously well managed
cables coming out from the power supply
area and the pre routed and
pre-installed cables for the drive cage
above and the front IO cables in the
bottom portion so all I can say is I'm
so happy to have seen the murder box
mark 2 in person the attention to detail
on every single element of this case and
every level of production deserves your
thumbs up for silverstone and ex forma
for giving us art to build inside</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
