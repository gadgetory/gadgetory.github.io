made possible by the insanely innovative
fantex and the always incredible Corsair
so gigabyte today showed off a few
awesome products that the first one that
caught our eyes was the brand-new x99
SOC champion now it has been developed
and built to become the sort of ultimate
overclocking tool built with the server
grade components like server level
chokes high quality post caps and longer
living solid black caps now this board
has the tools needed to ensure stable
power delivery and regulation to the
most important components in your build
most importantly gigabyte was celebrated
for offering consumers the option on the
type of socket that they want to use its
competitors have launched the 2083
socket which has the extra pins which
enhance overclocking stability and
ability to overclock actually let a move
that wasn't really popular with Intel
however gigabyte decided to offer a
switch that would allow users to select
the socket type that they want to use
therefore giving the consumers the
option to decide if they want to use the
additional pins to their advantage now
looks wise the port looks very standard
it does stand out with that classic
gigabyte orange accents and the four
ddr4 dimm slots there's also four PCI
slots for total 320 gigabits of
bandwidth so not very different from
many other boards for more details
please stay tuned for our upcoming
review of this board at our website at
harbor Canucks comm thanks for watching
and stay tuned for the rest of our CES
