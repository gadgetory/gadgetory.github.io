hardware connects and today is Radeon
seven on Boxing Day and as you can see
there are no signs of Radeon seven in
this setup as you can see they're just
components saying wide beside me because
we decided to do something a little bit
different or I guess something that
probably makes sense and that is to do a
built do a build featuring the Radeon
seven and this all started initially
with an idea that we had in mind which
was to set up a triple screen or triple
monitor setup and I just wanted to
quickly put together something that can
power and drive the three displays three
1080p displays that is and I think by
the time you're watching this video that
video might have went live so if you're
interested in checking that out link is
right over here but as I was building
that system I realized since it just
aesthetically looked amazing so I
thought I might as well just share with
you guys because you know it is an all
and II system and it featured the Radeon
seven so let's go over the components
and all the other stuff right after this
welcome the entire H series from NZXT
we're in the most elegant case lineups
with the premium construction you'll
appreciate and the little details like
purple USB ports per fret shroud floor
and the iconic cable cover we've got an
ITX option the h200 your standard ATX
mid tower to each 500 in the big guns
the H 700 all available with a smart
device for RGB illumination and fan
control or the standard variations with
a smart interior to complement an easy
assembly the Aged series is Hardware
canucks approved and is something for
everyone check it out below alright so
let's kick things off with the processor
I chose the Rison 520 600 X it is an
awesome CPU for the price because you
get six cores 12 threads you can also do
a little bit of or clocking with it as
well the 2600 is also a great option if
you're looking for an alternative for
the motherboard I chose the MSI B 450
tomahawk and the reason why I chose this
particular boat is because the case of
choice which I'll talk about later in
the video
matches perfectly with this board and
the grey on grey color scheme it just
looks perfect
it's like match made in heaven that's
what I want to put it that way but when
you look at the final footage I think
you'll probably understand what I mean
talking about so that's the board we're
gonna be using to cool the risin risin
520 600 X I went with the castle 240 RGB
from deep coal and the reason why
wouldn't this cooler is because it was
lying around the studio and I been
barely haven't touched it at all so I
decided to throw this into the build but
interestingly enough the actual CPU
block is also great in color and that
happened to match the build as well so
everything seemed to be coming together
really well and you know I love the fact
that it comes with also it also comes
with RGB lighting so you can you know
customize it to the colors you want
although keep in mind that I'm not going
to be using I'm not gonna using a lot of
RGB lights in this build I just want to
keep it as clean and simple as possible
so that's the way we're gonna do it now
in terms of memory I chose team groups
Pro dark 16-gigabyte kit clocked at 3200
Hertz remember Rison does perform better
with faster memory speeds so that's one
of the reasons why I chose this and the
other is of course the design and just
the way how it looks it just matches the
tomahawk board and the case really well
it doesn't have any RGB lighting which
is awesome and I don't know it just
looks clean and minimalistic I love I
love how these look I wish I had a 64
gigabyte kit that I can throw into my
workstation PC but yeah these kits look
awesome and I can't wait to put them in
when we have to storage I had a lot of
options to go with in terms of the
primary boot drive but I decided to use
this 960 pro and gave me SSD that I
picked up for boxing day for a really
good price and you know this also
matches really well with the rest of the
color scheme that were going for and of
course you're getting faster we didn't
write performance as well but if you're
looking for something that's relatively
new the 970 Pro is out in the market as
well or the 97 Evo those are great
drives as well and we'll leave links to
all of the components mentioned in this
build in the description down below now
for storing my game library I decided to
throw in a Western Digital one terabyte
blue caviar hard drive now powering this
entire build is be quite straight power
700 watt any plus gold PSU its semi
modular and it just is adequate enough
to power the Radeon seven and the other
components now you're probably wondering
there's something missing here in the
setup
that's the case and the GPU first and
foremost I can't really fit all that
stuff in this small table so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna bring these boxes
I'm just gonna move them so that I can
create some space to do my very short
unboxing of they're waiting on seven I
get this big box
you know you unbox it like that or you
open it up and there it is that's the
way on seven and if you need to know
everything about this card we actually
did an explained video so you can
actually check that out right over here
we go over all the specs and the
architecture and the disappointment in
terms of why we haven't received Nabi
yet but yeah if you're interested in
that link right over there well that was
a quick unboxing of the Radeon 7s
enjoyed that but moving on to the case
of choice for this build it is the
fantex P 600 s and the reason why I
chose this is just because of the color
and the build quality and just a way how
fan text is designed this case first and
foremost are these swiveling sight
panels that actually don't require thumb
screws to get access to the interior so
they're actually held by magnets which
is pretty awesome and you also have all
sorts of acoustic treatment taking place
on the inside as well which is great and
you have all sorts of modularity going
on the interior design as well and I
just love the color and just the way how
it looks which is definitely something
that has been going on me it's certainly
an expensive case for what it is in fact
if you're looking for an in-depth review
or in-depth look at the p6 on our next
link is right over here Dmitry did a
fantastic job and so yeah there you guys
have it so now having looked at all the
components let's put this thing together
guys as you can see the final build
looks gorgeous I think the gray aren't
great color scheme turned out to be an
absolute success none not only in terms
of component choices but I think just
the fact that it nothing really
particularly stands out in this build
everything just blends in really well
everything from the memory all the way
to the CPU cooler and of course you had
the weighty on seven which is to
highlight for this build
I left the LED lighting behind the
motherboard and of course lighting on
the Radeon logo to be lit because I
think the red and the red really
complements the whole PC it adds just a
tiny bit of flare but I did turn off the
lighting on VA i/o cooler so good
because it just it just was too much I
just love the fact that it looks very
clean and minimalistic I love this bill
to guys it's just really awesome but I
cannot get into performance just as a
least right now because there is an NDA
of course but we will be doing some
in-depth testing not only with premiere
but we'll also be doing you know 1440p
and 4k benchmarks compared to the RT x
cards so definitely stay tuned for our
full performance review on the Radeon 7
and if you guys are interested in any
particular test that you want us to run
on this new GPU I'd love to know that in
the comments down below and this is
going to be you know it's going to be
something that I'll be using in the long
term to see how this GP and of course
this whole system just works in
particular not just for content creation
because that's something that this GPU
is I mean potentially Andy's claiming
that it can help accelerate rendering
performance so that's is something that
we'll have to wait and see if it turns
out to be true but yeah let me know what
you guys think about this build and of
course if you have any suggestions for
alternative components I'd love to know
that in the comments as well I'm he bore
with Hydra connects thank you so much
