connection today's vlog is all about the
NZXT pox we're doing a little
promotional video for it you might I
have some really cool elements to do
with cables and stop-motion graphic
stuff so before we move on any further
here's a message from our sponsor
alright so this is the puck it's this
very unique accessory that is magnetized
so this portion is magnetized it is
rubberized feels nice to touch it has
this cable measurement channel through
over here so you can route longer cables
you can also split in half like so so
for example if you were to mount one
piece on top of the case one piece at
the bottom you can sort of route one of
the channels here and so the general
message we're trying to send with this
promotional video is the part rule all
no more cable mass size of in your in
your space and because it's magnetic it
can be attached to different surfaces so
that is going to be also part of the
promotional deep well be sticking into a
bunch of things and I'm hoping it's
going to look really good let's start
shooting oh look at snowing outside that
looks so beautiful what's going to
balcony this is gorgeous I love one the
snow just slowly falls down you know
it's not aggressive in any way it's
great calming alright back to the office
let's go so on the agenda today are two
things first it's still me the chair
review the trigger 350 s II and as you
can see it's snowing out so we have nice
ambient lighting coming from the
outdoors you know no sunlight messing up
with my white balance which is awesome
and then - I'm have to film the the
cable spot for the puck and so what I'm
trying to do is assemble these cables as
if like they've taken over the office
and obviously they'll be like macro
shots of cables spread around the office
space so I have to literally fill the
entire smaller cables but just certain
sections where the angle of the camera
is and looks like my bag of cables or
now that our two boxes of cables have
coming very very handy now there is a
reason why I have all this all these box
to stash the way into this one
particular area because I'm utilizing
this corner to shoot the chair stuff so
I think it's got nice framing here
because of the corner especially if I do
like low angle stuff
so that's where this chair will be shot
a couple of shots there and also it just
gives me a new appreciation for this
extra space because usually this area is
filled simply to all these boxes so what
we're doing for the spot is the park up
here in this table infested space and
the POC rules them all so the first shot
is me opening the door and like moving
some of shuffling from the cables around
that are beside the entrance door these
cables so two boxes of cables have been
occupied by the door this is the opening
sequence lighting here I have one
softbox firing a little bit off an angle
so we're not giving the cables too much
light because I'm trying to create this
like eerie atmosphere of the cables
taking over the office this is the angle
the shot that I set up with right sides
to bring the camera on the tripod so we
have a little bit of depth and like
coming off at an angle so we can see all
these cables I have an extra light
behind the door so we have a little bit
separation but I'm supposed to come from
so yeah yeah let's do this first shot of
me opening the door and coming into the
office
what I'm trying to do is capture a
little bit different angle on when the
door is opening just in case in to fill
in a little extra shock if I'm heading
to music for example my original idea is
to have one opening shop like what they
did the beginning but I'm trying to be
extra practice in case I need to
substitute something else in there like
I want to get a nice macro or hold the
cable for the next shot I'm supposed to
peek through the door and be like super
unimpressed with the mokemo kept taking
over the office the lighting here is
very straightforward one softbox
trying from the low to light of my
magenta and then I going to place my my
handy normal light behind me so that I
have a little bit edge light well to
continue on with that orange that was
glow coming from behind the door
so that was pretty straightforward me
popping out all this is very well lit
and I don't mind that we are too bright
on the edge there I just going to have
to check the video to make sure I'm in
focus but let me show you how the
lighting most of the time is done in
this type of fashion obviously lisent of
our box is on to prepare by the way I am
totally aware of my hair situation but
it kind of goes into the character for
this particular spot because maybe he
just woke up and like go to the office
and the cables are taking over you know
it's kind of fitted I hope so what I'm
trying to create is this kind of
disorder of cables as they have taken
over so for example here
utilizing a bunch of cables to sort of
block out the Krakken cooler boxes and
the next shot I'm doing it on my desk
obviously that would be the most the
next most natural thing to occupy for in
office space so the way I have it set up
is it's a low angle shot of the keyboard
and I'm going to place a bunch of cables
here and I'm going to move one of them
and it will add a snake sound like the
bank movement so the cable is kind of
like alive and moving and there's not
just static objects but giving life to
the disorder so I'm hoping that would
look cool initially I wanted to have the
box of the s340 elite because it
actually comes with the puck so it makes
sense to include it in the shop but it
doesn't really fit because I'm really
going for a macro shot of like the cable
is moving its up oh yeah let's see how
this works out
all right so this shot went really well
I discovered that you can open a bunch
of windows taskbar settings and stuff
just by randomly dropping cables on the
keyboard but here I worked out really
well with one of the HDMI cables that I
was able to pull slowly so it's like a
snake kind of crawling through all the
cables I'm hoping this I'll find some
good sounds to substitute without actual
motion and now let's go back to shooting
me as the actor in this a spot okay so
this next shot is probably gonna be the
most difficult to achieve so I'm
supposed to be walking towards the
camera I pre focused myself and this is
right after I walk over all the cables
and what I'm supposed to do is basically
this is the the spot this is a chance
where I get set up with all the cables
and a cable dropped on me so I have
these headphones that I'm going to be
dropping on myself so I have to throw
them into the air and walk into them as
they land on me as I yell out my punch
line
I just tried a couple times it's not as
easy as I thought it would be it'd be
great if I had my wife to drop it on me
but I am soloing this one alright I
think I have something I said
Puckett's a thousand times I hope it
doesn't sound like I'm saying the other
word I mean the whole idea is to have
that association but I hope it doesn't
sound like I'm saying the f-word
I hope the clear pronunciation of pocket
is a evidence in this shop alright so
now I'm on my last shop where I'm going
to set up like a mountain of cables with
a puck on the top I have I think plenty
of cables to set up my mountain so let's
do it
you
 it so thank you so much for
watching this vlog this episode of all
the sporadic things that are happening
in this studio you guys know the drill
in terms of me showing you what's going
on behind the scenes so it's a little
bit more authentic once you watch the
actual videos so make sure to check the
videos that were talked about I linked
in the description below
I'm doing shows how our kinetic State is
much for watching I'm a way to India now
after which go into Vegas for CES so
stay tuned for everything in-between
make sure to do some vlogs while at
India to maybe visit like a nice PC
store see how they do things over there
yes wish me luck see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
