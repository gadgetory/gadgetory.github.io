great technology selection and service
this is very and if only
Wow
yeah so that was my initial skeptical
reaction based on the promotional
material surrounding the core FX
tactical gaming vest as the concept
itself sounds so awesome you're you have
these transducers inside the vest that
accept an audio source whether if
they're coming from a game it is coming
from a movie or music and these
transducers intensified the vibration
based on the source audio so the more
audio layers the more intense the audio
as the source is inside the game the
more vibrations you would feel inside
the vest and that sounds very appealing
for gamers because you get that extra
immersion factor for whatever games that
you play but at the hundred fifty
dollars it is inexpensive add-on to your
gaming setup this is one of those
peripherals that should come last after
you are totally happy with your mouse
your keyboard and headphones as I
wouldn't consider this to be the core
gaming peripheral per se now the build
quality is ok nothing really stands out
there is some padding on the back of the
vest and it's really lightweight its
size adjustable I would call it
comfortable - with plenty of room for
your arms to maneuver design-wise it's a
typical vest resembles body armor in a
way with thicker portions at the front
the core effects text is showcased at
the front as well on these boxes that
house all the electronics and the
speakers and similarly shaped battery
compartments right above those the
velcro portion in the front is designed
to show an emblem of some sort
perhaps handy for gaming plants and so
the vest is Wireless that's a big plus
for not needing to handle any cables but
it is powered by four double A batteries
that are not included I would expect for
the price to have a ready-to-go product
the core FX hub is pretty small it is
USB powered but with a battery
compartment available for for double-a
batteries if you want to use the vest on
mobile devices on the go there's a line
in and that's where you feed the core FX
with an audio source whether from a game
from any movies that you're playing or
even
music so you can't essentially connect
this to anything that has a 3.5
millimeter jack and at the front there
is the line out for speakers or
headphones the intensity of the line in
is adjustable with this dial beside it
with small numbers on the wheel to
indicate the intensity level and the
volume of line out is also adjustable on
the side is where you'll find on an off
switch for the hub only and the bind
button to link the vest with hub and
that goes solid green when the bind is
complete overall it's a pretty
hassle-free configuration at all I will
say the base is really light without any
rubber bits to prevent it from sliding
all over the place and also the included
cables are really short thus limiting
the location of the hub pressing the
power button will turn on the vest with
an audio cue and you will need to bind
the vest only once by holding the middle
button until the LED goes solid green
and the rest of the buttons control your
mode and amplitude with useful audio
cues as well to let you know of the
settings used the mode key on the right
side selects between three filters the
filter one selects your lower
frequencies filter 2 the mid-range
frequencies and filter 3 meant to
arrange so it's slightly wider filter 2
is the most recommended one to use as
the default one and you basically have
the flexibility to choose which of the
portions of the waveform of the sound
that is coming in will be detected and
translated into vibrations by the
transducers and using the arrows on the
left you adjust the amplitude of the
transducers basically another way of
adjusting the intensity of the
vibrations inside the best now so you
may be wondering what it's like to wear
the best how is it actually for gaming
is it in any way immersive gives you a
bit of extra immersion feeling and as
soon as I got the vest I jumped into bf4
because based on the promotional
material based on other reviews I wanted
to be
the impacts of bullets or feeling the
grenades going going on beside me only
to realize that the core effects does
not favor audio heavy or sound heavy
games because in Bilbao field for
regardless if I was shooting at somebody
regardless if I was just standing still
there's always something going on in the
environment and regardless of the mode I
couldn't get the feeling of being inside
the games and feeling only certain
elements because the audio engine is so
heavy it's so busy the transducers were
constantly going off and so it didn't
really benefit me in any way trying to
play that FPS title however I jumped
into half-life - Lost Coast and that was
amazing just because the environment is
more quieter you still get a sense of
being inside this atmosphere and that's
when it played the core FX is going to
be an amazing addition for extra
immersion for scary genres like Metro a
series the alien isolation or
interstellar Marines where the low
humming of the atmosphere of the
background that resonates through the
vest so you don't particularly feel the
gunshots but you feel the environment
that you're in
next I jumped into project cars just to
see if this extra vibration inside the
best would resonate into giving you more
of a realistic feeling being inside a
cockpit and actually driving something
and unfortunately to say that wasn't the
case because the again the audio engine
is great that sounds amazing but it's
very busy and because it's using a
simple 3.5 millimeter headphone jack to
actually power to receive the source
audio it doesn't separate between each
layer so if there's speech or there's
gunshots if there's a grenade going
after next to you if you're driving over
certain different surfaces it doesn't
fully translate into giving you the same
layered feeling even though you have
different nodes to select from it's not
as realistic as you would normally get
with maybe digital audio and built-in
driver and API to detect which the
layers they want to pass through the
vest or you know to leave out for more
immersive experience and while I was
driving inside project cars the vest was
constantly going off it gave me a little
bit extra I'm like feeling like I was
inside a cockpit but not as realistic
and so I felt more like a chest massage
then being inside the game now also the
dual transducers are set up in stereo
mode for left and right and thus in
theory should deliver directional
assistance on where the audio is coming
from for example if you get shot from
the right side the vibration on that
side should be stronger than on the left
and you can react accordingly
however the transducers are not spaced
out enough and provide almost zero
directional assistance and now coming
back to this whole idea of what games
work with the core effects and what
don't throughout my experience half-life
2 is a must if you own the core effects
definitely go do play through half-life
2 because the gravity gun that vibration
through the ground
translates so well into vibrations of
the actual vest it's almost feel like
you're holding the gravity gun
interstellar Marines is awesome it's
still in its alpha stages but the low
humming environment very creepy and dark
environment you feel like you're there
because you can feel the humming of this
environment that you are in it's not
about giving you the sense of bullet
hits because that's not really realistic
but it's about giving you a sense of
atmosphere and the environment that you
are in so for creepy genres this would
be outstanding the entire metro series
is great with the best alien isolation I
don't need to say anymore it's a very
creepy game but man it works really well
with the core effects however it is an
expensive peripheral and I would say it
still feels like in the prototype stage
rather than a finished product now don't
get me wrong I love the concept of this
haptic feedback but it needs to be
expanded even further with additional
transducers on the side and maybe on the
back too just so that you can feel
there's something coming around you or
coming on the sides to actually give you
a sense of directionality second because
it's only using the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack to receive the audio
source I think that's where the
limitations lie within what games it
works and what games it doesn't work so
for quiet environments it's perfect but
for loud environments you just
constantly feel the vibration so my
proposal in if this is at all possible
is to have a digital pass-through maybe
you're connected via USB into a sound
dongle of some sort that way the game
engine maybe could layer the different
audios and the vest could detect that
and you can have different modes for FPS
titles maybe for driving simulators for
all different settings that you could
select based on the layers of the game
not based on the entire waveform through
the sound engine and for right now I
would like for core FX to provide some
recommendations for what mode and which
amplitude and which sensitivity setting
works for certain titles because
right now it's completely based on user
feedback and user experience and so once
you get the best it's a little bit of a
hassle to try it out see what works what
doesn't it would be nice to know that
battle fits for works on this setting
certain other games that are most common
- that works on this setting however it
now that's not available I would also
like for core FX to fix out the whole
battery issue because it's only using
four double A batteries to dive really
quickly I got through about two days of
light gaming so maybe some built-in
rechargeable so that you can just plug
in the USB somewhere on the best that
will charge the best because once you
run out of charge on these four
batteries you kind of have to scramble
for more batteries and that is a hassle
and lastly there is no auto shutdown on
the vest you have to mainly always
remember to turn it off as otherwise it
does consume battery and you come back
to it later thinking that let's do some
core effects gaming and the vest doesn't
have any power so that would be an
indication maybe in LEDs somewhere that
would that is visible but not
distracting to indicate you should our
off the vest or even an or shutdown
would be nice and overall I think the
core effects is a step into the right
direction for extra immersive gaming but
it needs at least another revision for
this to become the common gaming
accessory the form factor is great and
the fact that it's wireless and
comfortable but it needs a larger
selection of audio presets better
battery integration and the extra
transducers for proper directional
immersion but for hardcore gamers does
this interest you in any way and for
$150 do you see value in this sort of
part time accessory as always leave your
