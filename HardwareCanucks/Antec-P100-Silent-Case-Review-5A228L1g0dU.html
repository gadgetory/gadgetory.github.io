great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
heroic Knox and when it comes to silent
and closure designs there are usually
many cooling compromises so let's check
out whether this antics latest
performance one line case the P 100 can
stand from the crowd of competing cases
priced at $99 the focus with the P 100
has been placed on minimising
operational noise so that's why we don't
see a side panel window there and the
top is actually covered with two foam
pads that are screwed in so if you want
to utilize the dual fan slots up top you
will have to remove them but
unfortunately there are no dust filters
here the P 100 still brings on some
style with a metallic front panel that's
actually plastic so it doesn't leave any
fingerprints good choice and notice
spacing between the panel and the front
fans is appropriate to allow air to
enter the panel does open up at full 180
degrees and even goes all the way back
so it's not on your way when accessing
dust filter that covers the two intake
slots for either 120 or 140 millimeter
fan mounts and we also get to optical
slots there now only one fan is included
Toso default cooling won't be as
impressive and realistically for the
price both fans should have been here it
does incorporate a speed adjustment that
you have to access on the fan itself but
I would have liked to see a fan hub
integration something similar to what
we've seen from NZXT and fantex I am
glad however the hard drive gauge
internally is very open allowing most
air flow to get through and actually
more foam can be found on the front
panel to complement this silent approach
all the connections are located at the
front with four USB ports two of which
are USB 3 Auto jacks and PR buttons at
the back we get an exhaust fan 7 PCI
slots and a lot of ventilation behind
the motherboard tray allowing any hot
air pockets to exit the P 100 stands on
large rubber case feet incorporates a
removable power supply dust filter so
that's good to see
and all the panels are also covered in
noise absorbing foam to come
this silent operation and the internals
on the p100 are not very exciting here
the drive cage is non removable and non
modular and there are no additional
frame outs on the cage wall everything
is riveted and built quality is a little
disappointing with thin metal sheets
allowing quite a bit of flex on the
frame and again for chassis in this
price bracket that's a little bit
unappealing the drive caddies do support
both three and a half and two and a half
inch drives and one deja vu moment with
every antic case we've reviewed here of
the screws for mechanical drives that
are too long and allowed the drive to
wobble quite a bit you can see it here
as the thread on the screw sticks out
way too far from the rubber grommet that
will cause unnecessary rattling when the
drive is spinning for example which is
totally counterintuitive with this
silenced focus this case is marketed for
the drives do align in the back for
simple cabling so there is no issues in
that department and overall with cable
management antic has done a great job
with quality large rubber grommets
coyote mounts and the full inch of space
behind the motherboard tray with the
ability to tuck your cables in this
bottom sleeve I do wish ntek would just
convert to all black cables as we still
get these multicolored front panel
cabling but building inside the p100 was
still enjoyable with pre-applied
motherboard standoffs and intuitive
grommeted placement for this very clean
and uncluttered look both in the main
chamber and in the back as well with
everything as close to the motherboard
tray as possible GPU is up to 12 and a
half inches are supported and that's why
an additional fan mount could be useful
to improve internal air flow and the
p100 is well equipped for 240mm radiator
up top with over three inches of
clearance and it's light out them to
help with internal clearance but also a
wider gap at the top for wider radiators
so the p100 turned out to be a
well-rounded silent enclosure with easy
to work in internals clean cable routing
and long GPU support including top
ravier friendly clearance however for
the price I was expecting both front
fans to be included and an tag should
really consider modularity for their
drive cage design
perhaps in the next iteration and fix
the mounting screws for mechanical
drives if the option is there for duel
fans up top we still need to see a
complementing dust filter to go along
with this and now while the case isn't
bad at all
pantech needs to a job to changing
dynamics of the enclosure market and get
rid of their traditional formula and put
on their competitor pad as I'd love to
see something truly unique and exciting
from a once known legend of the case
market and while that concludes a review
of the P 100 from an tech thanks guys
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
