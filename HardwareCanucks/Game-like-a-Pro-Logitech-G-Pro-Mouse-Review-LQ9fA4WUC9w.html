reckon axe and my three favourite mice
right now are the my onyx castor the Zoe
fk1
and the logitech g502 but I also love
experimenting with new mice so let's
take the new Logitech G pro for a spin
as it combines an attractive price at
$70 a similar frame to the widely
popular G 100's and a fantastic sensor
this is right in time with eSports are
booming and launched its integration
with pro teams is a brilliant sell to
make the G pro a success but what I'm
curious is can it make an amateur player
go pro it's in the name
after all light up your build with hue
plus by NZXT d it fits into two and a
half inch drive slots comes with four
individually controlled RGB strips with
plenty of connection cables for best
routing and is wonderfully controlled
through the cam software get 10% off at
NZXT comm link in the description so
let's first meet our amateur gamer hi
wow here doesn't even bother making an
entrance and coming through the door it
is our pro this guy does not need in the
introduction so this is the second day
of using the mouse and we get these
results
but all the role-playing aside the GPRO
may be a fantastic starter FPS Mouse
because the body is comfortable for a
variety of grips complimenting claw grip
and hybrid grip more than panco it is a
super light frame with 83 grams making
it easy to lift and move around the
mousepad none of the plastic on the body
is rubberized even the sides a totally
plain which I actually don't mind it's
just that when you compare to the likes
of the g5 or to then the G pro feels a
little bit too basic and that's not a
bad thing as they have added some bling
with perimeter lining that's consistent
which is awesome and RGB with the color
cycle effect so I feel the simplicity
here is a benefit the body is
symmetrical but not ambidextrous as
browser buttons are only on the left
that feel in the reach and resistive
enough to avoid accidental presses but
still light so that your grip is not
affected when pressed the primary clicks
have more resistance than the g5 a2 and
feel like they travel longer to their
bit louder and for majority of that
surface of the switch they offer
consistent actuation force
the scroll wheel is now mechanical with
the rubber surface scroll steps are very
light but none are missed which is
awesome so if you scroll really fast
every step will be registered the middle
click is too tough for me toe it
requires for me at least hand
readjustment to put enough pressure with
my middle finger and that's really
unfortunate and lastly the DPI button is
accessible when needed behind the scroll
wheel with up to 5 dpi levels and I
normally leave just 2 with 1000 Hertz
poling and really the only button that I
dislike here is that middle click it's
too tough I wish it was lighter because
I love using it for mainly and other
things but otherwise all good on the G
Pro the cable here is thick it's 2
meters and it's braided it's a different
braiding from the g5 or to the braiding
here it feels very similar to the my
onyx castor the thickness here actually
prevents the cable from kinks and it
surprisingly does not drag the light
mouse obviously a cable bungee would be
helpful but not necessary
and so to sweeten the deal this mouse is
equipped with the 3366 optical sensor
which is considered to be one of the
best so if there is something wrong with
your aim you are the only one to blame
after a quick surface calibration my aim
performance at 800 dpi was phenomenal
you don't need to worry about
acceleration the mouse was working with
me if I needed to flick or to just
adjust my aim for a few pixels after a
180-degree turn the liftoff distance is
very short so no aim is compromised when
the touchdown happens and truthfully my
csgo score has improved only after a few
days of use and from now on this will be
my goal t FPS Mouse now does the name
hold up to the hype of this proline and
I gotta say does the lightbody the great
switch is the best sensor at $70 it
deserves the damn good value a word the
only flaw here is a tough middle click
which sucks
I wished was lighter but otherwise it
may well be for the
cross let's draw our feet so guys thank
you so much for watching I'm Dimitri
with how reckon next we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
