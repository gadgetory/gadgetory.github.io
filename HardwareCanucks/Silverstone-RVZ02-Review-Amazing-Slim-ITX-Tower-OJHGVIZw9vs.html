great technology selection and service
you
the silverstone RV zo2 is the latest
Raven release that pushes the boundaries
even further when it comes to functional
chamber separation at this unusual but
totally awesome
ITX slim tower foam factor priced at six
to nine dollars for the solid panel
version and a $10 premium for the
plastic window
I think this price point is right where
it should be offering great value given
the unique aesthetics and internal form
and let's take the time to appreciate
the angles of the plastic front panel
that follows in the footsteps of the
Raven exterior as we've come to know it
there's even an ambient orange power LED
that in my opinion looks fantastic it
may not be your favorite color it may
not totally suit your color scheme so in
that situation if Silverstone would have
gone ahead with a white LED that would
have been the safer choice
the sliding Raven door pulls down which
is really stiff and smoother sliding
rails would be better behind the door we
have dual USB 3 ports and audio jacks
and it's a great location plus the
orange underglow would help to light up
this front Io when in the dark the power
button is in the bottom left corner with
a tiny hole for the reset switch that is
activated via and needle and as with
previous Raven ITX cases orientation is
determined by you either standing which
I think would be the more popular choice
with the rubberized case feet included
that is a two-piece design so you can
collapse it when not in use and you also
have these large adhesive rubber dimples
that will allow horizontal orientation
that looks alright and does not affect
cooling that much at the back aside from
the motherboard IO and ventilation there
are two PCI slots right above the
motherboard with a power plug for
internal rerouting taking off the side
panels they are identical that
eliminates the confusion which panel to
install on what side first plus notice
the dust filter protrusion on each panel
I actually don't mind this at all as it
adds a little bit of character to and
otherwise plain sides the plastic filter
has very large ventilation cutouts Plus
really fine mesh
that helps to prevent dust without
impacting too much air flow these
filters are easily removable from the
outside one for the GPU chamber and the
other one for the motherboard area my
only point of concern are these venting
strips at the bottom and top of the case
that are not filtered and I really don't
understand why plastic transparent side
panel version does not even have a dust
filter I realize it won't look as good
with the dark mesh but come on take a
look inside the main chamber this is
where the ITX motherboard power supply
and your drives will be installed for
the power supply dr VCO 2 supports and
SFX and Silverstone's new SFX l standard
and we're using their 500 watt SFX L
power supply which is the same mounting
size as SFX and here they are in
comparison to standard ATX it can see
the SFX L in the middle that is slightly
longer than standard SFX but still a lot
smaller than regular ATX units the extra
length allows the power supply to be
equipped with the 120 mm under fan for
better cooling and quieter operation
versus the tiny louder fan on the SFX
power supply now I wasn't expecting
anything too challenging but the
interior cable work there's plenty of
room in front and on the side of the
power supply to tuck away the cables and
there's also a hefty amount of room
below the power supply that you could
potentially utilize for routing as
cutouts are available but in our build
this space was not utilized one thing I
do appreciate our all-black front IO
cables that comes sleeve for that extra
camouflage but the most annoying thing
to route was the USB 3 cable not only is
it super thick but it's not exactly
flexible and this whole tiny interior
doesn't help that either next you'd want
to install the PCI extension which is
held in with a couple of screws from the
GPU chamber install the riser card into
the GPU and popped out graphics card in
place I love this chamber separation as
there is no heat exchange between
hardware and due to this clearance a 13
inch or 33 centimeters is available for
your graphics card although the card
cannot be larger than 2 PCI slots
silverstone doesn't
include this GPU support brace that will
prevent the card from bending when in
horizontal position with multiple
mounting locations available for
different height and lengths GPUs now
for drive capacity the our VCO 2
supports a slim optical drive that for
this form factor is very fitting
furthermore two SSD brackets are
available above the motherboard with
really convenient mounting angle
brackets that are 2 lists with a picture
showing orientation of the SATA cables
but don't be confused to mount the
drives facing up as that won't allow
clearance for cables insert the drives
facing down to mount a three and a half
inch drive we have to go back to the GPU
chamber as that is the only spot that
has clearance with appropriate cutout
for a comfortable saddle routing so
that's appreciated although this drive
does limit GPU clearance to just over
seven and a half inches or 19
centimeters which is an unfortunate
compromise you can mount an extra SSD in
this place as well and if using 7
millimeter drives it can comfortably sit
behind the GPU I just wish that we had
the ability to mount a three and a half
inch drive instead of the optical drive
on the other side so I think silverstone
has done another fantastic job with the
raven line particularly with this new
introduction of this ITX slim form
factor the layout isn't challenging to
build at all and both compartments are
well ventilated and the hardware is easy
to access and replace if needed well I'm
not satisfied with the three in
half-inch drive mounting location
perhaps it's a good idea to go with full
solid-state as the chamber is passively
cooled also if they could improve on the
sliding door for the front IO to present
better general build quality and how
come there is no handle at the top this
is the perfect briefcase size case would
love to take it on the road with me but
other than that the silverstone RB co2
deserves the Harbour Canucks damn good
award for being a unique slim tower with
a lot of character I'm Dimitri with
hardware canucks thank you so much for
