about this one we've got our hands on
the Corsair obsidian 800 D chassis which
may be up for case of the year there has
been a ton of hype about this unit as it
is Corsairs first case on the market and
they've been known to produce some real
top-quality products the company says to
develop this case they've got feedback
from enthusiasts and consumers and
basically styled the case around what we
wanted and they obviously missed a few
suggestions as there's no mini-fridge
now with that said the case is not cheap
it rings in at a whopping 299 dollars so
the question is is it worth it well
let's take a look we take our usual look
at the dimensions the majority of the
case is constructed out of a thick steel
and as you may be able to see it has a
matte black sort of powder coat finish
throughout the entire case the front
panel is a bit different and it's made
of a brushed black aluminum so it is a
little bit of a fingerprint magnet but
the two finishes go really well together
the case itself is enormous it's 24
inches high 24 inches in length and 9
inches wide it's not gonna fit in your
little computer cubby just a quick
little warning to those who actually
purchase the case we used a few of these
cases and found that the sticky front
plastic protection will actually rip off
a part of the painted Corsair logo at
the bottom so if you're doing it be very
careful at the front hidden behind a
small panel we have four USB ports audio
and microphone jacks along with a
firewire connection and a reset switch
then on the left there is a power button
and activity LEDs the case has five
external drive bays and at the bottom we
have the best feature of the case hot
swappable drive trays the front holds
for hot swappable sleds which are easy
to remove and to install the drives
however these racks are not screwless so
keep your tools handy
Coursera's also added an extra tidbit
here the front door can be swapped from
either side sort of depending on which
way your case is gonna sit it takes all
of a few seconds to switch over and it's
really handy we have a window at the
side of the case and you'll notice a
lack of rivets or screws on the outside
so it looks really flushed with the rest
of the side panel jumping to the back we
have two buttons which will release the
side panels plenty of venting and holes
for water cooling there's also a hundred
forty millimeter exhaust fan seven PCI
slots and a vent underneath those slots
and then we have our bottom mounted
power supply there is also venting along
the gap in the back panel for more
airflow the 800 D is super easy to get
into there's no fiddling around with
silly thumb screws you push the button
and pull off the side that easy
once you get inside the first thing you
notice is that the case is black
everything is black and the metal has
the same matte tone as the outside
you'll even notice that the fans and the
fan cables and headers are black it
keeps everything uniform and it really
enhances the look the case is separated
into three major chambers for the
purpose of air flow the bottom is the
first end has plenty of room for
extended power supplies such as say the
Corsair 1000 watt plus other things like
say a water cooling pump or small
radiator and then at the front there is
a second area for hard drives the bottom
rack can fit to 3.5 inch drives as well
as a hundred and twenty millimeter fan
on the outside and then above is the hot
swappable enclosure and another 140
millimeter fan now Chris Harris
concluded these three covers which are
used to keep the chambers air flow
contained is recommended that you keep
them on when the computer is operational
the case holds five five and a quarter
inch ROM bays each using a screwless
lock system the third area is for the
meet of the case the motherboard area on
the bottom panel we have a hundred and
forty millimeter fan which pushes air up
as well as more tubing holes in case you
have water cooling components underneath
now the cables will have no trouble
getting to the motherboard
thanks to these rubber grommets that you
see surrounding the motherboard area
everything is run up the back of the
case and out through the tray
what Chris air is doing is forcing users
to clean up their wiring and provide
a great method for doing so at the back
we have a CPU backplate cover which
opens up a rather large opening and the
bottom has a removable cover as well if
you want to free up some room underneath
the 800 D is designed to be simple and
easy to wire yet still look amazing the
chamber and grommet system had the
potential to be an absolute disaster
really but Corsair overlooked nothing
they provided plenty of room with
perfect spacing so that no one is going
to be caught with problems moving to our
install our full sized ATX board looks
rather small inside this enormous beast
the case supports M ATX ATX and E ATX
motherboards which all of the grommets
are perfectly spaced for every form
factor as you can see even with this
super quick build that we did the system
looks impeccable we did nothing special
just wired it up the easiest way
possible and it looks like something
that should have taken hours the front
panel removes with little effort via a
few internal clips you'll need to take
it off to install external drives and
the two bottom hard drives the drives
fit in from the front and use screwless
rails to slide into position as we
looked at earlier there are four hot
swappable drive bays these are easy to
get in and out but the hard drives do
require screws to be secured they also
support 2.5 inch SSDs now in order to
hook up the hot swappable modules a
Corsair has included a special power
cable and for black SATA wires in the
accessories these wire cleanly through
the back of the case and then a cover
can be installed over top to hide them
while there are only seven expansion
slots there's an extra vent at the
bottom which acts as a perfect sauce
point for a bottom mounted video card
and there's a good inch below it for
better airflow for the card
now probably one of the biggest
attractions to the courser 800 d is that
it is literally unmatched in water
cooling potential with such a spacious
interior you're gonna run out of things
to put in it before you run out of space
one of the best features of this is the
ability to mount up to a triple 120 mil
rad inside the case there is a ton of
room between the board and the three fan
spaces at the top I mean you could not
only mount the red inside but also the
fans now we mentioned the cooling zones
in the case earlier but let's take a
look at how the airflow should work at
the bottom the power supply basically
keeps itself cool and 140 millimeter fan
in the divider will pull air from
underneath and into up into zone 3 now
the second zone at the front has fans
mounted on the side not much good when
side panels on but put the covers over
top and air should be pulled up from the
bottom and then push through the hard
drive cages there are no fans or venting
at the front of the case so the entire
basis of the thermal design relies
solely on getting fresh air from
underneath just make sure that the area
is relatively clear and not blocking any
intake ports already and that wraps up
our look at the Corsair obsidian 800 d
for their first venture into the case
market this thing is amazing
it has Corsairs quality and ingenuity
written all over it they've included
everything you always wish the case
would have and a few things you'd never
even thought of it has a great design
that appeals to a lot of users and the
quality is awesome and cable management
inside the case is awesome the grommet
system and separate bottom zones work
perfectly and keep everything clean and
you don't have to be a master tailor to
really make it look good and to top it
off they've included some awesome
features like integrated hot swappable
drive bays and the ability to mount
large internal radiators overall this
case is 100% awesome oh yeah and there's
no screwless drive trays oh yeah but
we'll forgive them and for the first
time in a video review we will be giving
out the coveted Hardware Canucks damn
good award hope you enjoyed our looked
