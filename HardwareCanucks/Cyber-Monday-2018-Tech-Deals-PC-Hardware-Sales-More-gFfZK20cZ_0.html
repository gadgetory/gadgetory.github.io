connects and it is Cyber Monday we were
scouting around for some awesome deals
online and we came across some fantastic
products and a ridiculous discount price
so definitely something that you really
can't pass I just want to quickly
mention that Cyber Monday used to be an
online sales event and eventually turned
into Black Friday's sort of becoming an
online thing because normally Black
Friday consisted of you physically go
into a store and picking up things that
were on sale but it's all turned into
this whole online sales event throughout
the week in some cases so some of the
products that I'm mentioning here could
be out of stock by the time you're
watching this maybe two or three days
when you watch this video some of them
could even go up in price or down in
price so they're not really certain I
also want to bring up the fact that some
on rally to retailers do tend to jack up
the price of the product and then they
put a discount to it so that it makes
you seem like you're getting a really
good deal so I highly suggest you know
using price check engines like camel
camel camel to make sure that you're
getting a really good deal on most these
products in fact we have validated all
of these products that we're about to
share through camel camel camel so
you're getting the lowest possible deals
or the little sale price at least in the
last twelve months or so so every
product we're about to mention here will
be linked in the description down below
for your convenience because we will get
a little bit of a kickback from Amazon
so I want to take this time to thank you
for that but why don't we go ahead and
go get into this so first up we have the
HyperX cloud flight wireless gaming
headset I personally have one right now
this is an absolute fantastic pair it's
something that I care we are on every
day in the office and you know with on
you know attending a Skype conference
call or anything like that this is the
one that I use because I simply plug in
the USB receiver to my computer I boot
up spot Skype and then I'm going to go
I'm completely wireless I can you know
strewed be role and attend the call or
do other things without cables and that
is just pretty amazing so right now it
is on sale for $100 because the retail
price for this is $160 so you're saving
around $60 which is pretty awesome
there's also a Canadian deal for this
specific headset it is $150 Canadian
which again is expensive for us
Canadians here but it's on sale for you
know our Canadian followers
now next up we have the razor or not a
chroma it's a membrane full-size
keyboard
it comes with razor's chroma lighting
and it's right now on sale for $70 which
is 30% off from its original price it's
again also a Canadian there's also
Canadian sale for this particular
keyboard as well so that's pretty
awesome next up we have the risin 7:17
2700 X pardon me this processor is again
a ridiculous it's a great CPU for the
price but you're actually getting it for
even better because it's $64 off of its
retail price so it's now $264 us and you
know it's a great multi-threaded CPU if
you're looking for something that can
handle multi-threaded tests especially
you know that's specific to your
particular workload this processor will
do the job just fine now if you live in
Canada there is another alternative to
the 2700 X and that is the risin 720 700
it's the little brother to the 2700 X
but it can still overclock just fine
it's just you're gonna be you know
limiting a little bit on overclocking
capabilities but it's still a fantastic
processor for the price and right now
it's on sale for $350 Canadian which is
pretty awesome now if you're thinking
about picking up the 2700 X or the 2700
if you live in Canada you obviously need
a motherboard to go along with that so
this is the MSI x4 70 plus performance
gaming Edition motherboard it's a great
board for its value it's got great
overclocking capabilities it also has
you know support for mystic lighting
from MSI which is the RGB protocol for
this specific motherboard and it's on
sale for $95 so it's $35 off of its
retail price and it's also on sale on
the canadian website which is pretty
awesome next up we found this SSD on
Newegg it's the Western Digital one
terabyte SSD it's priced at $200 but
it's on sale right now for a hundred and
thirty dollars so it's $70 off which is
again a fantastic deal and I think this
is a great addition especially if you're
thinking of upgrading your storage set
up if you want to load up your seam
library and offset some of that to an
SSD for faster load load of times again
this is a great value and certainly
worth picking up now there's also
another SSD on Amazon and it's an e
crucial MX 500
they two terabyte SSD for $200 it's 120
dollars off of its retail price which is
fantastic and you know if you're again
thinking about picking up fast storage
to expand your systems a steam library
and if you're looking to reduce load
times this is also another great pick
it's also on sale in the Canadian
website
which is pretty awesome now if you're a
content creator and if you shoot 4k
videos this deal is definitely something
that you really don't want to especially
if you live in Canada so memory Express
has this Western Digital blue 4 terabyte
desktop drive $400 which is a fantastic
deal killer deal to be honest because
it's one hundred and ten dollars off of
its retail price and again it's a great
Drive especially if you live in Canada
this is certainly worth considering and
now onto some graphics cards and we're
going to kick things off with the EVGA
GTX 1060 superclocked and gaming edition
this thing originally retails for $320
but it is on sale right now for $200 so
it's 38 percent off of its retail price
which is a killer deal it's probably one
of the lowest prices we've seen in a
really long time for a GTX 1060 awesome
card it's so on sale in the Kami website
so if you're live in Canada this card is
on sale it's 8% off which is again still
something there's also the MSI Radeon rx
580 for $190 which is 41 percent off of
its original retail price there's also a
mail-in rebate for $20 so you could
technically pick this up for $170 and
dad my friends is for an rx 580 you
really can't miss it there's also the
XFX Radeon rx 580 GTS Edition it's
originally priced around $380 but right
now it's on sale for $190
so it's 50% off great pick for what it
is I also want to bring up mobile phones
because this my friends is the Galaxy
Note 9 from Samsung it is on sale right
now for $7.99 so it's $200 off of its
original thousand dollar price point
I just recently reviewed the smartphone
and I absolutely love it it's got best
display it doesn't have any notches the
battery life is phenomenal and you
really cannot go with a phone that has
120 gigabytes of storage it's expandable
you know it's just an all-in-one package
for what it is I highly recommend the
smart phone just because it's an all run
package especially for $7.99 now if
you're thinking about picking a base
mark thermostat this is the Eco b3 light
it's right now on sale for one hundred
and thirty-eight dollars so it's
eighteen percent off of its original
retail price and this is something that
I use personally in my living room and I
absolutely love it it works with Amazon
Alexa and Google assistant so if you're
thinking about picking up some smart
items or smart home devices for your
household this is a great bag and lastly
we have one of my favorite items for the
living room and that is the Nvidia
shield TV it retails for around $200 but
right now it's on sale for $160 so it's
20% off and I personally use this thing
regularly I mean if I want to watch TV
shows catch up on TV shows and watch
movies this is what I use in my living
room because I have it hooked up to my
4k TV and it's just an awesome
experience it works as an Amazon Alex
and Google assistant so the integration
is fantastic you can also not only take
advantage of things like streaming 4k
content but GeForce gaming is also a
great alternative and the game library
is expanding as we're speaking so that's
awesome and it's also on sale in the
Canadian Amazon website so again if
you're thinking about you know picking
up a streaming device for your living
room the shield TV is hands-down one of
my favorite devices to go with and that
about wraps up our cyber monday deals
