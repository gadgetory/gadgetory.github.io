took center stage a cooler master suite
during CES 2018 they were also showing
off some next-generation gaming
peripherals many of these are just
prototypes right now but supposedly they
will be ready for primetime at Computex
we can't wait to see what's changed by
that point but for now let's take a look
at what they have in store for the
future before I get into that I want to
give a huge shout out to fantex Corsair
and cola master for sponsoring our CES
2018 coverage before I get too far into
this video I think it's important to
explain how cool the master names their
peripherals they all start with a letter
M followed by a letter that designates
the type and then a number showing where
the item is placed in their lineup for
example the M H is a headset and K is a
keyboard mice are labeled as mm and
mouse pads are listed as MP while the
200 series would be the entry-level and
800 or 800 series are higher-end the
first item I wanted to talk about is the
MK 800 series keyboards the MK 850 and
MK 851 these are basically the same
keyboard with an aggressive design RGB
backlighting of course a cobalt aluminum
top plate and these things cool omastar
calls precision wields the precision
wheels are an interesting addition since
they will almost act as a mouse scroll
wheel built into the keyboard one will
be able to completely program it and I
could see it being really useful for
Adobe Premiere or even some strategy
games provided its software supports
those things the other wheel can be used
as a profile switcher both of these
keyboards will also come with a
detachable USB type-c cable to ensure
you aren't struggling to find what's up
and down when plugging it in I also
really like the magnetic wrist rest
which had a perfectly textured surface
and it's really comfortable for long
gaming sessions so what's the actual
difference between the nka 50 and the
mk8 51 well the 850 will be available
with cherry blue or brown switches while
the 850 will only come and share your
bread but there's one more big
difference the MKA 51 comes with in
patent technology on 8 keys including
lost basically aim pad incorporates an
infrared sensor into each key and allows
them to act as an analogue matter that
means the more you press down the
stronger the on-screen reaction for
example a light press could allow a
character to walk while pressing further
down will be counted as
run command this really comes in handy
within driving or flying games another
addition to the new M 800 series is the
mm 830 which is considered cooler
master's flagship gaming mouse the
interesting features here is actually
hidden away within the thumb rest area
there are four small integrated buttons
that make up a deep pan that's supposed
to be easier to use for mobile and MMO
players than standard buttons with
software they're completely programmable
and I actually liked using them since
they require just a right amount of
force to actuate the only problem is
that a one-size-fits-all solution isn't
possible here since everyone has a
different sized hand someone with a
bigger thumb will overshoot the buttons
while someone with a smaller thumb won't
have the reach to hit them all I really
hope Coulomb s is able to ship this
mouse with interchangeable thumb rests
so those buttons can be easily
accessible to everyone the other
features on this mouse are pretty
straightforward there's a programmable
OLED display a durable PBT chassis USB
type-c connection on one switches and a
24,000 dpi picsArt 3360 sensor there was
also a mousepad on display called the MP
860 which incorporates an RGB underglow
and a reversible surface there's a hard
side for greater position and speedy
movements and a soft touch side that's
good for daily tasks
the last thing Coolermaster showed us
was a very early concept for a
low-profile keyboard this was just an
engineering mock-up but it showed a lot
of promise since it is the first to use
the new cherry Randy low-profile
switches basically this brand-new switch
is supposed to imitate the feel of a
standard cherry red switch but it's slim
form factor means it can be added to
very thin keyboards right now the plans
for this new keyboard that's tentatively
called the SK 750 on firm yet but it
looks like Coolermaster will start
selling it sometime after Computex in
either black gunmetal gray or silver
there's even hope to integrate the
upcoming Bluetooth 5.0 spec so it can
operate wirelessly while still offering
months of battery life so there you have
it while all the peripherals we saw
coolermaster we're prototypes of some
form I'm really looking forward to see
the final version that Computex but what
about you guys is there anything here
you could see yourself buying or are
there things you would like to see added
now is it time to speak up since none of
them are final yet let us know in the
comments down below I'm Eva with
Hardware connects thank you so much for
watching subscribe for more see
coverage and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
