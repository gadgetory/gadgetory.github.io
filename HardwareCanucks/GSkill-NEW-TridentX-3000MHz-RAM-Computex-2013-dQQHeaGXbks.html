event they're overclocking right behind
us I'm here with Mark when the engineers
g.skill memory so mark tell us what's
going on back here what motherboards are
they using what memory are they using
exactly what are we setting a new world
record here today or something well this
is our annual computex overclocking
event and this is one of the kind in the
world which as we invite top
overclockers from around the world and
work with the four major motherboard
manufacturers today you're going to see
a gigabyte we're going to over clock on
gigabyte motherboards with our g.skill
memory and what's the memory modules are
they using what's the capacities or is
there any standard of the type of
modules well they typically use our try
the next series else it really depends
on them because we have both four
gigabyte modules and a gateway modules
and we have our top modules available in
4 8 16 and 32 gigabyte sex right yeah
and what's the speed that we
overclocking with the speed well a
couple of days ago we broke the world
record at about 42 29 megahertz 4290
that's great that's been impressive
we're trying to break that today so
we'll see what happens where the what's
the progress on that well the progress
on that well I don't know find out later
on you'll find out we'll find out so
what's that what's the process of
overclocking the memory as what were
they most tweaking in the memory module
the timings they're working with the
motherboard specs with a CPU so there's
a lot of the whole science going on
there it's a very complex science but
what you're trying to do is increase the
clock frequency and you're working with
the timing
and you're also trying to work without
the cpu frequency in order to get up get
a stable setting so that you can
actually go into the system all right
yeah so now we can go back inside to
check out exactly the new memory modules
that are you guys introducing this year
so let's go in and check those out so
now I movie back inside we're going to
take a look at some of the modules but
first with the introduction of has well
the this overclocking potential and just
reaching the stock speeds of 3000
megahertz has become a reality has
become a potential because with the ivy
bridge the the highest was 28 3328 right
so now with the Haswell brings a lot of
overclocking potential and just default
sauce the default speeds for the modules
a lot of companies are jumping on board
for this so g.skill mark so tell us
about what type of modules you guys
introducing here and what was the
process of getting to that 3000 mark on
the Haswell modules or sit here that
it's improved a lot on the IMC so then
we can get to a higher frequency because
it's a lot more stable on higher
frequency so we have here is starting
from the 2832 to two gigabytes all the
way up to the 3000 megahertz range yeah
and then we're the first company to
actually validate with intel to have a
XMP certification for our for a 3000
megahertz kits
getting here well we have to filter out
through a lot of chips we have to go
through a lot of engineering we have to
make tweaks to our settings and timings
and frequency and just pretty much
everything on the motherboard so what we
have here are 16 gigabyte memory kits
and 32 gigabyte memory kits on 3000 and
what we have here is also running to
show that it's stable hyper pie running
eight eight threads and you will see
right here that we have pretty much no
problem running through here running
late with no errors yeah and it's been
on since this morning so it's pretty
nice and over here 16 gigabytes we have
actually over Clark beyond 3000 and if
you see right there it's about 3250 yeah
this is and this is just on air and what
makes this difficult is that we stuck in
four modules most most of the times it's
usually overclocking on one or two
modules but we have to because we're
trying to push for the limit we're
trying to go beyond the limit and the
difficult thing about four modules is
that you have to synchronize the timing
you have to synchronize all the settings
across all four modules which is the
maximum supported so we've done a lot of
work on that okay so given this this is
33,000 megahertz at one point six five
volts what is the overclocking potential
aside from what we see here you know for
a regular consumer could buy these
potential it really depends on how you
tweak it it really depends on the
hardware that you use and really each
kits and each system very varies so what
you get is
yeah what's the availability date and
how much are we expected to pay for
these well the 60 goodbye it's is
already available but the 32 should be
available really soon and it's on the
market it's been listed and according
surprises well it depends on your local
reseller well thanks mark great the
memory from g.skill high frequency
modules so great for rendering aside
from gaming but excellent excellent for
rendering we have high capacity modules
so 32 gigabytes so thanks mark and stay
tuned guys for more complex coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
