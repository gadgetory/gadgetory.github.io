axe and welcome back to the video rise
inside was just launched a few days ago
and we've tested two of the most
anticipated CPUs in that lineup the 1500
X and the 1600 X if you're looking for
in-depth benchmarks you can watch our
risin 5 review video right here or a
link that and a written article in the
description for you to check out later
now in our review video I mentioned how
rise in 5 is a great foundation to build
an amazing system and I did that now
before everyone starts raging upon how
Intel CPUs can help yield higher frame
rates think about it this way with
rising 5 you're not only getting
fantastic multicolored performance and
somewhat better frame rates compared to
its much expensive brother the 1800 X
but you're also getting it in a
relatively inexpensive package building
a system featuring a z2 70 motherboard
and an unlocked I 5 or I 7 processor can
become expensive
this build is $1100 and it can render 4k
videos just as fast as my sis core 49
30k workstation PC and it's also a
pretty capable gaming PC too but we'll
get into the details right after this
kula master master keys keyboard line-up
is now available in three sizes to fit
within your space with large medium and
small boards with either beautiful RGB
or pure white LED illumination a little
something for everyone make it yours
with the master keys pro by Cooler
Master so the heart of the system aka
the brain used for all that processing
power is the risin 5 1600 X 6 scored 12
threaded processor at $250 this CPU
offers excellent performance for
multi-threaded workloads like content
creation streaming games crunching and
complex numbers you name it Plus with a
base clock of 3.6 gigahertz it should
play well with games and since it comes
unlocked you might be able to squeeze
out some more performance cooling this 6
core beast would be the weight Mac stock
cooler than AMD centers now I need to
highly emphasized that the 1600 X does
not come with a CPU cooler this was
actually from the horizon 7 kid that AMD
sent us and it was the only and 4
compatible cooler I had in hand
do I find anything interesting about it
nothing to be honest you get the same
heating design from AMD's previous
coolers but they've added a touch of RGB
by implementing this ring around the fan
and it looks quite unique also remember
that a m4 is a fairly new platform so
after market cooling solutions are
working on providing mounting brackets
to support this platform some companies
are even offering their kits or their
respective kits for free of charge if
you happen to own an existing eio or an
air cooler if you're looking for a
cheaper alternative the cooler master
hyper 212 evo can be picked up for $30
and you can request for the import kit
from their website housing the 1600 x is
the asus prime bt 50 plus motherboard
$400 it packs a lot of features like an
nvme 4x m2 slot to native USB 3.1 gen2
back panel connectors and 6 SATA 6
gigabits per second ports most
importantly it supports crossfire but
not sli I would highly recommend a
single GPU solution because if you plan
on going crossfire or SLI along with
adding third-party PCI cards on top of
that you might want to step things up to
the X 370 chipset to take advantage of
those PCIe Lane speeds and that would
obviously add cost this board does
support overclocking which is pretty
awesome
plus the four ddr4 memory gems support
up to 64 gigabytes of RAM that can be
operated at 3200 megahertz
also check this out this board features
an RGB fan header meaning if you end up
picking up one of AMD's rate coolers
with the RGB ring you can control the
LEDs through the AI Suite app which is
pretty nice for memory we opted for
g.skill ripjaws 16 gigabyte ddr4 kit
clocked at 2400 megahertz and it should
be plenty enough for gaming and a little
bit of video editing now memory prices
have increased a little bit over the
past few months and this was the
cheapest we were able to find coming in
at $120 as a bonus the modules are red
so it should definitely help with the
red and black combo because the be 350
board features the exact same color
scheme and as mentioned earlier this
motherboard supports up to 64 gigabytes
of RAM so you can easily upgrade down
the road let's talk storage we chose the
OC ztl 102 40 gigabyte SSD has our main
boot drive while it may not be anywhere
near as fast as an nvme and to drive
still provides excellent performance and
great longevity while costing about $80
and also don't forget the fact that this
Drive is backed up by a three-year
advanced warranty program which is
awesome now I know to 40 gigabytes isn't
enough to store all your game library so
I decided to throw a four terabyte
Western Digital blue Drive for expansion
but if you're on a tight budget there
are cheaper one terabyte alternatives
that can do the job really well our GP
of choice goes to these tricks rx 488
gigabyte overclocked edition since this
is a build featuring a rising 5 CPU I
thought it was best to include a GPU
from the same team and this one made our
list the Strix cooler is a by far one of
the best aftermarket cooling solutions
we've ever come across on a GPU it
features 3 wing blade 0db fans meaning
during idle they completely stop
spinning and the direct cu3 heat pipes
should definitely help with lower
temperatures while gaming
it also features RGB lighting that can
be controlled through the GPU to make
software plus a $270 this should play
well with 1080p gaming because the core
clock gets all the way up to 13 30
megahertz our case of choice might seem
a little intimidating but there's a
reason for that
the course they respect alpha was
sitting in my living room for almost 4
months now and I had to put it to some
good use luckily it features red and
black accents throughout the chassis so
it fits perfectly with the color scheme
that we're going for in the first place
and it costs $80 now many of you guys
would say that the offense XP 400s looks
a lot better offers a lot more features
and costs exactly the same as the spec
alpha which is $80 and I would agree
with you guys because I would actually
pick the fan fics case over the spec
alpha any time of the day but like I
said this guy was taking space in my
living room so it was and it was the
only option I had so yeah powering the
whole TC is the Silverstone Strider plus
500 watt fully modular power supply it
comes with an 80 plus bronze
certification and given its excellent
modularity and extra wattage Headroom
you can easily upgrade to a faster GPU
that requires more power once again
alternatives are always welcome but this
was something I had lying around in the
studio so that's a total of two
components put to good use
so with all parts out of the way let's
build our first
Rison five systems
well here's a final system in all its
glory I'm actually pretty happy with the
final result
the case obviously is an interesting
aspect about this build and I'm sure
many of you would start raging about it
in the comments so I'm looking forward
to that the one thing that stands out
the most is the cable mass at the bottom
right in front of the power supply
I wish Corsair included a separate power
shroud to hide them plus the lack of
rubber grommets right beside the
motherboard tray is disappointing on a
positive note they include two red led
antique fans that perfectly match the
color scheme and the front aisle panel
covers all the essentials you need like
two USB 2.0 ports and dedicated
headphone / Mike Jack's the weight
smacks cooler looks gorgeous with the
RGB LED ring plus it adds some character
to the Weizen build alright so let's see
how the system performs I left the 1600
X at stock settings and the RX 480 was
set to OSI mode through the GPT software
and here's what I got I rendered our
standard one-minute 4k video using
Premiere Pro CC 2017 and the Rison 5
build rendered the clip 12 seconds
longer than my workstation PC it's not a
huge difference to be honest and this
can vary heavily upon the GP of choice
as well in this case with the arcs 480 I
was able to play rack native 4k gh4
files within premiere and the GPU was
utilizing well over 90% if I were to
throw in a GTX 1060 1070 or 1080 the
results may vary because Premiere Pro
works really well with CUDA CPA
temperatures were respectable out of the
box the 1600 X ran about 39 see during
idle and under load
it was reaching about 67 C and this was
monitored through the wizened master
software now on to gaming battlefield 1
at 1080p set to high averaged well over
90 frames per second and dipped into the
low 80s
overwatch at 1080 P set to ultra
averaged about 87 things per second and
dished up minimums in the low 70s Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon violence which is a
slightly more demanding title taxed out
in the arcs 480 averaging just a tad
over 60 frames per second and
in the high 40s these tricks ARC's 480
was running at a constant 13 30
megahertz with temperatures reaching
just below 70 C and I did not experience
throttling whatsoever oh hey there NC
XCOM it's Canada's leading a tailor for
anything your mind desires just keep
within those categories which are plenty
and be attempted by the weekly deals
visit ncx dot-com for all them sweet
deals so there you have it our first
rising 5 build featuring the brand new
1600 x from AMD now this is not the end
for our performance analysis of these
newer CPUs because we will be doing a
video on how overclocking a CPU can
impact gaming performance we're also
expecting a micro code update from AMD
in a few weeks so hopefully that will
help us get better frame rates you never
know anyway guys I want to hear your
thoughts about this build weather if you
hated it or if you loved it I'm looking
forward to reading those responses in
the comments I'm Eva with I reckon X
thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
