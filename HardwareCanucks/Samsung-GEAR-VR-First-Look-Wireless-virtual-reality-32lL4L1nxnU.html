great technology selections and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Haruka
knucks and Samsung gear VR is really
meant to hit two birds with one stone
first to show off the truly mobile of
virtual reality ecosystem while walking
to one truly amazing smartphone the note
for Samsung really is expanding their
reach towards mobile tech and this is a
more fancy and device specific headgear
that's very similar to what we saw with
Google cardboard VR headset so the way
it works is you insert the Galaxy Note 4
and this currently will only work with a
note 4 and perhaps later expand to
support multiple devices with a handset
in place there's an additional plastic
cover for aesthetics of course and since
the speaker is on the back side of the
handset it helps to bounce the audio
with pretty impressive audible immersion
however you are able to still plug in
headphones for private enjoyment by no
means this is a new design it's very
similar if not almost identical to what
we've seen from oculus rift with two
lenses for that three-dimensional feel
and in fact Samsung has actually teamed
up with oculus who have developed this
headset and the software there's a wheel
up top to adjust lens distance so how
close your eyes are to the display
unfortunately it didn't seem like
there's any clearance for glasses on the
right side there's a back button touch
pad and the phone control and since it's
fully powered by a smartphone it's
completely wireless and does not require
any external setup
aside from installing the applications
on the note 4 and it's the resolution
and pixel density of the note 4 that
allows this to operate quite well with
really awesome immersion and various
applications from PR gaming to fear like
movie experiences I played a quick
adventure game that really puts you in a
total different setting that's all
powered by a phone with a pleasant sense
of scale of course there are limitations
on the type of gaming from the
smartphone you can
she've and also the Android ecosystem
but we have already seen half life to
pour it onto Android and many other cool
titles in the works for the Android
ecosystem that would really help to
drive this virtual reality on the truly
mobile device they've managed to reduce
head movement latency to 20 milliseconds
which is almost instantaneous and very
accurate to even slight head movements
that helps to you know bring that
immersion feeling I still do think it's
way too bulky of a device to be used on
the regular basis and you know I would
love to see something more simple
something more compact but they have
managed to create a good-looking headset
that is also comfortable so that's a
plus and as soon as we see a larger
array of higher resolutions phones on
the market this will become a very
popular way to enjoy VR directly from
your smartphone so what do you guys
think of this design and for potential
notes for users will you consider a gear
VR to complement the overall usability
of your phone and what are you thoughts
on the exclusivity of the gear VR to the
note 4 and as always thanks for watching
