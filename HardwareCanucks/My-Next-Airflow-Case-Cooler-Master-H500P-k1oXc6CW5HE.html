fantex schoolmaster and Emma sign what's
up guys I'm Dimitri now recognize and I
am genuinely excited for the return of
the half or the high airflow series from
Coolermaster this my friends is the H
500 P a case that the boat looks amazing
I love this sort of metallic and glass
look although it's not metallic as a lot
of my friends it's fan blasted plastic
look with an acrylic side panel both at
the front and the top and this cohesion
with lighting and RGB looks absolutely
incredible so the two front spans are
200 millimeters and they are RGB so you
can control the lighting based on the
front IO which is nice so the included
fans and they told us that they didn't
even have any exhaust fans and just
having two fronts these giant fans is
enough to deliver a good airflow to go
through the case horizontally and yeah
that's a very good thing that's what the
high airflow series is known for anyway
alright so on the inside it's very much
a master case concept and I like that
they're going with a modular direction
so they have a simple you know the same
hard drive storage bracket at the back
they have a modular power supply shroud
so the front portion can move back a
little bit to make more clearance for a
front radiator they don't have a window
for the power supply which is kind of I
don't know say what you will about that
there's a lot of room over here so not
sure why they went with that instead of
moving the power supply closer there and
leaving more room at the back tour for
cables but one cool thing is that this
case will come with a vertical GPU
bracket which by the way if you notice
at the back does not interfere with any
of the PCI components so you can still
have a vertical GPU bracket to show off
short off your GPU while still
populating anything on the back there as
long as it's not much higher than the
PCI slot itself so here and the Emmys it
will be fine and that's awesome as for
the i/o they were very happy to tell me
that they've added more USB ports
because they've heard my complaints
about them only including two years be
forced on their higher-end cases now we
have four plus a day what interesting
thing about the power button is they
remove the coolermaster logo and they
just kept the shape so maybe they're
going for a little bit more of a
recognition element so that people can
adjusted to that shape to be the cool
master shape or something but looking at
the back check this out check out how
beautiful this whole thing looks I don't
think I think I would put a side panel
here because everything is kind of
divided into sections so we have a main
power supply some power supply cable
cover here it covers everything that's
on the side we have a CPU backplate
cover which can be 3d printed they
provide templates there are two SSD
brackets here and the power supply area
and whoever did this build is amazing
because everything here it looks very
clean and yeah you don't need a side
panel on the back which is here by the
way with captive thumb screws so that's
a nicely standard but at the front so
this is something that I didn't cover
yet they have a tempered glass panel
that simply goes on top like so and they
are using the same mounting mechanism so
the glass kind of shifts and it hangs
off this light ledge without falling and
they're using the similar mounting
method like on a 5 T turbo but here
instead of having you need to use a key
to lock it you can simply use a little
coin or something
so they've simplified that because
people keep losing the damn keys alright
so this being an airflow enclosure so
aside from the two 200 millimeter fans
here that you can swap for 3/16 on the
radiator at the top we have the similar
brackets as we see on the cosmos so that
is a 360 million radiator which gets
here no problem it is a removable
bracket so that's nice if you want to
install everything before inserting it
into the case and I just really love the
return on what they're trying to
approach here with the half series or
not really half series but more like the
high airflow direction and I can't wait
to get this interview but there's one
other super awesome case on the show
floor let's go check it out now so this
my friends is the cool master master box
cube I really appreciate for what kumis
is trying to do here because because
these three cases are the same frame so
this is the whole idea here is they're
trying to go for like more basic
bare-bones system where it's like just a
micro ATX enclosure this has a lot of
cool elements that allows us to be super
module so if you come over here this is
but
you know higher end version that allows
you to add handles that are have
metallic frame with a sort of plastic
housing on the outside so they feel
alright but I'm hoping they will be able
to improve them a little bit with this
very tempered glass looking acrylic so
it is not a tempered glass it's just
simple acrylic which is then printed and
then here this is the exact same frame
as the first one but now they've added
more elements here so the handles are
the same but the acrylic portions are
slightly more extended allowing the case
to actually sit on one of them and just
you have basically three different
unique enclosures with the same frame
and that's because as you can see here
the perforation panels are what allows
it to be so unique so here the
perforation panel is on it on the front
and on the bottom allows you to mount
fans pretty much and anywhere on the
surface because we are told that the
coals are precise so that regardless of
where you mount the fan it will align
with another hole somewhere else and
there's also the perforation at the
bottom too but when we move over to the
more advanced stuff the perforation now
expands to an additional side panel so
we have 1/3 perforation side and allows
you to basically maneuver whatever you
want you can install radiators you can
sell fans on there and then at the back
here the same thing applies which is
three perforated panels and allows you
to have this very cool look now because
of this modularity the i/o as you can
see here is also modular so you can
mount the i/o with the two screws in the
front wherever you want wherever the
perforation side panel is so for example
here the i/o is on the front here is
also at the front but here it's at the
top which is nice so they have a bit of
diversion here and this is also tempered
glass it looks like tempered glass but
they're going for kind of like this
premium look without the premium
materials because the price points
$39.99 $69.99 and $89.99 so giving you a
bit of variety of where you want to go
basic slightly more advanced for my tier
micro ATX and a really cool look for the
angler chassis and as for the interior
because it's targeting the budget
enclosure market
it's very basic there's no power supply
shroud but it does support ATX power
supplies and micro ATX motherboards and
you know there's nothing here there's no
rubber grommets even but if you come
around over here there's a lot of room
for cable management and it's got two
places for SSDs and a single drive
bracket for a hard drive that we are
told maybe will be expanded to support
SSDs also as we'll give you plenty of
storage capacity here but because these
panels these exterior panels are removed
with simple clips so you don't need to
use screws you can mount your drives
anywhere in the perforation perimeter
and yeah that's pretty cool allowing you
to be super module and I really like
this master box concept because it's
something different and actually not a
bad idea to have one single frame that
can be converted into different types of
enclosure yeah I like it what about you
let us know in the comments down below
thanks much for watching make sure to
check out over other Computex coverage
from colormaster and all the brands and
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
