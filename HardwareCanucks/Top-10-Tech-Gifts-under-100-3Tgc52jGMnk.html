we thought we'd do something a little
bit different to help make your purchase
decisions a little easier so this is our
top 10 holiday guide for tech gifts
under $100 Matt okay take it away
so first thing we got the chromecast
analysis the chromecast dongle most of
you already know exactly what it is you
can get it on Amazon for $30 what this
little device does is it basically turns
on any dumb TV into a smart TV by
connecting this dog to the HDMI port and
your television now this will give you
access to Android environment which will
give you access to stuff like Netflix
Hulu and all the other Android content
that you really want to have up next we
got the Fitbit flex now you guys heard
me talk a lot about the Fitbit force but
the flex is a little bit more of a
dumbed down version for $100 so up next
guys as battlefield 4 it speaks for
itself
that's up next we got this one I want to
make sure I get the name right it's the
high Perkin retron 5 what is this thing
basically it's a device a gaming device
that allows you to play all your classic
cartridges so your Nintendo your nes
SNES genesis Gameboy advanced you can
put all these cartridges in the game you
can play them under 1080p TV at a decent
resolution so you don't really need to
go digging in your closet or onto eBay
to be able to find all these amazing
classic retro games that you guys would
really love best thing you can get for
higher bucks
last but not least guys we're looking at
the Logitech Bluetooth adapter basically
this little $45 adapter will take any of
your great awesome speakers so that the
sound systems that you guys love and
currently use on a daily basis you can
turn that into a Bluetooth speaker so
you can use your phone or your tablet to
wirelessly stream your audio over to any
speaker system at all so thanks much for
that next on list is Corsair Vengeance
1300 King had said pony
$79.99 actually a really good value for
a headphone this is a 3.5 millimeter
Jack this is not USB so you would
require a sound card but from our
testing we have their view on a haru-kun
XCOM and it turns out to be really good
headset for the money so next is Moe max
high power battery pack this is holding
11200 milliamp hour of charge so in the
equivalent to this this is 2100 this is
nexus 4 which would give me : 2 6
charges on this one battery pack and
it's only $79.99 next on the list is 8
data one terabyte USB 3 drive this is HB
6 2064 dollars so an excellent value for
your sort of portable storage
speaking of keyboards Coolermaster
quick-fire XD and MX brown switches
clickety clickety click uh $94 some
excellent keyboard you know whatever you
prefer with that my switches back now
and lastly from me is a lomography DIY a
slot camera only $35 will leave a little
picture and the link in description so
you guys go check it out $35 an
excellent value for a little techie guy
whoever is one of your friends who is
into photography thinks so Matt I want

10 list for tech gift guides under 100
