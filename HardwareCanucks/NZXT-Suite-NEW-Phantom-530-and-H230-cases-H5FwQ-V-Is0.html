here with the new phantom 5:30 this is
the 2013 edition you know it builds up
on all the phantom updates throughout
throughout the time within 60 so it
basically takes your original phantom
adds up all the additional updates that
the entire phantom lineup has had and
this is what we have so the final
outcome is the 530 so one thing is you
notice right away well this is a glossy
red edition we also have the glossy
white and the glossy black also we are
told that matte black and matte gunmetal
black is going to be available soon as
well so those are options again
available $10 extra now one the most
predominant features again we can see
the NZXT you know they have figured out
their internal design pretty well so not
much changes going on here again some
little updates that again modify this
case to be a little bit better for water
cooling and just more components to be
fitted for the inside so if we look in
the back one of the SSD cages has been
removed instead of two you only have one
we're still plenty of room for all your
cable management tons of grommet holes
you know NZXT does a really good job
with cable management plenty of cable
tie grommets you know good spacing for
your 8 pin CPU large CPU cutoff as well
and this is where we have our all the
SSD and HDD brackets now one thing that
you guys know that I have complained
about these a lot because of how flimsy
they are but look at these now you know
they're not completely modified but they
have been made sturdy so that's a good
sign from NZXT good job guys but we are
told that these will not be used in
future cases so that's a good sign we'll
see me perhaps something off more sturdy
but again we see we have the fan
controller at the top we have two USB 3
ports audio jacks power and reset
buttons and we also have a single fan
controller 30 Watts that can be plugged
in into
the into the fan hub in the back so you
can still control all your fans with
this we see the door open it's a
magnetic door so it is kind of difficult
to open there you go one thing that I
notice right away is also the mesh in
the front has been enlarged so there's a
larger volume of air going through the
front this is a 200 millimeter fan in
there now one issues that we've had with
the fan cases is that the angle have
been the one is some of the issues we've
had with NZXT cases is the front airflow
because it's you know it's cut off here
so they've enlarged this area here so we
get maximum airflow for this sort of
angular design so again available in two
and three colors so it's $129 for a full
tower and one last thing is that triple
fan support so a 360 degree 360
millimeter that is supported for the top
there's also those additional spacing so
for those 140 millimeter radiators that
have different spacing between the fans
that will be supported with this case
and the last thing we want to mention is
the side panel we have the same angle
design acrylic side panel so revealing a
lot of the internals I'm gonna be seeing
your graphics card your CPU cooler of
course a little bit of hard drive but
that's that's not an issue but also also
notice the the mesh no snow no dust
filter here but it will still absorb
some of us that you can clean it but
this is a 140 mm at a fan that will
deliver some airflow towards your your
hard drives installed on the right and
also deliver some airflow for the
graphics card so not a bad place to put
it a little extra airflow for the
internals especially at the bottom it
will deliver a cold air from below from
the side also cold air from the front so
a good integration for airflow from the
side panel so another case we have here
and NZXT is the h2 30 now it takes up
the same initial design of sound
dampening foam that we see here on the
panels both on the front panel and in
the back panel as well now it takes the
sort of this concept of silence and
integrates it into a mid tower that's is
budget-friendly so $69.99 the retail
price and also incorporates the sound
dampening materials same internal layout
that we've seen you know basically on
mid towers throughout three so six in
total of your any of the 3.5 or 2.5 inch
drives three optical drives so when it
comes to the airflow on the h 230 the
front air flow is sacrificed because the
only venting we see is on this side and
not on the other so it is a little bit a
disadvantage because the front air flow
will suffer and any of your new drives
here aren't going to be cooled
appropriately because this is the only
vent thing that we see on the side so
hopefully we can see some integration of
more ventilation perhaps on this side or
something something else but we are
looking at the sort of a silent chassis
that is budget-friendly that has ATX
support and if we look at the back again
NZXT pretty well known for their cable
management we don't see any rubber
grommets but this is a sort of a budget
oriented case but still would be nice to
include them plenty of cable a notch is
fairly small CPU cutout so that may be a
an issue for some and also we see a 8
pin connection there that is just hidden
but it is there so that's a good thing
to see the the drive carries if you look
at here that we've been we've criticized
them quite a bit because they are very
flimsy would be nice to have the new
caddies integrated like the one that the
Phantom 530 but I guess we can't have it
all all right it's also in the top we
have two USB 3 power reset and your
audio jacks
so these are have been the two cases
that we are seeing here at Computex 2013
the h2 30 and the Phantom 530 so thank
you guys for watching and stay tuned for
more Computex coverage
