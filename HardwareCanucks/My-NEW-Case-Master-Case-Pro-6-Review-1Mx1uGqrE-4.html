is even particular way to hold the case
by the bottom not by the top and we even
get handles to take this thing out of
the box all right what where's the
temple wat actually I'll save it for the
engine so this my friend says the cooler
master master case six pro it's one the
only master cake series on the higher
end here that we haven't reviewed yet
and I'm hoping you know we'll see if
this is going to be my new case for my
workstation editing PC Verizon so let's
see if it's any good
what is that the view 31 you should put
a ring on it yeah
time to make it our Jimmy official
there will take ring-type static
pressure fast because your key reserves
are in full details in description below
so the mastercase pro six is not
entirely a new case Coolermaster just
reusing the interior of their master k
series here and the only thing that's
different are the exterior panels for
which they received the Innovation Award
at Computex 2017 your master just won
the cni award to the master cable ship
so the interior is identical to the
mastercase 5 and the 5 t so check out
those reviews for the full details but a
quick recap is in order first I love the
side panel attachment that includes
captive thumb screws and a two-step side
panel removal so they don't fall out I
gotta take it off you can buy the glass
panel separately but that's gonna cost
you $50 extra so it would have been
really awesome to see it included by
default with maybe a small price bump
because it looks absolutely gorgeous
what we saw at CES plus the 5 T has the
proper glass mount so I'm a bit
disappointed to see acrylic on such an
expensive case because it really doesn't
do it justice the basement is isolated
with appropriate rubber grommets for
cables into the main chamber and a
blackout bottom portion for the window
to hide everything that's in here which
I appreciate plus a modular drive cage
with dual drive caddies the interior has
dual SSD caddies below the motherboard
that are slightly elevated so you can
use United degree SATA connections or
the non end SATA power connections for
hassle-free routing plus we have this
module drive gauge system to install
cages anywhere along the height of the
case it's an excellent execution but the
available accessories are on the
expensive side like 20 bucks for
additional drag cages a GPU holder this
really awesome LED partition would have
been an amazing inclusion by default
because the only way people realize that
accessories even exist if they come
included with a particular version of
the master case did you know there is a
vertical GPU bracket that you can buy or
vertical as a d'être or a PCIe SSD tray
or even a custom made power supply
shroud cover no because none of these
are actually included in any of the
master case series why and what we saw
at CES with their build using the
case with tempered glass side panels the
vertical GPU brackets and the included
white LED strip looked amazing but
that's going to cost you just as much as
buying another mastercase 5 and ain't
nobody got time for that the dual
5-minute quarter inch drive bay is
removable with appropriate dust filter
separation for the front section with
duo 114 or fans included plus a standard
bottom rear dust filter is easily
accessible on the rear side we have a
nice channel for cable management with
darker straps and slots for those SSD
caddies if you wish to install them here
instead so the special thing about the
six are the magnetic front and top
covers that can be extended for
additional airflow or so they say we'll
test that later I do like the magnetic
approach because the extensions are easy
to pull out or push back in but with the
panel's pulled out we lose the clean
lines look and the case becomes kind of
unattractive especially with these large
gaps that are created at the front and
at the top it just looks like something
is not aligned properly like you forgot
to push the side panel in fully and
that's a huge turnoff I do like the
discrete i/o at the top it's hidden
behind this floppy cover but only two
USB ports is not how I like to roll
where my USB port
you
and so for conclusion I'm not entirely
happy with the case for example the top
fan bracket that can fit 240 and 280
million radiators is still centered I
would like it to be slightly offset to
allow better clearance for the top
motherboard area as far as the color
accent goes the LED fan in the rear kind
of feels cheap I rather prefer a red LED
strip and you can also buy the case in
blue LED illumination so that's the
thing I don't like the front LED
illumination because it´s just
blindingly bright you cannot disable it
unless you disconnected via the SATA
connector but seriously this is not how
you do ambient case lighting and lastly
I wanted to test the cooling potential
of the top and front panels and see if
there's going to be any changes in the
temperature of my system so I stressed
out the 1700 X and yeah there was a
significant and noticeable cool
improvement with the side panels pulled
out however this also introduced more
noise for the exterior not by much
with the system felt quieter when the
panel's fully closed and so with that I
appreciate the innovative features
simply being able to pull out those top
and front panels off for extra cooling
and there are an excellent mechanism
that works great but as a full package
it just doesn't feel refined I find lack
of premium accessories to be a real
drawback here because imagine a tempered
glass side panel maybe a white LED frame
on the interior what we saw at CES that
was the perfect default configuration
for the mastercase pro 6
if only that configuration was
reasonably priced instead of spending
close to $300 because of all these
expensive individual accessories say
goodbye to cables it's time to enjoy
wireless audio with the course they
avoid RGB gaming headset with the light
and comfortable frame low profile mic on
headset volume control and mic mute +
dual size illumination
check out the void RGB by Corsair the
perfect way to hear your game but let me
know what you guys think of the
mastercase pro 6 do you agree with my
