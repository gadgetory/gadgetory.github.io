sure thing what even is that to be
honest I'm not quite sure this my friend
is a proper typing keyboard oh wow
how boring can you keyboard do this huh
mine's smaller all the important stuff
whatever guys at least mine looks good
huh so all of these keyboards look
pretty unique for either gaming typing
or mobility let's check him out
after this looking for a solid board to
pair your 19 CPU the ASRock Z390 Taichi
gets it right with robust vrm designs
for extreme overclocking a 12 phase
power design for smooth power delivery
dual band Wi-Fi 3m 2 slots and
reinforced PCI connectors learn more
about it down below all right so
everything you'll see today will be
linked in the description below thank
you very much all right so let's begin
with something totally different in
economic typing keyboard from a company
X-Bows Ergonomic arrived with the MX brown
switches and the fantastic rubber wrist
rest that I now use for all my other
keyboards everyday it connects via USB
type-c which is a surprise and has a
metal backplate on top of a plastic body
now interestingly everything about this
layout this kind of bizarre with
non-standard key sizes like the giant
backspace and alt keys broken up
spacebar for both your thumbs tiny shift
key on the sides and additional
backspace enter ctrl and shift keys
sandwiched right between that angular
shift for the midsection the purpose
here is to provide uninterrupted typing
for both of your hands it's a more
ergonomic level than your typical
keyboard because the key columns flare
into the middle at first it was super
odd and awkward placing my hands on the
keyboard and not knowing where the keys
are and I was training myself for two
weeks trying to get accustomed to it
build new muscle memory and finger
memory knowing where the keys are but
it's been quite difficult and in the
beginning I was making so many spelling
errors and I still do one particular
annoyance for me is how the spacing
between the keys increases for the upper
keys making it more difficult to
actually recognize the full layout and
this is the first time I'm trying
something like it an economic keyboard
some typist based on reviews love it and
some find it extremely uncomfortable and
in that second camp the driver software
feels outdated but I'm a big fan of
their RGB implementation and also
because of that tiny shift key and caps
lock etc on the left side gaming on this
keyboard is out of question
now speaking of keyboards you cannot
game with I found this portable foldable
Bluetooth keyboard that is actually
quite fascinating if you need some basic
typing and navigation so it folds into a
compact and protected package with over
500 hours of standby time I wouldn't use
this for everyday but the layout is
actually not horrible given the fold
breaks the keyboard flow I wish all the
keys were the same size like DF TV are
especially annoying with a thinner
profile but if you need to carry a tiny
keyboard someplace it's actually pretty
good
it connects to my iPhone my Android
phones but honestly I'm faster typing on
the phone itself while for a Windows
machine given we have a tiny trackpad
that's actually better than some
notebook ones the keyboard is awesome to
use with hard reach computer spaces or
simple control of your HTPC it is a
highly niche product of course but it's
not too expensive at only $30 and moving
on to something for gaming we have this
interesting keyboard from Roccat the
Vulcan 120 aimo if you like full-sized
layouts and desk area is not the concern
it's a cool option and the reason it's
on my list are twofold Roccats own Titan
mechanical switches and the overall
board design
so first the Titans which is this is
becoming my favorite brown switch with a
tactile point at one point eight
millimeters with total travel distance
of three point six and I also love the
bounce back and the weight the half high
key caps at the slim factor to such a
massive keyboard that I appreciate but
more importantly they don't cover any of
the illumination and unlike what
Coolermaster did with the totally flat
surface of slim key caps on the Vulcan
they're slightly curved and angled by
row basis so fingers fall naturally into
place and the stem by the way is MX
based so if you wish you can swap some
out as for the design the clear switch
bass look fantastic with any hint of
illumination and that aluminum base
plate at
texture the volume wheel is awesome and
can be programmed to something else
useful and for macro lovers you can
utilize the EZ shift plus feature to
activate that second layer of commands
on shortcuts that I find incredibly
useful for my editing workflow the
magnetic wrist rest is okay it's just a
plastic piece and if a tkl version was
available that was slightly slimmer it
would have my name on it
totally what go on my desk which brings
me to my next unique pick a hybrid
keyboard from Asus the ROG claim or
following in the legendary footsteps of
the Sidewinder xx by Microsoft
now the Claymore is from 2017 and I'm
honestly quite surprised we haven't seen
any more similar keyboards so what you
can do here is detach that numpad area
from the right and turn this into your
standard T key a layout without any
compromises but you can also attach the
numpad section to the left of the
keyboard thus giving you that full-size
keyboard shortcuts and all the keys but
clearing up that area on the right for a
mouse movement it's an awesome hybrid
approach the frame is as compact as
possible thus there are no dedicated
media controls outside the volume dial
above the numpad section and you also
have these rubber grommets to cover
these side connectors when they're not
in use and the only reason why this
thing has kind of like slid under our
radar since 2017 is the price it's hella
pricey and especially for 20 so the
price yes it is hella pricey especially
for 2019 standards and that I guess
comes with that hybrid premium and
moving on to the last unique pic we have
the Razer Tartarus v2 gamepad now I
actually did the full video on this guy
recently but the idea of a smaller
gaming keypad that is more ergonomic is
just awesome and I wish we had more of
them on the market you can use them for
macros within professional applications
or in gaming as what they're designed
for and the Tartarus v2 raises your
wrists and relieves something you're
fatigued and placing it closer to the
body let's the elbow rest and it opens
up a lot of the area for Mouse movement
where normally your keyboard would be it
does not replace your keyboard but might
complement your work or gaming style if
you're willing to pay full price over
norm
keyboard for this half-sized product get
a good sense of grip with Corsairs iron
claw RGB Gaming Mouse featuring a
lightweight design ultra durable Emraan
switches paired with Pixar's 33 91
optical sensor and some RGB lining for
some extra Flair the iron claw ensures
gaming at its best check it out down
below alright so if you've seen any
interesting or unique keyboards on the
market let us know in the comments I
would love to try something new going
with the economic keyboard for the first
time I thought that the awkward stage
would pass as I trained my fingers and
start to realize where the keys are but
that didn't really emergent to anything
and I'm quite impressed with the rocket
Vulcan for the design and the key
switches the Titan switchers are awesome
but though if only they made a TTL
version because the full-size with that
extension on the frame is a bit too big
for my style but guys I'm Dimitri thanks
much for watching make sure to check out
