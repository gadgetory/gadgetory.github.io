now recognize that's Eva right there and
this is Apple Magic Mouse to a product
that seems to compound your Apple
computer with its sleek design the glass
in the aluminum body definitely an
exciting products to unbox and look at
and the price is actually not too shabby
but I want to know what the experience
is like using an on tap a mouse on my
macbook so at $99 this might be the
perfect alternative to the Apple Magic
Mouse which cost $79 so there's a $20
difference here but the t43 is also
Wireless it has a much better sensor
much better economics so let's see if
buying a gaming mouse for your Mac is
worth it right after this
cool master master keys keyboard lineup
is now available and three sizes to fit
within your space with large medium and
small boards with either beautiful RGB
or pure white LED illumination a little
something for everyone make it yours
with the master keys pro by Cooler
Master Eva come over here come on
field is too much let me know which one
you like better thoughts for your
thoughts
I don't like it give it look this is
what elements thanks Eber for your input
but in all seriousness I was very
skeptical about the shape when I first
picked this up and still am it's not
exactly comfortable especially when
compared to something like the g4 3
however I mean look at this thing it's
so beautiful the aluminum the glass the
top everything just screams a quality
product for Apple that would complement
your other Apple products and that's a
good thing cohesion of build quality and
design language is very important for
the Apple standard so let's begin with
connectivity Apple Magic Mouse 2 is
fully wireless there are no USB dongles
required and recognition is almost
instantaneous with this visual pop up on
the screen you know it just works and
for battery life it will last you for
like a full month on a single charge and
say what you will about the charging
port at the bottom you know it does look
ridiculous
but the recharge is fast enough to never
have to worry about battery life the g4
3 on the other hand does require a USB
dongle so that will occupy USB port on
your computer if you have it but at
least it is low profile and modest tech
has actually pretty good Mac OS drivers
that work well you just have
aside to use generic functions to the
side buttons for Mac OS to recognize
them charging requires a microUSB cable
and it doesn't last anywhere as long as
the Magic Mouse recharging takes longer
and you will need to do it more
frequently and economically these two
could not be any more different you know
a flat piece that like really doesn't
have any shape for your hand it's nice
smooth edges on the glass so there's a
bit of a transition here actually
reminds me a little bit of like the
Razer Diamondback and which I don't
really like the shape but the g43
super comfortable very nice curves and
just really ergonomic to support your
right hand but also you know the Magic
Mouse is symmetrical so it is good for
left and right hand use but the low
profile nature of this Magic Mouse means
it's really strange to hold it's one of
the most unnatural mice that are used
and you know it only feels ok now after
a few weeks of adjustment period and the
g4 3 in contrast is one of the best mice
for your right hand like I said
ergonomic curves good height and
switching between the two you can easily
ditch the Magic Mouse because the form
is beautiful but unfortunately it is
awkward to hold the left and right
clicks are fine on both I prefer the own
the separate buttons on the g4 3 but the
Magic Mouse has slightly harder presses
with natural spacing between the uniform
surface so it's quite unique because you
know you don't have physical buttons
here but they interact very well and
just yeah I'm happy what they've done
here to preserve this uniform smooth
surface without sacrificing on the
usability of the buttons you can't mess
them up both of these mice have easily
identifiable on-off switches at the
bottom with long glide feet on the Magic
Mouse that are comfortable and are
pretty good on plenty of surfaces and
since this sensor here is laser it is
good for reflective surfaces as well
unlike the optical sensor on the g4 3
that is fantastic in accuracy and is
actually one of the best sensors on the
market right now but it requires an
actual mat so for example in this white
surface it will not track but you need a
hard surface mat so there's something to
take into account because the Magic
Mouse tracks on this surface perfectly
fine but not the g4 3 but what surprised
me the most with the g4 or three is just
how much more responsive
Center felt on the screen and I'm not
sure exactly if it's like the Hertz
refresh rate or because it's optical so
there's no acceleration but it's salt
really true one-to-one tracking on the
screen versus the Magic Mouse because
there is acceleration yes I did game on
the Magic Mouse too on my MacBook Pro
and it played CF six years ago I feel
like you know betraying the csgo
community and the PC master-race but
it's almost like mixing orange juice
with milk it's very unnatural but when
we bring in the chief or three into the
equation it's still a little bit awkward
right because of this machine but my aim
felt a lot more responsive I could aim
better and it was almost like mixing
orange juice with cranberry juice it's
not exactly perfect but it is much
better than the milky stuff over here
however one of the main advantages when
it comes to the Apple Mouse are gesture
controls on the glass surface because
it's super smooth it's very responsive
that allows you to you know smooth
scroll the pages or you can swipe left
to right that is particularly useful for
scrolling my timeline for video editing
and also the lack of a scroll wheel I
did not actually find that an issue you
know I'm very used to using the scroll
wheel on any gaming mice or PC mouse to
scroll inside the premiere timeline but
on here it's very responsive still the
touch gestures work very well and so
after using it for a couple of weeks you
know I've been kind of running with this
type of setup and trying to explore
where I love the Magic Mouse where I
love the g43 and you know a mouse on
your MacBook Pro is just a complementary
tool because 80% in time I'm using the
trackpad which is fantastic so when only
it comes out to editing I would pull
this out and you know if I need to drag
and drop things it's much better to use
a mouse because you have a little bit
more area and the g43 actually falls on
the same footsteps but with a much more
responsive sensor and better ergonomics
so definitely the g4 3 for a stationary
machine if you're utilizing an Apple
computer but I would have to pick at the
Apple Magic Mouse to for travel purposes
because it's super thin so it's really
complements the whole portability aspect
and just touch controls work really well
and so then it is a little bit of a
compromise
although I still think the shape on the
Magic Mouse is ridiculous for constant
use you
we have to learn how to use it and not
use it constantly because the ergonomic
sound like when you put these two
fingers you know there's no way to for
the fingers on so the Logitech mouse is
a solid option especially because the
drivers support for Mac OS is excellent
and so that's it for my experience using
these two mice on my macbook I'm using
the g4 3 as my stationary because I love
the shape and like you can really go
fast with edits and stuff but I do
travel with this guy because of that
convenience factor don't judge oh hey
there NC XCOM is Canada's leading
etrailer for anything your mind desires
just keep within those categories which
are plenty and attempted by the weekly
deals visit ncx dot-com for all them
sweet deals so thanks guys so much for
watching make sure to let me know what
now it's you using for your Apple device
make sure to check out these videos and
subscribe and we'll see you in next
video it's good for reflective surfaces
