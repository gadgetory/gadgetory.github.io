great technology selection and service
building my first aim the system after
five years was refreshing and having
first an experience with how the new
crimson drivers behave how the FX
processor stacks up in 2016 and you know
with the aim for socket incoming and
then later this year building this type
of octet system brings a good point of
reference for comparison on AIM these
future hardware so in this video we
overclock the processor update to the
latest 16.1 crimson Edition drivers and
see if we can get extra performance
squeezed out out of the system for
gaming and this promised I wanted to see
how this eight core chip would perform
for video rendering now I must say there
were weird things happening with the
system in the beginning first I got
really low score and Cinebench r15 at
4.4 gigahertz which was caused by the
CPU underclocking itself to 4 gigahertz
which is weird but after tinkering with
the BIOS to make sure that the CPU was
at the constant overclock which I was
able to hit to 4.7 deer Hertz
so my Cinebench scores had improved by
close to 150 points I did or o'clock the
380 cards a little bit as well hitting
eleven hundred megahertz on the core and
1600 megahertz on the memory and now
with this overclocked machine I went to
play battle 2 for battlefront and Crysis
3 from which you can see my overclocking
efforts have played out well with more
than 10 percent performance increase in
all three games compared to my previous
stock results and with regards to video
rendering this 8 core is really not the
best for that rendering out a 5 minute
4k project in just over 12 minutes while
my skylake system renders it out in just
under 8 minutes
and surprisingly my editing notebook
with a 4720 HQ
at 3.5 gigahertz renders the video
faster than this eight core FX 83-70 so
the processor is showing signs of aging
it is three year old architecture after
all so what do we take away from this so
in my opinion enjoyable gaming doesn't
come through only maxing out your
graphics settings because as you saw
with our crossfire configuration it is
still quite challenging to drive the
best graphics settings even at 1080p so
in my opinion you could lower some of
those settings to very high or just high
and get much better framerate results
averaging out at 120 fps easily as an
overall experience I'm glad that we went
with the octave red machine but if I was
to do it differently I would choose a
single card configuration versus
crossfire just because the nature of
dual graphics cards whether it be aim
the or Nvidia always introduces some
guaranteed poor scaling in games and so
you can have suffer in performance and
while crimson Edition software solves
from multiple of issues that users were
having in the past with crossfire it's
still not perfect there's some still
little slight hiccups here and there
like I would restart the system just
through because I was overclocking the
processor and all of a sudden my
crossfire would be disabled without me
knowing it until I jump into the game
and see that my framerate is not where
it should be I encountered more crashes
with crossfire than when I took on the
cards out and also you have to consider
the you LPS or ultra low power state for
the second GPU which basically turns off
the second GPU when it's not in use to
save power but I noticed it's not always
perfect and it would still be off when
jumping into on the games and requires a
whole restart cycle for it to work
properly and lastly if you take pricing
into account our dual three in the XS
approach the $500 price point without
discounts and with the recent price
drops of the r9 nano to $4.99 you would
get almost double the performance of the
dual three and the XS cards within that
similar price range but off a single GPU
and so that is it for the octet system
thank you for tuning in for part 2
part one is linked in the description if
you want more details I'm Dimitri with
the HERA Canucks thanks much for
watching we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
