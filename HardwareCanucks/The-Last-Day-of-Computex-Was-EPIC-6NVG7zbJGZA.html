we got to do some push-ups has become
the daily routine boys humor let's do it
but I gotta run into this video first I
gotta finish the script and I would like
to thank Coolermaster Thermaltake and
fantex for making this trip possible
feels good how do you feel nothing
alright guys so this is the last day of
Computex and you know the show floor we
don't really necessarily show you what's
on it so let's do a little beer all
sequins do you know just so that you're
aware of what's the experience here on
the show floor
so one of the reasons why we don't do
voiceovers on the show floor is because
we have music we have giant loud
announcements and yeah you just lose
your voice after there we go alright
guys so last night over dinner we heard
some good things about naktu us new 812
fans 120 member of fans they've been in
production for like five years
Jacob has designed it and yeah it's like
these are finally on the market the
spacing between the blades and the frame
is 0.5 millimeters which is insane and
they have one span over there the corner
of the booth that's currently air
cooling is literal and the fan is
running it around 20 DB so it's not like
this is 4000 rpm or something and if you
put it on your water cooling radiator
you'll see a nice bump up in performance
as compared to the F 12 fans which are
obviously quite popular with water
coolers anyway would you like bodyguards
right yeah we book tripods boys oh yes
not the camera
oMG guys so our context trip has come to
an end our lies they hear that gang now
we're going back to the hotel to edit
the cool content so how was the trip for
you guys amazing can't wait for next
year going back to the office in
Montreal getting ready for CES oh my god
CES
[Laughter]
I just can't wait to get all these
videos I did it but I'm looking forward
to Computex next year for sure are you
I'm gonna be here next year too
hopefully I'll be here too you better be
here else we're not here oh all right so
now it's time to have some work done
and have some fun too so as a little
treat to ourselves we are going to
Taipei 101
up there to the observatory trying to
catch the sunset because no doubt that
will be one beautiful sunset so there's
one problem and that is the lineup so we
have to find a way to surpass that to
see the beautiful view so at Taipei 101
we're actually meeting Paul from Paul's
hardware and Wendel from level one techs
who I'm really excited for yep yep
traffic wasn't too bad but I see the Sun
setting I don't know guys will we make
it through I say like 50 percent I see
it pretty tickets no not anymore
well well well we're going all the way
up to the 91st floor the boss man is
definitely treating us they're not
leaving it yes okay just just the two of
you guys you're such a cute couple
I don't feel left out at all so we're
about to go on the high speed high speed
passenger elevator until 2015
right information you don't need to know
in your life that should be quick though
yeah I don't know if it's gonna mess it
my brother thinks I won't know I won't
mess up your brain don't worry I got you
okay that was faster dos tres oh man we
just missed the like oh you might know
there's big like you Wendell my kickball
don't click camera meets a beautiful
sunset
so this view outdoors on the observatory
is absolutely incredible we came just at
the right time
all the building is starting to line up
this looks absolutely incredible
dude it's breathtaking view is amazing
what do you think pretty amazing yeah
390 meters right here well we just came
back inside from the observatory and one
weird observation is that our hands feel
very silky they feel really good really
yeah
but upstairs they felt very you know
moist and kind of blah but here they
feel great we should just stay indoors
okay now let's go see the big ball that
was absolutely incredible
movie and we got an uber time for dinner
okay you guys ready for the cold yeah
that was pretty fun but I can't wait to
get back home so thank you guys so much
