getting no ah hello the people I'm
Dimitri and beside me as the
long-awaited peace 600's we initially
saw this at Computex and now we have the
final production sample in our hands so
let's overview big thanks to all of our
sponsors for making CES possible
now the Eclipse P series is all about
performance and silence so the P 600 s
is kind of a combination of the two
interior shell is basically based off
the involve X make sure to check out all
of our content that we based on the
evolve X so you know it's a roomy
interior you can populate an ITX
motherboard above so all the same
features in terms of the sliding low
pads beside the motherboard tray I'm not
a fan of those I just you know simply
prefer regular rubber grommets but they
have made a bunch of changes on the
exterior so the one of the most
predominant things right now you see is
this matte steel it's not plastic
despite looking like plastic you know
it's quite cold to the touch in this
very cold montreal basement thus why I'm
wearing two sweaters I am NOT a fan of
this color no math is fine and you know
it will not show off as you know as many
fingerprints as let's say non matte
steel but I was hoping they could go
into direction of being a little bit
more you know creative like for example
if you remove the front little piece
over here to reveal your mesh fabric I
was hoping that this mesh fabric would
be accented colors so like maybe it's
like the darker gray or they could go
into like a colorful territory but you
know in terms of this all black design
it is a little bit boring but of course
it's really awesome to see this whole
mesh movement you know cases in 2017
where these glass close boxes with
choked air flow now we're just swinging
the other way meza fiying everything
basically and so it's really good to see
mesh on the interior you know below this
metallic casing so you can have a quiet
system that is going to be hotter or
opened it up for better air flow it is
very cool to see a new pattern being
introduced to the case market you know
the whole idea of fabric being
interchangeable so I'm hoping that
fantex plays around with color
and actually delivers something a little
bit different other than black maybe
different colors of course but what
happens if you rip it what happens if
you accidentally slightly push too hard
on it is it gonna lose its you know
elasticity is it gonna be droopy later
on so a lot of questions arise but I
guess we'll have to wait and see this
front plate can be angled out so it
opens up air flow and the side
methylations are facing the back so any
noise escape from the front will be
channeled towards the rear the IO is
hidden behind this cover with dual USB
threes a Type C Gen 2 port audio jacks
and a reset switch the power button is
at the top along with this other
removable magnetic plate that reveals
another similar to the front mesh dust
filter that is awesome to catch and in
settling dust and also for aesthetics if
you want to open up the front and the
top for air flow the temporal glass side
panel swivels to open pretty standard
stuff it can also be removed from the
hinges while the rear panel also
supposed to open has noise dampening
material applied on it since this is an
S edition of the enclosures therefore
silence focused and has a little of
fabric tabs to help you easily open that
rear side panel as for the interior you
have three 140 member of fans and all
the layout is exactly the same as the
evolved X and you know you don't really
get to experience the enclosure unless
you build in it so
with no fogged in so here's the
situation we got the piece 600's all
situated with the system by the way this
or is 2080 TI is absolutely insane I
actually like this so instead of
temperature testing we have got
ourselves an enamel anemometer and
anemometer that it measures the air
speed and so the whole idea is to use an
instrument like this to see what the air
flow basically is like I think it's
gonna be pretty fun we're actually going
to see if it's accurate though let's
begin the air flow taste so basically
this anemometer what we want to do is we
want to set up inside the case it's a
really quick and dirty setup right now
because we're leaving for CES tomorrow
morning again it's just gonna be non
scientific we're gonna put in there see
if there's any differences in the
readings from when we put on or off the
side panels basically this little fan in
here it's gonna spin and it's gonna give
us a measurement in meters per second
hopefully yeah I'm hoping that we can
actually see a visual difference when
the sight when the front panel is
installed when it's removed when it's on
an angle and then when the dust filter
is installed and all that goodness I
need it make sure that it's straight
that's something all right we're all set
up I think we should turn it on let's
see what happens okay you do it oh it
didn't knock over that's good hmm
so that's stationary it will spin if you
speak into it so putting my hand here
will bring us all the way down to 250
feet per minute so basically it seems to
be working again unscientific but it
seems to be working so all the
measurements are in and it's interesting
to see the variation of this speed
movement we are measuring in feet per
minute so with the case in the default
configuration we measure 271 but
slightly angle in this front panel we
measured at 281 so the difference is not
significant and removing this whole
front panel made no difference which
means that whole angular motion is
actually pretty good it clears out
enough room here but then the
interesting thing about removing this
section which is you know it's very open
it's made of mesh so it's made to move
air through
I went up to 300 feet per minute so the
difference between completely closed and
this thing removed was about 30 now
removing a dust filter we went up to 313
so dust filter is actually not
restrictive at all which is pretty
impressive and you can blow through it
and can still feel air coming through it
which is pretty nice and when you're
dealing with high static pressure fans
that is all good and so the difference
between completely you know default
configuration versus unrestricted front
intake is about 40 feet per minute so
it's not that significant but when
you're taking into account completely
choked front fans we're reading about
160 so this whole front panel design
with the mesh the dust filter and this
whole angular front panel motion is
pretty decent all those who are
contemplating about the evolved X
airflow can now kind of trust that fan
fics has no fixed it and the last thing
we want to test for a little
experimentation is to completely close
off that front panel because that is
quite common on cases and so completely
unrestricted we're getting around 315
feet per minute but now with you know
those front fans completely kind of
blocked off with a few millimeters away
from the front metal piece like what
what is that reading I think we're at
161 oh wow it's like nothing it's pretty
cool interesting that's for the price it
is slightly cheaper than the Evolve X
which is good if you were considering
thinking of the evolved X for its
interior layout for its ITX
accommodation you know vertical GPUs so
this is a good option if but actually
you're looking for that whole
performance aspect / silence focused
system alright guys so that is the
Eclipse P 600 s from fantex you know
it's nice to see them kind of innovating
the exterior design but I'm hoping that
would also focus a little bit more on
the interior and kind of like modify
certain things that you know users are
you know giving them feedback on they're
not super satisfied with and I'm hoping
that we'll see something
in the future release but let me know
your thoughts in the comments below
thanks much for watching we'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
