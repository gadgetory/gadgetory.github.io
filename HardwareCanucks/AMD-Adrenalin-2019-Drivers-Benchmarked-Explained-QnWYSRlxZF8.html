opportunity to sit down with AMD at
their Markham offices and talked about a
bunch of new things and while some of
them will need to stay locked away a big
part of our time was spent discussing
their drivers so for those of you who've
been following a channel for a while now
you'll notice that this is a video that
we do every year around the same time as
a matter of fact last year on December
the 12th we posted our video on the
adrenaline and edition drivers and you
can actually check it out right over
here but basically AMD tends to roll out
major updates on a yearly basis and so
here we are in mid-december and boom a
massive overhaul for Radeon software you
see many years ago AMD was known for
having amazing hardware but they were
held back by some pretty poor drivers
now they're on a mission to deliver the
best software possible and move the
perception of gamers away from the old
thought that AMD is amazing but their
drivers really suck kind of thing so now
they want to deliver day one support for
new games and also want to add a lot
more features to their GPUs so let's
discuss a little bit more about that
right after message from our sponsor hi
I'm looking for a case well look no
further I got this beauty the H 700 I by
NZXT with all steal premium frame with a
side of tempered glass - beautifully
showcase any cooling adventure you might
pursue and cable management system that
you wish you had earlier all this lit up
with integrated RGB lighting and
built-in fan control the aged 700 I this
one's for you I'll take it now I know
what you're all thinking what's
performance luck on these new drivers
well according to AMD they made some
pretty big steps since the original
adrenaline Edition drivers that were
launched about a year ago so this is a
chart that they provided us and there
has been some significant improvements
but remember this is a year of
development but you can also see some of
these titles like battlefield 5 and
Assassin's Creed Odyssey weren't even
around when the adrenaline was first
introduced in 2017 but with AMD's focus
on day 1 driver support for new games
there's a big performance improvement
over you using older software another
big focus for AMD is their project our
ESX which targets popular esports games
like overwatch and 49 for
special treatment basically they're
aiming to boost FPS while also lowering
response times and improving 99th
percentile frame times but what does
this all mean in real-world testing
let's check it out but before that I
wanted to mention how these were tested
basically I took aim DS 18.61 drivers
which were launched in June and I'm
comparing them to the adrenaline in 2019
at 1080p resolution it should be
interesting so as you can see that even
with some older games like overwatch and
destiny there are performance boosts but
the bigger ones come with battlefield 5
basically the newest game received a one
driver updates that weren't around back
in June which is pretty cool
alright so enough about performance
since there's a lot more to talk about
and I don't want this video to run close
to the 20 minute mark again but I do
want to mention something really quickly
AMD has been adding a lot more features
their latest update and that's primarily
because of the community feedback that
they've been receiving so they've been
hosting the Radeon team has been hosting
regular feedback sessions on reddit
Twitter and even their diminishing
service to their drivers so that as soon
as you know they get those results in
they actually start developing the new
features honestly guys the most
interesting thing about these new
drivers is what AMD is bringing to the
game streaming space while you can
already use the relive features to
stream your gameplay to services like
twitch YouTube and mixer really of games
streaming service allows you to
wirelessly stream your PC games directly
to your phone or tablet over a Wi-Fi
network so a quick overview before we
show this in action basically AMD game
streaming is meant to offer exactly what
valves steam link and in videos game
stream technology do but it doesn't
require another box like the Nvidia
shield to run the only small hiccup is
that it isn't officially compatible with
Android TV solutions but if enough
people ask for it they'll look into
porting it over so ask for it guys
according to AMD since this uses the
asynchronous compute engine within GCN
GPUs latency is better than on other
solutions like steam link the only
performance cut will be between one to
three percent which is basically the
overhead from AMD link running in the
background setup is actually pretty easy
too at least that's the way it worked at
AMD HQ the first thing you do is
download the AMD link app on either your
Android or iOS device scan the QR code
to pair with your PC and select the game
from the game Explorer tab
it's then a simple matter of actually
playing since aim D gives you the option
to either use on-screen controls or a
Bluetooth controller in theory it should
be possible to get this setup with your
TV provided you have an Android
compatible wireless controller
supposedly Bluetooth keyboard and mouse
could work too but we didn't get to test
that now considering this is a first
generation technology I thought it
worked pretty well but there were a few
streaming hiccups and artifacts every
now and then
the nice thing is that you can even
change the resolution in case your GPUs
having trouble streaming at your devices
native resolution we're actually going
to cover this a bit more soon so stay
tuned for that if there's anything
specific you want to know let us know in
the comments down below one of the other
interesting features rolling out in
these new drivers is Radeon game advisor
now it might not sound as amazing as
game streaming but let's check it out
anyways so basically this analyzes
performance as you play a game so here I
am playing battlefield 1 and I can press
alt R to bring up a Radeon overlay this
overlay tool was launched with a Drella
in 2017 and it brings a massive number
of tools right at your fingertips in a
game so in the game advisor tab you can
see that it after after quickly test
performance of my system in this title
ill recommend some changes to either
improve frame rates or give better image
quality
I think this feature will likely appeal
to people who quickly want to optimize
their game and get playing instead of
spending a while going through the whole
trial and error process it's also
probably a pretty big deal or it's
probably going to be a pretty big deal
for novices who are just getting into PC
gaming and might not be able to use you
know all the options that they encounter
so back to other few options in the
overlay features AMD has added a
centralized display tab that houses
options like the ability to turn on free
sync and enhance sync there's also an
option to control colors in-game as well
luckily the Radeon overlay will remember
all of these settings for the next time
you launch a game or a specific title
but remember that some monitors require
you to turn on free sync on the panel
before it's enabled in Andy's software
Whatman is the overclocking utility for
AMD cards and it's now in the overlay as
well with the ability to overclock or
automatically overclock the GPU and its
memory that's pretty cool since it
allows you to create a game specific
overclocking profile and tested
immediately rather than just use
the global settings finally the
performance tab is still around but it
has a whole new makeover with a ton of
customization options that includes you
know adjustable colors modifiable
columns and a lot more it's a pretty
cool area to show and login game
performance metrics
speaking of want Minh it got a shot of
adrenaline into with automatic GPU and
memory overclocking as well as dynamic
GPU under volting there's also better
control for fan curves and the arcs Vega
GPUs get a few targeted improvements too
with fine grain adjustments for DPM
States and even some very serious memory
tuning options a next up is a small but
pretty improvement to facing to HDR you
might remember Denis Tree had some
issues with HDR displays blowing out
bright colors and scenes in some games
well-aimed he's now adding Auto tone
mapping into scenes so they keep the
detail when HDR is enabled that's a huge
relief and I'm hoping Nvidia does the
same things since their cards experience
these same problems the last thing that
I wanted to cover is something that's a
bit small when compared to some of these
other huge items its extended support
for virtual super resolution or VSR
upscaling on 21 by 9 displays it was
actually one of the most requested items
on AMD surveys so they ended up adding
that as well which is awesome improve
your workflow at stream deck Mini by
Elgato giving you six fully customizable
LCD keys for macro commands hotkeys app
launches media control and the full
array customization for OBS Twitch
xsplit and more check out the stream
deck MIDI down below so there you guys
have it I know it was a lot to cover but
believe it or not there were a bunch of
changes in these new drivers that I
personally wasn't able to get to but I'm
really curious to test out some of the
new features like game streaming for
example and see how that plays out with
my smartphone but what we're really
seeing here is AMD continuing to develop
their drivers and bring some really cool
exciting features to the forefront I
just hope that their hardware makes a
real comeback as well so that's it for
me let me know what you guys think about
the new update from AMD in fact if you
own an existing aim to GPU would you
consider taking a manage or would you
actually take advantage of some of these
new features at AMD is rolled out love
to know in the comments down below
I'm eager with hybrid connects thank you
so much for watching make sure to check
out some relevant content over here
