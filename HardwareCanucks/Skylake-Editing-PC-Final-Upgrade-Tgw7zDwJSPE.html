great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm three tree with
hard-working oxen welcome to part three
of our skylight editing PC build upgrade
video that's the PC right behind me if
you haven't checked out part 1 &amp;amp; 2
they'll be linked in the description
below but in this episode we'll be
replacing some hardware I'll finally get
around to doing proper cable management
with proper cables and also doing some
fan replacement because the whole idea
has shifted to going as silent as
possible so let's begin
now before we move on let me explain or
give you a rundown of my reasoning
behind using the sky like platform as an
editing or dedicated for editing machine
and many of you have commented in the
past saying and x99 the six core of the
a lot more suitable extra rendering
power and while yes I agree with that
the sky like a platform is still very
capable and let me tell you why I sort
of ditched my 3930k 6-quart ship for
this sky like processor so what I
started with was an XLT 9 platform with
a 3930k processor 32 gigabytes of RAM
followed by five hard drive so I can
access our entire archive and this
followed by only two SSDs for the
operating system and one for the media
projects drive that system ran in sli
with dual 980ti switch was awesome but
all this hardware was putting out a ton
of heat especially those hard drives
making computer anything but silent so
here's where an idea for the SS the only
powered system was in the works
utilizing an Intel 760 700 K processor
with this gigabyte board triple OCZ
vector 180 SSDs and the star of the show
was the Intel 750 SSD which I wanted to
use as a boot drive and how's my video
editing software but I couldn't do that
with my x79 board because the x79 board
does not support nvme SSD as a boot
drive i also added the NZXT hue plus for
lighting which turned out to be super
awesome and finally I had a 2 terabyte
hard drive which was added to offload
some of the backup before it was moved
on to the NAS and this is where the
latest upgrade comes into the equation
so with the addition of these 12-volt
RGB headers on the new Asus motherboards
this is the Maximus 8 hero alpha I am
able to get rid of the hue plus lighting
completely while still being able to
route LED strips inside the case and
have full control of what color I want
to choose and etc I also realized that
having SLI for a sort of video editing
system is pretty pointless because the
Adobe Media encoder does
utilized both GPUs when its rendering
videos plus the 6700 K only has 16 now
PCI Express 3.0 lanes which means with
both graphics cards and my PCI Express
SSD it was really not optimal to have
all these all this hardware and there
might be some bottleneck at some point
if all this Hardware is being utilized
at the same time so one of the graphics
cards is out of there but I'm still
utilizing all of my OCC SSDs along with
the Intel 750 and now a 4 terabyte hard
drive again just for archiving and one
terabyte tree on 150 SSD which is the
new SSD from OCZ for home my games
the ketchup and mustard cables are gone
replaced with cable on the red and black
set just so I can color match to the
motherboard theme and so the assembly
begins
and so here's the final system with the
new avexir core Ram that looks pretty
awesome
with this dynamic illumination but I
gotta be honest this lighting behavior
is very random and I wish I could just
either disable it or either keep it just
static but at least the system is now
equipped with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 20
400 megahertz Ram and I could already
feel the huge benefit of this extra Ram
when opening up video projects and etc
16 gigabytes never again now I know the
red and black color scheme has been
overdone to death but I didn't want to
fully sort of derail off the color
coordination with the motherboard so I
decided to do something a little bit
different and add a very unique accented
color for this PC and so what I did was
add cable mount LED strips which are RGB
that connect directly to the motherboard
RGB headers and I was able to achieve
this very unique purple and red
illumination for the interior that to me
stands out from million of other red
builds so now moving on to the airflow
and I decided to replace all fans from
the case and also the cooler so for
intake I'm using fractal designs venturi
140 member of fans two of them these are
the high airflow models and deliver
amazing airflow and they're also super
quiet and then for the NZXT x61 CPU
cooler I'm using two high static
pressure venturi fans as well because
the stock fans were just way too loud
for exhaust the be quiet silent wings to
fan which is the quietest fan that I've
ever worked with it's amazing moves
quite a lot of air and so now on to
cable management that is very easy going
with modular cables and plenty of open
area at the back of the case to clean
everything up now thanks to plenty of
fan headers on the motherboard itself
and pretty good software control of
those fans
I actually didn't use the fan hub at all
that came with the case just to clear up
some cables and minimize that cable
clutter and now I think I have the
quietest editing PC that I've ever built
for myself with
proper hardware configuration that isn't
being bottleneck by anything else in
this case the CPU is overclocked at 4.5
gigahertz I'm running about 33 degrees
Celsius on idle and about 66 to 67 at
100% load which is pretty awesome but
now let me show you exactly how quiet
this system is
and again just to come back to this idea
of you know 6700 K being not your
optimal CPU for video editing and while
I agree that an X 99 platformer with a 6
core processor and just the same amount
same amount of RAM would yield better
rendering performance my thinking behind
this upgrade was to focus on fast
storage first because that grants you
immediate improvements because
everything just loads so much faster
when everything is being accessed
just from solid-state drives and
eventually when I move on to the X 99
platform all that solid-state drives and
solid state storage will migrate with me
onto this new system but so far I've
been very happy with how this Scylla
editing PC has been treating me and
behaving around me with power efficiency
temperature stability overclock ability
and finally speed all of which are on my
satisfactory points but it will continue
to pump out these pixels that you watch
now until my next editing PC upgrade so
guys I hope you enjoyed this video
upgrade let me know if there was
something that you would have done
differently if you were sort of in
charge of this sort of system I'm
Dimitri without recognized thanks so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
