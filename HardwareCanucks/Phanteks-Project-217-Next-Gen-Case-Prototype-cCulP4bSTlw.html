Nvidia gigabyte fantex and NCIX
what's up guys do meet you here with
Haruka Knox and the iconic end to evolve
micro ATX case from fantex gets an
upgrade
bringing tempered glass and a few other
minor modifications to stay relevant
it's been the common practice to see TG
revisions and fan takes is actually
introducing something really cool with
this update first the original hinge on
the side panel is still here giving you
a convenient option to open both glass
side panels easily but what they added
on the rear side panel is a high
temperature a silkscreen to basically
cama flage
all the cables on this side you still
get the glass look with this interesting
reflections when looking at the off
angle but it's a more of a mirror finish
now and you cannot complain about
visible cables no more there is an
opening around the two SSD caddies so
they are directly visible and I would
love to see this approach more often the
silk screen is also scratch resistant so
you don't need to worry about cables
damaging this coating the IO has been
relocated from the side to the front now
with the added LED button as an RGB
strip is included on the inside
they've also removed the optional file
in the quarter inch drive Bay as I'm
assuming most people were not using it
and they've also secured the top panel
with screws improving the handling if
you need to carry the case and now you
can also install a 240 millimeter
radiator at the front so the Evolve TG
at $129 gets an awesome upgrade which is
only a $10 premium over the original
price tag we also saw another concept
enclosure the project 217 and 2 17s
which is meant to tackle the whole
living room PC explosion and somewhat
resemble high-end audio equipment there
are two size variants with flexible
orientation when standing like so and
one lying down and they look pretty
modern with clean lines aluminum panels
and glass on both sides so you can
actually see through it which is super
cool and all of these side panels can be
removed to leave just a frame during
assembly in the larger 217 we had a full
custom water loop to are getting high
performance living room market that can
house a 280 moment of radiator right
below the motherboard on the front panel
plus a 120 or a 140 moment fan at the
bottom to intake air and
one at the rear for exhaust which is why
the case is so gracefully slim with
flexible mounting pump brackets as well
the shorter 217 s can only handle up to
140 mph and at the front bottom and the
rear so there are some user options on
which case is more suited for you and
what type of system you're going for
with the larger case supporting
full-size ATX power supplies although
limiting some water cooling options if
you decide to go that route while the
shorter case supports SFX only and I
love the direction of such cases to
combine high performance features with
beautiful design that is unmistakably
fantex
they want to offer small footprint over
small volume and I'm sure we'll see a
final revision of the project 217 and
also the name reveal probably at
Computex but let us know how you like to
design and stay tuned for more CES
