great technology selection and service
hey guys eva here with harbor Canucks
and chromebox are meant to serve as a
portable affordable solution for
students and professionals who spend
most of their productive time on the web
we have a so today taking a slightly
different approach with the Chromebook
15 a 15 inch notebook that starts at
$300 and it is meant for a more
stationary use as an alternative to a
more portable 13-inch that we reviewed
recently the main question still remains
is there a place for a 15-inch
Chromebook let's find out at five pounds
the Chromebook feels appropriate for the
size and while it's not ideal for
on-the-go it's much better suited for
spending more time on the desk the slim
profile should fit backpacks no problem
and the bill is acceptable and by that
I'm in the premium plastic material to
our chassis feels solid the front and
bottom parts of the Chromebook have
these fabric textured finish that looks
and feels great seriously for $300 this
has surpassed my expectations also do
note that the Chromebook 15 comes in a
black variant on the white sample we had
did show signs of staying after some use
our model here comes with the 5th gen
dual core Celeron CPU clocked at 1.5
gigahertz 4 gigabytes of RAM and a 16
gigabyte SSD a 32 gigabyte model is
available and while it is still limiting
Acer includes a free access to 100
gigabytes of Google Drive for two years
to compensate on the right side of the
Chromebook we have a Kensington lock USB
2.0 port and a card reader so as you
over to the left we find an HDMI port a
USB 3.0 port along with a headphone
microphone combo jack and on the front
there is an exhaust meant to cool the
Chromebook 15 the 15.6 inch in 1920 by
1080 display is a pleasure to look at
it's an IPS panel with great viewing
angles and contrast ratio the colors did
look a little oversaturated
but it is nothing to be worried about
for $300 this is perfect for watching
movies with your friends and family and
the screen frame on the Chromebook
maintains that excellent structural
integrity there's also an option to
change the resolution all the way up to
20 160
by 12:15 which gives you more screen
real estate but the text doesn't look
sharper compared to 1080p and we aren't
even sure why there's an option in the
first place a 720p webcam is fine for
video chat I have no complaints there
the keyboard layout is pretty standard
for a prone book
the only difference compared to the
regular keyboards is the replacement of
the caps lock button with a Google
search button which comes in handy for
quick google searches you could swap it
for caps lock functions so that's nice
to see the function keys that are placed
with a set of shortcuts like return
forward refresh page maximize your
window a multitask button that explodes
your open apps but you can also use the
four finger swipe on touchpad
there are also brightness and volume
controls typing on the Chromebook 15 was
a pleasure the tactile response in the
keys was excellent but the keys are made
out of some cheap plastic material which
isn't too bad but if you heavily rely on
the Chromebook for a lot of
Correspondence like email schoolwork
Google Docs etc it'll get the job done
the touchpad is okay some of the things
I like about it is a touch surface which
is smooth and the responsiveness is on
point
however the zoom functionality was
missing and the primary left and right
buttons required a tiny bit of pressure
to press and I wasn't satisfied with the
tactile response of these buttons
performance in the Chromebook 15 is
satisfactory thanks to the 64-bit
dual-core Intel CPU with 40 bytes of RAM
this machine can easily handle multiple
tabs without any hiccups there's still
some struggle with 4k video playback
however Acer makes it up with an
outstandingly wireless performance
thanks to the dual band AC wireless
adapter the battery life on the
Chromebook 15 is moderate with its 5
hours and 4 minutes in a heavy usage
scenario with video playback and surfing
the web the full recharge time is little
slow taking up about two hours to 100%
moving on to the speaker's they are
simply amazing by far one of the most
impressive at this price point the 2
speaker grilles are perfectly placed
beside the keyboard for the best sound
protection they do get loud I mean
really loud it's perfect for watching
movies listening to Spotify and much
or take a listen for yourselves Chrome
OS is a unique operating system that's
targeted towards users who lie on
getting work done on the web the whole
UI is based off Google Chrome's web
browser and Google Docs where you can
create edit and share documents with
your friends and co-workers it's simple
and very easy to use if you're
interested in checking out chrome OS for
the first time I will guarantee you
you'll find your way through the
operating system right away it boots up
super fast there's a growing number of
apps for offline work and the OS is
evolving to become a proper productivity
tool an ASA here has created an
excellent all one package for $300 with
a solid build fine IPS 1080p display
fast performance along with those
exceptionally loud speakers if you don't
mind the 15 inch form factor it's
actually a pretty good machine and we're
giving it the horican acts damn good
