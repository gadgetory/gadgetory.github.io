axe and welcome back to another review
now we all know gigabyte by their
jaw-dropping GPUs and stable yet
beautiful motherboards and some other PC
components but today we're diving deep
into their $60 stealth gaming keyboard
this is the force k7 the first thing we
notice is an extremely low profile of
the set of keys along with its angular
and strong design the k7 obviously tips
its cap to the beauty and aggressive
design of the stealth bomber as we
analyze the crisp line it's the matte
black finish and overall the covert
military appeal the keys are backlit
using a three color backlight with dark
blue green and light blue colors that
can be switched by pressing the wheel
and scrolling to adjust the brightness
to fit your needs and the taste beside
it is a volume control wheel that also
mutes if pressed and since there are no
drivers included with the keyboard
having these at hand is quite convenient
now the backlight isn't the strongest to
begin with it only Peaks through in the
darkest conditions and the viewing
angles to see the backlight is also
limited the size of the keyboard is
about average for gaming devices and
features and extended but not removable
armrests as well as adjustable feet with
rubber pads to prevent from slipping now
one thing to note is that there are no
USB pass-through and also for gaming
keyboard in this price point we find
this oversight a little bit confusing
now taking a look at the keys themselves
gigabyte has opted to use a membrane
based slim scissor key structure similar
to that of many laptops and considering
this a gaming keyboard or gaming
oriented press this leaves quite a bit
to be desired
the keys feel mushy and somewhat
non-responsive as we don't get that
tactile feedback that we've gotten
accustomed to with mechanical keyboards
but based off the name the stealth
aspect of the keys may be appealing to
those not really happy with the loud
mechanical switches and the k7 is
extremely quiet but doesn't exactly land
in the gaming category in fact
mechanical switches have become the norm
with gaming setups so using scissors
switches
just scratching our head a little bit
however despite the use of scissor key
structure gigabyte has implemented the
solution for those gamers who worry
about info flag they have implemented
anti-ghosting capabilities around the
wsd zone to put in cue left shift and
space bar so they are all registered
without conflict but for a gaming
keyboard the lack of full and key
rollover is a bit disappointing plus
there is no software for the force k7
meaning no macro recordings which is
again something we've gotten accustomed
to in gaming peripherals now I'm coming
back to the layout of the keyboard we
find function keys at the top where we
have come to expect them and include it
as something we haven't seen in a while
art shortcuts for Facebook Google and
Twitter plus you can open calculator and
task manager from there as well and we
have all the media controls as well a
little bit unusual for a gaming keyboard
but we're not complaining now I'm not a
fan of the tiny backspace button but
many will appreciate the over large
Enter key also I'd like to mention the
first sample we received experience were
key performance where you have to bang
the spacebar for it to register while
the backspace would go off every time
you hit Enter which exposes the
weaknesses really of the scissor style
keys but overall the keyboard has a slim
profile with aggressive style and black
matte finish so it looks pretty nice and
the keys are very quiet however the use
of membrane scissor switches for gaming
isn't ideal at all as response and
bounds just don't mean that gaming
expectations and aren't as reliable the
backlight is also quite poor and the
small backspace is annoying and the
ghosting rollover is only on the WASD
cluster and at $60 price point it's a
bit high considering mechanical
alternatives are quite close to this
price range plus there's no driver
software to record your macros which is
disappointing
now the force k7 is very quiet keyboard
so if that's your priority when you gain
it's a worth every consideration but
otherwise would strongly suggest going
mechanical so thanks guys for watching
