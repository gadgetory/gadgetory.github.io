does not sound well some of our viewers
may recall Dimitri taking a crack at it
about a year ago and from his conclusion
it was fairly evident that it was a
pretty playable experience although he
did experience and random freezes with
csgo that is still a question but two
other titles where flawless if you
missed out on the video we'll leave a
link down below now I consider gaming
off the USB Drive to be a luxury just
like Dimitri and the reason is pretty
straightforward if you happen to game on
multiple systems having your entire game
library within portable media like this
or a portable solution like this is
pretty awesome although there are a few
caveats to understand the for jumping
into this bandwagon so let's discuss
about that along with alternative
solutions right after this hula master
is hosting an exciting overwatch
tournament with a $40,000 prize pool
that will go towards one High School
Robotics theme you can watch live on
Twitch or visit the eSports arena
downtown Santa Ana for free more info at
Coolermaster Invitational comm alright
one of the things to consider before
transferring your entire game library to
a USB flash drive is one the price per
gigabyte on USB flash drives are still
at an all-time high
especially for high performance USB 3.0
drives take this kingston ultimate GT
one terabyte USB 3.1 gen2 on Drive at
$1000 I'd be much better off building a
gaming PC supporting a hard drive with
the same capacity - this has some
relevance to my previous point and that
is modern games are at least 60 to 70
gigabytes in size so if you're
accumulating a lot of titles that adds
up quickly and soon enough you'd have to
step up your storage game a 256 or 512
gigabyte SSD is not going to make the
cut
I'd say 1 terabytes would be a sweet
spot for gamers to offload their
existing library plus three and a half
inch hard drives are relatively
inexpensive today but what if you're
willing to game off an external hard
drive with the same capacity oh I'm not
talking about spinning drives that are
external but external SSDs like this
Western Digital My Passport
I mean seriously they could have come up
with a different name anyways
recently I got a chance to test this guy
out and I was very impressed with its
read performance and that's thanks to
its USB 3.1 gen2 interface
performance in a portable package once
again if you're interested in learning
more about this drive I'll leave a link
down below so today I decided to test
game load times on this external SSD and
compared to a standard three a half inch
standing drive a two and a half inch SSD
and my aging external rugged hard drive
that I paid $100 for a while back
testing was pretty straightforward I
installed Origin battlenet you play and
steam on each Drive to test battlefield
one or watch Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
and dune respectively I also made sure
to disable as much as background
applications as possible to get the best
results before we move on here are the
crystal disk mark results per drive just
so you're aware of where each drive
stands with respect to each other
alright our first test involves
battlefield 1 with the first step being
to start up the game and as you can see
the WD external SSD aligns right in line
with my Neutron XD I'd local SSD with
both completing the task in about 34
seconds the other two drives were not
that far apart either with the WD blue
drive taking seven seconds longer and
the external shrunk boot drive taking
one more second honestly it's not a huge
difference between the four drives but
when we're switching to loading a
permission in my case I chose over the
top which is our standard benchmarking
scene the lot of times were quite
significant at least when comparing the
SSDs and the spinning drives and that's
some surprising but what surprised me
was the low time on the WD SSD it just
took four seconds longer than the
corsair SSD but also gaming on it was
flawless I did not experience any
stutters or random crashes even
multiplayer worked perfectly and I was
focused on the gameplay without having
to worry about unnecessary hiccups and
such so that was awesome next I fired up
overwatch which isn't a highly demanding
title because the overall size of the
game is about 10 gigabytes and the
results between the four drives were a
lot closer than I thought the external
SSD was the fastest but surprisingly the
WD blue drive took second place followed
by the corsair SSD and finally the
shockproof external hard drive loading
up the practice session was also quick
on all drives as you can see the
external SSD took the lead once again by
a slight margin but the blue drive and
the Corsair were just seconds apart
the shockproof drive was the
a list and that shouldn't be surprising
since it's running off the USB tape I
know that roughly provides five gigabits
per second theoretical throughput I was
excited to test Ghost Recon because a
it's graphically intensive title and be
loading up the game along with missions
take a while so it's a great way to test
each drives we performance and we're
aware that the WD passport SSD is a
monster at that so how do we do well
just as expected the passport SSD was
faster during the initial game launch
loading to the main menu took about 48
seconds but the corsair SSD was almost
neck-to-neck to the timing taking just a
second longer
surprisingly the shockproof drive took
12 seconds longer than the corsair SSD
but it was also faster than the WD Blue
Drive that took approximately a minute
and 13 seconds
forcing hits away to the last spot next
up I loaded up a mission that took 19
seconds on the corsair SSD 26 seconds on
the passport SSD almost doubled that
time on the WD blue drive and about a
minute on the SP drive I need to point
out that you plate took a lot longer to
discover the game files on the
shockproof drive so be aware of that but
gaming on all four of them were flawless
no stutters or crashes and that's a
thumbs-up my last test was to load up
steam and test out doom which again is
an enormous title that's also
graphically intensive I have expected
steam took its time installing on the SP
Drive compared to the rest that
completed that task in seconds loading
up the game was the fastest on the
passport SSD followed by the corsair SSD
and the WD blue drive but check out the
SP drive it took three minutes to launch
the game which is a significant
difference between the other three
drives but loading up a mission was
fairly faster on all four drives as you
see here gaming on it was also flawless
so again very playable experience no
stutters no crashes which is awesome
so what can we take away from this video
well I wouldn't recommend you to go out
there and spend three hundred sixty
dollars on my passport ancestry just for
faster load times because that would be
money not well spent as we saw from the
charts the two and a half inch solid
state drive performed very closely to
the WD drive in some cases the standard
three-and-a-half inch hard drive
performed very well I would say it was
about 10 to
20 seconds slower than the SSDs which
wasn't still not too bad but again very
respectable I think that the passport
SSD had the benefit of the newer USB 3.1
gen2 interface compared to SATA 6 or
even USB 3.1 Chen one which is just USB
3 by now that being said driver speeds
didn't really affect frame rates within
games and I validated that battlefield 1
averaged around a hundred frames per
second on all drives I'll be a few
frames per second higher or lower
same with overwatch Ghost Recon and doom
so all you need to know is that if you
just value framerate over load times you
can save a lot of money and up for a
three and a half inch hard drive that
has a much better price per gigabyte
ratio but if you value load times I
would highly suggest picking up a
high-capacity two and a half inch SSD
although be mindful they are pretty
expensive I think the maximum you can
pick it up for is around $300 we leave a
few options down below if you're
interested now if you're the type of
user who games on multiple systems and
if you're looking for a quick plug and
play solution without sacrificing on
load times or frame rates pick the my
passport SSD it's a much faster solution
it's compact it's fast and it's reliable
although be mindful it's expensive so
that'll do it for now I hope you enjoyed
this non-scientific test comparing all
four drives let me know what you guys
