Logitech and it costs $130 way too
expensive
the K 95 Platinum from Corsair costs
$200 way too expensive this my friends
is the new MS 120 from Coolermaster and
it costs $90 it comes with a keyboard
and a mouse it's a combo set and yeah
you are seeing RGB goodness here but
what's more special about it
well back at Computex we got a chance to
play around with this set and it was a
really interesting experience Kula
masters said that it was designed to
offer a great price to performance
combination plus a solid upgrade for
from the master keys light combo set
that we took a look at a while back what
interested me the most about that set
was that it featured RGB lighting mem
chemical switches that provided
respectable tactile feedback and the
included mouse was excellent for casual
gaming the master said 120 on the other
hand steps things up a notch providing a
layer of extra features that some users
might appreciate so let's take a closer
look right after this explore your
future with the cosmos to case and
celebrate 25 years of ambition the drive
schooler master forward enjoy the
familiar yet still forward-looking
character of the frame with solid
aluminum handles it may be the most
physical you'll ever get with the
computer case but it's all worth while
or get creative put any of the 13
storage options that encourage outside
the box thinking meanwhile the curved
tempered glass panels on both sides
ensures a lasting impression classically
trained but still ready for anything the
cooler master cosmos - lets celebrate
the past by building for the future
alright first up the keyboard and it's
actually not that different from the one
found on the master keys light combo
sent at least from a physical standpoint
it features the exact layout with the
dedicated numpad and the main body
maintains a simpler yet smaller
footprint just like cool masters
high-end master keys Pro lineup but the
same can be said for the build quality
and that's expected for the price that
you're paying the plastic chassis isn't
as robust as high in mechanical
keyboards so I would be extra careful
when handling it so what's the
difference between this and the cheaper
keyboard sound on the master keys light
combo L package well it's actually
pretty straightforward
Toula master has implemented their new
men
panicle quickie switches yeah clicky
switches unlike the standard mechanical
switches that function in three stages
these come with a fourth element on top
of that and it's a pretty simple one a
spring with an accompanied
custom-designed plunger this in turn
emulates a tactile feedback kind of like
what you'd experience when typing on a
mechanical keyboard with MX blue
switches I'll be it doesn't feel like
typing on a mechanical keyboard because
I did switch between the white foxes
GPIO and this to see the difference or
not and it was fairly obvious because
this was definitely feeling like typing
on plastics which is an exhibited
tactile and clicking response but I'm
really super happy that Coolermaster is
able able to sort of emulate this
feeling of a mechanical or typing on a
mechanical keyboard actuation takes
place at only one point two millimeters
and doesn't require a lot of force to
register a press which is awesome
because in my master keys light combo
video I mentioned how the keys only
registered when pressed about 90% down
in order for the plunger to hit the
tactile dome that's located at the base
the MS 120 on the other hand eliminates
that factor giving users a similar
experience when typing on a mechanical
keyboard the rebounds on the switches
were a lot quicker than expected things
to the spring mechanism underneath the
switch housing they should also last a
lot longer than the standard mem
chemical switches found on the master
keys light combo keyboard if you're
looking to take RGB lighting to the next
level given that you're on a budget the
MS 120 s keyboard features perky RGB
illumination but the catch is that you
won't be able to control it via a
dedicated software but rather a
combination of these function keys
needless to say the user has full
control to pick their desired color
choice in fact if you love lighting
effects this keyboard is the real deal
as you can see there are different fancy
mounts that fly around randomly from
brain effects to reactive touch that was
pretty fun to play around with
plus you can adjust each mount speed and
direction but if you prefer to go static
there is an option for that to keep
things simple there are nine primary
colors to choose from which obviously
doesn't cover the whole RGB spectrum but
you can add five levels of red green and
blue to make those colors look unique
I think coolermaster should eliminate
their sixteen point seven million color
customization marketing material off
their website since that only can be
done via software but it is generous of
them to include this level of
customization with just a few keys in
the first place do not that you lose the
water resistant feature found on the
cheaper keyboard but things like
multimedia controls
windows and foo keys lock buttons
adjustable razors along with you li
coded key caps that are compatible with
cherry MX temps remain identical as for
the included Mouse there is nothing
really important to talk about other
than the fact that it's ergonomically a
much better upgrade from the one found
on the master keys light combo set it's
built really well and it's designed for
users who value comfort there's proper
tom support and additional frame support
for both your ring and pinky fingers
alongside the MS 120 cooler Mercer is
also launching the MS 121 this combo
comes with the same clicky keyboard but
comes now paired with an ambidextrous
mouse featuring the same sensor as the
claw grip type Mouse like the one found
on the MS 120 although be mindful it
will be retailed in select regions only
both mines feature the pixel 3050
optical sensor just like the cheaper
model with 4 adjustable dpi levels that
cycle between 500 750 1500 and 3500
respectively
they are color-coordinated for
differentiation but I feel like the
scaling is a little too far apart I'm
more comfortable using a mouse at either
900 or 1600 dpi setting so not having
the option to manually adjust that is
disappointing but what do you guys think
is it fair for Coolermaster to not
include this option on sub $100 combo
package
let us know in the comments down below
the primary left and right buttons
squeeze your arm on switches that
provide excellent tactile feedback and
require minimal force to press the
forward and backward buttons who are
comfortable to reach no problem and just
like it's cheaper alternative and the
scroll wheel was well defined and look
I've tested a lot of gaming mice priced
over $70 and they have their unique
characteristics when put
each other but this this particular
mouse has surprised me in a lot of ways
because it's an all run package that
comes with all the basic needs that a
typical angel gamer would require I
spent the weekend playing battlefield 1
with this set and I got to be honest it
was such a pleasing experience gaming on
it was pretty awesome I was able to fire
gunshots no problem the amnon switches
on the mouse felt super fast or
responsive and the tracking was
excellent too because given its a 3050
optical sensor obviously this set is not
geared towards pro gamers because there
are gaming peripherals that are suited
for that task if you're a casual gamer
who just likes to spend a few hours
gaming you know playing triple-a titles
like battlefield one csgo or any other
you know FPS shooters or FPS titles this
gaming set should be more than
sufficient as for lighting there are
three zones one on the scroll wheel the
other one for the outer glow for the
logo and a transparent ring at the
bottom the luminosity is pretty
consistent across the zones except for
the scroll wheel lighting effects can be
adjusted by holding the dpi shift button
along with a combination of the scroll
wheel click forward backward or the
right click buttons Kula master is
targeting this as a driverless solution
that just works out of the box and it's
welcoming to see this feature on a
budget peripheral set so to conclude
Coolermaster has surprised me once again
with the master set 120 it is an
excellent set it offers a lot of
features the gamers value like clicky
and tactile feedback shoulder actuations
plus a mouse that's organically pleasing
to use because it comes we know with an
ergonomic feel and shape plus the Ibaka
3050 optical sensor is excellent for
tracking and casual gaming
the online switches are perfect
especially if you're firing gun shots
the shorter travel distance on these are
excellent it is actually super awesome
when I recommend this over the master
keys like combo l package absolutely but
I would still recommend that package if
you're strictly on a budget building a
gaming PC I would save that $30 into
hardware but if you really want to
emulate a mechanical keyboard this will
probably be the once again so what do
you guys think of the Master said 120
from coolermaster do you find the hybrid
plastics which is to be innovative plus
what do you guys think of the new Mouse
