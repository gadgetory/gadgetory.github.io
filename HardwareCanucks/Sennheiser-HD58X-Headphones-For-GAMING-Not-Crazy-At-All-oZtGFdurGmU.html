about dual purpose headphones utilizing
them for movies entertainment music and
of course gaming
[Laughter]
you know we review so many gaming
headsets that I see so often people
commenting why not just get a proper
headphone that you get better audio
quality most of the time better comfort
and build quality instead of a gaming
headset that have all the add-on
gimmicky features and so that is exactly
what we're talking about today because I
have the master up and son Heiser HD 5/8
X Jubilee headphone and that is a
fantastic value that I'm sure will be a
great addition for your gaming setup let
me tell you why right after this the new
t46 caliber ddr4 memory is one unique
RGB kit with awesome light spill from
each module and the special edition has
a cool totem design on the light bar you
get lifetime warranty up to 4,000
megahertz speeds and full lighting
control through the software check out
the t4 6 caliber Ram
down below oh man it is hot in here but
not as hot as these headphones
I love the HD 5 and X Jubilee because
the value is absolutely incredible
$150 for a pair that sounds this good
that looks this good that are so
comfortable I mean you know I'm
fanboying all over this pair but you
know I've been using the HD 6 xx as kind
of like my primary headset I even have
the mod mic attachment on here because
this is my favorite pair aside when I'm
not using actual headsets for gaming but
the HD 5 index is based off similar
design as the HD 6 xx one of the things
I absolutely love about the ear cups is
this internal mesh it's super soft so in
case your ears do enter all the way
inside the ear cup and they do make
contact with that internal wall no
issues with plastic hitting your ears so
absolutely love this design now one of
the reasons why I say this headphone is
a fantastic value is because many
members of the audio enthusiast
community are referencing the sound
signature of this headphone to be very
similar to the San Heiser HD 6 60s which
is a $500 pair and this thing is only
150 bucks so you can check out the drop
down below now from a build quality
perspective they're mainly plastic which
is great because they're lightweight
with some metal pieces where they matter
but the frame structure here is based on
the HT 6 xx which I have carried in my
backpack they've gotten squished with
gear and
over time they've held up really well no
issues so I'm feeling continent in the
HD 5x Jubilee as well now the thing I
love about open-back headphones is the
fact that you ears breathe so if you're
in a gaming match for six hours you know
you have those marathons absolutely no
problem with any sort of heat
accumulation
no sweat whatsoever unless you're like
physically sweating but not from the
headphone now obviously one thing to
keep in mind with this open back nature
is that there is sound leak so this is
not for public spaces this is for like
home use for quiet environment and also
you can definitely hear everything
that's coming into the headset so
something to keep in mind but with
higher enough volume it completely shuts
everything out audio wise from your
external environment and is never an
issue so then why would you get
something like this for gaming going
with the gaming headset you get a
microphone but ask yourself how many
games have you played in last month that
actually requires a microphone sure for
some multiplayer games csgo this is why
this is here so I can communicate with
my teammates but basically for majority
of all my other gaming sessions I wear
either the 5/8 X Jubilee or my HD 6 xx
for that matter and so it kind of makes
me think if you do have already a
headset potentially just for the
microphone so you can put these on and
put the other thing over like this so
you can still have microphone but
receive much better audio quality from
an actually good sounding pair obviously
this looks a bit ridiculous but you can
fashion other accessories if you require
microphone for your gaming sessions but
I would say for like 90 percent of the
games that I play are in single-player
so I don't require microphone to
communicate with those BOTS so I choose
something like this and so what is it
like gaming with the Jubilee it is an
audio file pair that is super cheap and
they're using sanitizers new drivers
which are 150 ohms so you can totally
try them with your smartphone I have
plenty of volume from the 1 plus 6 for
this pair and I normally plug all my
headsets and audio stuff directly into
my motherboard because onboard audio is
becoming so good and I actually did a
little bit of a comparison between my
lovely the element amp from JD's labs
and my onboard audio on my Asus
motherboard we can check out that video
here so I used both motherboard and my
amp to test out these and the results
are incredible the open back nature of
this headset really delivers that really
nice positional awareness of your
environment even better than a GSP 500
which is an open back headset and has
really good enriched definition and
fantastic base with these the entire
soundstage is like slightly bigger but
without losing any detail and preserving
like all the sound cues that you'd want
to hear like you know in csgo if if
flash goes off on site b-but you're
inside a you're somewhere in the middle
you can sense that distance if you play
the maps it's a really weird feeling
replaying some of my most recent games
and just hearing the audio in a
completely different way because these
are just so clean and they have no
overpowered bass the mid-range is
fantastic they are slightly higher on
the mid on the treble versus the HD 6xx
and I think the bass here is like
slightly boosted as well but I would say
that's actually pretty decent sound
signature for gaming because you want to
have enough treble that is not harsh so
you want to maintain all the detail you
want to have a little bit of body in the
bass so that things don't sound too flat
and I think the HT 5 EDX kind of
delivers in that respect perfectly for
games like quake champions where there's
a lot of vertical movement so if you
hear anybody above you you can
anticipate their movement if you have
good map knowledge and know which
corridors lead to where these this whole
like audio definition is just like a
really good way to give you an advantage
in gaming if you are not just after the
visual side of things but after you're
the audio side of things as well if you
have not yet played squad I highly
recommended the amount of power in any
gunfight and like rocket launchers and
just like 50 caliber
it sounds incredible here just sounds
like something is literally flying right
beside you where you are as a character
in game and that's something that you
definitely need to experience especially
when it comes to this like open
environment through the HD 5 EDX it's so
nice
and then there's hell blades annual
sacrifice a game that has such
interesting audio characteristics that I
knew about that and I kind of saved it
for good set of headphones I'm so happy
I did because like hearing voices behind
you in front of you and like having this
kind of whispering thing that's inside
the game but it feels like it's right
here it's creepy but it's also delivers
such good game design that like really
immerses you into that environment and
something that I haven't been able to
recreate with other pairs with the GSP
500 yes but with the HD 5 EDX it's a
little bit of a different feeling
because it's slightly more open and not
there's like enclosed inside the headset
there'll be no more stories after this
one it's over $150 this is a fantastic
pair for games if you want to experience
like really clean not too bass heavy not
too harsh treble but just enough detail
so you can pinpoint everything and like
just consume the audio as the way it's
meant to be consumed with a little bit
of sparkle I would highly recommend the
HD 5 EDX the thing is you know I prefer
like more fun signatures so I prefer my
lower and slightly beefier which is why
I replaced the ear cups on the GSP 500
to the leather ones so they maintain a
little bit more of that bass but it's so
refreshing to come back to something
like this that is flatter but without
losing character so it's a different
sounding signature versus what you get
with like typical gaming headsets and
obviously kind of self-explanatory but
if you're not into gaming this is a
fantastic pair for movies and music just
really clean analytical bright extension
that is just fantastic for trance music
good for rock you know for hip-hop you
probably want a little bit more bass
something a little bit heavier in there
but they still deliver in that bass
Department not to be sounding too flat
and still having a lot of character that
you'll still be pumping your head so
yeah pretty happy with how these deliver
not just for games but for the overall
genre of audio that might pass to your
ears and like I said earlier if you
require microphone add an attachment
Slyke mod mic is quite popular for
headphones of this caliber also going
with like an external USB microphone
maybe or if you already have a headset
potentially just use that microphone and
a different pair for your audio needs so
you get best of both worlds alright so
that's it for the HD 5/8 X Jubilee it is
definitely going to be staying on my
desk as part of my head
