great technology selection and service
2015 was an awesome year for AMD and for
value focus gamers that still want to
reach that enthusiasts performance our
right to look into the 390 x series it
fits perfectly well between the fury
line and the lower radeon cards so today
we're taking a look at the asus strix
390 x-bow see that we think is properly
priced at four hundred dollars which
covers the Affordable spectrum based on
its raw performance let's check this out
alright let's get some basic specs out
of the way this is a hawaii-based
architecture with an engine clock of
1090 megahertz memory speed of 6,000
megahertz and a whopping 8 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory the disappointing part
about these specs is that AMD decided to
leave little room for overclocking Asus
was only able to push the 390 X by an
extra 40 megahertz which isn't that much
but what makes this card special over
the competition is the inclusion of
several Asus exclusive technologies like
auto extreme that utilizes a completely
automated fabrication process
eliminating quality control issues and
enhancing overall durability there's
also super alloy 2 components which also
enhances longitude II and can boost
overclocking Headroom in extreme
situations naturally there is a premium
to pay here and the Strix OC is a good
fifteen dollars more expensive than
alternatives from power color and
sapphire from a physical standpoint the
Strix 3 90 X looks exactly the same
compared to the asus r9 fury and the gtx
980 TI the direct CU 3 is a tried and
tested stunning black and red design
that's also up to task to cool the
ridiculously hot hawaii core the GPU is
12.5 inches long so picking the right
case to fit this card is highly advised
the triple wing blade fans don't spin on
idle or low load situations for totally
silent operation what makes this card
special is the beefier engineered
copper-based heat pipes that are in
direct contact with a GPU core which
speeds up the heat transfer and improves
fooling the quick movement of heat also
requires an expansive fin array to
properly dissipate the heat hence the
Strix larger footprint and just taking a
quick peek we have a pair of 10
millimeter heat pipes backed up by two
smaller eight millimeter units for those
wondering the Strix logo on the card
side typically glows constantly and
pulses when the Strix is overclocked
the back late looks gorgeous the Strix
branding adds a nice look the back
lights also includes a secondary
stiffening plate to ensure that the PCB
doesn't sag due to massive weight of the
cooler and I mean it this is one heavy
card as for power input the 3 90 x takes
an 8 + 6 pin connector these features
small LEDs which glow red to advise you
of an unsuccessful power connection and
white when the 8 + 6 pin is properly
attached for display output we have
triple displayport 1.2 one hdmi 1.3 and
a single dual link DVI as i mentioned
earlier the hawaii-based Granada XD
course does exhibit a significant amount
of heat and from our tests you can see
how much hotter it runs when compared to
power color and sapphires 3 90 X this is
mainly because the fans don't get Cain
until the temperature hits 75 c and when
they do the card maxes out at 82 c I
have good news in terms of acoustic
performance the Strix OC is ridiculously
quiet but there is one thing to consider
inductor wine it does show up doing any
game play button menus where frame rates
find themselves in the 200 frames per
second plus level it does become
apparent if you listen to it luckily
silence reigns supreme when actually
playing this is one power-hungry card
and it's obvious that the cooler is
doing some really hard work to cool the
hot running GPU alright performance time
let's take a look at some numbers
as you can see the power color and the
Strix OC I'm neck to neck in pretty much
most of our 1440p tests and yet
performing below the gtx 980 switching
to 4k and the results are the opposite
the Strix OC overtakes the 980 in the
majority of our tests thanks to the more
RAM and higher memory bandwidth
the absolute best clock speed we were
able to achieve with the Strix OC was
around 11 20 megahertz through the GPU
tweak software and from the results it
does boost the performance a little bit
so the asus strix 390 xoc is one
beautiful and well performing card
especially for the price it certainly
closes the gap between the fury acts and
the other lower end offerings from AMD
just be aware of the other issues that
we talked about previously before
picking one up thank you so much for
watching this video make sure to go AMD
on that like button Annie bear with
harbor connects don't forget to

we'll see you in the next one happy
