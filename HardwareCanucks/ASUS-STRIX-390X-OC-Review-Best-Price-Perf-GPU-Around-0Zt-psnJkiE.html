great technology selection and service
2015 was an awesome year for AMD and for
value focus gamers that still want to
reach that enthusiasts performance are
right to look into the 390 x-series
it fits perfectly well between the fury
line and the lower Radeon cards so today
we're taking a look at the Asus Strix
390x bossy
that we think is properly priced at $400
which covers the affordable spectrum
based on its raw performance let's check
this out
all right let's get some basic specs out
of the way this is a Hawaii starka
texture with an engine clock of 1090
megahertz memory speed of 6,000
megahertz and a whopping 8 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory the disappointing part
about these facts is that AMD decided to
leave little room for overclocking asus
was only able to push the 390 x by an
extra 40 megahertz which isn't that much
but what makes this card special over
the competition is the inclusion of
several asus exclusive technologies like
Auto Xtreme that utilizes a completely
automated fabrication process
eliminating quality control issues and
enhancing overall durability
there's also super alloy to components
which also enhances longitude II and can
boost overclocking Headroom in extreme
situations naturally there is a premium
to pay here and the Strix OC is a good
$15 more expensive than alternatives
from power color and sapphire from a
physical standpoint the Strix 390x looks
exactly the same compared to the Asus r9
fury and the gtx 980ti
the direct cu3 is a tried and tested
stunning black and red design that's
also up to tasks to cool the
ridiculously hot hawaii core the GPU is
12.5 inches long so picking the right
case to fit this card is highly advised
the triple wing blade fans don't spin on
idle or low load situations for totally
silent operation
what makes this card special is the
beefier engineered copper based heat
pipes that are in direct contact with
the GPU core which speeds up the heat
transfer and improves cooling the quick
movement of heat also requires an
expansive thin array to properly
dissipate the heat
hence the Strix larger footprint and
just taking a quick peek we have a pair
of 10 millimeter heat pipes backed up by
two smaller 8 millimeter units for those
wondering the Strix logo on the card
side typically glows constantly and
pulses when the Strix is overclocked
the backlight looks gorgeous the Strix
branding adds a nice look the back
lights also includes a secondary
stiffening plate to ensure that the PCB
doesn't sag due to massive weight of the
cooler and I mean it this is one heavy
card as for power input the 390x takes
an 8 plus 6 pin connector these features
small LEDs which glow red to advise you
of an unsuccessful power connection and
white when the 8 plus 6 pin is properly
attached for display output we have
triple DisplayPort 1.2 1 HDMI 1.3 and a
single dual link DVI as I mentioned
earlier the hawaii-based Granada XT
course does exhibit a significant amount
of heat and from our tests you can see
how much hotter it runs when compared to
power color and sapphires 390x this is
mainly because the fans don't kick in
until the temperature hits 75 C and when
they do the card maxes out at 82 see I
have good news in terms of acoustic
performance the Strix OC is ridiculously
quiet but there is one thing to consider
inductor whine it does show up during
any game play but in menus where frame
rates find themselves in the 200 frames
per second plus level it does become
apparent if you listen to it luckily
silence reigns supreme when actually
playing this is one power-hungry card
and it's obvious that the cooler is
doing some really hard work to cool the
hot running GPU alright performance time
let's take a look at some numbers
as you can see the power color and the
Strix OC are neck to neck in pretty much
most of our 1440p tests and yet
performing below the GTX 980 switching
to 4k and the results are the opposite
the Strix OC overtakes the 980 in the
majority of our tests thanks to the more
RAM and higher memory bandwidth
the absolute best clock speed we were
able to achieve with the Strix OC was
around 11 20 megahertz through the GPU
tweak software and from the results it
does boost the performance a little bit
so the Asus Strix 390x
OC is one beautiful and well performing
card especially for the price it
certainly closes the gap between the
fury axe and the other lower end
offerings from AMD just be aware of the
other issues that we talked about
previously before picking one up thank
you so much for watching this video make
sure to go AMD on that like button on
either with hurricane axe don't forget

and we'll see you in the next one
happy holidays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
