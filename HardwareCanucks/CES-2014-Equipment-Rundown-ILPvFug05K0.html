brought to you by and say XCOM
technology connected so hey guys i'm
dimitri and this is matt and as you can
see we're getting ready for CES 2014 our
coverage is going to be super awesome
very excited but we decided to give you
a little bit of a glimpse of how we are
planning to cover CES 2014 based on my
short experience with computex i've
gotten a little bit better in terms of
knowing what to bring and how to pack
for CS and pack for the step of coverage
so this is matt this is going to be our
sort of regular rig as you can see this
is our very handy handheld rig from
genius there's our beautiful lens with
the camera and of course an LED light
that is definitely going to be needed
because CES is mainly in sweets i'm not
exactly sure about the lighting in the
suites so that this LD like will
definitely be useful for darker
conditions even though we have 1.5 lens
which is awesome enough of this rig it's
very simple very basic it's nice and
light and we're also going to have an
monopod that attaches to the bottom of
the rig and because you know filming the
entire CES show for an entire day you
know Matt and I are gonna get jacked
afterwards because the rig actually is
pretty heavy so this is going to attach
to the bottom and let me just turn off
the cell phone camera so that I can show
you how this attaches so it's very
simple boom boom boom boom like this the
the rig is going to be attached onto the
top and that way you can have the rig
for an entire day it's very handy this
is something that i really wish i had at
computex as you can see the light is
sort of also evening out the shadows in
my face we're just useful to not create
the very darker image so at the LED
light on top of the camera is also
something I missed and computex of
course everything will be editing on
these two laptops from Asus they
actually have the same specs pretty much
this is only a 1080p but in terms of
performance power
very nice and portable sort of rendering
solutions for coverage exactly like this
both CES and computex obviously will
have external storage so we have USB 3
external drives that will drop off all
of our coverage just in case anything
happens to the laptops will still have
all of our footage extra CF cards
because covering things with you know
it's going to be so much footage that
will definitely backup while we're
shooting throughout the day we also have
this 11,000 milliamp hour battery pack
from gear power this is for our cell
phones this means that we'll be able to
charge our cell phones while we're
covering CES just in case we need extra
power of course we have a USB 3 card
reader if you guys don't know I'm
unloading you know 32 gigabytes footage
from the CF card onto the computer it's
a time power hog so a USB 3 is totally
crucial for work like this and this is
our little battery charging station will
have a bunch of spare batteries for the
camera spare batteries for the LED
everything will be charged for the next
time to go so it will have power for the
day and now one last piece of equipment
is this guy right here so this is a
camera bag let me open this up so you
can see what type of things we can fit
inside so it's huge it's padded so all
of our equipment will be nice and safe
during transportation this also opens up
nice and easy for any TSA check ups
which will we're looking really looking
forward to well we gotta definitely get
checked it also has a a notebook pocket
here so my laptop is gonna go in here
Matt's gonna have his own back as well
to show where which is right here let's
take a look nicely padded everything so
we'll stash away some LED lights in here
some battery packs he's gonna have his
back his laptop in there as well and
this is it basically we're packing very
life we're packing all the essentials
for the
sort of like event coverage so we can
deliver the best audio the best video
and also we have this microphone here
this is a lav mic let me show you so
right now we are recording on our zoom
h4n as you can see there's this is an
XLR input that goes into the power bank
for the lav mic that is on me right now
it's not the easiest solution to go
about you can see this our level so I
can know when I'm talking this is the
lav mic right here oops I touched it
it's very easy so I know where my levels
are very important especially in loud
environments as a rule of thumb you want
to be peaking at negative 6 DB which is
what we're doing right now so it's
totally fine and debase transfer
decibels not douche bags thanks Matt if
I heard that DB stands for decibels not
douche bags so this is how we're gonna
pack this up so this is the zoom h4n the
power brake power brake goes into my
pocket and since it's not the most
convenient way so the actual zoom h4n is
gonna go into my back pocket and we're
sort of going to hide the XLR cable
somewhere mm-hmm and so now we're kind
of left with this XLR cable we're just
gonna stash it away somewhere but mainly
you'll be seeing this right so like for
example if I'm talking about a certain
product I'll be talking about it like
this that gives me both hands to
basically touch the product and showcase
it in the most appropriate way and
obviously we will also have a handheld
mic as well which is very convenient to
sort of have the interviews so that the
other person doesn't have to be right in
my face so that pretty much wraps it up
for our CES 2014 equipment coverage
we're really looking forward to doing
bringing a lot of videos so next time
you see us will be in CS cncs will be in
Las Vegas actually sometimes warm is
there as i expected i was hoping they'll
be like 20 degrees and sunny but it's
important a supposed to be there like I
don't 10 degrees during the day so but
anyways it's a lot warmer than it is in
Canada
farmers it's snowing right there you can
see a little bit of a windy day or there
yeah that's right so hope this is useful
so this gives a little bit behind the
scenes as to what will be bringing and
yeah so next time you see us will be in
CS bringing you the latest and the
greatest and hard-hitting coverage
vitria well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
