case review I'm trying to be as engaged
visually as possible with something
that's in front of my lens and also
mentally and this is where audible as a
productivity booster really comes into
play of getting my mind engaged and I've
recently been listening to brain maker
which is a fantastic audio book on what
you should eat to feel elite see the
connection there you get a 30-day free
trial if you sign up with audible.com
slash
hwc plus you get a free audiobook that
you get to download and keep forever so
happy listening and elite healthy
lifestyle so the NZXT s340 is one of
those popular cases that keeps updating
to keep up with the market trends as the
elite version is a $30 premium over the
original which i think is fair given the
extra updates the frame itself is
unchanged and I have the matte black
version which is the identical color to
the eraser edition of the S 340 but a
white and a red black versions will also
be available now first thing the
tempered glass panel has been added that
not only gives the S 340 a new clean
fresh look but it's also so much more
resilient to scratches &amp;amp; handli marks
they're so common on plastic windows the
perimeter is blacked out to hide the
edges of the frame and you can see a lot
more now versus the previous window
which this frame still supports so the
backwards compatible with all the cases
panels but given the nature of the glass
mount the window is not compatible with
older versions on the case and what I
would love to see is some type of swivel
glass panel but I understand that's very
difficult to implement given how heavy
the glass is air flow remains the same
with rear and top exhaust top being
unfiltered still unfortunately and I
think people were hoping for an added
fence slot but given the compact mid
tower status I'm fine with how things
have been left alone
as the intent is to use the front panel
for AAO installation either a 240 or a
280 moment a radiator and the intake is
filtered to with easy to remove panel
and a magnetic filter the drive cage is
below it is ventilated but without any
direct access for air flow but the
spacing from the panel is enough for the
fans to intake enough and here at the
top is the new i/o with added VR ports
as they are labeled giving us 2 USB 3
ports a full size HDMI pass-through for
the VR headset it's definitely the
latest trend to follow in the footsteps
of tempered glass but let us know if
that's an attractive feature for you in
the comments below the interior is
identical with the power supply shroud a
couple of SSD caddies with appropriate
cutouts and now a third SSD caddy on the
side with a cutout at the front for
proper orientation of the drive and it's
definitely made to show off your
hardware the rest of the layout is
unchanged with a smart cable management
bracket on the side of the motherboard
that actually has been offset away from
the front panel so you have now 65
millimeters of clearance from the front
which is enough for standard radiator +
fan configuration the power supply does
total has changed to this easily
removable plate unlike the crappy flabby
one on the original and cable management
has also been refined with new plastic
clips that hold all the cables my only
negative comment here would be the clips
are quiet weak and would open if any
excess cables are stuffed in there and
why couldn't NZXT fix the bottom drive
cage
it fits only three and a half inch
drives but without any padding there are
no caddies there so this metal on metal
contact is not ideal for acoustics and
so as I begin the assembly process I
really wanted to leave the full
25-minute timeline until I have a
finished system as the process as you
can see is super simple and I would say
the S 340 would be a nice beginners case
the one surprising thing that I found
was this molex fan splitter for 2
included fans that I wish was SATA but
for best fan control of course they were
connected to the motherboard the main
thing I like here is the layout that's
built for this particular configuration
so
and all in one at the front for intake
while exhaust is covered by default and
if your air cooling front fans are a
must for intake now with improved cable
management this was easier to route than
the original and the fact that the power
supply is totally hidden you actually
don't have to do as much to keep things
clean and with the glass panel closed
this refresh gives the s340 a totally
new attractive look and if you're after
this minimal clean lines frame this
totally fits and lastly a VR accessory
is included this magnetic rubber 2-piece
holder that can be attached to any metal
surface and is meant to hold a VR
headset it's actually surprising how
functional it is having a channel for
cable to wrap around and the magnet
itself is quite powerful so this is my
go-to headphone holder from now on
assembling your verdaguer gaming chair
just got a whole lot easier with a
simple insert mechanism off the back
seat onto the side rails so you mount
the side screws much faster a true
one-man job assembly made easy by
vertically and so the elite in my eyes
should serve as a perfect example of
what to do when refreshing a case the
price premium of $30 is fair and in line
- how much competing brands are charging
for tempered glass editions plus the
added VR IO accessory bracket extra SSD
caddy on the inside plus improved cable
management I only wish the drive cage
was different but if you have been
eyeing the s 340 the elite Edition
deserves that status for one of the best
mint hours on the market right now it is
a little bit risky though as this is no
longer a budget enclosure but that is
what happens when tempered glass is
involved I'm Dimitri with harbor Canucks
thank you guys so much for watching and
we'll see you in the next video
