year's CES from the perspective of PC
gamers like at Computex RGB was
absolutely everywhere with peripherals
cooling power supplies cases
motherboards and everything between
going the multicolored approach the
other defining technology was HDR or
high dynamic range monitors and unlike
the RGB craze this will certainly change
things in a big way while the amount of
content right now is limited at best HDR
is the future of monitors and most
people agree that it has an even greater
impact on image quality than the added
detail afforded by 4k resolution as a
result it is not surprising that hot on
heels of AMD's announcement of free sync
to Nvidia introduce their latest and
greatest gaming oriented monitor
technology g-sync HDR let's see what it
has to offer after message from our
sponsors the show coverage is possible
thanks to Nvidia gigabyte fantex and
NCIX
as a quick recap from some of our
previous videos HDR or high dynamic
range allows for a greater amount of
luminosity within images which brings
them closer to visual perfection for the
human eye than previously possible this
can lead to anything from increased
shadow depth to more realistic vibrancy
to better black levels and increase
detail actually the possibility with HDR
are literally endless and more
importantly since HDR 10 is now
considered a standard supporting
monitors will be completely plug and
play without any setup necessary to
attain optimal image quality with that
in mind at CES 2017 and Vidia unveiled
the world's first HDR gaming monitors as
of right now g-sync HDR is not just some
guidelines like AMD freesync - it is an
actual product working in coordination
with a you optronics NVIDIA has actually
developed a g-sync panel that fully
supports HDR 10 this 27-inch panel not
only has a 4k resolution but it also
runs at an ultra fast 144 hertz refresh
rate and it requires a single
DisplayPort 1.4 input now if that wasn't
amazing enough this panel also has a
peak brightness of 1000 nits a full
array backlit with 384 individually
controllable led zones almost zero input
latency quantum technology and a wide
color gamut
colors close to DCI p3 cinema standard
so basically you can have your cake and
a tattoo the first two monitors to
feature this ultra high-end 27-inch
panel will be the Acer predator xB to 72
and asus rog swift a PG 27 UQ they will
feature both hdmi 2.0 and DisplayPort
1.4 inputs the latter of which is an
absolute necessity to handle the 31.4
gigabits per second bandwidth that this
panel will require we actually went
hands-on with both of these but since
they both function identically I will
focus on the asus swift PG 27 q one
thing is evident right away and that's
the new base which will be used in many
of the new ROG products it uses three
thin legs to support a raised center
column and within that is an LED which
projects downwards onto your work
surface now even though the stand makes
this monitor look light the actual panel
is ultra thick part of this is due to
the depth required by the full array
backlit with its individually zones but
there's also some thickness required for
the active cooling of Nvidia g-sync
module asus told us that the final
retail units may do away with this
active cooler but that's something
they're testing right now so how does a
4k HDR running g-sync actually look
absolutely stunning in person the
side-by-side test systems were running
the Unreal Engine infiltrator demo and
the differences between HDR and SDR was
completely evident even if you can't
really see the differences in this video
shadow depth color reproduction and
highlights were noticeably better on the
HDR monitor and I was actually able to
see a lot more detail on it
GC HDR will be launching later this year
and unfortunately neither Asus nor Acer
would tell us the price of these
displays but don't expect them to be
anywhere close to a budget-friendly 4k
g-sync HDR will also need a ton of jpo
horsepower
since the system's we saw were running
dual Pascal Titan X cards and the
infiltrator demo dipped below 30 frames
per second a few times so what do you
guys think of GC HDR is it something
that will interest you or do you think
it'll be way too expensive let us know
in the comments down below and stay
tuned for more content from CES 2017 an
email with hurricane X thank you so much
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
