from Thermaltake is finally here I have
the level 20 VT which is a micro text
enclosure at $99 I'm excited to see this
whole micro Tech's popularity rising but
let's say if this case is for you right
after this
all right so the level 20 series spends
the entire spectrum of motherboard sizes
I am happy that I have the VT version
for micro TX motherboards because
anything that stands for the ATX and ATX
motherboards is just way too big for me
I don't do water cooling and obviously
those larger cases are designed to house
like really gigantic radiators and tons
of water cooling equipment and that's
just on something that I'm into but I am
actually quite interested in the VT
because micro ATX popularity is growing
we recently reviewed the courser - ATX
which is quite nice but side to side
comparison you can see that VTE is
bulkier it's wider is taller but also
because it can accommodate a lot more
for water cooling hardware and so it's
not exactly a fair comparison size-wise
but you know it's bulky enough so that
you can put a lot of things into it and
not be cramped for space now design wise
I actually quite liked it the dark grey
color scheme the glass paneling and it's
like smooth exterior it almost Slim's it
down so in comparison to something a
little bit more edgy like a - ATX I
actually like the level 20 VT more now
the cool thing about this micro ATX
layout is that the motherboard is flat
which means you can see an entire system
from all four sides which is kind of
cool so you approach that from a visual
perspective first in terms of how you
gonna mount your water cooling
components or if you go in with air
cooling and where you can mount certain
fans for the entire system to shine a
little bit extra but of course that
front glass piece is a bit of a concern
especially because that's spacing
between the glass and the filter behind
it and then the actual frame is not that
deep and I'll show you the temperatures
later but yeah it is a concern now
behind the front panel is our 200
millimeter fan it is mounted outside of
the frame and if you want to have a
little bit extra spacing I'd recommend
you mounted internally but this space
can also accommodate dual 120 or 140
motor fans with their respective
radiators and one thing to keep in mind
are those IO cables and how they exit
from the bottom but the good thing is
you can route them from any of the four
large cutouts on that frame so if you
need to route them sort of around
certain fans in one directions or the
other you
have the ability to do so the ILO is
pretty standard it is at the top and
it's attached to the actual frame which
is awesome so when you remove all the
paneling you don't have to reroute all
the cabling again but it is pretty
widespread and you have to take that
into account when you know doing all
your cables below the top glass panel we
find four fan brackets which are
actually pretty clever I do like this
implementation so not only are they
labeled for left and right to avoid
confusion when reinstalling them back
into the case but you also have markings
for 120 and 140 Miller fans so you could
do a 280 or 240 rod on each bracket
there are also two lists so installation
is much easier and not only can they be
installed at the top they can also be
installed on the side the catch however
are the side panels because only one of
them is slightly spaced out to allow for
airflow intake or exhaust so you have to
make up your mind whether or not you're
installing radiator or fans on the top
or on either sides because you cannot
install the flat panels when the side
bracket is installed because just like
it doesn't fit whereas the spaced one it
is designed to fit no problem on top of
those brackets I do like this
flexibility but it does corner you into
using only one of the three sides for
airflow while the others will be
completely sort of shot with those glass
panels and you cannot purchase the
additional spaced out side panels just
yet but if you do let Thermaltake know
now I don't particularly like the side
panel attachment the thumb screws are
nice the little ridge at the front is
nice to cache the panel but there's
nothing in the bottom so when you remove
the thumb screws it simply falls out now
the interior layout follows a dual
chamber design so we have our micro ATX
motherboard that is flat with five PCI
slots which is awesome there's this
giant cutout in front of the fan so you
have five inches of clearance from the
frame after the motherboard but of
course it will be shorter because you
have to still route your 24 pin cable
but it gives you a little bit of
flexibility for extra thick radiators
for the bottom chamber we have a
standard ATX power supply mount and a
drive cage with three drive caddies and
three SSD caddies on the side of the
motherboard and these caddies have a
little bit of flexibility on where you
want to mount them so you can slightly
reposition them if you need extra space
for cables or something like that so
that's nice now the bottom panel needs
to be removed in order to install your
power supply and access your drives here
we have our case feed and the power
supply dust filter however we have this
additional ventilation which is supposed
to be for additional fans 120 molar fans
if you want but it is not dust filtered
which I find odd and it's things like
that alongside with really short spacing
on that ventilated glass side panel that
made me think that maybe this was a
rushed release or they had other plans
that didn't fully come to fruition but
regardless I wanted to approach this
build from a visual perspective and just
to see how easy or difficult it would be
to do an simple airflow system with some
good illuminated hardware and then how
easy it would be to do cable management
and something that is that exposed well
the experience were satisfactory up to a
point and I literally through all the
visual arsenal that I could to make this
thing beautiful so first I use thermal
tics ring trio fans which are actually
quite beautiful they have the sent to
elimination
the exterior illumination and they also
have the rear illumination so for the
exhaust fan for example that ring
elation shines right through the frame
which looks stunning I also appreciate
the ambient spill of the frame itself so
you're not particularly seeing harsh
LEDs you know it's all evenly split and
I also replaced the 200 mm were a fan of
the front with an RGB fan and I placed
that behind the frame to give me a
little bit more spacing between the fan
and the front panel obviously I had to
put in some RGB memory to color match to
the theme of my light blue build so I
have the team group Excalibur fantastic
dims with a nice ambient illumination
and that can easily color match to that
or add some accent color with the other
colors and purple looks fantastic and
lastly to tidy up some cables I use the
sleeved cable mod extensions which look
awesome and I also use their sleeping
for all-in-one coolers but I use this
for cables because cable management in
this case is a bit challenging so first
we have all the cables from the top
front IO that have to be bunched up and
router to the side of the motherboard
which is completely exposed and I don't
know a way to
route those cables so doesn't look messy
and luckily I have this leaving so
they're at least kind of like bunched up
into one but I don't know how else you
would control that so it looks actually
just fine from that side maybe a
low-profile USB 3 connector would have
been nice because man nothing is
completely blocking the graphics card
and on the other side I used one of the
SSD caddies beside the motherboard to
hold the cables and the other SSD to
basically just hide the entire mess that
is the bottom chamber and that is
because there is not a single not a
single cable type point in that entire
bottom chamber so I stashed all the
cables into the hard drive cage so that
it doesn't completely pop out and that
is an issue when there is nothing to aid
you with a completely exposed enclosure
that's fully made of glass on all sides
how are you supposed to do a clean
system you have to put in hours and
hours of work for cables to route them
particularly way and then use like DIY
solutions to hold those cables in place
that is not a pleasant experience and
the only solution here are covers for
the bottom chamber to contain all that
mess tinted glass side panels would not
work because all side panels aren't too
changeable so like how would you have
that so it's not well thought out and
that's unfortunate now of course the
front panel is an airflow barrier so not
only is our GPU temperature hotter not
by much but still our CPU throttled at
75 degrees Celsius to 3.3 gigahertz
instead of staying at 3.5 so yeah so
then who is this case for it's exactly
for the target audience who are water
cooling but also are willing to
experiment and put in the time to do
something extremely beautiful and clean
cable management is a big issue and so
you have to go in with some DIY methods
and controlling all the cables that are
exiting from the power supply and how
they enter back with that motherboard
area it's difficult especially because
we have glass on all three sides so that
entire area is exposed and you just have
to put in your all so the whole thing
can look okay I don't think that's a
particularly bad direction
but we've gotten so comfortable with you
know regular power supply chambers that
hide all the mess that Thermaltake needs
to put a little bit more work into
something like this so that we don't
have to the new mark to coursers trades
and k70 keyboards are fully loaded with
custom illumination convenient media
buttons USB pass-through extra set of
key camps and ergonomic wrist rest for
each keyboard so you can type core game
comfortably with a variety of MX
switches available so you can check out
which keyboard suits you best in the
description below alright guys so that
is the level 20 VT let me know how you
would approach building is something
like this for water cooling you know how
would you do keel management and it's
micro TX as popular as I think it is
becoming let's have this conversation
I'm a Dmitri make sure to subscribe and
