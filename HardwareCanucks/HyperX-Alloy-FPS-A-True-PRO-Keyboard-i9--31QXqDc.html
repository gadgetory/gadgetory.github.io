long way we've tested a variety of them
here at Hydra connects and so far
everyone stood up from each other based
on their unique characteristics or
features not to mention they had their
own drawbacks but choice ultimately
comes down to user preference and there
are a lot of options out there
price does tend to be a crucial aspect
with these things too regardless of
whether you're someone with hundreds to
spend on a peripheral or you're simply
looking for something entry-level
everyone wants to maximize overall value
and what they get for their hard earned
money in this review I'll be taking a
look at a new mechanical gaming keyboard
from Kingston that focuses on quality
over broad feature set but will that be
enough to justify a price that some
gamers may consider overly expensive so
before we move on quick message from our
sponsor this cyber monday NCIX PC impact
our gaming pcs featuring GeForce GTX 10
series graphics are an even sweeter deal
with big discounts a free course avoid
gaming headset a copy of watchdogs 2
plus even more swag click the link in
the description to learn more meet the
HyperX a low FPS mechanical gaming
keyboard priced at $100 what's so
special about it is that the design or
are there any unique features actually
let's start with a design because it
really backs to basics without any
add-ons this is a very simple looking
gaming keyboard in a compact form factor
that's been engineered for Portability
and durability the black solid steel
frame throughout the chassis complements
a robust build which is always a welcome
feature at this price point there's
absolutely no flex when typing and that
increases both typing and gaming
accuracy there's a single USB charging
port at the back of the keyboard which
is a convenient way to charge your
mobile devices but I would have
preferred an extra USB port for data
transfers from hard drives or flash
drives because this single port only
passes power the main cable on the other
hand is removable and braided in a tight
mesh I prefer this type of approach over
pre-attached cables because it provides
easier routing to my PC and it's user
replaceable HyperX also includes a mesh
travel pouch for the a low fps and I
think this should be useful for
traveling purposes especially for LAN
events there's also a convenient storage
slot
or the removable cable even though the
overall approach here is very
minimalistic there are a few touches of
color here and there a HyperX includes
these colored contoured and textured
rawski caps
along with the first four number keys
since the a low FPS is targeted towards
FPS gamers this is a nice addition and
helps quickly find your movement and
inventory keys a key cap removal tool is
also included media playback buttons are
programmed to the function key plus
there is a game mode on f12 that
disables the Windows key the keyboard
also features full end key and six key
rollover and to enable that you'll need
to press the FN + delete key and FN plus
insert key respectively unfortunately
this information is not provided in the
manual nor on the website it's very
disappointing to have all the marketing
material drowning out useful information
that is missing but good thing they've
added that portion after we brought it
up the lighting on the a low FPS is
pretty basic but that's by design rather
than anything else all the keys are
individually backlit by the red LED and
while RGB is a trend these days it's not
easy to find a fully mechanical keyboard
with cherry switches and RGB for under
120 dollars HyperX opted for Cherry MX
blue switches on the a low FPS gaming
keyboard and I found that to be a bit
odd now most of you might be comfortable
gaming on MX blue switches but the
majority of gamers but for MX reds or
browns because the actuation force is a
lot lighter compared to blues this can
be a major disadvantage for FPS gamers
because from my experience these
switches are not so good for fast
actions like changing weapons or
movement throughout the gameplay on the
other hand MX blue switches are great
for productivity purposes because they
have great tactile feedback and a little
bit of resistance for actuation and I
like that for writing scripts and emails
but for gaming I just wish they offered
MX Reds or perhaps a custom switch since
that's slowly starting to become the
trend these days
let's have listen
this is a driverless keyboard so all the
lighting effects are built into the
device so you don't have to worry about
messing around with the driver software
that can be considered either positive
or negative depending on what you expect
from a peripheral there are six lighting
modes that are selectable by pressing
the function key and the left and right
arrow keys there's static effect
breathing and then comes the keystroke
effect followed by ripple the wave
effect is next which only flows in one
direction and finally it ends with the
custom mode that lights up the wass keys
the inventory Keys the spacebar and the
control key which is what I took
advantage of while playing battlefield
one these are high quality switches no
questions asked I love MX blues for the
perfect tactile registrations and the
included textured keys do a great job
gripping my fingers and it's easily
distinguishable when playing in darker
environments
I just can't agree with switch choice
HyperX opted for as MX Blues are not
great for FPS gamers you easily
experience finger fatigue after hours of
gameplay given the slightly stronger
actuation force there are angle
adjustments for appropriate elevation
and the textured rubber grips at the
bottom do a great job preventing the
keyboard from sliding around your desk
so to answer my question at the
beginning of this video is the HyperX a
low FPS gaming mechanical keyboard worth
every penny I personally don't think so
but that might not be the same for you
you see I love the compact form factor
and I think it's perfect for travel
especially for land events the build
quality is great and the accessories
that are included in the box are useful
and I like the red backlighting what got
me was there switched choice the a low
FPS is targeted towards FPS gamers but
as an FPS gamer I would have preferred
an option of at least MX Reds due to
their lighter actuations now you might
prefer MX blue switches for gaming and
in that case this might be a great
keyboard for your needs I'd like to hear
your thoughts on whether or not HyperX
chose the right switch for the alloy FPS
gaming keyboard
do you prefer MX reds blues or browns or
are you spoiled by another switch that
isn't cherry let me know the comments
section down below I meat bar with
hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
