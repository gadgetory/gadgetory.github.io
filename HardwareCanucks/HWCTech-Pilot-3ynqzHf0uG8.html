with Haru Canucks and welcome to the
very first tech show with me here this
is my co-host Matt hey Matt and so
basically the idea of the show is to get
more engagement with our audience get
some of the interaction going and you
guys get to finally sort of get to
experience our personalities aside from
watching our regular video reviews on
YouTube so this could be a way to get
your engagement and just hopefully it's
gonna work out to the way we're gonna
run the show because we have a lot of
topics lined up we gotta be covering a
lot of tech news some of the most recent
tech news will be answering questions
from you guys and so today's show is a
pilot episode for the Huracan x tech
show and we still have not come up with
a name yet yeah we got nothing so well
Matt and I we've agreed that we would
like your opinion on the name for the
show so leave your comments down below
regarding the name or the potential
names show and perhaps you know some
people can also chime in and maybe your
name for the for the show will become
the detect show for the highroad
conducts you never know so we got a lot
of cool topics coming up today and so
well I guess gonna just dive right into
it and we'll the first topic is the it's
actually been recently this we came up
yesterday it's pretty big news it's
coming directly out of China it
specifically Foxconn and it's kind of
Reiter
it's about basically the console war
that's going on right now it looks like
PlayStation might be in a little bit of
trouble with the ps4 basically Foxconn
the people that are actually making the
ps4 for Sony are going to a school or a
series of schools and there's basically
cherry-picking students to work there ya
know that's not necessarily a bad thing
except for the fact that they're forcing
the kids to work there for school credit
for school credits so not only is that
like an issue in its own right but
they're using students that are underage
so I think there was a 14 yep some 14
year-olds where the legal age is 16 so
that's kind of a big issue in its own
but also Foxconn is the world's biggest
contract in electronics so not only this
is not a tiny company that that has kind
of few employees they have 800,000
employees worldwide so they are a pretty
huge company and letting them do
something like that that's completely
unacceptable and you guys know Haruka
Knox we are all about critical analysis
so being vertical is always the way to
go and so the Foxconn being the the
world's biggest electronics contractor
not only are they producing things for
ps4 that's coming up but they're also
working for Apple and HP HP Nokia so in
normal circumstances I guess this might
not really be that big of a surprise
yeah considering I mean Foxconn
technically it hasn't really done much
to stop you know everything that
happened a couple years ago when you
know they had those mass suicides
basically the people jumping off the
building now they have done things like
exercise classes and let's all be
cheerful and like have like a chanted
motto before the morning I mean that's
that's fantastic stuff from building
morale mm-hmm but the one thing that I
really didn't like about this story the
thing that really pushed my buttons a
little bit was the fact that they're
forcing these students to basically work
the graveyard shift so it's not even
like an actual nine-to-five shift
they're working Midnight's and then
having to go to school during the day so
they're being forced to do this for
credits at school so number one blame us
to fall on Foxconn but also with the
school itself I believe it was yes the
Zion Institute of Technology so I'm
blaming you Institute of tech so yeah
that's that's basically I guess a but
I'm a little bit pissed off about it but
that's that's just me and actually based
on the response of this worldwide
community because this is pretty huge
news especially with ps4 like they did
this with a smart move sort of bringing
out the attention and bring up relevant
attention to the whole tech industry
saying that you know that this is
relevant because ps4 is coming out and
that's very exciting but here's the
little details that you should probably
know about sort of the production
facilities that's what's going
and so there's been the response from
the school and from the company a fox
from Foxconn itself stating that they
will they admitted the guilt first of
all so that's a good thing and they are
working with a school now to get rid of
that mandatory credit to work for like
the graveyard shift so it's showing that
you know people are aware and they're
they know what's going on and they know
that's a it's a it's a bad situation and
it's a good thing to see that
international community they're
responding in such a positive way saying
that this is this should not happen I'm
gonna give them credit for one thing
though
that's a genius way to get pretty much
cheap and free labor I'll give it that
ok yeah oh they're also getting paid
technically I guess but yeah let's chalk
up the Foxconn for being innovative but
alright so the next thing in news of the
hub right now is that LG and Samsung are
both developing a bendable and
unbreakable o LED screen so what does
this mean to you know the wireless cell
phone industry so one thing that first
comes to mind is that well I think
Samsung is gonna be coming out with
their it's the note 3 which is gonna
have the the curved screen and I know
the LG is coming up with a couple other
things so yeah what do you think about
that whole curb screen and like having a
bendable and unbreakable o LED screens
well I'm not sure if that would have
anything to do with durability of the
phone because currently you know on
phones like Samsung and the Nexus 4
right now for example that doral build
of Gorilla Glass any tiny drop and you
know maybe perhaps a really bad angle
that they would crack the screen right
so that's one of the things that came to
my mind I mean if you're able to just
sort of it has some type of flexibility
what type of effect does that have on
absorbing vibrations from a fall onto
the ground that's what I was thinking
about those I mean if its malleable so
if you can bend it and move it wouldn't
that also kind of help with like shock
resistant exactly yeah so if you're
dropping if you drop the phone like I I
don't know if you guys can see this this
is my phone and I got a big crack down
the middle of it
in case but it's always gonna keep Nexus
for always yeah yeah I shoulda got it
for my ass three but not but so if you
drop your phone the case can kind of
like move with the vibration but I said
you're not gonna have I mean Gorilla
Glass is now gonna probably go out of
business and hopefully not but I mean
they're called the famous the fact that
they're gonna be able to develop that
unbreakable or unlikely to break the
glass it'll go over top of the screen
that has like it's sensitive why not it
this might actually change the game a
lot the same way that Gorilla Glass is
kind of hoping that it would change the
game for for cellphone so this is huge
news mm-hmm
and I think that you told me a little
bit a little while ago I bought like
this new 3d technology to that's coming
to the screens so Disney whom you write
Disney Oh
Disney is making tech yeah let that sink
in for a second yeah okay the same
people that brought you Nemo it's now
developing it's actually that's pretty
cool
yeah they are developing technology that
would work in conjunction with a
touchscreen that would send tiny
vibrations through the screen that would
allow you to actually feel the texture
of a certain image or a certain picture
that's projected through the display it
so has a couple of potential useful
situations for example in the museum
where you're not allowed to touch
certain skeletons and certain sort of
preserved parts that you now can perhaps
just go to monitor and just sort of feel
where the where the texture of the bone
is like and could revolutionize the porn
industry yeah oh it feels so good okay
anyways um so what I think this could
really really work with is that like
education-wise actually something I
didn't even think about when you were
talking about this before I mean medical
profession they feel like a medical
student or if you're looking at scans I
don't know if they have like 3d skin I'm
sure they have 3d scans mm-hmm but like
there's a lot of different use cases
that you can use for this and this is
this could be a game changer
specifically if they're able to come up
with the tech and it's you know
something you could create on maps which
would be really cool yeah but of all the
people Disney
I mean I had no idea that Disney
actually even own stuff but well they
own Pixar so it kind of makes sense but
maybe there's some type of visual aid in
terms of that that okay that makes sense
that'd be really cool
so moving on the the whole thing about
touch screens and stuff like that new
rumors are the Nexus 5 are coming out
now I don't know if you guys have heard
about the pricing and there's like
different fluctuations with battery life
which is kind of cool so what if we
heard about the Nexus 5 well so the
Nexus 5 well first of all the rumored
release date is always isolating so it
was in the end of October now it's the
15th of October so perhaps we could see
it next week even so that would be cool
pricing wise I think it would be 399
sort of like the standard pricing for a
Nexus phone one thing that I don't
understand it's like how come somebody
like these guys Samsung can charge like
$6.99 for a phone and yet they're
actually able to undercut that's an
incredible value especially considering
the gear that the four went on sale like
what $1.99 for the 68 or it was at the
Epstein Yeager was a don't think was the
1616 yeah $1.99 for a 16 gig smartphone
that has LTE and all that fun stuff yeah
that you can unlock yeah just just come
on a note of this this whole mobile
movement and on topic of Nexus 5 I think
it has its own benefits for the consumer
who is sort of price conscious as the
Nexus 5 release drops down the prices of
previous phones so for example the Nexus
4 is still an amazing phone and it is
now free with a lot of plants right so
the phone that was on sale usually
released at 399 went on sale for 199 has
a phone itself and now it's free with a
plain it's it works perfectly for for a
lot of people because if you're not
constantly chasing after the best phone
then it's just the perfect and the
really cool thing is no bloatware yeah
there's a lot of like the the
manufacturers they have right now is
that they'll actually package a lot of
they're there because they're in their
custom software that in reality doesn't
really have that much tangible benefit
to it I mean granted I kind of like some
of the gestures at Samsung it's like a
her to her put into their phones and
everything hmm interpreted some of the
things that they've implemented there's
we're just looking for implemented into
the phones that actually have a lot of a
lot of use but the majority of people if
you're into tech and you like messing
around with your tack and stuff like
that you're probably gonna put a custom
ROM on it anyways basically one thing
that I really like about the galaxy not
the galaxy the Nexus I'm thinking
Samsung still the Nexus 5 is that it's
still gonna run just the vanilla version
of Android so you're sleeping over 4.4
okay and it's important the 4.4 kitkat
and that's the Nestle pay for that okay
then okay
there's I've read today there's actually
my shirt was rumored or is it confirmed
cooperation between Nestle and and
Google that makes sense considering all
their like the sweet ideas like for
their of their code names and everything
I wonder if you can go into settings and
then click on Android 4.4 and instead of
jelly beans so neat bunch of kids
running around already Creek like snap
in half and whatnot oh yeah
so cool moving on from mobile so another
really big thing that we wanted to talk
to you guys about is the new GPU Center
me coming up from a and B or that
already art out of the kind of a little
bit it's the our series so basically
what we're looking at now is that AMD is
completely changed up their naming
scheme we're going from the r5 to the r7
to the r9 so our five is can be like
your main stream our five will be like
your middle of the roads type of gamer
and then the r9 is going to be like your
extreme gaming cards and whatnot so the
r7 series and part of the r9 series are
already launched now one thing that I do
want to comment on right away is the r9
280x there's quite a few people that are
a little bit confused and I think that
this is a brand new car that this is the
new high end GPU from AMD guys it's on
the 280x is basically just the 7970 it's
the exact same card it's a rebrand but
it's priced a little bit differently
than what we've experienced before now
this card actually right now considering
where it stands in performance and
prices I'm pretty confident saying
right now right now for the next two
weeks at least it's the price
performance leader in the category
they're charging $2.99 for this card for
performance and equals basically the 684
the GTX 770 which is the exact same
courage okay so basically this card this
card is not necessarily brand new but
what is brand name is the pricing so
we're looking at 299 for the actual
price point of the 7970 or should I say
the 280 acts against the 60 a 680 the
Nvidia 680 or the 770 which is roughly
the exact same curve and that's priced
at 399 so we're looking at basically
$100 difference and that's huge news
considering the fact that we're looking
at a card that performs at a really high
level yeah and NVIDIA doesn't really
have anything that can compete against
that right now yeah so Nvidia is
currently also responding to the whole
market to the to the aim these release
of these new r7 9 r9 cards by lowering
prices are they're lured lower models so
the 650 Ti but they still don't have
anything in the exact 299 range that
would compete with the r9 card so that's
kind of that's a big deal for indeed
they sort of have the upper hand in that
because it performs like the 77079 70
gigahertz edition but it is priced $50
less $100 less so it's it is a very good
thing from certainly from AMD to release
something like that for the gamers out
there that are not particularly fanboys
for one the best bang for the buck out
there because I myself am NOT have not
been falling in video have throughout my
entire life I've been switching between
cards based on performance and I would
say this would be an excellent kind of
time to move on to name B right now yeah
I mean AMD is basically doing the exact
same thing that they did with the 5870
guys I don't know if you remember this
but there 5870 was easy first it was an
incredible card yeah it was priced
really aggressively they refers to the
market with DirectX 11 which is what
they're doing if mantle and actually
it's a perfect segue because I wanted to
talk about mantle what the hell is
mantle
well guys mantle is an API to low-level
API a series of coding so basically it
uses the drivers a little bit more
efficiently than what's currently
available on the market so what does
that really mean it means that
developers now have the capability that
they can avoid bottlenecks that are
caused from communicating between the
GPU and CPU so a lot of the tasks or the
pulse can be pulled directly off the GPU
itself rather than having to go through
the whole system of going to the CPU and
the CPU calling it going directly to the
GPU and one of the other things that's
really big about this is that there's
games that are just recently being
baited bf4 for all of you people that
have basically lived under a rock for
the past little while bf4 battlefield 4
is the newest game from dice they uses
frostbite 3 and it uses mantle yeah it's
gonna take over the run now all you
fanboys would want to get angry with me
and say that Call of Duty is gonna be
the biggest game so the ghost is gonna
be fantastic
Oh ghost it's gonna have dogs you can
break a friggin
skyscraper in this game like the entire
world is destructible but the best part
is is that the game looks incredible
and despite a little bit of hiccups in
the first little run of the beta it's
running pretty darn good on a lot of
different types of hardware and the game
is fun it's got one of the best online
communities I've ever been a part of
outside of hardware connects so
basically like the online experience is
good the story is decent from what I've
heard I mean it's gonna probably be
around the exact same story lands McIver
yeah a bad guy with the nuclear bomb
tries to blow it up and we need to stop
him
oh my god it's gonna destroy everything
so let's do our best - you know my
famous bf4 is certainly shines in the
multiplayer yeah it's I mean it's it's
the reason to get the game that's that
simple now currently it's been a lot of
fun to do play in the multiplayer with
64 players with just everything is
intense they've added the new
obliteration mode recently which is
basically chasing the bomb and planting
the bomb in three enemy sites and you
have to blow them up but the thing is
with them with that mode is that you can
see the bomb so if you have a fear of
the bomb and you're on the map you
highlighted for the enemies so the the
action is non-stop so they don't we
constantly parachute onto you and it's a
lot of teamwork cooperation so it's a
lot of fun to do especially with friends
and one thing that I'm really happy with
battling four guys is that if you're not
sure but the path of your three did not
have any voice chat it built into the
system so you have either Skype or use
another communication to chat with all
your gamer friends now you have squad
chat so pressing left out we'll get you
the voice chat for your teammates for
your squad which is amazing cool so I
mean not it's not amazing they should
you should have been at bathroom three
as well but it's just something that
gamers have asked for and it's there
that's that's actually really cool I
mean it avoids having to have run things
in the background which can't slow down
your actual gaming experience and from
somebody like I when I was playing
battlefield 3 I was using Skype a lot to
basically communicate with people that I
wanted to communicate with and I notice
how they give you once in a while I get
like these notifications and people
would pop up and it would kind of ruin
the experience for me so dice did a
really really smart thing and actually
put that into the game so you don't
actually have to download any
third-party software which is really
really cool
no one correlation that I want to make
is that mantle and bf4
is gonna be like your match made in
heaven which is gonna give a little bit
of an advantage to AMD going forward but
I've heard that Nvidia will be coming
out with a solution to this and I think
it's probably just gonna be implemented
within the drivers I'm not too sure if
it's going to be anything specific in
like regards to Hardware change but I
think the first real move to allow this
type of a low-level API will be in
Maxwell but there should be an answer
pretty soon guys coming from the from
the greenside and and mantle is also its
current is going to be released in
december yeah
so for everybody who's getting the new
AMD cards now you will get an update
driver update for your GPU that will
incorporate mantle into the
into the car and will be utilized by the
game as well so it is not release
currently with the cards but as soon as
it's launched it's a simple driver
updates for your job before you got got
this card and you're good to go with
mantle now guys if you want to take a
look at it there is a leak of the 290x
PCB if you go to ek water blocks or ekw
be calm that's not a shut up guys stay
in a pace for that so basically if you
go to their cooling configurator which
is I think cooling configurator calm you
can type in the r9 290x and that will
show you the PCB in the stock cooler I
mean everybody's seen the stock cooler
thankfully this time around they're not
building with wood nails sorry guys I
kind of had to say that we are kind of
anticipating something along the lines
at least I was but you can see the PCB
and you can see that they're using
pretty high-end components like they
usually do and I'll give you a little
bit of a sneak peek as to what you can
expect from what I will what I'm
expecting to be the performance later I
haven't seen the card I want a caveat I
haven't seen anything about it yet I've
seen you know some leaks by the same
stuff that you guys have seen but I'm
expecting it to be a Titan killer so
we'll see if that actually there's the
high of it at least they're trying to
build up the height for it to be there
well I know what the hype is good it
makes people it gets people excited and
you always look forward to the hype
cards to see if it is it lives up to the
hype if it is a Titan killer and it's
650 dollars versus $1,000 for the Titan
I mean that's a huge price difference
yeah game and knowing md it's most
likely possible that this price
difference is going to still maybe not
be the titan killer in terms of
performance but will be very close
because that's just how long the rolls
yeah it's like getting a steak on
Groupon for like 35 bucks and you could
have paid like $90 for it trust me it's
a good experience I don't know if you
guys have heard of this company it's
called Fitbit
now Fitbit basically makes these fitness
trackers hence the name fit bitches just
because it's tiny it's like roughly
about that big they've made a couple
different products before the Fitbit
flex which was their first
like a watch it's a wearable fitness
tracker which basically tracks our sleep
and how much you move calories you
burned they've upgraded this to the
Fitbit force now the upgrade you might
seem pretty miniscule and small to most
people but I'm incredibly excited about
this and you guys if you want to learn
more about it you can check in the link
in the description and all the topics
that we're gonna be talking about
covering today will be in the
description with time code so if you are
if you're want to go back check out
anything I will talk about a little bit
earlier on you can do that with a time
code sweet everybody loves time code I
love time good so what are the really
specific things about the Fitbit force
that I absolutely love is that it's
gonna have the ability to track your
sleep so it'll tell you how many times
you're waking up the quality of sleep
that you're getting so you can make
subtle changes and recommend these
subtle changes to you within the
software that you can program at your
phone they will have Android sorry I
enjoyed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so yeah
that's huge no other one has this on the
market oh they are the ones like the the
Nike FuelBand I think you gotta actually
plug it into your computer via USB
there's a jawbone up band which actually
looks really cool it doesn't have a
screen on it or anything but the jawbone
up and you actually have to plug it into
your phone it's like the headphone jack
so it's not really all that convenient
so one benefit the Fitbit is actually
put into it so you have that Bluetooth
connectivity you have that Wi-Fi
connectivity the other real good benefit
is that it's not Android or iPhone
specific you can download the software
for both of the devices yeah as well as
Windows and it tracks everything how
you're sleeping how much you eat how
many calories you burned and you can
compete against your friends using an
online system which is really really
cool
so this experience is completely new for
a lot of people because I don't think
that many people actually are using
these type of fitness bands unless
you're really into the whole the fitness
thing and it's pretty cool how it can
track everything that you do
how much Chuck how many calories you
burn alright moving on we have the
walking dead I know you're you huge fans
Sunday oh this is really gonna be up
this after watch it if you didn't watch
it find the copy of it online it's
premiering again
go through another topic we have
chromecast is now getting shipped
worldwide yet so if you order it on
Amazon's web page right now amazon.com
it ships worldwide so basically they're
allowing people now to get the
chromecast dongle even if you're outside
of the states I'm gonna pick one up for
myself it's bugging me it takes any dumb
TV and turns it into a smart TV
so if you like Netflix and being able to
browse the internet with Chrome and what
now you're gonna be able to do it on
your TV from pretty much any device that
you own a tablet whether it's the iPad
or any type of Android tablet your
laptop your phone I mean this is a cool
device and it's only 35 bucks I mean
granted getting it shipped here to
Canada it's gonna be a lot more
expensive nut but it's for the value
it's pretty damn sweet so now it's
shipping worldwide so that's awesome
yeah yeah so the next thing on the list
guys is that we wanted to take a look at
some of the new cases that are gonna be
prototype they're coming out question is
gonna be launching the new 230 case what
do you think's so 2 13 budget gamer case
guys it's not let's like think that's
the 900 d it's not a monstrosity but
what do you think of the layout so the
layout I think well of course there's
not doing anything new here I mean it
looks very much like the 200 R series
may be slightly smaller more more
compact one thing though I don't see any
dust filter in the front it seems like
there's a mesh but you can clearly see
the fan behind it so there's no dust
filter in the front which is a huge
letdown unless the pictures that just
maybe not high detailed enough so that
you can see one but it seems pretty cool
in terms of the outside layering so you
can choose different colors it seems
like the actual panel you can have an
orange or the blue design so that's why
oh that's cool yeah and the window
itself is a kind of a cool looking arrow
style that's we have one they got LED
fans now - yeah so the problem here
though I mean the the case and the
construction is going to be for a budget
case right I mean you're not expecting
anything aluminum nothing of thick steel
so the case is probably gonna be very
not not extremely rigid so don't stand
on
don't stand there and don't use it as a
table but which you can do with nine
hundred Dean so huge yeah thing is
massive you can get inside the box and
scare people you can pretend you're cat
for the day yeah okay so that's
something but also another thing I want
to talk about the 230 is the pricing and
we're not sure about the pricing yet but
knowing course there and hopefully
they're not going to be very aggressive
not going to be very dominant in terms
of pricing but if it's anywhere between
the $50 range it would be a complete
knockout for a budget case it looks like
they offer everything that you would
need lots of space for GPU SSD cage
finally and overall the case looks fine
so if it's anywhere within the $50 range
it would be perfect if it's anywhere
more expensive than that it's just
coarser branding that's adding to the
value that you're buying into and that's
just my opinion that the cases in that
range
should be definitely around the field
I'm gonna caveat this and I want to make
sure like granted we are expecting this
to come in and around like 48 to let's
say 60 dollars let's put that that price
tag on that guys if the Corsair for
wrong we're wrong is what we're
estimating based on the pictures that
we're seeing here I hope that the build
quality is good because at that price
point you're not gonna be able to get
the best quality steel so I know of
course it does a really good job with
their design process and everything so
hopefully that everything's up to par
another case we wanted to take a look at
is the our vo5 from silverstone it's a
it's a currently prototype this looks
pretty cool it looks pretty cool I mean
Silverstone has you know the views that
whole fan in the bottom to drive air
upwards so there's that's where the
entire channel is flowing and the whole
flipped motherboard just yeah it works
and the cooling is a air cooling device
especially because Silverstone provides
these massive 200 millimeter fans or 180
mm their fans at the bottom that there
are complete powerhouses that the
amounts are powerful they deliver
and the airflow is not just regular air
for this very channel so it's basically
a column of heavy-duty airflow just
cause your components and goes straight
up the RP of five so I'm looking at the
pictures right now and it seems like the
top is very much open and I'm not sure
why that is it makes the case a lot
bigger than it actually is to support
for hardware I'm not sure if this was
intended to make your graphics card to
be as close to the fans as possible at
the bottom to provide the most optimal
airflow cooling solution
as you can see here there's just way too
much space left at the top right I mean
it looks like there's literally that
much space above the the framework and
it doesn't seem like you can install
anything in there I mean that would make
sense if like they have a back 120
millimeter fan there yeah for your
exhaust I mean that would make sense if
it was like cut out so you can maybe
have like an A or like an all-in-one one
example or so you could have it sitting
out the side of the case but that's
actually really interesting
I wonder guys Severson tell us why you
did this because that's a lot of wasted
space from our point I mean it looks
yeah the actual case looks incredible it
looks really tiny compact like you guys
have done before but it's pretty
interesting like the design and
everything I mean tell us guys what do
you think of this yeah the whole point
of this show us you know to get a lot of
engagement between you guys so any
topics that we just been discussing any
of the cases that we check out that and
we would like to hear your opinion on
these two cases what do you guys think
of them so the next thing that we have
on the list right now is there's a
report that came out a little while ago
about NVIDIA and steamer valve are
working together for the steam OS and
those steam boxes now this is a little
bit of a tip of the hat because the
steam box is basically running off of a
linux-based owe us this is some that
they've announced everybody in the
control looks pretty badass I don't know
if you guys are seeing it
can you feel have it looks so cool it's
apparently just from the look of it just
like the tactile like touch buttons for
like your your joysticks it looks sec I
can't wait to get my hands on
but it looks like because of that
because of the way the driver's-side is
set up I originally thought that AMD
would be the perfect partner for this
because of mantle and how the API is
gonna be set up so I think Nvidia kind
of tipped their hand a little bit when
they announced this that they'd be
working with valve because now that
they're saying that hey we're gonna have
GPUs in the demo units or in the beta
units that valve is gonna be sending out
yeah running with steam OS which is yeah
like I said before just like a really
basic basic Linux OS so they kind of
took their hand a little bit and it's
it's awesome to see this Nvidia do that
because at ps4 and Xbox one Xbox one
both use ABS are only in the console
worker yeah so with NVIDIA going towards
with this would steam OS it's uh it's a
good way for them to bring back some of
that market share and perhaps introduce
something very innovative that could be
used because with line makes you can do
a lot more with Xbox one and ps4 yeah
and videos not gonna be far behind guys
we're gonna have this technology from
Nvidia popping back up but almost as
soon as we started recording this
AMD pretty much came out and said hey
we're gonna be putting our cards in
these boxes - so maybe Nvidia might not
have as big as you know stranglehold on
this process as we thought but the
exciting news is that these boxes are
gonna be coming out both with AMD and
NVIDIA cards yeah so that's pretty damn
cool I'm very excited for the steam OS
to see exactly what it can do it'd be
cool for like if you have an HD PC or
something at home and you don't want to
be able to game and not be tied to a
specific console so I mean valve is done
like something really smart here and
they've entered into like a the big war
with the big three or the big two if you
want to consider Nintendo's being like a
little little third brother now which is
kind of sad but they've really thrown
their hat in the ring and that's pretty
exciting that they've partnered up with
- the biggest GPU core the two major GPU
companies that are on the record and so
well that concludes for basically all
the topics that we have covered today
that we prepared but the idea is that we
would like to have the show run on a
weekly basis answering your guys
questions and bringing you guys all the
latest tech news and doing a recap of
something that's
of all the things that we review on Hard
Knocks Channel and Haruka Knox comm
website so it's going to be a very
exciting show and like like we said
earlier we would like your suggestions
for the name of the show because if you
say it's something that has to do with
beaver we won't accept it no no that's
just it I know it's a anything but let's
not go there nothing with beavers but
think of something very interesting guys
I'm excited to see what you say we have
you can hit us both on Twitter so I
heard were Canucks and at Matt laugh -
you can see in the description of what
not mm-hmm well that wraps up our
first-ever tech show here at I reckon
ducks were very excited moving forward
because you know the industry is always
evolving there's always something really
cool to talk about fast it's like a
cheetah it's totally a cheetah the tech
industry is like a cheetah so we're
gonna have to try to keep up and guys um
thank you very much for checking out the
first video yeah and our community on
the YouTube channel and on the Hard
Knocks forums is growing so much that
you know this can be a very good way to
implement that growth and utilize that
growth to get more engagement with you
guys because I think that engagement and
all this interaction with the audience
is very beneficial
aside from bringing you guys informative
and critical reviews this would be a
very good way to bring informative and
critical news see whether there -
towards you guys towards this channel so
well done sir so again thank you so much
for watching and we'll see you in the
next episode awesome man oh wait okay we
got to keep that done yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
