NOx and in our search for some more
unique products at CES rather than yet
another boring RGB peripheral I think we
found something really perfect until did
not have many announcements at this
year's CES because Kaiba Lake their key
platform for 2017 had already launched
but there was still some interesting
things being shown one of those is this
little thing called the compute card
believe it or not hidden inside the
metal chassis is a full PC integrated
into this form factor that's not much
bigger than a few credit cards so let's
take a closer look right after this the
show coverage is possible thanks to
Nvidia gigabyte fantex and NCIX so the
compute Court has been designed in a
very different way than Intel's compute
stick but its intention is very much
similar much like the Intel stick
concept the compute card aims to
minimize the form factor of computers as
we know them to make implementation
within devices much simpler and less
costly in this case until took their
seventh generation ultra efficient six
walk cable ache vPro processor paired it
up with integrated memory modules and
other local components to create a
powerful yet fully integrated system the
five millimeter all metal chassis subs
in as an internal hint sync also but
this incredible thinness means adding
the compute card to everything from a
fridge to smart TVs to washing machines
to tiny all-in-one computers and set-top
boxes ensures the device remains as thin
as possible Intel's intent for the
compute card is to aid the acceleration
and acceptance of technology into
everything from household appliances and
connected devices basically it is meant
to make the integration of processing
power easier by offering a near-complete
system that can simply be inserted into
a compatible slot on virtually any
product all that's needed is a breakout
for various IO buses like sada for local
storage and PCIe for additional feature
connectivity if that's required so think
of it this as a cartridge type
plug-and-play module which manufacturers
can simply slide into their devices
provided the necessary connections are
in place it is also very easy to upgrade
those devices with the next generation
of compute cards since Intel intends for
this to become the standard format as
future iterations are introduced and one
of the most important features is the
nuke
third that runs alongside the standard
USB C port and Intel is opening up this
connector specifications to partners in
order to speed up the adoption and to
ensure that it does not become yet
another proprietary format that no one
uses and while calling the compute card
the complete system is not exactly
accurate since it needs a few additional
components to be functional partners are
already working on concepts which
incorporated now don't expect the
compute card to make its way directly
into your back pocket anytime soon but
it does give a tantalizing glimpse of
what the future will hold for a massive
number of lifestyle devices until was
also showing off their next generation
Knox at the show while they're not
upgrading the skull canyon system we
just reviewed the other less expensive
products are receiving the makeover with
the KB leg processors there will be
availability of i7 processors and iris
plus graphics on some with hdcp 2.2 and
HDMI 1.4 along with Thunderbolt 3.0 on
offerings with AI 5 and i7 processors
and cool thing pricing has not been
increased at all when compared to
skylake Knox visually not much has been
updated on the Knox but Intel did add a
new metal unibody frame move the power
buttons to the front and implemented a
new customizable LED halo on the Knox
front there will still be extremely thin
Knox but the slightly thicker ones will
have the dual two and a half inch SSD
brackets for compatibility with intel's
octane so there you have it a brand new
computing form factor from Intel and a
revision to the popular nock platform it
should be interesting to see what
happens with the rest of the year but
there is definitely some interesting
things happening at Intel thanks again
for watching and we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
