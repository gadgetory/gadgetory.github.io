and today we're taking a look at another
audio engine product we've recently
reviewed their d1 deck so go ahead and
make sure to check that out so these are
the a5 + stereo 2.0 arrangement
bookshelf slash desktop speakers we've
got the bamboo here that will set you
back around $450 but the white and the
black versions will slice the premium by
about fifty dollars now personally very
excited about these powerhouses to see
exactly how these speakers play out I've
heard very good praise and audio engine
look like they know what they're doing
the a5 Plus come very well packaged and
protected inside the box and take them
out they're a lot bigger than expected
if you plan to use these as desktop
speakers it is recommended they're at
least six feet apart for best sound
staging and imaging and at least six
inches away from the wall behind them
for proper bass response so take this
into account if they are placed inside
the bookshelf cabinet as well now these
can be placed on the sides where the
tweeters on the outside if you prefer
that type a setup and there's a quarter
of an inch threaded insert at the bottom
along with some padding for mounted ease
on speaker stands so the bamboo finish
from these is exceptional I didn't
notice any imperfections in the wood and
I really love the way these look while
some people say bamboo is not the best
word for acoustics this would be mainly
for aesthetics and these are not
marketed as reference monitors so there
is quite a bit of coloration going on
but we'll get that in a moment now the
whole point of having this 2.0 set up is
the ability to get powerful sound
without needing a subwoofer the large
five-inch Kevlar woofers are the reason
for the size of the speaker so you can
still experience that tight and powerful
bass 20 millimeter tweeters above are
not centered I personally don't mind
this look but you might but one thing
missing are the speaker grilles although
they wouldn't look as clean with some
type of protective front element the
right speaker is the active power that
has a built-in volume knob and can mute
the speaker by pressing it the LED on
the Left indicates the power and volume
adjustments and beside it is a remote
receiver as a very convenient
control is included that can put the
speakers to sleep mute and adjust volume
at the back of the active speaker we'll
get a whole bunch of inputs and outputs
that could make this quite a versatile
setup so first we have the
three-and-a-half millimeter input so
connecting you in computer sound card
your phone or really anything that you
have available there's a USB power
output to charge your mobile devices
then we have the RCA stereo input so you
can connect these to a dag and there's
also an RCA variable output with a
built-in preamp so you can connect a
subwoofer to the setup then we have the
output to the passive right speaker on
which there are a pair of RCA inputs
with binding connectors so just insert
the speaker wire and secure the ports
coming back to the left speaker there is
a power on/off switch voltage select
based on your region and that's already
pre-selected you can also change the
fuse in case you mess up your voltages
and finally there's the AC power Inlet
also notice the large external heatsink
that has been added to cool the speakers
when you continuously run them at
extreme volumes the heatsink does get
somewhat warm and it will prevent from
overheating that was a common issue on
the previous a5 speakers all the cables
are also included so you can get started
right out of the box and we tested these
through the d1 DAC using the RCA inputs
audio engine recommends a good 60 hour
break-in period before any critical
listening so we plug them in and let the
listening begin now like I said earlier
these are not reference monitors so the
a5 Plus wouldn't be ideal for music
creation but man are they really fun to
listen to the bass response due to the 5
inch woofers is really tight and
dominant these would be totally overkill
for casual listening but if you plan to
fill the room with powerful sounds for
parties and blast them out to watch some
movies you'll be completely satisfied
I think the looks are slightly
misleading is I was expecting clean and
controlled response instead of punchy
and fun the lows are too dominant
it's an overly warm sound with very
smooth high ends so you do lose out on
plenty of brilliance meaning guitar
picks that shoot sound crisp and natural
sound soft and distant the main range on
the a5 plus
moderately recessed but definitely open
up after about 40 hours or so of
listening I was initially disappointed
by the reserved vocals and was wondering
where instrument separation was but be
patient and you'd be pleasantly
surprised when the vocals move forward
and the clarity in the entire ment range
improves there's still way too bass
heavy for my personal taste so I
adjusted the EQ particularly on the high
end for additional sparkle to really
brighten up the sound one thing I was
very impressed was with stereo imaging
these do a fantastic job in creating
soundstage run in front of you but sound
Direction does change depending on
speaker angle and your proximity to them
if you're not satisfied with the sound
remember about the break-in period the
distance between and the angle of the
speakers and the distance from any walls
or surfaces behind the speaker once I
figured out the optimal arrangements for
my listening I didn't want to put my
headphones on and I had these blasted it
was a very pleasant way to experience my
audio although not the most accurate or
detailed sonic signature the a5 Plus
have quite a bit of coloration as I said
earlier but that is sort of an
expectation given these are not
reference monitors having said that
these are fun speakers and are intended
for party listening with an extremely
powerful sound and great imaging the
drivers have potential with excellent
deep bass response and smooth out
high-end the build quality is totally
outstanding and the multi color options
are always appreciated
what makes this even more attractive
though is the versatility due to
multiple inputs and outputs plus the
added heatsink to prevent overheating
and the volume knob on the speaker
itself for direct control of the volume
plus that small remote is included now
if you expect reference style tunnels
the a5 Plus cannot deliver with its
overly powerful bass and slightly
distant and muted mid-tones but don't be
afraid to add some sparkle in the EQ for
the extra detail but I guess we all have
our preferences at $400 for the white
and black versions and the $50 premium
for the bamboo I'd really say consider
whether or not you have enough space to
properly drive these as
speaker placement is crucial also if you
don't care whether or not you get
reference signature but want something
with energy and fun and lots of headroom
for bigger spaces then we certainly
recommend these damn good speakers now
what about you guys would you rather
spend the money on a pair of headphones
or if you're picky about natural sound
go with reference monitors let us know
