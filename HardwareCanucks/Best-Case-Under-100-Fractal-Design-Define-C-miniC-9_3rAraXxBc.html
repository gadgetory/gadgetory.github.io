Canucks I gotta tell you it's never a
dull moment here when it comes to cases
in the studio one day it's unboxing $900
encoders another is reviewing something
that has a dragon on it but you know
when it comes to fractal design you know
it's always a familiar experience which
is seen both in a good way and sort of a
bad way it's like where are they going
it's going to be exactly the same case
with a few minor modifications it looks
like they got the memo on the power
supply shroud but defined scene define
many see I'm more excited about the mini
C because it's a great progression on
where we see 2017 going with
introduction of micro ATX and closures
and really focusing on that aspect
something that's been really emitted
from the case industry so let's take a
look at these two cases right after
message from our sponsor who a master
master keys keyboard line-up is now
available and three sizes to fit within
your space with large medium and small
boards with either beautiful RGB or pure
white LED illumination a little
something for everyone make it yours
with the master keys Pro by Coulomb
after so really the iteration of the
defined series has always been so
familiar and so identical and you know
it's a really good way to keep the
consumer in line to their expectations
nothing's weird happening and just with
being a little bit of updates here and
there and the fine C is like a little
upgrade to this define act which was a
little upgrade the r5 series and the r4
before it and the r3 before it and you
get the idea
this is a time when the shop comes
around usually okay no I guess I'm fine
1 &amp;amp; 2
size-wise they're actually not that big
of a difference obviously the micro ATX
board is not not much larger from an ATX
board but still it's a little bit on the
define mini side much smaller still the
same elegant design so let's dive right
in
alright so the first thing I want to
cover is the price that is very
competitive for both cases and the
five-dollar premium for the windowed
model is reasonable I think what's
practical design has done is a brilliant
example of frame efficiency and
launching the defined C and together
with the ministy highlights an important
trend for 2017 the reason I praised this
new frame design is because they managed
to minimize the size as much as possible
while still catering to the current
builder you can say the frame is boring
it looks way too similar to previous
defined cases but it actually comes with
plenty of interior upgrades and makes
for one of the best building experiences
for its size so here is the defined fee
next to the F 340 and the H 440 and
notice how to define C is much shorter
compared to an already compact as 340
but interestingly you can see the case
feet on the defined C arm are shorter
and the frame itself is much lower to
the ground
that's creating this super compact frame
without losing the cooling potential so
I'll say the closest competitor to
define C would be the s3 for the elite
from NZXT perhaps on the elite version
because the tempered glass it's a bit
more expensive but I guess to be an only
a matter of time until we see something
with tempered glass from fractal design
the only company up to now that hasn't
released anything with TG in terms of
these two cases let us know if you want
to see like a direct head-to-head
comparison if you're on the fence
between picking these two up let me know
in the comments down below and I love
that the frame is practically identical
as the cases are the same width and
depth come with identical feet and that
staple brushed plastic front panel that
doesn't leave any handling marks and
both come with dual 120mm fans one for
intake and once for exhaust with the
same new power supply shroud that has a
slight angular position for the top to
create this unique separation and the
Phi P refined interior layout where the
butchering is embedded further into the
Shafi where the surrounding area
accommodates for easy cable measurements
plus an open frame around the pci
brackets to allow for a screw driver to
fit in no problem furthermore a full
bottom dust filter is easily removable
from the front that has a fine mesh with
an adequately deep side ventilation at
the front to let air through for intake
so the only difference here is the
height with the mini si having 5 PTI
brackets for micro ATX builds while the
define see is a standard 7 PCI slot
frame making it slightly taller but not
by much the thumb screws on both side
panels are captive that's awesome with
the dense layer of foam like material
applied to the front the top and the
rear side panels making them quite heavy
and feeling extra sturdy but I do
question their purpose and if they're
supposed to dampen any noise from the
system or just there for our perceived
benefit the front filter is easily
removable with the grilles angled down
that is meant to help with noise
isolation but the filter is especially
bulky something that I don't like that
will for sure prevent some airflow
intake but the included dynamic fans
supposed to deliver a good balance
between airflow air pressure and noise
performance which define C giving us
more fan options because of the taller
frame but the mini C does not lag behind
with excellent front cooling options for
its side top cooling options for such a
narrow frame are pretty good with
properly offset mounts away from the
motherboard with the top cover
pre-installed that is a single piece
unlike the multi modern systems we've
seen in the past that now includes a
full tub filter in case you're
installing any fans at the top thank you
for listening to our advice this is how
it should be done the i/o is there I
wish we had more years B ports but the
power button is super satisfying to
press take a listen with a knife and
being blue LED shining through the front
now this being practice first power
supply shroud they've done a fantastic
job first with the ventilation around
the PSU and the removable front plate to
expand your front air or water cooling
options it's super easy to remove and
simply slide the hard drive underneath
away from the front
to make room for radiators or fans
giving you up to 60 millimeters of
clearance until the frame and that does
limit your PSU clearance also to about
150 millimeters but the drive cage can
also be removed completely if needed
which has two metal drive caddies by the
way for HDD or SSD I really do
appreciate the efficiency of the rear
layout with an additional SSD bracket
with three drives that also has a
captive thumb screw and a very good
frame design for cable management that
route everything through the larger
spacing and the front thus eliminating
cable concentration in the middle and
these velcro cable hoops are the best
I've seen so far that have three points
of contact and allow these dual loops to
be created and let you separate small
versus large cables with ease and this
is by far the easiest case to work in
the regards to cable management in this
form factor because of that additional
spacing in the front of the enclosure
and how these rubber grommets are angled
with the frame so starting with the
build motherboard standoffs are not
installed but a handy tool is included
along with the middle extension to cache
the motherboard so with our 30 member
radiator and a set of fans installed at
the front not much clearance is left
between the 10 and a half inch GPU so
you'll be able to squeeze in 11 inch
card no problem but a push-pull is out
of question for such a tight interior
but I love the way the cables exit out
of the grommets that's a perfectly angle
for the motherboard but strangely there
are no additional cutouts on the shroud
for GPU cables something I feel would
have benefited the cleanliness of the
build
I also wish the radiator mounts would be
slightly more flexible to position it a
bit lower but that is the lowest span
location at the top just to create a
little bit more symmetry on the inside
or to allow for additional spacing or
clearance if the top fan slots are
occupied with a radiator but I do love
the shroud design and I'm sure many
define as owners would love something
modular that they can install to achieve
a similar layout and also to finish up a
cable management as I said earlier this
was the easiest built cleanup with many
cable to hoops and proper strategic
locations and that front section to help
guide those thick cables into the main
with fantastic velcro straps in the end
all the cables were flat so closing the
panel does not require any additional
force on the inside
I kept the top panel closed because the
case is not really high enough for
comfortable top rated or installation so
what you see here with that front a IO
would be I would say a more popular
approach and if your air cooling I would
stick to this horizontal air direction
without any top fan we do have a bit of
a surprise giveaways to follow the link
in the description below to get a chance
to win a brand new defined C or define
mini C so good luck and at $85.00 the
defined C is one of the best mate hours
on the market right now although it
still doesn't touch the extra features
found on the p400s spandex but it might
be a better option compared to the s3 40
for example so thanks to all the needed
upgrades we're giving up the harbor
Canucks damn good value award oh hey
there NC XCOM is Canada's leading a
tailor for anything your mind desires
just keep within those categories which
are plenty and get tempted by the weekly
deals visit mcx dot-com for all them
sweet deal ok I think it's so much for
watching this review define theme define
mini see I'm actually quite happy with
everything that they've done to improve
these enclosures the incremental
upgrades on the interior really add up
to make it competitive the only thing
that's missing is TG you know give us a
temporal acquisition so they stay
competitive with other competitive TG
additions from other brands but I'm
really curious to see if you know more
people gravitate towards the micro ATX
build because now this you know presence
of define mini C on the market so let us
know if this is something that people
are interested in I'm Dimitri with
Haruka Knox thank you so much for
watching we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
