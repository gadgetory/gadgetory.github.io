Android smartphone the essential phone
now some of you might argue against that
for certain reasons and I totally get
that but there's no denying the fact
that the company has pushed boundaries
when it comes to smartphone engineering
with their first device now don't get me
wrong there were a lot of issues with
the essential phone since launch but
gradual you know software updates have
addressed some of them but not all of
them and given how it's been through a
major price shift recently should you
still consider one in 2018 let's find
out but first a quick message from our
sponsor experienced every pixel with the
GeForce GTX 1080 Ti and enjoy these
awesome new games and full 4k resolution
at over 60 frames per second and get
destiny 2 for free for a limited time
full details in the description below
all right guys let's get something
straight the essential phone screams
minimalism all OERs design and I love it
the titanium construction throughout the
body practically means that it can
resist dents scratches and bending
unlike aluminum the result is a durable
smartphone that's also quite heavy to
hold in the hand now be mindful that the
rear side of the phone can pick up
grease and fingerprints easily so a skin
or case is highly recommended if you
need some more grip essential has also
made a few accessories that simply click
onto the phone via this proprietary
magnetic connector for instance there is
this 360 degree 4k camera module that
just snaps onto the device and the
connectors take charge of transferring
the data although be mindful that the
camera app tends to crash sometimes
after attaching module it only happens
like say once and three times when
you're using the module you'll also find
the fingerprint reader at the back
that's easier to reach but it takes a
few seconds to unlock the device it's
honestly not a huge deal but that's
something I noticed instantly coming
from the pixel 2 I also noticed that the
power and volume buttons were placed in
an odd location personally and much
rather have them flipped so power at the
top and volume at the bottom but that
could just be me the essential phone
doesn't come with a headphone jack but
they have included a type c 2u 3.5
millimeter the phone also doesn't
support wireless charging which makes
sense since it's pretty complex to pass
current
through the robusta titanium body but
essential is working on a dock that
would use the magnetic connectors to
charge the device I guess you could call
that Wireless but I don't know what are
your thoughts on that let's know in the
comments down below be mindful that the
phone doesn't come with any
water-resistant reading either so I
would take extra precaution when
handling a device especially outdoors
I'd want to get the specs of the
essential phone they are right on par
with what competitors offer so we've got
a snapdragon 835 cpu four gigs of ram
120 gigabytes of storage that
unfortunately cannot be expanded a 3000
milliamp hour battery 5.7 inch display
which is qHD and it runs Android 7.1.1
as it making this video now while the
price point might seem old compelling
for some users out there one great
example one great alternative to the
essential phone would be the 1 + 5 T
because it offers better specs than this
and of course it comes with a lot of
software related features which is
pretty awesome and you can check out our
full review right over here moving on to
the display it sports a 5.7 inch IPS LCD
panel sporting a qHD resolution with an
85% screen to body ratio and boy does it
look so good physically that is sure the
top notch with the front-facing cutout
could be a distracting element for some
users but I got used to it right away
at least it isn't as bad as the iPhone
10 that's for sure now given that this
is an IPS display viewing angles are
great there's a good contrast ratio I'll
be it not as good as AMOLED panels so if
you're someone who's looking for the
deepest blacks or if you just want
colors to pop you might not be that
pleased with the color rendition on the
essential phone
unfortunately the screen lacks
brightness output meaning even at max
setting it doesn't do just as using the
device outdoors here's an interesting
comparison to Google's offering the max
brightness setting on the essential
phone is roughly the medium setting on
the pixel - and that's kind of
disappointing you know one major concern
that I had with this device was the
terrible screen jitter or scroll lag if
you want to call it that way it was very
noticeable when scrolling through menus
and apps there's a good amount of black
which really killed the user experience
and that just didn't make any sense
given that the phone featured a
Snapdragon
835 flagship CPU now obviously doesn't
explain everything because it could be a
communication issue with the screen and
the software but honestly that's just
not acceptable for $500
I mean phones like the LG G 6 do much
better at that yet they cost less the
screen shooter also effects content
consumption just a bit especially when
you're watching fast-paced visuals again
this all comes down to software and
hardware optimization and essential has
yet to fix this major issue but they are
looking into addressing it with an
update very soon hopefully until then I
would stay away from this device
essential played it safe this time by
pre loading the phone with a cleaner
version of Android so for those of you
who prefer stock Android this should
feel like home there are no custom
launchers or any bloatware applications
installed which is highly appreciated
now with the type of making this video
the phone is running on android 7.1.1
nougat and awaiting the 8.0 or u update
and as mentioned earlier essential has
promised that they'll be addressing the
issues in that update and I actually
appreciate the fact that the company's
transparent about these problems and
that's all thanks to the AMA reddit
session that they have opened for their
customers it's a great way to interact
with a company and I'm hoping that
they'll continue to open these
discussions in the future do note that
you are getting a cleaner version of
Android meaning that there aren't any
unique features added to the device to
elevate the user experience for instance
you don't get this squeeze to activate
Google assistant feature that's found on
the pixel to which quite frankly I did
miss speak you're missing out if you
didn't catch our one plus 5t review make
sure you do so as dimitri spends a good
amount of time talking about the amazing
software features are built into that
device seriously it's far superior to
the essential phone especially since
they both cost the same and i'm kind of
disappointed then essential just took it
plain this time without adding any
productivity enhancing features within
the OS the battery life is respectable
on the essential phone it features a
3000 milliamp hour battery and it
charges via a USB type-c it doesn't
support Qualcomm quick charge protocol
but essential has included rapid
charging it's just not as quick as quick
charge that's something to keep in mind
I go roughly four to four and a half
hours of screen on time in some cases
only three and a half and that's under
heavy usage which involves content
consumption check
you know my social media accounts
emailing etc now screen Oh times aren't
the best way to describe battery life
because it all comes down to usage but
in my case it kind of makes sense
because I can compare the essential
phone to the pixel to that I've been
using before this guy so normal usage
would get me roughly four and a half to
five maybe even five and a half hours
let's get on time on the pixel too but
with the essential phone it's much lower
than that and that makes sense because
the CPU has a lot to process in terms of
you know the much higher resolution
display and of course optimizations they
play a huge role when it comes to
battery life so don't expect two day
battery life out of this guy just don't
and the last thing to discuss here is
the camera performance so there are two
thirteen megapixel sensors with an F 1.9
aperture one shoots color and the other
one shoots monochrome this was done to
capture more light in order to retain
the detail in the shadows and
theoretically
you know that would result in better
low-light photos but that's not the case
as you can see you lose quite a lot of
detail in those scenarios even with HDR
turned on as for brighter scenes two
camera captures good dynamic range but
the color seems a bit washed out and in
some cases the highlights are just blown
off essentials also included portrait
mode and it works really well outdoors
with proper lighting and exposure but
again it doesn't do just as in low-light
but I'd love to hear your thoughts on
the results down below now before I get
to the rest of the samples I need to
mention that the camera app experience
on the essential phone is absolutely the
worst not really sure who designed the
app but quite frankly this is not
something that I would expect on a smart
film that cost five hundred dollars as
you can see there are very limited
options when it comes to adjusting the
settings on the app you don't have the
option to add grid lines to help you
compose shots and that was kind of
disappointing most importantly you can't
toggle between different frame rates so
for instance you don't have the option
to shoot at 4k at 24 frames per second
or even 1080p at 24 frames per second
the only options you have is 4k and 2k
HD and 60 P which is disappointing I
wish they gave us more options to play
around with video resolutions and here's
worst part I normally shoot everything
in HDR and leave everything else in Auto
which is what I did with
the shots that you're about to see every
time when I go back to the app it
automatically disables HDR's so I'm not
sure why does that it resets back to HDR
turns on flash automatically so it feels
like the camera is fighting back with me
rather than me trying to adjust it the
way I like so overall pretty frustrating
experience with the app I'm sure you can
download third-party camera applications
and you know solve all these issues but
that's just something you'll have to
live with until they actually fix that
problem with an update hopefully all
right let's go back to the samples
so this is the video test on the
essential phone currently shooting in 4k
at 30 frames per second and as you can
see but there aren't any image
stabilization built inside so the video
is quite jerky wenyard
when you're walking so if you're
thinking of doing any fast or just
motion related stuff but you should
probably avoid this phone the dynamic
reach is pretty good I wouldn't say it's
the best but it's obviously not on par
with the 1 plus 5t because that phone
cost exactly the same and here's a point
yesterday autofocus it works pretty well
I mean but you can also test the detail
on the video it's again not the best as
I would say but ah man I'm pretty
disappointed with the video on the
essential phone to be honest so I guess
it's about time to conclude my thoughts
on the essential phone and guys I really
wanted to like this device when it
arrived here in the studio I was ready
to throw away my pixel 2 and switch to
this guy immediately which I did but
things like the scroll lag and just to
screen to the terrible performance on
the device plus the you know shorter
battery life of the camera performance
they're all kind of man the software
experience was also not the best given
how I was going through the screen
jitter issues I mentioned earlier it
just killed the experience I was not
really pleased by the performance of the
essential phone on the other hand the
design on the smartphone is absolutely
breathtaking it's seriously right on par
with the iPhone 10 if you were to ask me
but of course this is a smart phone and
they have a lot to work on they are
continually working on updates to fix
issues with this device and I'm hoping
that they will with the upcoming 8.0
update perhaps I'll make a follow-up
video with that update running and
about whether or not if it's actually
interest in all those issues but as of
right now I think you should completely
avoid the smartphone because I still
feel like the 1 + 5 t offers a lot of
features for its price when compared to
this guy because sure it's running a
stock cleaner version of Android but the
hardware and software optimizations
aren't quite to the level as I'd expect
it to be so yeah just just avoid the
essential phone well that's it for me
thank you so much for watching I'd love
to hear your thoughts on the essential
phone is it worth its price would you
actually consider this over the 1 + 5 t
and are you willing to take the
compromise that I mentioned above like
the lack of a headphone jack or the you
know the screen issues that I mentioned
earlier and of course what do you think
about the camera performance does it do
well in portrait mode and how do you see
that comparing against the pixel 2 and
the other smartphones or the rest of the
Flash's smartphones let us know in the
comments down below I new bar with
hardware connects thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
