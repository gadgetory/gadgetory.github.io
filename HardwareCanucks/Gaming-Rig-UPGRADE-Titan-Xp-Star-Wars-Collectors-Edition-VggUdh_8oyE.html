different with my ex $3.99 gaming slash
workstation PC I mean for one it's a
power horse I can handle pretty much
everything I throw at it and secondly
it's gorgeous the white and black color
scheme looks fantastic especially with
the lighting inside and right now it's
completely different but it initially it
was a wedding black themed piece and if
you're interested in the bill log you
can check it out right over here but now
that the new Star Wars movie is out and
a few days ago I just received a GPU
from Nvidia with Star Wars theme going
all over it I decided to do a little bit
of an upgrade on this PC it's gonna be a
quick one so I'll be swapping out the
ROG Strix gtx 980ti for this monster the
titan XP and i'll be changing the color
schemes to green in order to complement
two GPUs lighting speaking of lighting I
thought that the Jedi Order was supposed
to be blue instead of green I'm not
really sure when video went that route
but I'd love to hear your thoughts in
the comments down below on the lighting
anyways
let's take a closer look at this GPU
right after message from our sponsor get
ready for the holidays with mass drops
fast shipping of their gift collection
items they'll get to you before
Christmas like these emu Purple Heart
headphones with beautiful warm sound and
unique wooden purple housing that are
easy to drive with your phone and come
with a fair price to join a drop link
below so the technics peak collector's
edition comes in two flavors the
Galactic Empire and the Jedi Order both
of them are priced exactly the same at
1138 dollars that again is another
reference to the Star Wars franchise
they're also identical in terms of specs
you get 3840 cuda cores twelve gigabytes
of gddr5 X memory eleven point four
gigabits per second memory speed on a
384 bit bus and the boost clock of up to
15 82 megahertz but we'll get into
overclocking shortly the design of this
GPU is quite unique since most reference
based GPUs look alike at least on the
ten series of cards we've taken a look
at the aluminum shroud looks a lot like
a lightsaber and the blower cell fan is
laser etched and dual anodized with the
Jedi Order logo the LED lighting is
showcased on the side emulates the same
visual effect
lightsaber plasma blade and it looks
gorgeous guys you'll also notice that
this card comes with a backplate with
the official Star Wars logo featured on
it so if you're a huge fan of the Star
Wars franchise and if you're looking to
build a Star Wars themed game epc this
Titan XP would be a perfect fit for that
now to quickly go over the specs of this
x3 99 PC it features an overclocked 16
core 32 threaded 1950 X threader for CPU
at 4 gigahertz which is cooled by the
NZXT X 62 ail cooler 64 gigabytes of
g.skill stridency
RGB memory all sitting on an asus x 399
zenith motherboard i also hooked up to
samsung 960 pro nvme SSDs in raid 0 and
all of this is housed inside the Corsair
air 540 chassis as for the GPU I was
initially rocking at GTX 1080i Strix OC
but I think it's about time to change
things up a bit with this Titan XP so
without any further ado let's move on to
the upgrade process
all right now that the system is up and
running let's run some gaming benchmarks
and see what kind of performance improve
when we get over the gtx 980ti
but before again to that I wanted to
mention that I did manage to overclock
the Titan XP to 1923 megahertz encore
and twelve thousand four hundred
megahertz on memory let's start with
star wars battlefront 2 at 4k set to
ultra settings the Titan XP does take
the lead here but when all clocked it
performs a lot better than the 1080 Ti
Gears of War 4 shows similar results
with the Titan XP taking the lead once
again the overclocked card surpasses the
60 frames per second mark and just like
expected the rest of the titles favor
the Titan XV so if you're looking to get
some performance benefits in 4k at Ultra
settings in the highly demanding titles
this piece of a card won't disappoint I
also ran a seven minute vendor test
using Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2017 and the
results were not too surprising both
cards completed that task at the same
time and that makes sense since Adobe
still has an updated their software to
take full advantage of these higher-end
GPUs now if we were running 3d renders
using cinema 4d we could potentially see
a major difference and I do intend to
investigate that in another video so
stay tuned for that well there you guys
have it d and video GTX Titan XP
collector's edition in the Jedi Order
flavor now I'd love to hear your
thoughts in the comments regarding the
aesthetics of the GPU what do you guys
think about it would it complement a
Star Wars themed gaming PC I have a few
more steps to do with this extranet and
build so for why not change the
enclosure to make it more stealth so I
might go with a dark matte black finish
with tempered glass and of course I have
to get RGB fans to complement the green
lighting inside there are a lot more
things to have planned for this build
because I'm still sort of building this
out I'm not sure if I want to do a
custom water loop down the road
I haven't even water-cooled a whole
system ever before so that could be an
interesting experience in the future so
yeah stay tuned for that
I'm here with hurricane X thank you so
much for watching make sure to subscribe
