past couple of years with every personal
manufacturer and their dog coming out
with their own flavor of mechanical
switch Razer has been at the forefront
of this movement with their own green
and their orange switches there's only
so many ways to make a mechanical switch
unique though and the cost is all
prohibitive to many especially for
premium RGB boards that's where hybrid
membrane keyboards come into play we've
already checked out two on this channel
the Cougar 450k and the CM Devastator -
you can check out the reviews down below
and now racing has done there's a little
bit differently creating a low profile
quickie switch which is available on
there or not a keyboard we'll take a
look at how it's done after this message
from our sponsor the new NZXT air RGB
fans can be daisy chained together for
awesome lighting cohesion in your build
with vibrant and accurate color
illumination all easily controlled
through the hue plus via camp software
for details in the description below so
what are we looking at with the O nada
well it's a full sized board which
retails for $99 and it comes with chroma
RGB lighting or for $79 with the regular
backlighting that's a price tag which
brings it into the realm of true
mechanical keyboards the design on the
anatra is simple a hard plastic frame
gives a solid if not particularly
exceptional build and the top is
occupied almost entirely with the keys
there's no separate media controls here
the condensed footprint certainly has
some benefits but certain people will
miss the chance to play with the extra
macro buttons that some extra large
keyboards feature the bottom has two
rubber feet as well as a cutout for
routing the thin but very manageable
braided cable back on the top we have a
very nice addition a wrist rest but it's
not just a cheap plastic wrist rest like
some of the companies include Razer has
stepped it up with a plush faux leather
finish it's also magnetic so removing it
is easy it's more comfortable and just
straight-up better than the competition
Razer is really showing how it's done
from an economic standpoint this wrist
rest is almost perfect although I would
have liked
to slow down a little more at the end
but what of the keyboard the key caps
for the first contact you'll have when
typing and they're a little different
than most razors went for a mid height
key cap creating this strange in-between
not as low as Chiclets but higher than
regular key cap size
this has the advantage of sleeker looks
and a unique feel which will be familiar
to those coming from chiclet keyboards
the font choice is nice and the key caps
feel quite good but what's really
interesting is the switch sitting
underneath in essence it's a membrane
switch even though Razer calls it a
Mecca membrane the key principle is
still the key cap hitting the rubber
membrane service to actuate but it has a
couple of tricks to imitate a mechanical
switch the first is the travel distance
it's not as satisfying as a mechanical
switch but it's further than the
membrane one's reaching a satisfying
middle ground Razer has also implemented
a mechanism to fake the actuation of a
physical switch and it audibly clicks
when getting closer to bottoming out and
the faking works the key presses on the
anartha feel different when compared to
most other mix switches but it feels
good it's quick to type on thanks to
that shorter travel distance and the
fast actuation and the clicky response
is satisfying if a bit loud give it a
listen now
in game these are a very solid switch
thanks to their fast actuation the short
travel distance and the lights which
allow for quick responses and even
though keyboards make very little
difference to end game performance
you'll still find this quite nice for
gaming so are these worse than
mechanical switches it's really up to
your preference I think of these less of
a poor man's mechanical and more another
switch variant for your preference it's
not for everyone
but they're very good in their own right
as usual when it comes to talking about
any peripheral I would really suggest
you try these switches before spending
any money on a keyboard like the anata
personal buying is an intensely personal
choice and you should always have a
frame of reference before spending
almost $100 on a keyboard mouse or even
a headset your NASA is also accompanied
by Razer synapse software suite which is
always very good unsurprisingly you've
got profile and macro support as well as
the option to set up custom key binds as
well as a dedicated game mode disabling
the windows key as well as alt f4 and
alt tab optionally the cool part of
Razer software is the stats sections
when synapse opens it will record your
keystrokes in-game and give some cool
stats as well as a heat map of the
keyboard so you can see which keys you
press most it's not a whole lot of
practical application but it's a nice
feature to have the last point of
contention is the chroma lighting for
another $20 it is a decent price premium
but you do get some nice RGB lighting
for it the white back plate on the
anartha creates this vibrant glow which
looks great and it's one of my favorite
lit keyboards I've seen raises software
as powerful as ever allowing for some
solid customizations and effects they
also have Chrome or apps allowing for
third party game integration so that you
can have specific in-game reactions of
the lighting in the end it's up to you
if the RGB lighting is worth $20 so
conclusions the razor or Nauta is
something different and that's a good
thing the low profile key caps and the
interesting switchers combined with
great lighting and a solid design create
a compelling keyboard and the best in
its class wrist rest is a nice touch
it's still not cheap at $99 for the
chroma variants but if the switches are
your thing it's a solid offering so
