you by fantex nvidia corsair and CI x
silverstone and in win make sure to

great content to you
hey guys we are checking out the new
case from be quiet this is the silent
base 600 now they've done many
modifications to the exterior first
minimizing the total frame size compared
to the bigger brother the silent base
800 and now we'll see all the usual
color options like orange accents grey
accents and the standard black the side
panel window is now made of scratch
resistant material we'll have to do our
own testing with a nail scratch test
when we get the case in-house but now
also the panel is a double layered with
an air gap in between that's supposed to
reduce total noise output from the case
it's an excellent attempt to allow users
to still showcase their systems while
adding a little extra sound insulation
to the window the front panel swivels to
open that has noise dampening material
applied and inside is a three speed fan
controller built in nicely and easily
accessible and a dust filter that's
removable from the top just like that no
need to tilt the case or anything I love
this dust filter installation the top
panel is still fairly closed off but the
venting holes are now have been moved
closer to the center and it's actually
advisable to use the top spots of either
120 or 140 million fans for intake as
otherwise I'm worried the air will just
rebound back into the case on the inside
I love the accented rubber grommets that
reflect on the exterior color there's
only one drive gauge included with a
sound bass 600 for three three and a
half inch drives and a single SSD on top
of the cage that is a bit limiting for
today's standards however looking at the
back we find dual SSD brackets to bring
total as the mounts to three inside the
silent basis 600 unfortunately cable tie
points in the back are still limited
this was one of the main complaints that
we had with the sound base 800 and
they're really hope that be quiet fixes
that for the final release and with this
case be quiet has shown us that
improvements are possible like the new
double layered window and the front
filter mount but to be honest I was
expecting something extra as I still
think the front frame is pretty
restrictive and having non modular five
and a quarter inch drive cage is behind
the times for a 2015 release
now having said that I love the new
smaller form factor and the reference
system they built inside look really
good with excellent cable management so
stay tuned until September when the case
launches at the hundred fifteen dollars
for the windowed model and we'll make
sure to pass this through proper
hurricane axe treatment</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
