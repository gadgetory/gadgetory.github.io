wired / wireless gaming headset and
it'll set you back around 200 George
Washington's which is a lot of money and
I'm sure it'll raise a lot of eyebrows
because we're all familiar with the
cloud family and how good they are
especially we've got the cloud flights
that Cloud alpha is a cloud stinger these
are all great headsets that are pressed
appropriately for the features they
offer now when I looked at the price of
the cloud mix it really got my head
scratching up for a bit because the only
additional improvement that I see with
this headset is the implementation of
Bluetooth technology and that's pretty
much it so how is this particular
headset gonna stand out against his
competitors we'll find out right after
this hello I'm looking for some fans
well are you married yeah I have a ring
what is your favorite number I would say
3 do I have the perfect fan for you this
is the new thermal tech ring trio 12
fans with good static pressure for
radiators it is a beautiful frame with
double side and center ring illumination
with soft and super brights bill with
razor chrome and compatibility control
it through your smartphone the RGB plus
software on the PC or Amazon Alexa well
I'm gonna take these home perhaps you
should to check them out in the
description below ok so there's
something I just want to get off my
shoulders
there is a particular reason why we
decided to delay the review for the
cloud mix and the reason for that is
when we were briefed on it back in
October of last year HyperX told us that
customers would only be able to purchase
the cloud mix exclusively at Best Buy in
the United States and to us that just
didn't seem like a feasible choice to
make a dedicated video on so we decided
to wait until this headset was available
worldwide and it is right now so we'll
make sure to leave links in the
description down below if you're
interested and it actually does help it
does give us a little bit of a kick back
in exported channel so thank you very
much any
back to the review and honestly guys
it's really not that different from the
other cloud headsets from the outside at
least you see it still maintains the
same frame structure with the signature
leatherette memory foam ear cups I do
appreciate the stealth look on the mix
because it features a few matte black
elements however the HyperX logo does
seem to stand out quite a bit so maybe
next time they could implement a tone on
tone finish and minimize the size of the
logo as well that'd be much appreciated
now as I mentioned earlier the build
quality remains the same
just like the Alpha headset it's very
flexible and rigid no signs of creaking
as well and that should be expected for
$200 the headband is not self adjustable
and that's my personal preference the
adjustable sliders are well defined and
intact and the clamping force is also
very minimal and I didn't experience any
fatigue wearing this for longer periods
of time just like previous cloud
headsets so that's a good thing and I do
note that the ear cups can't rotate 90
degrees so it might be a little bit of a
challenge resting these around your neck
especially when you plan on traveling
with them the signature memory foam on
the ear cuffs feature plenty of cushion
and they're super comfortable to wear
although keep in mind that if you live
in warmer environments the leatherette
material could start to accumulate sweat
so you may have to vent your ears often
the ear cups do provide a good seal
around your ears though and it does a
fairly good job isolating background
noise now when it comes to versatility
HyperX
takes the crown here once again and I
think I keep repeating myself every time
I review one of their headsets the
included braided cables are detachable
and that's obvious given that these are
wireless as well the same story goes
with the boom microphone the braiding on
the cable is certainly unique compared
to other handsets in the market they're
not too thick and they're very flexible
which makes it less prone to kink
formation and that's awesome
however reverberations exhibited by the
cable is certainly audible especially
when you're you know sort of gaming on
it for longer piece of time we can
certainly pick this up especially the
microphone because it's a very sensitive
microphone you can actually start
picking up the reverberations as it's
you know sort of going through your
fabric material or whatever you're
wearing so that's definitely something
to keep note of the main 3.5 to 3.5
millimeter cable is 1.3 meters in length
and that's perfect if you paired this up
with your smartphone provided that it
has a headphone jack can't believe
that's the thing I'm saying in 2019 but
that is what it is now you can all
find a controller within the cable to
adjust a volume and mute the microphone
there's also a 2 meter extension cable
that splits in two separate headphone
and microphone inputs and this can be
used to route it comfortably behind your
PC and you also get a carrying bag
nice touch alright so let's move on to
the wireless aspect of the clock mix and
this is certainly something that you'll
need to pay close attention to you see
HyperX does market the mix as a wired
gaming headset with bluetooth technology
and that's really the key difference
here compared to other cloud headsets
now don't confuse yourself thinking that
you can pair this headset pair your PC
via a 2.4 Gertz receiver because that's
not the case here it's just via
bluetooth and I believe that they using
the Bluetooth 4.2 protocol and honestly
for 200 dollars that's disappointing
now hear me out for a second this is the
cloud flight by HyperX it's a wireless
gaming headset it pairs with your PC or
pairs your PC via this USB receiver and
you know you can also be used in Wired
mode via a 3.5 mm interconnect here so
it's very flexible and right now it's on
sale as well so that's really cool but
when you compared to something like the
cloud mix there honestly isn't a huge
difference at least to me personally I
don't feel like you're getting all that
much for $200 not to mention this
headset can only pair with a single
device and listen some of you may think
that it's not a deal-breaker to include
a wireless receiver but what really
concerns me the most is the price tag
you see I would been completely fine if
the cloud Mex was priced between 140 to
160 dollars because now you'd have two
headsets competing within the same price
range that offers different wireless
modes that better suit the customers or
their particular needs or their use case
scenarios
alright so enough of me ranting let's
move on now in terms of Bluetooth
functionality HyperX has not skimmed on
the basics so you do get your standard
volume up and down buttons that sync
with your mobile or system volume levels
enabling bluetooth or powering on a
headset can be done by holding down the
power button for two seconds the same
goes for turning it off and if you want
to pair it with that device simply hold
it down for five seconds when powering
it up there's an LED indicator right
above to show the status there's also a
multi-function button that acts as your
play pause and picking up a phone call
or skip tracks by just double pressing
on it now HyperX claims that the
life lasts for about 20 hours and I was
comfortably able to hit that by pairing
it with my smartphone and setting the
volume to about 50% you can recharge the
headset via this microUSB port although
I would have wished if it was typed see
now as I mentioned earlier the boom
microphone is detachable and it
basically features the same hardware as
the ones found on the cloud alpha so
you're not getting a significant
improvement in terms of microphone
quality compared to that headset which
is also really funny because that costs
around $100 so there's that now my voice
sounds very clear it's not too nasally
very natural there's very minimal
background compression taking place so
it doesn't really affect the vocals I'm
typing on a mechanical keyboard these
are the romaji switches and it does a
fairly good job isolating the background
noise but there's something that I
really wanted guys to pay close
attention to and that's the
reverberations that the braided cable
exhibits check this out you can
certainly hear it I'm sure you'll pick
it up because that's definitely
something that I noticed when I was
doing my testing so if you're wearing
like hoodies or something like that with
zippers on them
just be careful that's all I got to say
all right so what do you listen to right
now is the built-in onboard microphone
on the cloud mix and this works
obviously via bluetooth just keep in
mind that if you connect the boom
microphone it doesn't actually work that
way because this only works via a wired
mode when connected to your PC so
certainly keep that in mind now this is
an omnidirectional microphone so it does
fake you know fairly a lot of background
noise but it actually sounds fairly good
for a Bluetooth headset I'm actually
surprised by the quality of the onboard
microphone and it should be adequate
enough for you know taking phone calls
or all that kind of stuff and now let's
wrap things up with how this sounds and
to be honest I really have nothing
terrible to say about it because the
drivers are built exactly as the cloud
Alpha's with the dual chamber design that
separates the highest Ament and the base
the soundstage is surprisingly wider
than I expected it to be and for a
closed back design that's actually
pretty awesome and given that it now
comes with the high res audio
certification it covers a wider
frequency range so you can pick up the
slightest details within a sound track
the vocals are well defined however I
will mention that just like the Alpha's
the bass response on the mix isn't too
powerful and
that could be a deal-breaker for some of
you out there but personally I really
enjoyed listening to music and watching
a few shows on the cloud mix now gaming
on it was a whole lot of fun guys I
spent a couple of days playing apex
legends which is a huge thing now and
overwatch and I have to admit I did take
away some productivity time but it was
so worth it though the gunshots feel boo
me when you're blowing stuff up the
explosions really do sound awesome even
though the bass response is minimal the
widest soundstage really does add up to
it and you can hear the slightest
details especially when you're
navigating through the gameplay you can
hear certain directional cues and oh no
you just it's just an awesome experience
just you know playing with the HyperX
cloud mix I certainly loved it it
certainly wasn't a significant
improvement over the cloud Alpha's so if
you're coming from the cloud Alpha's I
don't think you're gonna be noticing a
huge difference upgrading to the cloud
mix so I guess it's time to wrap up this
review guys the cloud mix by HyperX is a
good headset I mean it sounds amazing
it's built really well it's very
comfortable and I like the design too
but it's the price that I just can't
digest because for $200 I'm sure you can
expect a lot more I mean I would have
preferred if they included at least a
USB receiver so that it can seamlessly
transition between your PC to your
mobile device and of course if you want
to connect it in Wired mode to your
console it just completes that
versatility and that's just a missed
opportunity for HyperX now sure you can
pair this up via bluetooth to your
desktop PC that's totally not a it's not
a question it's possible I'm just bummed
about the price guys and I really want
to know your thoughts about that in the
comments down below what do you think
about it did HyperX go way too far in
terms of pushing the envelope for
pricing a headset especially a gaming
headset that features bluetooth
especially at that price point I'm Eva
