connects wish list segment today we're
taking a look at the corsair h50
all-in-one water cooling solution let me
see what this is meant for is people who
want the benefits of a traditional water
cooling system whether it's the lower
temperatures or the quieter system and
they either aren't familiar with how to
assemble a water-cooling system or they
don't want to have to go through the
hassle in the increased cost of doing so
it rings in between 75 to 100 dollar so
it's meant to compete more with the
higher end of the air cooling solutions
and I wouldn't say it's meant for
serious overclockers so we're going to
open it up check it out assemble it in
our system and see what kind of
improvements we can get all right so
we're going to do the obligatory
unboxing here up at the top we have the
paperwork with a giant stop sign which
is advertising for the Corsair RMA
service and their help support their
tech support we also have the
instructions for AMD mounting 4am to an
am3 sockets and then intel socket 775
1156 and 1366 and then we have the Quick
Start Guide here which there's not a
whole lot to it it's basically just a
rundown of how to install it also then
we have the unit itself now what does
cool is this unit is a cpu block and a
pump all in one that makes it really
simple it's just two piece operation
which will notice here is there is a
copper base and it already has the
thermal grease on it what we have here
is the radiator which is like I said
it's very simple you have the radiator
here you have your it's about a foot
long worth of tubing and then you have
the block / / pump up at the top now
it's all powered by a cpu fan header the
traditional 3 pin style instead of a
molex connector also in the packaging we
have our fans screws we also have all
the mounting hardware here for all of
your different socket types so that is
what is included very simple packaging
now let's find out how tough it is to
actually install as for the instructions
we attach the plastic back plate which
is much easier if you have a case with a
rear cut out and then the metal
retaining ring gets screwed in
the cpu socket so after getting the
bracket installed the next step is to
figure out exactly where we're going to
put the radiator actually this is
something you probably should have
figured out before you even buy the unit
but the best part is usually going to be
over the rear 120 millimeter exhaust fan
which most cases do have now of course
they're actually recommends that you
install the fan as an intake fan so
you'll have their logo pointing towards
the radiator and because the screws are
only this long that is why you can't
install a larger fan than the one
they've provided because it goes right
through the case straight through the
fan and into the radiator without
damaging any of the fins
as you can see the process of installing
the radiator isn't all that difficult
it's just a matter of making sure that
you properly line up the screws and you
don't damage any fins on the radiator
make sure it's secured tight and from
there the next step is to install the
pump and water block so in order to
actually install the block the clip
should be a little loose and what it
actually uses is a sort of a teeth style
system and you just going to make sure
that the teeth match up with the holes
in the block and then you take your
screwdriver and you secure it all down
and that's all there is to it
so for our stress test we're using
prime95 eight iterations because it's
four cores eight threads for the CPU
we're using the core i7 920 CPU which
runs natively at 2.66 gigahertz and then
we're going to be overclocking it to
three point three gigahertz which isn't
terribly stressful but it's a modest
overclock without getting too aggressive
now at stock speeds the temperatures
with stock cooling just the regular
couva it comes with the CPU is just
sitting under 60 degrees on most of the
cores so it is a little high under full
load but it's nothing unexpected so
we're going to change it up overclock it
a bit and let's see what we get
so out of three point three gigahertz
overclock we're sitting at a high of
about a little over 70 degrees there
which isn't all that bad with stock
cooler however we're going to throw in
the corsair water cooler will test it
out at stock speeds and then overclock
it as well and see what kind of benefits
we can get
so even just with the stock clogs we
managed to drop our temperatures by
about 10 degrees hopefully that will
carry over when we overclock it will see
just as much if not more of an
improvement
and this is where water cooling really
shines overclocked a three point three
gigahertz you can see that it's hovering
right around 55 degrees and we've hit
highs of just under 60 degrees that's 10
to 15 degrees cooler than with our stock
cooling all right so that wraps up our
look at the corsair h50 water cooling
system now I realize there's a lot more
we could have done with this like
comparing cooler to popular air coolers
or other systems etc but you know what I
think that's best left to a full review
and analysis rather than sort of this
short video overview nevertheless the
h50 really seems to pull its weight for
the relatively low cost and ridiculously
easy setup you really do get a lot of
value out of it and it's a great first
step for somebody who's looking to dive
into the world of water cooling and
that's it guys don't forget to subscribe
