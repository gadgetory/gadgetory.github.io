two-time case of the Year winner fantex
the always incredible Corsair and NCIX
visiting rocket at CES highlighted just
at how much gamers want that full RGB
support the latest ryos TK l FX keyboard
along with the full keyboard the ryos FX
now features MX cherry RGB switches they
are sticking to the cherry switch for
now as they trust the quality and as
with many other RGB releases on the
market the lighting SDK will be fully
open to developers for game integration
and the fact they've recently pardoned
up with Alienware shows promising
roadmap for those with rocket
peripherals they've also announced the
rocket cave xtd true 5.1 surround sound
gaming headset that's based on their
previous design but with a few
improvements the headset is surprisingly
comfortable with deep leather cushions
with angled drivers inside for best
sound direction and make sure your ears
don't make contact with the internals
the microphone portion is illuminated so
the headset needs to be connected via a
USB port along with analog jacks for the
full 5.1 surround sound so the USB is
there just to power up some elements on
the headset but the sound must be
channeled through a proper sound card
there's an inline sound control that
sits on this desk clamp that is awesome
so it doesn't dangle on your side or
slide around the desk you can mute the
microphone adjust the volume per channel
and switch between game and movie modes
and last thing they showcased was the
rocket nith this is a gaming mouse where
the right side of the body is modular
and allows users to interchange between
a more narrow form or slightly wider for
additional support both shapes a suit me
wow I'm leaning more towards the narrow
form for easier pick up but the
modularity doesn't stop there all the
buttons on the left side can be moved
around you can populate only those that
are in use and therefore configured the
Nith both to your style of game and the
shape of your hand and the RGB lighting
is of course attractive with the main
illuminated logo at the back and one
small strip at the bottom just like the
tie on make sure you're subscribed to be
notified when our full of use of all of
these come out and don't forget to check
out the rest of
our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
