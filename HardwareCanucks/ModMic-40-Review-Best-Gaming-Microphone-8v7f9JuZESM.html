that simplistic Scandinavian appeal with
easy to work in internals great airflow
and storage potential and comes in both
the windowed or plain side panels for
your preference hello everyone this is
Dimitri with Herick knucks and today
we're going to review an external
microphone solution to turn your
favorite pair of headphones into an
all-in-one solution for Team chatter
Skype calls and anything else that you
will need for communications so this is
the mod mic 4.0 from antlion and $50
boom mic with a mute option and $43 for
the mute list revision so their slogan
is keep your heads phone at a mic and
then we'll totally agree with their
strategy as gaming headsets usually
don't sound that great or if they do
microphone quality or the form is just
not the best like son Heiser game series
sound excellent and they're extremely
comfortable but that gigantic boom
microphone means stationary used only
and they're not as appealing to be
honest now while they do exist proper
solutions within gaming realm like
retractable microphones on steel series
headsets and removable options from
Kingston and funk there always seems to
be a compromise in the actual sound
quality of the microphone so the mod mic
4.0 comes in a protective case and this
means transporting the mic without fear
of damage is highly appreciated inside
we find a couple of adhesive mounts that
will be attached to the headphones
little instructions manual preparation
wipes and the microphone itself the $50
version has an inline mute switch that
is very convenient as a feature but I'm
glad they're also selling the mute list
option to save you some money as most
games do have the push-to-talk mechanism
the mounting process is very simple we
have the adhesive base to attach to the
headphone but you first want to get a
sense of the best distance of the mic
from your mouth and only then apply the
adhesive base once that's done you have
yourself a headset when you need one and
your standard headphone when you don't
need a mic plus the magnetic adhesive
base is not
intrusive or all in any way and it's
also quite stealthy the joints allow you
to put the mic in the upright position
with this jaw like clamp and the
magnetics are strong enough to hold the
mic in place even when some intensive
head movement you'll be fine but still
allow for seamless repositioning when
you need to put it in the upright
position the microphone is about 16
centimeters in length the entire boom
pole is flexible yet it feels sturdy and
after installing the base on my HD 650
slide the off center it was a perfect
fit and distance for the mic to pick up
my voice clearly without being hit by my
breathing now you do still have some
flexibility for microphone orientation
by unscrewing the bit on the magnet and
you can either pull back or extend the
location of the boom mic the wind form
does help to eliminate direct air
contact but it's not the best and poor
placement of the microphone to really
make you sound poppy and annoying as it
picks up all the air during conversation
the cable is plenty long as three point
three meters it's bundled up with the
velcro strap that's very nice to see it
is then as well as a connects through a
low-profile 3.5 millimeter jack and the
biggest critique here would be how to
manage the actual cable I'd love to see
some type of hooks so you can attach the
cable to your headphone cable as
otherwise there is no system in place
for her cable management now I'd like to
mention that microphone quality is of
course dependent on the input source so
this entire voiceover has been recorded
with the zoom h4n as this is what it
sounds like from my laptop with too much
white noise as you can hear when I stop
speaking there's just way too much noise
in the background
take a listen also here is a sample
using the mic input on my camera it's
plugged in directly into my Canon 5d
Mark - so you just get a variable
examples of where you might use the mod
mic and how it sounds on these different
sources now I personally think it sounds
better than majority of microphones
included on gaming headsets and that's
why this external solution may work in
favor too
prove your vocal quality when on
teamspeak Skype calls or any other
platform for communications the build
quality is fine the magnetic base is a
low profile and there's plenty of
flexibility for mounting and
repositioning plus the built-in mute
switch is appreciated although it does
cost extra
and the only thing that's not well
thought out is actually the lack of
cable management as otherwise it's an
attractive and an affordable microphone
solution for basically any headphone and
we're giving it the hard road Canucks
damn good award but what do you guys
think of the mod mic 4.0 does it sound
acceptable for the $50 price tag or
would you prefer some type of an on desk
solution for your communication needs
