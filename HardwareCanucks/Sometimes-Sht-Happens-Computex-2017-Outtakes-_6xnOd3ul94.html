messed up
I wasn't that flow man I just are you
still rolling
it's probably going to be bloopers or
something but and today we are checking
out something very exciting in the
notebook Department now I know a lot of
hype there's a lot of hype regarding the
new was not even called Cypress ciphers
right so let us know if a 35 inch 200
Hertz UHD HDR everything like that
actually not UHD high 34 40 by 40 is 40
let me redo that in calculation again
okay so them so the main hurdle with
approaching this from a DIY project is
that it's rarely no dammit so hard now
we normally don't talk about VR because
I would say as a from a market
perspective the condition is vanilla
just get it we've got a warm-up
we were
trying to think of how it starts to know
it
so it's like I mean I find those really
interesting finding a micro SD X form
factor with desktop-class components is
quite interesting as well and all right
my friends this is the cube case the new
direction for their micro ATX cases that
try to be affordable and trying to be
super cool
I doubt this is you know good for
consumers anyway but how about you wait
until the thing that's the rotate so you
can see what it does
alright guys so that dates for the p300
let us know what you think of it here is
actually for scale and also for a little
bit of a weird contrast being Santa's
fans X's fan texes position so thank you
guys serve in it and another thing that
we see here is and another thing that we
saw here are these halos fan RGB fan
frames they are NSA fan too early so
that's why as Rock is working with
silvers and I just unplugged the cable
which is removable by the way so that
kind of fits in with the conversation
let me plug that in back and also be
offered in red switches I meant to say
the white body both black I might just
one second I have a hair somewhere oh my
god I can see it it's not okay we you
probably can't see we do it with your
screen okay yeah can we get hey Liam you
know it's my move
alright so so for size reference I am
Here I am 511 and that's feet or 180
centimeters for the European audience
you know what I mean but
I love you but I know what else is
saying
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
