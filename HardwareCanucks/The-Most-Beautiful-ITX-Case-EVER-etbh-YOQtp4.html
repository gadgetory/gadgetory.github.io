by an enclosure usually at Computex we
see plenty that resemble each other and
they borrow from each other but there is
one company that we've been involved
with in the past that have fantastic
unique enclosures that are also modern
this is streak um db4 huge thanks to our
Computex sponsors for sending us out
here
shout out to nvidia fantex and CI x and
msi so db4 is aluminum it's unique it's
fanless and it's this fantastic looking
cube case this is the definition in my
opinion of a modern case and I've worked
with nothing like this in the past
totally fantastic can't wait to get this
on my hands in the studio the aluminum
panels here are slightly heated they're
pressurized with a ton machine and
formed into this proper shape then
there's the SNC refinement with venting
holes placed in its proper position etc
then this panels are polished
sandblasted and anodized so that it
hardens the surface and because as we
know it aluminum or aluminium is a soft
metal so this being a fan li's designed
each side panel can accommodate for 65
watts of heat dissipation the aluminum
is thick on these side panels a heavy
and you can connect the CPU block to
potentially two side panels for more
heat dissipation about 110 watts so that
if you have a more overclock or slightly
hotter CPU that's a possibility when it
comes to the CPU block streak um
approach this with compatibility in mind
so all ITX boards are supported as the
CPU block comes with a copper heat plate
underneath that is in free form then we
have this aluminum sort of base that is
connected with the heat pipes and then
that has a little bit of a momentum it
can angle the heat pipes that will then
connect to the actual aluminum panel the
thermal paste here still undecided
thermal paste would be mainly kind of a
messy so thermal pads are more
preferable a very unique solution for a
family's design especially since that
CPU block looks pretty sweet for
hardware support GPUs up to 200
millimeters are supported of course this
being a fan less case your choice of a
GPU
may vary depending on what type of use
this will be more slide most likely an
HTTP C type a solution that looks
absolutely gorgeous for your you know
for your desk for your space if you want
to put populate an ITX card in there
be my guest however the power supply
compatibility here is proprietary so
street comes 240 watt power supply is
inserted at the bottom and that is also
fameless
apparently that they've been working
really hard to create that power supply
which also supports right beside their
in that chamber drives three and a half
and two and a half inch for concluding
remarks the DBA for in my opinion from
what we've seen in Computex so far is a
totally refreshing take on the computer
enclosure that's not just taking it from
RGB perspective and tempered glass and
all these current market trends that you
know case manufacturers are starting to
catch on catch on so street comb is
definitely unique market niche but look
at how fantastic this enclosure looks
for an HTP see of course there are some
compromises in there but that is to be
expected when the closure is so
different from anything else that we've
seen on the market I'm Dimitri with our
conducts thanks so much for watching
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
