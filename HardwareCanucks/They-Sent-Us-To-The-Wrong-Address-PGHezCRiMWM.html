day yet again today we're gonna have
some lunch with me and Lee have some
meetings and finish off the day with
another dinner with NZXT but you excited
magic sack are you really excited a
little bit of a dilemma yeah we are at
the wrong place we are we're at the
wrong place but they sent us to the
wrong place yeah and really appreciate
our sponsors thanks to fantex and
SteelSeries for making Computex possible
so now we're at the right place this is
the actual Mitsui let's go in and eat at
the right place this time this place is
so fancy
ibrahim was it it was amazing let's go
to our next meeting we get a little VIP
private ride nearly whoo we made it we
made it the gigabyte well it is not
creepy at all here everything is dark
and quiet and silent so I have finished
with all my people but Eber here still
going no one more shot oh really
so concentrated Ibrahim as do you love
Horus I love hard we had to do it yeah
we had to so we can use the washroom
come on take a bike I can hear them
meeting together in the bathroom
you guys are paid in there who just got
to a Maasai we earned the subscriber our
uber driver was awesome
because I go what's your channel let's
google it and yeah I saw him click it I
saw him click it and so we were here for
about an hour and a half shooting all
the bureau for the motherboards but now
we have to head out to Taipei 101 for
dinner and from what we're told it's
gonna take about half an hour due to
traffic to get there what are you doing
I don't think it will work man
so the one thing that we start to do now
before leaving the place is actually
taking photos for the thumbnails and for
social media so that's what the boys are
doing now sounds like someone's getting
frustrated even why are you frustrated
because the pixel camera is not working
dude no my pixel three can do anything
there's a pixel to every phone this is
the guy that does our smartphone reviews
I know
say hello to every smartphone Bieber how
they spell and oob new youtuber walk the
quick girl oh my god I so dark already
how long have you been in here this way
you cannot pass by here not knowing this
is Emma sigh we got the Dragons we got
the glowing logos we got this cool
pathway with cool lighting and hopefully
our ubers right outside the Guard
Station has
oh yeah the guard station has it all
right let's get in back at the Apple
Store my iPhone is ready to be picked up
I'm much excited hopefully they fixed it
we found we found an uber clone but a
positive update from the Apple Store
they fix the camera so uh what's a yes
oh sweet are you fans are you like okay
so you actually recognize it come over
here it's time for your makeup and hair
all right
so good people we just got back to the
hotel it is it is almost midnight but
you know how it goes we are setting up
for another video shoot editing working
writing away so this is our current on
camp set up we have this really clever
way of setting up this was a table it's
true but this middle section is from the
table which we use to expand the table
for more work area and then
Eber had cleverly positioned over here
so it's right below the camera facing
into so we get excellent audio until we
forget to start recording the audio
which happened this morning that's
exactly what you are going to be very
whiny of that okay just don't just don't
I just I don't want to think about that
I just hope that this thing actually
works we're gonna show us leave that but
it does look like a highlighter though
that's a whole you guys alright you
ready to record but I hope you guys
enjoy our content and we'll enjoy all
the future publishes and Ebro good luck
with the re-recording of this video yeah
and yeah the students for more subscribe
and all that stuff and talk to you guys
in the next one yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
