NCIX for our CES coverage what's up guys
Dmitry here with Haruka Knox at CES 2017
and at the show HP and build a number of
new notebooks on once and also an
absolutely stunning curved gaming
monitor that you have to see to believe
let's start with the monitor because it
is what jumped out at us right away this
is the omen X it is one of HP's first
forays into high-end gaming displace and
it hits all the right points it has a 35
inch 34 40 by 1440 ultra-wide 21 by 9
a-m VA panel that clocks at the hundred
Hertz features a not-so-subtle curve of
1800 R and boasts 4 millisecond great
great response time when overdrive is
used more importantly it comes with
Nvidia g-sync module 4 stutter free
gaming as you can see HP spared no
expense when designing the omen X it's
black frame is extremely subtle due to
the tiny bezels even though there's an
ambient light strip which allows for a
uniform backlight glow around the back
there is a DisplayPort 1.2 connector
which supports g-sync a standard HDMI
1.4 input and finally three USB 3 ports
the panel is also fully height
adjustable it will be available in March
at the round $1,300 so it's quite
expensive but it is clearly competing
with the Acer X 34 so stay tuned for our
full review next up is the EliteBook X
360 a convertible tablet / notebook with
a 360 degree flip mechanism that's
supposed to target on-the-go
professionals and I'm saying supposed to
here because I've talked to a very few
professionals who actually want to use
one of these flip books nonetheless HP
would not be launching the X 360 if
there wasn't market for it so what
they've included here is actually pretty
interesting it has a thin milled
aluminum unibody frame and diamond-cut
accents not to mention it passes 12
military durability tests whatever that
means speaking of that flip mechanism it
can be put into five different modes so
laptop tablet media conference and tenth
each of which has its own use for
business types powering all this is a
selection of cable IQ series low wattage
processors 16 gigabytes of ddr4 system
memory and your choice of SSD from 128
gigabytes to 360 gigabytes of
MDOT two PCIe nvme storage but despite
these specs HP expects it to last for up
to 16 hours on battery life which is
pretty impressive but one interesting
addition here is HP's Shoreview
technology which activates an integrated
privacy screen within the display so
people around you cannot see what you're
working on it's pretty brilliant and
what you see on a screen right now is
the example of that and the last thing I
want to focus on is this guy the HP
sprout pro sprout is a hilarious name by
the way which looks like Microsoft's new
surface at first glance but there's a
lot more going on here the sprout is
built for creative professionals and its
features highlight just that atop the
21.3 1080p touch screen there is an
advanced 3d scanner this allows you to
rotate an object below it and it will
automatically scan that item in three
dimensions to HP's integrated 3d
scanning software it's pretty awesome
there's also a flat surface mat in the
place of a traditional keyboard this is
called the touch mat it's two point two
millimeters thick and is designed with a
20-point capacitive surface that lets
you to work near four hands at once it
can also be enhanced with HP's active
pen capability and can even be used for
scanning documents by placing them
simply on the mat with up to a3 or
tablet size paper of course you can also
plug in a standard keyboard and use the
touch mat as pure collaboration device
and so that wraps up our visit to HP is
there anything here that interests you
is either someone looking for a monitor
or maybe a professional device let us
know in the comments down below stay
tuned for more CES coverage and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
