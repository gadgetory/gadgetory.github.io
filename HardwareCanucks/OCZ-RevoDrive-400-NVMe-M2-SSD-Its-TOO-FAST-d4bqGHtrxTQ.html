possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex and NCIX ever since OCC has been
acquired by Toshiba the company's future
is looking better than ever especially
with the Shiva's background in flash you
guys going to be super excited about the
new River Drive 400 from OCC
this is their first nvme M that to SSD
and this is important because so far
MDOT to SSDs have been restricted to
satis beats and now the reward drive 400
has four lanes of PCI e 3.0 bandwidth
over the m de 2 connector and comes with
that optional mother port adapter so far
your options for nvme drives has been
the Intel 750 SSD or the Samsung 950 Pro
so it's really good to have these type
of competitive options the Reaver drive
400 was born thanks to the Sheba's next
gen 15 nanometer flash and it has been
an action for their enterprise solutions
on the sheba side and we're very happy
to see this make its way for the
consumer product speed wise you're
looking at 2600 megabytes per second for
sequential reads and 1600 megabytes per
second for writes and crazy I ops
performance for maintain consistent
speeds as well capacities will be
available in up to one terabyte and
these drives will be available in the
first quarter of this year and one more
cool item we got to see a Mishima was
world's first 256 gigabyte TLC 3d Land
48 layer wafer this is really cool
because of technical challenges toshiba
has to face creating these but they come
with better power efficiency improve
durability and faster and NAND
programming and the fact that these are
in production may hint at eventual
integration into the consumer division
of the Shiba aka
OCC</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
