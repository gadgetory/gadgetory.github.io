course the motherboard lineup for the
x99 platform has to receive an upgrade
so here at gigabyte booth here's all the
little upgrades for their x 99 and z 170
lineup of motherboards huge thanks to
our computech sponsors for sending us
out here shoutout to nvidia phanteks and
cix and msi one of the board says i'm
most excited about is the x 99 designee
r designer this is the the new line of
their which is going to be sort of
following the ultra durable space so the
x 99 will feature a full display port in
so that means that you can rear out the
GPU from your GPU discrete graphics card
into back into the motherboard and out
after the Thunderbolt three-point no
port so for content creators if you have
a thunderbolt three compatible monitor
you can route that directly through the
motherboard which is fantastic they've
also increase the spacing between the
first and the second pci slots so very
compatible with their new extreme GTX
1080s graphics cards which is two and a
half slots so you can run to a sli
without restricting compatibility
between the two PCI slots and on topic
of SLI there is now a plx chip that's
built in so it will allow the first and
second slot to run at full x16
three-point no speed without needing the
most high-end processor so even with the
lower end with basically any chip that
is supported by the motherboard you'll
still run both PCI slots at full speed
there are dual YouTube ports which is
awesome for nvme SSDs and lastly for
physical upgrades they've added full RGB
lighting so it has this underglow
underneath the dims underneath the pci
brackets underneath the heat sinks and
it was going to be full RGB supports so
you can customize not only the look of
let's say the logo and the audio little
strip but pretty much everything on the
motherboard which I actually really
appreciate so you don't need to get like
LED RAM and all these things the
motherboard can be like the cohesive hub
for all the lighting inside your
components or for your components inside
your PC the z1 70 lineup has received
similar physical upgrades so there are
now metal shielding on the PCI the dims
the M de two slots and also added the
ambient lighting throughout the board
very cool stuff and unlike on the x 99
motherboard this one the Z 170 has
received a mini DisplayPort in so you
can re-route again the graphics output
back into the motherboard and back into
the Thunderbolt three-point know so you
can read route that signal into a
thunderbolt monitor and now let's talk
about the gtx 1080 extreme gaming here
my favorite bits so first they shorten
the card the boards in the past have
been too long people are complaining the
shroud size was just way too large so
now they've have this patented stack fan
design where the fans overlap have
smaller blades and one smaller fan in
the middle fan which is pretty cool and
this will allow us basically more
airflow without increasing on this
shroud size because of this the fans are
slightly thicker and the card is
two-and-a-half slots therefore we talked
about the x99 having that extra spacing
between the first and the second slot
there you go gigabytes thinking about
their GPU on their motherboards
compatibility it's not an issue so
design wise it will have full RGB
there's this giant X along the shroud in
my opinion the logo there is a little
bit too large but it's gigabyte you got
to show it off and there's this new
backlight with a new logo and we have
dual hdmi in the back so you can pass
through for VR applications and also for
Thunderbolt pass through and lastly here
gigabyte we're gonna check out the arrow
14 which is a 14 inch size notebook it
has quite a bit of power into it great
battery life and quite of
customizability customers a customer
okay so design wise i really like what
they would gigabyte has done there it's
slim it's light at one point nine kilos
and we have this new nano print
technology on the lid with the orange
black and green color accents with the
carbon fiber little texture they're
pretty cool while for this 14-inch form
factor the specifications are pretty
impressive so we have a 970 m or a 965
em the gtx graphics em the two pcie SSD
it is 1.9 kilos up to 32 gigabytes of
memory and after 10 hours battery life
in productivity mode the display here is
pretty cool it's 3k and IPS you know
these specifications really definitely
lead into that productivity and
payment creative field so I'm really
happy to see this being available and
the keyboard now is also improved the
travel time is one point seven
millimeters instead of the average of
1.1 millimeters so that's nice it tried
it very tactile travel distance is quite
far and you have no idea how much stuff
matters on a very thin body like this to
make sure that your typing experience is
enjoyable and the inclusion we've seen
some pretty amazing stuff here gigabyte
especially the mods the red and white
mod here was absolutely incredible water
cooled and all the things in the back
there were all the cable management and
all the water cooling stuff was built
into one acrylic piece which was so
fantastic to see and fits in with that
red and white color scheme of that x99
motherboard but let us know what you
think about all the things that we
covered here today I'm going to meet you
how are Canucks thanks much for watching
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
