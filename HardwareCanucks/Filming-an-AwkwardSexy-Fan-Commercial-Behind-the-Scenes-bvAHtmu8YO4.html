what's up guys welcome to another behind
the scenes i am ibrahim would be finally
in this episode is going to be showing
you guys how we shoot some of the
pre-rolls the pre-roll the whole process
of a pre-roll involves quite a bit of
planning quite a bit of discussion with
the advertiser in terms of what they
want us to do and also obviously adding
our own element to the whole equation
and so today we're shooting the pre
roles for the fractal design fans both
140 and 120 ventre venturi fans which
are while i guess i don't know what to
say about the fans but we are doing the
same similar spin on to our as to our
previous mural where it would define s
where we did the whole and sexy spin so
there's going to be an awkward episode
because it's gonna be quite a bit of
sexualized 33 ended and you were here is
help here to help me film it so let me
show you what we have so far give you a
bit of rundown on the idea for the whole
pre-roll and how we came up with it so
the whole idea is to actually be a funny
sequence or funny pre-roll for fractal
and we did come up with some ideas with
Josh of course you know it's all
scripted it's all done so we're just in
the preparation of you know clip being
the fan setup and we're just about to
test the pants and it should be fun I'm
really expecting something funny out of
it as well but at the same time and
wanted to make it more creative from the
other of the competition so usually fun
we have 4 120 millimeters set up and
what we're trying to do is create this
contraption that will pull my hair in
the sequence of the actual pre-roll in
order to power all these fans obviously
we don't want to you know create a new
system that would these fans will be
connected to but it's a simple
contraption of having a single molex
cable believe it or not powering the
whole thing I was worried that there
might not be enough power but we jump
our jumped a power supply you know using
the black and green paper clip
method work beautifully so let's so as
you can see they're working right now
just did a little test run before
actually creating or before piecing them
all together but they are working and
we're ready to somehow generate these
for fans so that looks awesome for video
alright so we just finished this one
shot we're setting up for about 15
minutes I was really close to the camera
we're doing a macro shot of my eye where
there's a water drop dropping from my
eye lid to indicate how hot and sweaty
the scene is for this mural turned out
beautiful so this is kind of what I was
trying to demonstrate so I have my light
and I wasn't really shining it into my
face because it kept over exposes me but
angle it in a certain way that it gives
the side of the shot a bit of purple
hinge and you can actually see that on
the Sony rx100 so that is what you'll
see in the final shot of the fractal
design venturi for you all so now Bieber
the first shot is done let's do the rest
date all right we just finished our
second shot in my hallway here and you
can see Bieber hiding behind over there
he we set up the camera on the floor
with a slider and what that allowed us
to do is get a quick slow motion shot
with motion of the slider as I moved
into the into the shower maybe dynamic
than cool quickly set up with two lights
one firing from the bathroom and one
just a softbox just over here to be very
give us a very dramatic lighting effect
than a little bit extra things in
post-production to give the whole
pre-roll very creative look next on to
the next Rodriguez yeah yeah let's do it
do it things we do for the bureau guys
just to give you a little preface of
what we're doing right now we're
preparing for the soap shot so right now
so then I'm gonna slice it back down put
some salt on my hair so that we can get
this shot you own all right ebert what's
up he's good all right guys we just
found my shot and now it's so funny this
is what I look like so quite a bit of a
folk following my hair combing his hair
but that's the whole idea men getting a
shot harbor connect style this is what
we do so yeah all right we did the final
shoot this is the setup for the
jerry-rigged triple fan it worked out
great no problems with it so far and the
single molex connector actually was able
to power all these fans on just
perfectly fine and there's so much air
for coming out of these fans that we
almost ended up not using a blow dryer
all right so it is the morning after we
shot the pre-roll I think it went
extremely successful we finish the whole
thing in just about four hours and I
think reviewing the shots later on
really liking what I saw so now I just
have to fill in a couple of more b-roll
things and let me show you what i'm
doing here behind me okay so this is the
setup i have the gh4 with olympus 12 to
40 millimeters just because i need to
stop down my aperture and the sigma does
not go all the way to f 20 which is this
camera setup currently it's on the same
level as the fan and i positioned a
couple of faculty sign boxes behind
there because i didn't want to leave the
background fully just white or empty I
needed some context as to why this fan
is in the front obviously because there
are more fan options for consumers to
choose from so the shot here is all
about highlighting this object in the
front and i'm using my handy-dandy light
that i manually rotate within the scene
so that
can get really cool shadows and cool
light play as i like to call it so right
now i'm shooting at f 20 which means the
everything in turn the camera is super
super dark and i'm shooting at two
hundredth of a second which means the
shutter speed is really fast and i'm
shooting at 60p which means i will be
slowing it down to get that slow motion
effect and that's why the shutter speed
is alright but look what happens when I
move this fan and move the slide above
the fan it will only highlight certain
objects of the fan like blades and maybe
the background I can do you know I can
maybe start off something like this and
then move it down and keep the the light
away from the lens so doesn't actually
enter the shot but I know where that is
so I'm very careful and just I start
recording and I do this multiple times
within the exact same shot so I don't
have to go back and cut everything and
then in Premiere just choose the
lighting movement that I like the most
out of the whole thing and that would be
it this shot here very simple camera in
the front fan and literally just one
light and that concludes the behind the
scenes of us shooting the fractal design
pre-roll it was a really fun shoot it
was a little bit awkward than some
moments when I had to basically shower
and get my hair wet and get the soap in
there but one thing that we realized to
do is get the shop set up before knowing
what that's going to look like and then
I went in and we actually did the hair
but hey man clean here now don't have to
shower so why don't we enjoyed this
