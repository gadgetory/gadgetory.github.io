great technology selection and service
AMD's r9 nano officially launched on
august 27th where we saw the initial
slide deck with aspects the card design
an hour at the time speculation of how
the Nana will perform against competing
cards and all of that can be found in
our r9 nano explained video linked in
the description or in the eye here
I'm a tree tree with hard rock nuts and
the r9 nano officially launched today
for retail we have all the gaming
performance or the acoustics power
consumption frequencies and everything
will be ready for you in this video make
sure to stick around this can't be a
good one
now to quickly recap what the Nano is
trying to achieve is become the ultimate
4k compact ITX GPU for the living room
simply because it's so tiny at six
inches or 15 centimeters with a great
cooling solution yet feature a fully
enabled Fiji XT core the same that is
found on the fury ax with 4 gigabytes of
HP M but with a 100 watt TDP reduction
than the flagship and this is done
through picking only the most efficient
course and thus introduced a challenge
in its own for availability and
overclocking that we'll talk a bit later
priced at $649 the r9 nano is a niche
card for several reasons first you can
look at what competing cards you can get
for the same amount of money like the
really appealing fury X or the 980ti
second if you're really after the ITX
form factor most newly-released
small form-factor enclosures support 10
half-inch GPUs that could void the
compact appeal of the nano take the SG
13 from Silverstone for example this is
a perfect I TX chassis for the Nano that
leaves plenty of space inside for a
front mounted radiator as the car does
not even extend past the motherboard
itself and you could say that this case
is actually too big for the Nano on the
flip side of that coin the SD 13 has no
issues accommodating for 980 or a 980 TI
first I suspect that most potential
owners of the Nano will take a really
narrow case on purpose to accommodate
for that short form factor as put the
nano inside the full tower and an ATX
motherboard and to me this looks
completely out of place and while looks
aren't really everything the r9 nano is
an ITX card designed for ITX habitat
only in my opinion but be aware of the
fact that aside from triple DisplayPort
1.2 the HDMI port is only one point four
which makes 4k gaming in the living room
not as appealing at 30 Hertz as most UHD
TVs still are not equipped with
DisplayPort now for the price I was
expecting AMD to focus a bit more on the
shroud design especially considering how
much thought and emphasis went into the
cooller designed for the fury acts so
the Radeon text on both sides is not
illuminated it's just vibrant red and
gets kind of lost in the dark plus we
have no backplate leaving the dart PCB
exposed which i think is on purpose as
most ITX cases will have the GPU
standing like so and the backplate you
could say is not really necessary it is
impressive tall at what AMD can achieve
with such a tiny yet effective cooler
and a single 90mm fan keeping the car
during load at 74 degrees Celsius which
is a fantastic temperature for tight
enclosures although the VRMs check out
these thermal shots here gets super hot
and we advise to set up the best
possible air flow to get rid of all that
heat away from the PCB now there's a
constant balancing act with monitoring
core frequencies to hit the power and
temperature targets with a nano hovering
around 900 megahertz which was our exact
expectation
having said that our sample experienced
some terrible coil whine bumping the
nano into being one of the loudest cards
in our stack this is not the fans fault
per se as it is library quiet as Amy
calls it but the coil whine is
definitely part of the equation
take a listen
to power the nano you'd need a single a
pin that plugs into the bag and thus
extends the length of the GPU by at
least an inch keep that in mind
however check out that power consumption
the r9 nano turns out to be an
incredibly efficient GPU when compared
against the fury ax we are happy to see
this and the bidding process seems to
have made a significant impact on
separating the Nano against all other
GPUs and with that out of the way let's
check out the benchmarks
now obviously from a fewer raw
performance perspective the r9 nano
isn't at the top of the charts but given
its place in a completely different
category for ITX the Nano is a
powerhouse of its own beating the 1980
and 390x easy as for overclocking
Headroom we were not expecting much from
the Nano and were pleasantly surprised
when the core pushed all the way to 1070
megahertz
stable bring the performance right below
the fury X so where does this leave us
with the Nano it's obviously not a
perfect GPU with two major downsides
being acoustics and the lack of hdmi 2.0
whereas power efficiency stable core
frequencies and form factor are all
major selling points and for prospective
buyers it really becomes a balancing act
whether or not you value the ITX length
of the card over loud operation and
whether or not your priorities lie with
the size and not within choosing to go
similarly priced but outperforming
solution but having said that this is an
absolute step in the right direction and
we're giving it the harbor Canucks damn
innovative award and so now that you've
seen all the numbers would you recommend
the r9 nano to a friend who is
potentially building an ITX system for
the living room and if not how would you
set up the perfect ITX gaming machine
