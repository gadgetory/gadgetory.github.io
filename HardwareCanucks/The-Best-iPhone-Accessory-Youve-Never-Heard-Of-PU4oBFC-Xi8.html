lot of pictures on my trips on a daily
basis for Instagram Twitter and whatever
but now I started doing a lot more video
just capturing things for my smartphone
just so that you know my memories are
not just still pixels
and it's a really good thing to reflect
back in the year from now to see what I
was doing at the time and just reflect
and enjoy those memories once again but
now we can enjoy those memories with
actual 3d audio so you can hear exactly
what was captured at a time not just
through excellent quality video but
through actual 3d surround audio as well
all in this consumer son Heiser can be
your headset in my most recent trip to
Vancouver I took the ambient with me and
I captured my audio experience
throughout the journey so you guys can
hear what I was listening to so enjoy
the Graham spectrum keyboard by Tesoro
comes with a new mechanical agile switch
with low profile key caps with super
fast response and shorter actuation
distance plus all the customization
included with RGB lighting and macros
for a premium user now be the time to
put on headphones if you have any for
the best audio experience for this video
advance
of course if you have any that's good
let's go to Vancouver
always got to hit a park before a trip
like the general have Java Airport
announcer them
ladies and gentlemen we will soon be
arriving at Vancouver Airport well
so the summarizer ambu a headset man
what a cool product the headset of
course makes sense because it's both a
headphone and the microphone on the
outside not used for your conventional
ways for why the microphone would be on
the headset in the first place but a
really cool implementation to record 3d
audio now because the Ambu is locked
down to Apple devices only because of
that lightning port it does suit that
it's white it's low-profile and nice
over ear design makes them comfortable
to wear so despite them having this like
main functionality of being able to
record things while you are you know out
and about and doing whatever you can
also use them as a headphone and they
are a nice quality being from San Heiser
the white body here I think is a little
bit too bulky of course it has its
functionality with being able to turn on
and off the AM Bo microphone surround
sound recording and there's the red LED
that indicates that it is on we have the
plus or minus buttons for volume of your
music tracks plus a multi-function
button in the center and at the very
bottom we have the ability to adjust
what you hear in the headset so it's
like audio pass-through so you can hear
what is being recorded and so based on
that initial sequence you guys watched
what do you think of the quality of that
3d spatial awareness of you know what I
was experiencing did it feel like you
were in the space with me not in the
visual perspective but in the atmosphere
in the audio side of things and how does
it sound to you so this is what it
sounds like with the am Bo
okay that's an airplane not ponder okay
so I'm taking them off let's see what it
sounds like
just with the iPhone
you decide so it's definitely a unique
product but I feel the market for it is
very small if there's any so you know is
this something that you guys potentially
buy to go on your trips on your vacation
to do family videos so you can record
not just video but that you know spatial
presence that you normally will never be
able to capture otherwise now a few
quirks that I have with it despite
having a built in wind filter it still
picks up way too much noise in like a
very slight windy situation you know you
have to be in the very calmest quiet and
non windy environment for this to be
recording your environment properly
interpret the software there's none I
use the default camera app here and they
also downloaded the filmic Pro app that
gives me full control in the video side
of things for exposure and choosing the
highest quality audio codec but you know
they give you the hardware and you
choose your own software in terms of the
audio quality itself I think the 3d
spatial recognition between left and
right channels is very good especially
if doing things like you know kind of
snapping things or rotating your head
and the very noisy environment so that
you can get that spatial sort of motion
in the audio sphere and that's really
cool
in terms of recognizing smaller details
like bird singing and the very quiet
environment it doesn't like boost the
gain so that's awesome and so aside from
being at a very noisy environment or
very windy environment thus Anheuser
AM Bo delivers in every regard
I also appreciate the fact that we can
hear what we are recording with the
adjustments on the control center here
and that means that you don't have to be
sort of stuck in your own world of
headphones and trying to record
something you can actually be hearing
everything that's going on around you
and be present in that moment as well
and I'll just be constantly capturing
videos and also just remember when
reviewing the footage that you've
captured with the Sun hyzer Ambu headset
- also where as some sort of headphone
in order to experience that true-to-life
3d audio immersion otherwise you know if
there's no headphones in here then it
doesn't sound that great in terms of
giving you that immersion that this
thing tries to deliver now I wouldn't
say I bring this thing everywhere with
me but it does stay in my backpack so
whenever I travel and there's like a lot
of going on in the audio department I
take them out I do a little video clip
and it's a very pleasant experience
having to you know reviewing the footage
and reliving the audio and the visuals
exactly what I was there and that's
something that you think you might enjoy
then the Sun has your AM Bo might be for
you always stay charged with linky power
up power banks Houston gorgeous aluminum
enclosure with dual USB and type-c port
with support for quick charge 3.0 to get
two devices recharged fast available up
to twenty thousand one hundred million
power capacities check them out in the
description below and so that is my
experience with the sanitizer AM Bo
being able to re-watch and to real issen
to some of the clips that I shot while
on my way to Vancouver it's just really
cool being able to almost being
physically present in that point in time
again because that really good audio
spatial recognition so yeah that's the
sign Heiser am your headset thanks for
watch for watching let me know what you
think of the audio clips that are shown

we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
