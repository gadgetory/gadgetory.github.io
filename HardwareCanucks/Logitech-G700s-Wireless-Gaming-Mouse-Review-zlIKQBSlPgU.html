great technology selection and service
hey guys this is Dimitri and welcome
back to another hardware let's review
so Logitech is going through a bit of
rebranding and reintroduction with their
gaming peripherals literally pouring
science behind these upgrades so we're
taking a look at the new Logitech G 700
s a gaming wireless mouse that there's
not only loaded with features but also
has an excellent economic design for
your hand now released at $99 this is
slightly more expensive than its
predecessor given we have a faster
sensor and a new coating on the body but
still is very competitive compared to
other high-end wireless mice so right
off the bat the G 700 s house is an 8200
dpi sensor which for regular use isn't
overkill but for multiple
high-resolution displays it might come
in handy
we tested sensor tracking on many
different surfaces and we are pleased to
report we have smooth tracking without
any hiccups now this is a wireless mouse
powered with a single double-a battery
and like with the original it can be
connected through USB port for charging
so if you want the G 700 s can also be a
wired mouse now we do get this tiny USB
nano receiver which actually can support
up to six different wireless Logitech
products and communication between the
mouse and your computer is rated at a
thousand Hertz so in theory there should
be no lag issues and throughout our
testing we're happy to report the mouse
performed pretty flawlessly I compared
the G 700 s with my wired gaming mouse
and then notice any difference in
response time which is good news for
gamers one thing to keep in mind though
is the mouse is front heavy with no
weight customization which I found a bit
too heavy for my liking and $400.00 this
is a letdown
however when plugged in you don't need
the battery installed so removing that
for a slightly lighter feel is an option
but the ergonomics are top-notch for a
comfortable grip the sides are textured
which helps to secure a mouse in your
hand while the top is coated with this
new surface that prevents your palm from
sticking to the body which has a rather
plastic feel regardless of how much
science went into it and I will have
much rather preferred a rubberized
surface
now the
button layout works really well here
aside from your regular left-right and
the scroll wheel we get a range of
programmable buttons that can be
utilized in any way you want the three
buttons on the left side are angled so
not to interfere with each other which
means you won't be pressing g9 if you
are reaching for g8 we also have an
infinity scroll switch for those who use
it and a profile switch right there
below it now the scroll wheel also
supports side clicks which could be
programmed to do something useful doing
gaming like throwing in grenade or
something but because the scroll wheel
is very sensitive with almost no
resistance
I found cyclic useless because I would
always accidentally initiate a scroll
also clicking the wheel to the right did
not have any tactile feedback while
clicking to the left was much more
responsive and an LED indicator on the
side of the mouse to show which of the
five profiles you're using now the LED
indicators also showcase the battery
life but unfortunately the three
indicators are quite vague and there is
no exact percentage and the software
either but we were able to get about six
days on a single charge with moderate
daily use there's also an off switch at
the bottom to really preserve your
battery life now foreign buttons are
included for your thumb which are very
well designed the top two buttons have a
slightly longer reach which makes
differentiate and using these buttons
without any issues however they don't
have the same press for example one of
the buttons is very soft while the
others have a more tactile feedback
which raises some concerns down the road
the driver software is very intuitive as
well and you can fine tune every single
button for any game or use recording
macros as an option plus having game
specific profiles to configure your
mouse exactly how you want so the new
Logitech G 700 s is a well-rounded
candidate for gaming mouse with an
excellent sensor comfortable ergonomic
design and button layout that works
really well during gaming but no
noticeable input lag for games which is
quite impressive for a wireless mouse
and also a wired option is available
with the g7 100 s which would eliminate
any skepticism you might have about the
input lag during gaming now there's
really nothing negative to say about the
G 700 s
aside that we have no exact battery life
indication and while the new coding may
be a fingerprint-resistant and non
sticky it does have a plastic feel and I
would much rather prefer a slightly
rubberized surface also missing weight
customization is kind of bummer
considering the high price but when it
comes down to wireless performance the
g7 100's has improved on many aspects
from the original and definitely should
be considered if you are in the market
for one and we're giving it a hard
knocks damn good at word so let us know
if you'd consider using wireless mouse
for gaming tell us why or why not in the
