closed-loop liquid cooler from EVGA
that's right my friends after launching
a pretty successful air cooler a few
years ago EDG has expanded their cooling
solutions towards on once EVGA may be in
for a challenge go since companies like
Coursera NZXT and coolermaster have
experienced market share and the time on
their side I'm really interested to see
how well this cooler can keep up with
those competitors so as you know EGA has
been well known for their all-in-one
hybrid water cooling solutions for
NVIDIA based GPUs will that awesome
performance on the graphics card side
translate into a competitive AI oh let's
find out and dive into this new cooler
from EGA right after message from our
sponsor you can only rely on the pro to
do the job with every keystroke
satisfying like the millions before
you
quality with every key regardless of the
fate Kula master master keys bro take it
with you
thank you so this is the new CLC 280
liquid CP cooler that runs for about 130
US dollars the model name itself implies
the fact that it's sports day - 80
millimeter radiator that we'll talk
about shortly but if you're having
trouble finding room for a massive
radiator inside your case EVGA also
offers a 120 millimeter variant for $90
unfortunately there isn't a 240
millimeter variant for the time being
but expect one in the near future
pricing for the two 80 millimeter cooler
lies right in between quarters H 110 a
GT and NDA sixties new x6 - both of
which are 280 millimeter liquid coolers
now on paper the CLC 280 certainly looks
to be a powerful cooling solution as it
offers a massive two eighty millimeter
radiator that's just 27 millimeters
thick - large custom 140 millimeter fans
and a well built custom EDG branded
water block / reservoir combination unit
this is hands-down one of the
best-looking and easy to install coolers
I've come across lately the tight nylon
braiding tubing makes installation a
breeze and it's relatively flexible plus
you don't have to worry about accidental
leaks from traditional PVC tubing sound
onto some other a iOS there's also a
custom water pump that has its Inlet and
outlet ports on the top instead of the
side which reduces water pressure and
thus noise the water block features in
acrylic top with a glowing EDG RGB LED
lit logo its colors and behavior can be
customized through EVGA flow control
software it's also pretty unique looking
I love the metal frame around the unit
that adds an extra layer of premium
quality which EVGA has always been well
known for there's a micro USB port which
is used for adding a data link for EDG
edge control software and the included
cable connects easily to the
motherboards a USB header running up the
bottom comes with a fairly polished
copper base plate that has thermal paste
reapplied so let's talk about those
included 140 millimeter fans they're
definitely unique looking and I
appreciate EVGA taking the step to
design something that promises high
performance longevity and quite
operation and that last point has to be
highlighted you see the unique chassis
design allows these 140 millimeter fan
to rotate at a blistering 2200 rpm yet
maintaining lower noise levels
remember these are claims so I guess
it's just a matter of time to find out
how well they perform during our
benchmarks another thing I need to
mention is that EB J's design causes
part of the fan blades to expose so
watch out for cables or anything else
that could get in their way the
installation process was pretty
straightforward I mounted this cooler
inside the NZXT s340 halide metal
chassis now given this is a 280
millimeter radiator I had no clearance
issues within the chassis and the fan
blades never made contact with the front
frame something I was a little worried
about with its design it's still
important to remember that your case has
to natively support two eighty
millimeter radiators and EDG is own
layout so make sure to check the exact
specifications and measure before buying
the CLC 280 I didn't proceeded to
install the included Intel based back
play for skylight and KB Lake do know
that EVGA includes back plates and
retention brackets for x99 and AMD based
motherboards - the next step was to
install the bolts to the CPU mounting
holes in the motherboard and secure them
given the plastic nature of the
backplate I'd be extra careful with
tightening the bolts since overdoing
them could cause some serious damage
down the road thankfully EVGA
pre-installed the inter bracket on the
CPU block so it was just a matter of
time of placing it on top of the bolts
and I tightened them with the included
screws the pump doesn't require separate
SATA power to function
it just works fine through the
traditional three pin power / CPU fan
connector you do get two PWM fan headers
to connect the dual 140 millimeter fans
and the fan speeds can be adjusted
directly through the flow software
speaking of the software well EDG still
hasn't perfected the UI in fact this
version 1.0 isn't even labeled as the
flow control software and it does not
even look closer to what EVGA has posted
on the website which might seem a little
misleading either way it looks pretty
basic with appropriate controls for fan
speed LED lighting control with
different effects and different profiles
- so within the system you'll also be
able to find real-time coolant
temperature and fan rpm readings
alongside a visual fan curve if you'd
like to configure your preferred setting
like I said it does need a lot of work
and I'm hoping EVGA updates the software
sooner than later alright so how well
does this new CLP cooler from EEG
a stack up with the competition we use a
harder running for points back yogurt
4770k for these tests to operate under
the assumption like cooling for today's
KB Lake processors will be even better
testing was also done a bit differently
since we compared the coolers at
different rpm levels to see if mej and
their constant setup can really achieve
a good balance between rpm levels and
temperatures comparing it to popular to
40-millimeter solutions other than the
predator 240 the COC 2 a does a pretty
good job cooling the 4770k overclock to
4.5 gigahertz starting at 1250 rpms we
can see that eg is cooler really dust
trail behind the competition while it
can achieve better results that need to
40-millimeter a iOS like nm access to 40
HP and the liquid pro 240 it one's quite
a bit warmer than the H 100 i GT and
NZXT x 62 luckily the CLC 280 is at a
price point that's more affordable than
many - 80 millimeter alternatives it's
also backed up by a long 5-year warranty
bumping up fan speeds up to a louder
2000 rpm CEB G is cooler catch up with
Corsair and NZXT to 80 millimeter a iOS
a proving that it can be very
competitive if you don't mind knows but
what does this all mean for how loud the
cooler is well let's check out some
acoustics at 1250 rpms EVGA has
obviously created an extremely quiet a
i/o with their custom fans but when
compared to NBC's results here there's a
bit of concern not much just a bit it
looks like even though the air P pins on
the X 62 are about as noisy as the ones
on the CLC 280 they provide much more
performance listen to this it's very
quiet
and what happens at 2,000 rpm here where
the CLC 280 provides its best
competitive cooling performance it also
becomes much louder than the X 62
meanwhile on the positive side it does
remain quieter than Corsairs H 110 i GT
and many of these 240 millimeter coolers
let's have a listen here to detect out a
theory we took the NZXT fans and install
them on the EVGA LC 280 and those
results speak for themselves at 1250
rpms installing those quieter and EXT
units resulted in much lower temperature
results it looks like despite EGS claim
of an optimum noise to performance ratio
NZ exceeds air technology is just so
much better it's almost like the CLC 280
fans aren't properly designed for low
rpm scenarios like we expected when
operating at higher rpm levels EDG stock
fans are almost as good as NC HTS but I
doubt many people will want their
massive 280 mm intercooler running at
these speeds anyways higher rpm pretty
much defeats the purpose of buying a
bigger cooler to conclude EVGA has come
up with an excellent a i/o solution that
competes well within the all-in-one
liquid coolers battleground the price
point is really competitive and the
hardware you get for that screen premium
quality however the custom-designed 140
millimeter fans struggle to push air
through the radiator which in turn
resulted in higher temps at lower rpms
compared to the competition combining
the air fans with the CLC 280 resulted
in an amazing combination so I'm
genuinely hoping EVGA can go back to the
drawing board come up with a better fan
design plus please update the driver
software it seriously looks like a rush
to release that took inspiration from
the 90s all in all for the price the CLC
280 is a great solution if you're okay
running your fans at slightly higher
speeds but looking away from the chart
at decibel results and towards what can
actually be heard by a user I think this
a IO deserves are damn good value award
so what do you guys think of the EDG AC
LC 280 liquid cooler do you guys think
that they have potential to keep up with
the big leagues let us know in the
comments down below
I'm Ebert with how I can axe thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
