and we stopped by the msi booth at
Computex this year and they showcased a
few bunch of products so let's kick
things off with their motherboards huge
thanks to our Computex sponsors for
sending us out here shoutout to nvidia
fantex and cix and msi meet the x99 a
gaming Pro carbon motherboard by the
title you can guess that certain parts
of the motherboard are covered with a
carbon skin it also has a new design
with reinforced steel armor on all the
RAM slots PCI slots and MDOT two PCIe
SSD slots this was mainly done to
improve signal strength and stability
when preventing electromagnetic signals
from traveling to other components the
PCI MDOT two slot delivers speeds up to
32 gigabytes per second and there are
two slots in this motherboard so you can
configure it in a raid zero
configuration and in kept those placing
fast rates your PCI Express speeds LAN
protect is a LAN connector designed to
give you the best networking experience
while also featuring additional
protection and to do so it has a
15-kilowatt anti surge protection to
shield your network from lightning
strikes brownouts and static electricity
a red LED inside the rj45 connector
shows its functionality the CPU socket
features an additional of twenty thirty
six pins versus twenty eleven and this
is to improve our clocking especially
for intel's extreme edition processors
and ddr4 memory we saw this feature
about a year ago on msi high-end
motherboards but it's starting to become
popular on pretty much muslim
motherboards
now since RGB is the thing these days
we're starting to see its purged into
the motherboard market and in this case
we have the gaming Pro carbon logo
that's RGB LED on the side and subtle
lighting underneath the V RMS and other
areas MSI called the mystic light
it features sixteen point seven million
colors with 17 different led effects and
these can be controlled within the
mobile app that's eventually going to be
coming out later this year MSI also
showcase their z170a titanium and x99 a
titanium series of motherboards this is
targeted towards enthusiasts and the
overclocking market when I held that I
was amazed at how strong the board was
built seriously this thing is a tank we
have a steel backplate at the back of
the board and this is perfect for
enthusiasts since if you're playing a
lot of torque by installing two to four
GPUs you need not worry about GPUs sag
they also have a ton of connectivity and
overclocking options for the GPU as well
all right moving on to GPUs we have the
GTX 1080 gaming X GPU and gaming Z GPU
least look almost similar to one another
with both using the new Twin Frozr six
cooler and red highlights the heatsink
features double ball bearing fans to
keep the card relatively silent and heat
pipes are directly in contact with the
core and compared to the two five cooler
on the previous models it's supposed to
be 20% cooler and 40% quieter the gaming
X comes with a significant factory
overclock whereas the gaming set boasts
even higher frequencies along with an
MSI dragon logo on this backplate and
custom LEDs they also displayed the gtx
1070 gaming X video card that featured
the same Twin Frozr six cooler similar
to the 1080 we will be receiving two
versions of this particular card with
one featuring RGB and the other without
the RGB and so what do you guys think
about MSI's new high-end gaming
motherboards as well as their GTA X 1080
GPUs let definitely let us know in the
comments section down below I knee bar
with harbor connects stay tuned for more
competition coverage and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
