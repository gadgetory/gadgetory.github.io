we're here at the del event where they
have a lot of enterprise solutions but
the 17 things that interest us and
obviously our viewers is consumer grade
product so there'll be showcasing some
of their latest releases here so let's
go check out some of their latest
ultrabooks take a look at the beastly
alienware 18 laptop and actually i'm
reviewing the alienware 17 so that's
coming shortly but right now let's go
and take a look at some of the things
that really should be interesting s and
should be coming out near in the future
so let's go alright so one of the cool
things we saw at this Dell conference is
this low guy this is the XPS 11 and it's
pretty unique because this is the
resolution of 2560 x 1440 now on 11 inch
screen it is actually quite incredible
because everything looks so tiny you
actually have to be this close to the
screen in order to actually read what's
in that search bar you guys can
certainly tell what's going on over here
but it is a unique way to interact with
your machinery I guess and very
difficult to actually be going to type
something and obviously you can lower
the resolution to get get appropriate
reading levels but on 11 your screen it
is definitely unique another cool thing
about this little ultrabook / on
notebook is this keyboard it is a
capacitive keyboard which is actually a
little bit difficult to type on to be
honest uh initially I was thinking that
maybe it sort of has a touch touch feel
interface but it doesn't you actually
have to physically jam your finger into
the button in order for it to register
but there's no nothing in there too to
give you the feedback that you've
actually pressed the button so it might
it's not the most comfortable keyboard
to type on and it's actually a lot more
difficult because you have to literally
just press your finger in there for the
button to register but also another cool
thing about this is actually it is also
touch I'm not sure if I've showcase that
but
there we go this is also a two-on-one
sort of like a notebook / tablet it's
not extremely light for this form factor
but and it's also there's nothing to
kind of hold this keyboard in place so
it's not the most comfortable of tablets
in there like tuned ones and also the
keyboard is disabled one while it's in
this mode so yea it is definitely unique
product absolutely not for everybody in
terms of connectivity let's see actually
look how thin this thing is it's very
thin 11 inch notebook so we have a USB
HDMI headphone and you have speakers
sort of on the sides so that's a much
better thing than having speakers on the
bottom and there you go this is the XPS
18 from Dell very unique 2 in 1 /
capacitive keyboard with extremely high
resolution display on this very tiny 11
inch form factor alright guys so it's
matt here at the dell event with harbor
Canucks and right now we're going to
take a look at the XPS 15 Testarossa now
this netbook or this notebook is
extremely powerful and I mean it kind of
kind of comes with the name with the XPS
name now one of the things that is
really important about this laptop but
it actually uses the i7 processor so
it's a quad core with multi-threading as
well it's got 16 gigs worth of ram and a
nvidia 750 mobile GPU now one of the
biggest selling features about this
netbook or this notebook is actually the
fact that it uses an 1800 p display now
this means that it's got 32 x 1800
pixels the density is very very tight so
the quality of the screen and the color
reproduction of the screen is fantastic
for what you're getting for the device
another thing as well too is that has
plenty connectivity including USB
display port as well as hdmi and quite a
few other features that will go into a
little bit detail later on so let's just
take a quick look as well as you can see
that the does have a front facing webcam
and a capacitive touch pad the keys are
still give a little bit of feedback but
it's what you would expect from a
notebook I mean it's not going to have
amex cherry switches on it but it still
gives you quite a bit good amount of
feedback so it's got that tactile feel
that you would want the screen is
incredibly vibrant
it's it looks fantastic that's only way
I can really explain it outside of that
this is the XPS 15 Testarossa and keep
on checking back for more okay guys so
we're taking a look at one of Dell
sinuous offerings and I personally I
think this is going to be one of the
biggest successes they've had for the
Christmas season coming up and the
reason why well it's this little guy
right here we're looking at the inspiron
11 so it's an 11 inch notebook but the
biggest and most important thing about
this notebook is that it's touch screen
and the price 399 so this is going to
compete directly with other books that
are priced similarly in the market but
the biggest feature is that it's a
touchscreen and it uses the AMD a6 apu
and four gigs worth of ram and a 500 gig
hard drive so guys do you want to see
more from Dell and more from what we got
for me today just keep on watching
alright so another cool thing we
discovered here at dell conference is
this inspiron 23 now you guys have you
know that we've taken a look at the XPS
18 which is the all-in-one 18 sort of
tablet / all-in-one desktop but this is
an actual all-in-one desktop this is not
a tablet type of computer where you can
actually you cannot take it off the the
dock but what's cool about it is it's a
23 inch and it's the world's thinnest 23
inch aio that's actually quite
impressive you get very clean edges
aluminum frame and it's actually very
thin as well which is you know for for a
compact system for compact spaces that's
the best way to go really the awesome
thing about this computer is the base i
think the base and this articulating arm
because you can lower this to this angle
to this degree and there you go it's
completely flat horizontal so you can do
things with it I definitely find use in
this scenario if you are working from
home for example and you'd like to be
standing this is going to be a very good
interface for like you work environment
I could see that to be a very useful
thing we have a front webcam it's a
touch interface of course 1080p display
bring this back up it is very stiff at
the moment there's a pre-production
model but I do like that because it's
not going to be shifting if you
accidentally touch it so you do have to
be working with this with
two hands in order to adjust the screen
the speaker is located inside the base
so that's a cool thing because from Dell
we've seen some speakers sort of in the
very awkward positions that don't really
work I do like the speakers right there
so it's going to be directing audit
towards you and one thing that I do
think this computer is lagging is in
connectivity so the calling tivity is
actually all the back so we have power
and the thing is this doesn't have a
battery built in so you has to be
powered on all the time nor to actually
be in use and it only has two years be
ports which is very limiting I would say
but they do come with bluetooth mouse
and keyboard mouse mouse and keyboard
and that's a good thing that is included
with the salads computer so this is the
inspiron 23 go head on over to delcom
for all the information and
configurations and now we have the big
alienware 18 so let's go check that out
alright guys this is the big one this is
the alienware teen i'm sorry we're gonna
have to tease you about this
configuration because they definitely
brought out the most beefy system you
can get a lemur 18 starts about 2k all
the way up to 5k so depending on your
configuration you can go up to this
insane machine so specs wise this is
780m SLI dual GPUs dual 7 80s in there
absolutely amazing it's got a 4
quad-core 4930 MX CPU so clocked at
three gigahertz again it's going to be
an absolute powerhouse 32 gigs of RAM
and most importantly actually well not
most importantly but one of the selling
features is this intel raid 0 4 512
gigabyte SSD satou for a total of almost
a terabyte of storage and write 0 for
ssds absolutely insane so this is an 18
inch 1920 x 1080 P resolution will be
running any game at the highest ultra
aspects absolutely no problems now
alienware is a focusing with this with
the system to be sort of a desktop
replacement i'm sure this is not going
to be a mobile gaming solution for you
for example if you travel a lot and you
gaming machine this going to be sort of
out of the question because it's way too
heavy it's kind of bulky as well but
this is a desktop replacement with style
so one cool things is alien effects as
you can see we have
strips on the bottom you have three srt
four zones for the keyboard in total so
you can actually configure them each
individual zones again something fancy
alienware logo in here you can change
every single LED colors on this computer
quite insane for gaming as well
alienware effects is sort of a cool
thing integrated into the laptop because
it interacts with your game so it's a
custom API they built to interact with
game so if your health is low this is
going to be flashing red if you're
totally fine for example be green and it
they work with a lot of games
unfortunately we're now we are not aware
what games that are supported but we are
aware there'll be more more than 50
titles that are supported with alien
effects the trackpad is also lit up
right now is disabled but it's a kind of
a cool looking machine but it's also a
huge I mean the amount of power it packs
into this package is absolutely
incredible so if you guys want to check
out more information about this we will
have alienware 17 review coming out
shortly but this is 18 go on the website
check out what type of configurations
you have and let us know what you think
of this type of configuration is this
like the the ultimate gaming system you
can have probably for the money and like
a new mobile form factor so thanks guys
for watching this concludes our coverage
with this Dell enterprise kind of like
all these new gadgets and all these cool
things that we get to try with so thanks
for watching we'll see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
