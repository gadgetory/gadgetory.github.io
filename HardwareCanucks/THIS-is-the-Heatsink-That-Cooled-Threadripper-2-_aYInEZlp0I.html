connects and we've been covering a lot
of cases so far Computex but
Coolermaster had a few things that were
a lot more interesting hiding in the
corners of their booth not only was
there an all-in-one liquid cooler that
incorporated a thermo electric chiller
but also an awesome-looking heat sink
called the Wraith Ripper but before I
get into either of those I want to thank
coolermaster Thermaltake and fantex for
sponsoring this trip without them none
of this coverage would have been
possible so let's start with one of the
most unique things we've seen in
Computex so far actually it doesn't look
all that unique and we all want to write
by it at first because doesn't this look
like a slightly modified yeah you're
cooler well that's actually what it is
but the modification schoolmaster made
to it can lead to CPU temperatures that
go below ambient basically a Tec or
thermoelectric cooler quickly transfers
heat from one side of a solid-state coal
plate to the other there are a few
challenges though it can transfer so
much heat in a short amount of time that
an initial heatsink is required to
ensure those high temperatures are
dissipated also once temperatures get to
a certain level condensation can occur
in certain situations and TECs require
quite a bit of power as well despite
those potential problems depending upon
a te C's output I can cool even hot
running processors down to a very low
levels the idea of adding a TAC element
into a closed-loop water cooler to
reduce fluid temperatures isn't a new
one either
for example coolant systems did this
quite successfully eight years ago with
their borass series the cool master
version of the tec e io combination is
still in its prototype phase but is
expected to officially launch before the
end of the year for $300 or a bit less
right now it doesn't have a name but
it's made up with a slightly expanded
CPU block that holds the coal plate and
a higher power pump the increased pump
capacity is needed since the setup
consists of a 240 millimeter and 120
millimeter radiator working in tandem
basically the heat produced by the core
is moved from the block into the 240
millimeter radiator which also houses
the tec coolers then these work to
reduce the liquid temperatures and then
move the coal fluid to the secondary
radiator which will then balance things
out to reduce the possibility of
condensation
master's intent is for the Tec units to
only come on when the flu temperature
reaches a certain threshold which would
usually happen when overclocking
extremely high wattage processors
however they are looking into
possibility of giving users more manual
control over the whole setup opening up
the door to extreme cooling or CPUs that
output less heat but honestly guys I'd
love to hear your opinion about this
cooler is it something you would
consider buying for higher level
overclocking or does it add a bit too
much complication the other thing that
caught my attention was this what we
have here is yet another tower core but
it's a joint venture between
Coolermaster and AMD with its sole
intent being efficient cooling for the
high TV p TR for threat to perceive use
and now with thread report OU's 24 and
32 core variants in the pipeline a
purpose-built high level air cooler
might actually be a great option it's
officially called the wraith ripper for
its extreme silence coupled with thread
ripper compatibility other than that
there isn't much information since it
literally arrived from the factory to
cooler masters booth while we were there
what we do know is that there's an array
of seven heat pipes addressable our
jeebies that are connected to the
motherboard via a USB cable and a single
centered mounted fan basically it's
supposed to be the quietest thread upper
air cooler around but that also means it
won't be able to handle an overclocked
chip balancing performance and acoustics
is going to be a major challenge on AIM
DS k GD t platform and we'll see if we
way through accomplish that when it's
launched sometime this year so there you
guys have it - pretty neat coolers from
Coolermaster but our visit doesn't stop
here so stay tuned for even more
coverage from them and other companies
as well here at Computex 2018
I mean bar with hardware connects thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
