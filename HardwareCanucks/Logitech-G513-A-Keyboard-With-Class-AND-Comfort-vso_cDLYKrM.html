mechanical gaming keyboard now for those
of you who don't really keep track of
logitech gaming peripherals let me
explain this new addition because they
do have a lot of options for consumers
to choose from
remember the g4 13 that I looked at last
year for $89 well the g5 13 is the exact
same replica of the g4 13 except it
comes with you guessed it RGB lighting a
new mechanical switch and a few other
features which we'll get to shortly and
if you're wondering about pricing one
hundred and fifty dollars guys but is it
really worth spending that much on a
gaming keyboard these days let's find
out right after this the new OC CTR 200
from Toshiba
is a great value SSD if you're
considering upgrading your hard drive
and get a nice boost in performance with
cutting-edge 3d flash memory and ultra
reliable controller with built-in power
management available in different
capacities check it out below ok so
first up build quality it feels very
similar to the g4 13 essentially they've
laid a solid piece of brushed aluminum
on top of the plastic chassis which
complements rigidity so I wouldn't worry
about long-term durability although be
mindful that the brushed aluminum
texture can pick up dust quickly and
it's a pain to clean at times I'm
typically not a fan of this texture I
would have preferred it sandblasted as
its smoother and easier to clean but
that's just my opinion
logitech has also included a single USB
2.0 pass through port at the back for
plugging in any USB power devices this
could be used for a wireless receiver
for your gaming mouse or to charge your
mobile devices or plug in external
drives I did wish if it was USB 3 but it
looks like this port by itself requires
more bandwidth to fully function which
is also why the cable is really thick
and braided I did have some trouble
comfortably routing this on my desk so
do keep that in mind plus it's also non
removable the layout is pretty straight
forward remember this isn't a tkl
keyboard but rather a full-sized
mechanical one it certainly took me some
time to get used to since my daily
driver is the g pro but if you're coming
from something like a standard membrane
keyboard this should feel like home
to mention you are getting a huge
upgrade in terms of build quality and
features there aren't any dedicated
programmable buttons on the g5 13 just
like the g4 13 but the user can program
the function keys with their desired
macros to Logitech's gaming software the
included memory foam wrist rest is a
welcoming addition and I absolutely love
my time typing and gaming with it I
really wish the G pro has something like
this and as much as I prefer its compact
nature
ergonomics is also something that I
value and the g5 13 certainly gets bonus
points for that the wrist rest is made
out of leather Ed material its soft its
comfortable it's also sweat proof and
waterproof but that's something that I
have to validate in the long term this
doesn't attach to the keyboard which is
a good thing by the way because you can
reposition the rest to your comfort
setting plus the bottom does come with
adequate overfeed so it does stay
stationary regardless the bottom of the
keyboard also features appropriate
rubber feet to prevent unnecessary
movement and it also comes with angle
adjustments what's even more impressive
is that they've carefully implemented
capable routing points for your
headphones or your mouse so that it
doesn't get in the way while you're in
an intense gaming session so kudos to
launch tech for designing a
well-thought-out keyboard except for the
lack of including dedicated media
playback buttons now this may or may not
be a deal-breaker for some of you out
there but having tested multiple gaming
keyboards full-size mechanical keyboards
here in the studio I'm just disappointed
that Logitech decide to eliminate that
on the g5 13 especially at this price
point a Corsair does it with most of
their full-size mechanical keyboards so
I don't really know why they've decided
to eliminate dedicated media playback
buttons I would value them on a
full-size keyboard to be honest now they
have integrated those playback buttons
within the function keys and what's
interesting is that if you use launched
X Games software you can inverse switch
the function keys to those media
playback buttons so you don't have to
hit the function key and then change the
volume or skip track so you can directly
hit that button and it'll do that
functionality the only thing is you lose
that function key as primary so for
example if I'm working with programs
like After Effects and if I want to use
f9 to smooth out that keyframe I would
obviously have to hit I'd have to
remember to hit a function and then f9
and not f9 instantly so that's something
to keep in mind especially if you work
with programs and that take advantage of
function keys also launched egg what's
up with this thread mount of the back I
was not able to find any info on that on
your website nor was i briefed on
anything about it my guess potential
future add-on accessories to complement
the rest of your gaming peripherals or
or something interesting I don't know
I'm just speculating but if you decide
if we if you end up picking up this
keyboard and if you're wondering what
that thread man is for I I don't have
answer RGB lighting has made its way
into the G 513 and it looks amazing I
really like what Logitech has done here
with the lighting just like the G Pro
and the rest of the keyboards it doesn't
spill across the frame unlike some other
gaming keyboards and that's thanks to
the aroma G switch design the LED is
dead scented within the housing which
then results in uniform and consistent
lighting across the board it looks
simple and minimalistic and I'm sure
most of you would agree with me on this
but regardless I'd love to hear your
thoughts on Logitech's lighting system
in the comments there are a variety of
effects to take advantage of like
breathing star effect color cycle color
wave where you can adjust the speed and
direction there's also a keystroke
effect and finally ripple which is a
little bit on the fancier side and I
don't see myself using that but you may
like it this can be done through the
drivers software but if you want
on-the-fly customization launch tech as
implemented dedicated Keys ranging from
f5 to f8 that controls the effects the
direction and the brightness along with
the G key to disable the Windows key
nice touch I should also mention that
the g5 13 is like sync compatible so if
you do end up picking up the g5 60
gaming speakers featuring light sync
technology you can sync the lighting
across this keyboard as well as the rest
of the peripherals you can take
advantage of effects lighting effects
like audio visualizer or screen sampler
or if you're in a game and if you want
that lighting immersion this can
definitely implement or it can
complement a you experience when we have
two switches well that's the new thing
here you see if you only launched a
gaming keyboard like the G Pro the G
4:13 heck even the Orion spark you're
probably aware of the romaji switches
they feature it's custom designed by
Logitech and I'm used to it on my G Pro
with the introduction of the g5 13
Logitech has announced a new type of
switch called the
linear' they've renamed the original
switches from Roman G to Roma G tactile
and the primary difference between these
two switches is their feedback so with
these new linear switches you're getting
a more fluid and smoother keystroke
experience compared to the tactile
response you get with the originals so
there isn't that tactile bump anymore
with these new linear switches they
still feature the same 1.5 minute
actuation distance with a total travel
of three point two millimeters an
activation force still remains at 45
grams it took me a solid day to get
comfortable with these new switches
compared to the tactile ones found on
the G Pro and I certainly have mixed
things about this for one I do miss the
slight tactile feedback that I used to
get with the tactile profiles and it's
also a lot more on the quieter side so
that could be an advantage for some of
you out there but most importantly I've
also noticed that I've been applying a
lot more pressure than needed for the
key to action and I think that's all
part of the smoother and keys the
smoother keystroke experience you're
gonna be getting with these new switches
I did manage to compare these switches
to Cherry MX rent because they do
feature linear characteristics it's kind
of like what Roman G linear offers and
one of the differences that I did notice
is that the lift L force is a lot higher
on Cherry MX Reds compared to Roma G
linear so if you're looking for
something with a higher liftoff force
obviously Cherry MX wears is a better
offering of course you are gonna get and
that's smoother I think the actuation is
smoother keystroke it's just a lot
better on MX Reds compared to romaji
linear I'm just not fully comfortable
using this the g5 13 with these new
switches I'm still I'm still so used to
the tactile ones and of course I prefer
that type of feedback so if I were you I
would try out these keyboards with the
new switches at local retail store like
Best Buy or Micro Center and then pull
the trigger and because like I said you
can only get comfortable with a gaming
keyboard once you've tried them and once
you sort of get used to them as well so
yeah that's what I would recommend
try this out first of course I think
most keyboards are returnable within 30
days so you can definitely give this a
shot and if you're not comfortable
switch this up with aroma G tactile and
see if you're comfortable with them and
if you're not then of course cherry MX
there are variety of mechanical
keyboards with Cherry MX
offerings that you can get to try out
now how do these
which is translated into gaming well
that once again ultimately depends on
what you're looking for in a gaming
keyboard here's what I can assure you
these switches are fast and very leduc
to actuate so finger fatigue is
completely out of question the liftoff
force is also non-existent as I
mentioned above and these keys were
overall very quick to respond with in
movements within a game and I had a
pretty good time gaming with the g5 13
although I'm still getting used to them
I should also mention that you can pick
up the g5 13 with the original aroma G
tactile switches for the same price
which is awesome and here's a sound test
comparing or the linear switches to the
tactile ones on my g pro and the MX Reds
on my Corsair k6e t wireless lastly just
to go over the software Logitech has
always excelled in this department the
user is greeted with a physical overview
of the keyboard here's where you can hit
the function inverse toggle if you'd
like to assign the integrated media
playback buttons as primary plus you can
easily customize macro commands to the
function keys through f12 Logitech has
to be programmed a handful of commands
that users can take advantage of which
is awesome you also have the option to
create profiles as well as play around
with lighting here's where you can
customize the lighting effects that I
talked about earlier and since this is a
logitech gaming peripheral you can sync
the RGB lighting across the rest of your
Logitech peripherals including the g5 60
speakers with light sync so to conclude
the g5 13 is an interesting addition to
Logitech's existing gaming keyboard
lineup for one it costs $150 which is an
expensive investment especially if
you're considering buying a logitech
gaming keyboard but if you're looking to
spend the exact same money for something
a little bit more unique you can pick up
the g6 13 by Logitech which is a
wireless mechanical keyboard but you're
going to be losing on things like RGB
lighting and of course the robust build
quality
and the superior wrist rest I really
can't get over this guy I mean it's so
comfortable in fact I will be using this
with my G pro I really don't care how
long it is or not but I just love the
fact that it's comfortable and
ergonomically it's just it's perfect
hey it's probably one of the main
highlight or main selling features of
the g5 13 now the new rumor jelenia
switches are not exactly for everyone
out there because you are going to be
losing on that tactile feedback and of
course the liftoff force is basically
non-existent on these new switches it's
more geared towards people who prefer
smoother actuation something that's fast
something that's quick and that's where
something like the linear might come in
as a better fit and once again I'd
highly recommend trying these out before
pulling the trigger that being said this
is a fantastic keyboard designed by
Logitech in fact as I mentioned in the
beginning of this video this is
basically the g4 13 with the addition of
RGB lighting a new mechanical switch and
of course the inclusion of this wrist
rest and that's about it that's all
you're paying for that extra premium so
would you actually spend that extra
money for those features over the g4 13
in fact you can't pick up the g4 13 for
a lot cheaper or for a lot less than $89
right now so let me know if you would
rather pick that or this in the comments
down below of course I'd love to hear
your thoughts on the g5 13 what do you
guys think about it let me know in the
comments I knew better with hardware
connects thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
