you by fantex nvidia corsair and CI x
silverstone and in win make sure to
support them for helping us bring this
great content to you
there were two new cases announced from
fractal design and Computex both
targeting the ITX crowd the first one is
the no 202 the slim tower like chassis
is getting more attention and I'm happy
to see fractals version of it it's a
very simple exterior shell keeping to
that minimalistic design something that
the fractal design is known for and the
front there is a pair of USB 3 ports
audio jacks and the power button and the
note 202 stands on this base for
vertical orientation that I personally
love however can be placed in a
horizontal position as well where a
fractal design logo would be properly
showcased as otherwise it's on an angle
when vertically placed at the back there
are two PCI brackets and the dual slot
GPU can be installed right above
utilizing a PCI bracket and given the
interior placement of an SFX power
supply here's your power input and the
back and here's the internal layout and
a top right is an ITX motherboard spot
with CPU coolers up to 56 millimeters
supported and an SFX power supply right
below up to 130 millimeters long and you
can notice all the case cables are black
and already pre routed into the main
chamber for storage the note 202 can
only accommodate dual two and a half
inch drives every ventilation port is
dust proof that's really good to see
there's one big filter for the GPU
chamber one for the CPU and one for the
power supply GPUs up to 310 millimeters
will fit and I notice the spacer in the
middle most likely to make sure the GPU
does not bend and make contact with the
fans as there are two 120mm birthday
announced in the GPU chamber also one
thing I noticed that with the front IO
cables is they are pretty thick and thus
a long GPU would overlap this area and
I'm a little worried about proper
cabling and making sure the GPU can
comfortably sit there the riser card for
the PCI slot was not present on a
showcase sample but it will be included
with a note 2 or 2 and at $79 you are
looking at the well-rounded ITX case I
personally love these slim designs the
other case they've announced is the core
500 I think is ribbed in place in the
note category but it shares the exterior
elements with the
for series so that makes sense this is
an ITX design as well with two PCI
brackets and the silent are three 140
millimeter fan at the back included for
exhaust all of the ventilation ports
come with magnetic dust filters
something I'm really happy to see for
this form factor taking a look inside we
find a fairly is similar layout today
our note three or four case but this
time without all the drive caddies
instead there's a five and a quarter
inch drive bay and a three and a half
inch drive bay right underneath for
storage we get an SSD mount at the front
with appropriate cutouts out to the side
for routing your SATA cables the rear
bracket can support two or three and a
half and two and a half inch drives at
the same time but these rubber grommets
available to prevent vibrations and the
core 500 can accommodate ATX power
supplies up to 140 millimeters to
maintain compatibility for GPUs up to
310 millimeters and so here I wish an
SFX power supply mount was available but
the most impressive part about this case
is its water cooling support with this
top bracket this would allow you to
mount radiators up to 280 millimeters so
you can install an all-in-one CPU cooler
no problem plus the bracket is removable
for easier installation all in all the
new releases from fractal design mark an
ever rising trend for ITX systems
combined with efficient layouts
thus prevent elation and gaming ready if
needed so it's exactly what I want to
see from case manufacturers moving
forward so let us know which of these
cases you'd like us to review first the
note 202 or the core 500 so we can build
our own systems into it and tell you the
full story
