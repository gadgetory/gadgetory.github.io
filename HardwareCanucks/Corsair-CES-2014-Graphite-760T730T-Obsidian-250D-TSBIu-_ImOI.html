alright guys for coming on to the cases
in the Corsair suite here at CES 2014
one of the new additions to the graphite
series is the 760 T obviously one of the
unique features of this case is the
fully acrylic side panel it does open
with a simple hinge like so as you can
see it does have a little bit of wobble
to it and because it's it is full
acrylic so you're not expecting an
insane rigidity out of this thing this
is strictly for aesthetical purposes and
not really for and it's also removable
simply by taking it and taking it off
like this coarser you know they do have
a certain standard when it comes to
internal designs so this is this
interior is the identical interior to
the 750d which has a lot of benefits so
you have a lot of SSD pockets in the
back you have these to us as hard drive
cages here and as you can see it's a
very open concept lots of room to work
with water cooling options and they're
also announcing their Corsair Hydra
series H of five like 240 ml liquid
cooler which is actually installed
inside there and we can take a look but
this is a 38 millimeter thickness
radiator so a slightly thicker than
their previous series and they're
showcasing it here with nice thick
tubing and so there you go this is the
760 T now nothing really much to save as
aside that aesthetically it is different
and they're they've kept nique is the
identical interior as to the 750 d this
is also another 760 t and as you can see
it's a different color color mode
basically so it's a black on black the
LEDs you guys see inside here have been
installed they do not come included the
case but exactly the same concept here
as with the other case removable side
panel is simply showing us exactly
what's inside there and the other panel
it is identical so it is not clear
through it just it's completely covered
but it is easily removable simply like
so it is also plastic so perhaps if you
have a very bad cable management there
and it might have a little bit of flex
if you're trying to close it but there
we go so
also on the front this is a removable
dust filter that showcases 240 sorry to
140 and 120mm or a fan mouse which is
awesome so mobile fit and dust filter is
pretty sweet and coming to the top here
as you can see there isn't any dust
filter which is kind of unfortunate but
it will come with a cover in case you
want to sort of go for that silent build
but fortunately no that's water so this
is the 760 T let's go ahead and check
out sort of ass budget oriented design
which is the the other one so this is
the graphite series this is the 730 T
now the 760 T so as you can see it
doesn't have the acrylic side panel
there are two fan mounts over there and
it user utilizes the same latch design
for both side panels both there on the
front and it includes basically all the
in tentacle interior is the 750 D the
only difference here is there's no
acrylic side panel like on the other
case so let's go ahead now and check out
the 250 D this is the Obsidian this is
one of the very impressive cases that we
saw here and because it is so tiny and
when you're dealing with sort of space
constraints there's a lot of design
features that have to be sort of thought
about because base efficiency in such a
small compact small compact form factor
is very important so why don't we go
ahead and take off these a few side
panels so there we go
it is pretty modular you take off the
side panels just by sliding them off and
of course they are secured with screws
as well but as we can see they have
installed a mini ITX system inside but
what's very impressive it supports a
full ATX power supply at the bottom it
has a 240 million radiator on one side
and a full graphic full-length graphics
cards on the other side so of course
space constraints will be sort of
incorporated into this case so if you're
building a mini ITX system you do have
to think about the length of your
graphics card but the fact that this
case does support both a 240 millimeter
radiator and a full-sized graphics card
and a full-size power supply is very
very impressive from this obsidian 250 d
and we also if let me see if I can spin
this around somehow there we go we have
a
drive both for SSDs and 3.5 inch drive
sub 2 of each removal from the back
which is awesome very convenient to
access those we have looks like 80
millimeter fans fan mounts here and also
very impressive is these dust filters so
this isn't the same idea as on the
Obsidian it is a magnetic dust filter
that is attached to the side panel at
the front here so that if you do decide
to install those fans and that water
cooler for either intake or exhaust it
will be dust proof so that's awesome to
see and the other side pan has also dust
proof so this is the Obsidian 250 D and
one more thing to mention before we head
out is the front also is dust proof so
there's that removable dust filter that
we've come to expect from the Obsidian
series so a lot of new cases here with
the corsair cs 2014 booth seem like a
760 is designed for that that as you saw
said those systems were amazingly
beautiful so if you really want to show
off those systems the 760 t the black
version is 169 and 179 for the white
version because it's a lot more
expensive this the 250 D is priced going
to be at eighty nine ninety nine and the
730 T so it's sort of more of a mid
tower version not a mid Tower sorry the
mid budget
love also does not incorporate the
acrylic side panel is going to be $30
cheaper than the other so this is 139
giving us those competitive price points
it is coarser so you are expected to
face over the premium but really looking
forward to sort of testing out these
cases how they stack up in terms of
airflow because it does have a different
design so guys this has been our
coverage here at CSI Corsair booth at
CES 2014 and don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
