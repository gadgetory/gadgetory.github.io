is brought to you by and see IX
technology connected alright guys so
we're here getting loose in the fractal
design suite I here I'm with josh at CES
2014 now one of the newest or one of the
new things they have here is this
fractal design define r4 so what is new
about this and why did you come up with
such a feature yeah so what we basically
have we have to define our for blackout
now what we've done is the entire
interior is black that means all drive
cages the PCI slots as well as the fans
now the reason that we did that is
basically because of our fans and our
customers that wanted to see something
like that you know we pride ourselves on
being the company that listens and when
we receive that feedback we want to give
our customers and products that they
want so we're kind of trying this out it
is gonna be a full production case it
should be available in April in North
America and what we want to know is you
know do our fans like this do you like
being able to you know speak to us and
have us listening to you know bring
products to the market that you've been
asking for so this is really a
reflection of our commitment to
listening to what our fans have to say
so fans have requested an old black
interior do you have any other feedback
that you can share with us-based if
something's coming in the future do you
have any revisions based on like because
you at your case selection is excellent
everybody's you know I'm a huge fan it's
not a video yeah exactly arc midi are
two deserved the number two spot the top
five cases and everybody's mentioned the
r4 like why the hell wasn't the r4
included and the only reason is that the
interior was pretty much pretty much
very similar except that this is a more
silent solution so any feedback based on
other cases yeah so you know we do have
to temper it somewhat right like I can't
be like one guy says he wants a pink
case we're going duction for pink cases
you know it's like we do kind of have to
take you know the greater common good
when we do get that feedback I mean
normally what you'll see that come out
is like you know an arc midi are to
where we take a lot of those revisions
it people like want the other SSD mount
so they want that this and they want
that you know it's like we roll it out
into a new product that's why a lot of
times like your CDR for you know what
we out of the r 3 where it's like don't
you know if it ain't broke don't fix it
sort of thing a lot of it but then we
also try to answer those questions so as
far as stuff that's coming out I have to
do the usual PR guy thing of like I
cannot comment about things that may or
may not be in villain blah blah but yeah
you will see you will see some good
stuff i mean i'll give that scoop to
minus but you'll see some good stuff
coming out so i know its it and that's
the thing we want to say is like if you
guys don't see something for us that you
want to see let us know your hips up on
facebook your comment on this video we
monitor all that stuff and we value your
feedback excellent well track design
there you guys have like a formula for
cases you know you they are all very
similar in you have the equation for the
internals and you have a slightly
different external is based on sound
features or you want extreme air cooling
or something like that so this is kind
of well it's nice to see that you guys
listening to your customers but now so
this is the full black are for but you
also are doing a lot of fuss or custom
cases working with a bunch of custom I
guess companies at design your system
integrators so let's go and check that
out so one of the cool systems here that
we have using the arc sorry the XLR to
from Franklin is a system from puget so
Josh what is so impressive about the
system you just show this to us yeah so
the thing is a peach is very selective
on what the hardware they use and they
selected the fine excel or two for their
Genesis system and you know they're very
picky because they do custom builds for
people like you know video editors and
workstations you can tell us as a dual
see on Rick what you might not be able
to tell us it's actually on right now
yeah so I don't know if you're Mike came
to pick it up but like how silent this
away let's let's go ahead and so we're
talking with our normal voice the system
is on so we have how many do we have two
fans in the front yes terribly we have
been praised the broom we have one down
here we have rear exhaust and we
obviously have two fans on the tower
coolers as well as you know duel fans on
the video so a total of six fans and
check out how quiet this thing is you I
mean the mic is certainly not gonna be
able to pick this up but I can tell you
from personal experience being here it's
dead silent and that's one of the
beauties of this case and this is what
side panel off yes if you think about
like when you're actually attending
video or you're turning through whatever
I work out what you're doing in these
things are actually ramping up with a
side panel on you're still going to have
a quiet system right you know so that
way you're not tainting your audio if
you're doing recording or whatever
absolutely so another useful thing for
extreme silent bc's form using frankly
sign cases and not for reference let's
turn this one on yeah exactly this one's
more of an airflow case it's liquid cool
but so it slightly louder you can
actually we have to turn this computer
off in order to actually hear how silent
the other one is but this is exotic
exotic pc this is a you know it's an
ARCA excel-based system and this one is
obviously in a bright hemi cuda green
now what you probably see in there it
might help if I take this off first of
all you see the the tenant acrylic on
the window so it subdued lighting a
little bit which is it you know feedback
from our fan some we did but they had I
love you tinted acrylic well thank you
too for thank you it's always good to
hear that we're doing something right
you know yeah they've got a 360 red in
the top as well as a 240 in the front
and then they're running you know custom
dual or custom loop system to run an SLI
video cards both liquid-cooled so this
shows just kind of like the flexibility
you can do with the architect so yeah
well it seems like all your cases right
they they have a very certain
functionality but pretty much every
single fractal design case has really
excellent water cooling support like the
the arc mini are two that we are
releasing actually today on Tuesday so
watch out for that is you know it
supports a 360 the top to 240 in the
front then just sister micro ATX case
yeah exactly so awesome things to see
from you guys it's nice to see that you
have a full black version of the r4 it's
a very popular case so again coming to a
new satisfying the consumer needs and
what you're asking for yeah well like I
said I know that's why we take our fans
and our customers you know they are part
of the development process so we're
always looking for feedback from you
guys so if you don't see something you
want let us know that that's how the
only make it happen so let us know in
the comments below as to what you think
that fractal design should implement
some of the features that you perhaps
saw in other cases and so this concludes
our tour of the fractal design booth
