heartbroken acts review today we're
taking a look at the mouse and a mad
from gigabyte this gaming series is
known as the avia Krypton which
incorporates dual purpose designed for
each of the peripherals they are sold
separately but really are meant to
complement each other so its first take
a look at the dual sided Krypton gaming
mat so starting off with the dimensions
this is a fairly large matt it is
particularly wide due to a large bezel
like rubber which prevents the mount
from sliding unfortunately it doesn't do
a good job on glass and slides with
almost no resistance gigabyte has also
managed to keep the mat quite thin
despite incorporating dual surface
design and the math is made of three
layers we have the fabric surface the
hard PVC coat and a soft rubber layer in
between which is supposed to provide a
little cushion when using the precision
side and the mat cannot be folded but it
is rail to be flexible and switching
sides is simplified with this tab on top
all right now on to the selling point of
the Krypton gaming mousepad well the
fact that it has two surfaces
incorporating into the one unit we have
the precision side and the speed side
the precision side has the fabric
surface so there is resistance to the
mouse moment and allowing you a little
bit more control and accuracy now this
doesn't mean the surface is not suitable
for FPS gaming it really does depend on
your preference of the math and DPI
settings on your mouse I personally
prefer this type of surface as I like to
have more control of the mouse at lower
DPI settings now the precision side is
in a way similar to the XFX warp pad but
it has a smoother surface it almost
feels like silk to the touch now the
speed side is made of harder surface
coated with scratch-resistant PVC most
of you are probably familiar with this
type of matt is they are quite common
steelseries for HD for example is a very
similar surface but it is a bit more
coarse to the touch so gigabyte has
really focused on providing the least
amount of resistance and offer a far
superior gliding speed over the fabric
surface again whichever you use really
depends on your preference and
sensitivity of your mouse while testing
on the speed side the bottom edge did
irritate my arm while
in use and that's because the edge is
somewhat sharp due to the hard PVC
coating and it will have been nice if
they put a small rubber strip to prevent
this from happening you eventually get
used to it but there's nothing more
annoying than having to lift your hand
off the mat just to relieve your arm
from the edge now while testing out the
precision side in just two days of use
the edges start to show some signs of
wear now this is quite common for this
type of surface and it doesn't really
affect the movement of your mouse but
the tearing starts to get worse from
here so it was quite disappointing to
see this happening straight out of the
box well enough about the mat let's
check out the Krypton gaming mouse now
first impressions to the build quality
are quite satisfactory the mouse is
covered in a rubberized surface
especially the sides that offer a
comfortable grip and right off the bat
this is mainly designed for clog rippers
due to its angle down left and right
click the mouse and total has 10 buttons
your left and right click dpi change the
scroll wheel to browser buttons and a
profile change button on each side since
the mouse is symmetrical so good news
for those left-handed users and the
cable is braided and connects to a gold
plated USB port to eliminate Layton sees
all right let's check out the dual
chassis options for the mouse at the
bottom we have hot swappable plate that
slides just right off and you have the
option to use either the speak plate or
the control plate both offer a
completely different movement to fit
through gaming style and desktop use now
the speed chassis has these hard ceramic
feet that offer minimal resistance and
when paired up with the Krypton gaming
matt gliding in movement speed is
greatly improved now scenarios where
this could be useful our multi-monitor
setups when you have to get from one
corner to the other we're doing FPS
gaming to match your response time with
quick aiming now when using the control
chassis the normal Teflon feet provide
precise movement and combined with the
right sensitivity of your mouse both
gaming and desktop use would feel
comfortable the duel shall see option is
definitely an added bonus so you can
swap the back lanes depending on what
you're doing I found myself switching
between different chasity's while
performing different tasks it's really a
tune one mouse that
is designed for a variable user now one
extra cool feature included with the
mouse is weight distribution which is
revealed underneath the backplate
gigabyte includes 10 individual weights
plus the Clippers we have four light
aluminum ones and six heavier iron ones
for a maximum of 39 grams of weight
increase now they can be stored and
included container so you don't lose the
ones that are not in use now the weight
distribution is quite clever it can
accommodate both left and right-handed
users and also different type of
grippers which will allow you to
concentrate weights around center point
of gravity and it works really well in
practice so you can figure out the best
setting for different habits now
plugging in the mouse we get some
illumination for the scroll wheel and
the indication for the DPI levels along
with the illuminated profile button the
DPI Change button the uses is forward
and backward motion to flip between the
four desired sensitivities which also
can be configured within the ghost
engine driver software the dedicated
profile switch button illuminates based
on the five different profiles and
holding both profile buttons for three
seconds will switch the orientation from
right to left hand illuminating the
correct side now regardless of which
hand you're using their browser buttons
on both sides are always active now the
mouse feels comfortable in the hand
great support on the sides and reaching
for those browser buttons feels natural
and is in the right place reaching for
the DPI button also is quick and is not
forced so overall a good placement for
all the buttons and the profile button
is just out of reach to avoid accidental
switching and that no worries for those
with large hands the mounts should
accommodate properly now the crypt
incorporates an 80 200 DPI laser sensor
which is far too sensitive for any use
but the motion is fluid no stuttering
experienced on any sensitivity level now
when it comes to the go software it is
quite intuitive and simple to use we
have nine programmable buttons or with
many customizable functions to choose
from but also the ability to record your
own macros to the memory on the mouse
for on-the-go gaming we also have a
bunch of other settings like changing
the color of the profile excellent
sensitivities of each of the DPI levels
brightness of the scroll wheel and some
others all right so this has been a long
one let's finish it up the avia Krypton
gaming set introducing something unique
to the gaming market and that's
flexibility for every gamer the Krypton
gaming matt gives us both surfaces to
play with each with its own purpose it's
large enough to fit lower sensitivity
users the surface has great contact with
the sensor and provides smooth motion
but to be critical the size as it is an
advantage is also a disadvantage in
terms of spanning large real estate on
your desk and when using the speed side
the hard TVC coding does cost slight
discomfort and the edges of the fabric
side started to deteriorate only after a
couple of days so these small flaws
should not be overlooked on the mouse
pad that is priced at forty dollars
which is about twice the price of an
average mousepad now the Krypton gaming
mouse is going to be popular as it
incorporates two completely different
plates for different hues they are
extremely easy to swap and fun to
diversify in gaming the weight
distribution system is really cool which
doesn't only affect the entire way to
the mouse but accommodates for left and
right-handed users and claw all palm
grippers the ghost software is really
simple to use and we have many
programmable options now to be critical
the price has somewhat on the steep side
but the fact that this is a two-in-one
deal it should be overlooked by most
users who would be able to take
advantage of the duel shall see now due
to the symmetry of the mouse I found
myself accidentally pressing the browser
buttons on the opposite side which was a
bit annoying but overall the Krypton
gaming peripherals are solid products
designed for gamers and surely won't
disappoint those who are interested to
try out different techniques with
different titles and deserves the
hardware canucks damn innovative award
and that concludes our view for the
Krypton gaming bundle from gigabyte
thank you guys for watching and we'll
see you next month</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
