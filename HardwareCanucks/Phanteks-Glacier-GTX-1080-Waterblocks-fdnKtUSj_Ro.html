exciting news coming from fantex with a
custom GTX 1080
glacier water blocks for the GPU if you
love what you see from the show and
video fantex and cix and msi made this
Computex possible the fan --tx is
approaching this from a perspective of
giving users a very high-end almost like
an ecosystem so the water block is
nickel-plated it features acrylic clear
acrylic and potentially multiple
materials for the aluminum or the metal
pieces that are on top water block to
match the different colors that fantex
currently sells with their case designs
water block will have RGB lighting so
I'm guessing this is the first of its
kind to feature RGB lighting that
connects directly to either the fan --tx
you know RGB LED system for cases or it
will connect to the aura boards and the
new MSI and the gigabyte support for
this RGB support through directly
through the motherboard the water block
looks pretty fantastic and given the
lighting and you know this very uniform
design given its installed inside a fan
text enclosure another cool update here
would be with the o-ring so fantex is
using a new material it's called Viton
which is military-grade it's a lot more
durable than simple I guess the the
silicon or the rubber o-rings that are
normally used with fittings so this new
material is much more durable it's not
going to get ripped with within the
thread it's not going to get bent in
certain way so there are no leaks it's
so it's supposed to be more high quality
they are working on their own fittings
as well so fantex is going the full
water cooling route and giving users a
full package in providing fittings GPU
water blocks and CPU water blocks that
all tie in with the whole ecosystem of
design so the importance of this move
with fantex 2 heading towards water
cooling and using their current
knowledge from their previous cooling
solutions for water cooling I think is a
very good idea considering the target
audience that fan
is trying to achieve with their high-end
cases and even their mid tower mid tier
selection of stuff the GPU waterblock is
going to be priced at 129 us
so I'm guessing that's competitive given
we have these RGB lighting features and
the fittings the custom fittings that
the GPU water blocks include and these
o-rings that apparently do add quite a
price premium over the standard silicon
or rings and that would be it for the
fantex coverage here at Computex so gtx
1080
perfect timing with water blocks and the
cpu and all the water cooling stuff let
us know if this is something that would
interest you in terms of picking
something up that looks in a way this
new glacier series does I'm Dimitri with
higher conducts thanks so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
