great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm V tree with Hard Rock
Canucks and the market for budget cases
hasn't really seen an introduction of
that one killer case in quite some time
the NZXT s340 at $69 was an awesome
direction but it still wasn't hitting
that right budget spot and so today
we're going to put the $49 case to the
test
the PS 11 from silverstone available in
silent and air flow optimized versions
it is an ATX case but a fairly compact
one and there are not many fancy
features integrated here to keep the
cost down but one thing they made sure
is to keep the build quality as high as
possible and a deep side panel stamping
on each side allows exactly that extra
room for all the cables on the right
side and a giant window on the left with
the same deep stamp now naturally I do
my nails swipe tests and well no good
news here the panel scratched easily so
be cautious when working with a side
panel to avoid getting any nasty marks
but on a more positive note coming back
to the deep stamp there's absolutely
zero flex in the panel giving the frame
is sturdy feel and even on the window
panel the same story continues plus the
thumb screws on each panel stay on the
panel a feature that I would love to
become the standard so you don't
displace them the plastic front panel
spices things up a bit with the brush
the grain auto color variation between
the steel and the plastic is clearly
visible the front IO includes dual USB
three on your jacks a really difficult
to press power button and almost
unreachable reset button along with the
hard drive activity LED I am happy to
report the front of the frame pops open
with a built in mesh to prevent them
from the dust coming in behind which we
find a 120mm blue LED fan that has
nothing restricting the airflow and I
find this a major positive and
additional fan mounting holes can
support dual 120 or 140 member fans at
the front and you can even move the
120mm fan slightly higher up with these
holes here the PS 11 is elevated with
high case feed that are unfortunately
not rubberized
and that's with all these small details
when the price comes back to mind plus
you guys know how much I dislike these
type of dust filters at the bottom here
but spanning both the power supply and
the optional middle of fan slot so at
least that's included but I wish these
were exterminated and replaced with
something that you can easily take out
and clean at the back we have 7 PCI
slots 2 water cooling holes 120 and 80
member fan holes and you can see just
how little height there is left based on
the motherboard IO and coming to the top
we have dual 120mm fan holes only and I
want to say right off the bat that the
PS 11 is not designed to properly
accommodate for all-in-one coolers in
this space the case comes with an
internal dust filter which is great but
it is attached with these pegs that
interfere with any fan that you want to
mount in a top slot and turns out
they're also extremely difficult to
remove now you may be wondering why I
have a 240 millimeter radiator installed
here
and well it doesn't natively support it
because there isn't enough height
clearance and the motherboard is pretty
high up there almost touches the top
panel but you will still be able to fit
a set of fans in there no problem
and CPU heat sinks in height of 161
millimeters are compatible but I wanted
to water cool so I could only align the
front portion of the radiator with the
venting holes but the rear screws do not
align and plus I was lucky to have the
radiator the same width as the 120mm
fans so my RAM modules do not interfere
and before the assembly I had to pre
route my 8 pin CPU cable as otherwise it
would not have fit through the cutout
because the motherboard would cover it
and here is the finished system it is
unfortunate that the radiator isn't
natively supported as silverstone could
just add appropriate holes for mounting
but in that case you're most likely lose
out on the rear exhaust fan and also if
you are to mount a 120 ml of radiator at
the back it will have to be the same
width as the fan because everything is
just super tight the drive cage is
standalone it can house three units and
notice there are no drive caddies
instead you just slide the mechanical
drive in there and use these tools clips
to
in place and if shipping the system
drives can be secured into position and
if any of the slots are not occupied you
can use that space to tuck away your
cables and with a panel close that they
won't be visible anyway and it looks
like Silverstone has done their best to
keep the cage frame open and you can
also remove the cage entirely to allow a
radiator to be installed at the front
but in this scenario you kind of lose
out on all the storage options and I
wouldn't consider that a viable option
we have two SSD brackets secure it with
thumb screws for easy removal that you
cannot reposition anywhere else on the
case
as for cabling both the SSD and the
mechanical drive below are on the same
level and complement the wiring that
leads me into cable management and it's
a very good thing that all of the cables
on our power supply are flat because
clearance is limited extremely limited
with only a few cable tie hoops and you
need to concentrate the majority of your
cables right behind or around the drive
cage
it is a very good thing that the side
panel has that deep stamp in case you
cables aren't completely flushed to the
case and as for interior wiring the
motherboard is pretty much surrounded
with cable cutouts I had zero issues
with finding an appropriate routing spot
now do I wish i we had rubber grommets
yes absolutely at least to cover the
power supply cutouts because they're the
biggest ones lastly after the assembly
we have to find a spot for the
silverstone adhesive logo to be attached
to a place are we a choice and I'm
pretty happy with how this build turned
out costing just at 50 bucks for the
chassis you are getting an attractive
package with the basics covered
although the PS 11 would be such a
killer case if only we have native
radiator support up top because the
workaround we did here with this build
is not an answer to today's rising
appearance of all-in-one coolers and
despite the value focus I am
disappointed Silverstone did not take
this into account however we cannot deny
the many positives of this forty nine
dollar budget case and I am willing to
deal with the compromises because if
that's all your budget can allow then
perhaps the constraints of the case will
act as maybe guidelines for your build
and the hardware that you choose
to put in it and so that concludes this
review for those on a tight budget let
us know if this is an appealing option
at 49 bucks with the comments below as
