Eber here with Hari connects and his
guests can see we do have yet another
bunch of speakers on the table for
comparison but this one's gonna be
interesting because this is the razor
normal Pro desktop 2.1 speakers system
and this is the nuclear on the block
from razor in fact this was officially
launched at CES this year but they're
officially starting to ship these out to
customers right now so if you are
interested in picking them up you can do
so now right now now the only issue that
I have here is the price tag because
these things cost five hundred dollars
and they are feature packed that comes
with a bit come with all sorts of
features like RGB lining you've got
bluetooth technology and you know THX
certification all that kind of stuff but
you know the reason why we're doing this
video is more specifically we wanted to
focus on how far we've come in terms of
technology just for you know speakers
because this right here is a speaker set
back from 2004 and it's the Eclipse Pro
media 2.1 speaker system and this thing
costs you know somewhere around the
lines of 120 to 200 dollars depending on
which version you've picked and you know
there's still one of the best desktop
speaker systems that are around in the
market in fact you know Amazon rates
them as a number one pick or bestseller
so to speak so we wanted to do a
comparison not just from you know a
feature standpoint because obviously
Razer tends to have a lot of that
compared to the clinch but more from an
audio perspective to see are you
actually getting that extra fidelity
with the sound when you you know upgrade
to something like they're no more Pro so
sit back you grab a cup of coffee if you
have to and let's get into this
comparison but first a quick message
from our sponsor it's time to play with
light with fine things digital RGB
starter kit that includes two LED strips
and all the appropriate cables the main
hub is magnetic velcro tape is available
with three digital channels four LED
strips or halos Lux fan frames that
display a ton of lighting effects and
they're absolutely gorgeous check out
the kit down below okay so let's start
with the
klipsch pro media 2.1 this is a thx
version that I have over here and it
costs around $150 this is a 2.1 desktop
speaker system so you do get the
standard 2 satellite speakers and a
dedicated subwoofer the design is
nothing really special it's fairly
understated and that makes sense given
that these have been around for well
over 10 years it should still complement
a modern Desa really well
not to mention this could be a perfect
companion for your living room setup as
well the build quality is respectable
it's mostly constructed out of plastic
materials but at the end of the day what
really matters is the sound quality and
I'll get to that a bit later on in the
video as to the form factor they are
relatively compact I'm not gonna say
that they are as small as something like
the creative a 250 s that I checked out
a few weeks earlier but you can
definitely fit them in a compact desk
space and here's a comparison or a live
comparison between this and the Galaxy
Note 9 and as you can see they are
roughly the same height so it's pretty
compact now one of the cool things I
like about the speaker by itself is that
the supporting stands are actually made
out of metal and they are angled in such
a way that you get a better sound
projection when you have them facing you
so that's definitely a positive and
we're really glad that they haven't you
know skip that part
considering that these are fairly old
desktop speaker systems now for the
controls this is a unique design
implementation in my opinion so the
control pod can be swapped and installed
on either the left or right channel
speakers giving users that extra
flexibility you get your standard base
and main volume adjust knobs with a
power on LED indicator and on the side
of the control pod you'll find two 3.5
millimeter audio jacks one of being
aux-in and the other a headphone output
for conductivity both these speakers
connect to the main server for using a
standard speaker wires and to connect to
your audio device the only option you
have here is to use the included 3.5 mm
audio jack so you don't get things like
a optical input or a USB inputs that's
something to keep in mind now the one
thing that I found to be a little bit
odd was actually being able to locate
the power button for these speakers now
normally with the other cheaper sets
that I looked at a while back the main
volume acted as a power button because
it had that little tactile bump that
basically turned on the speaker system
but in this case it just stays on
completely
you have them plugged the main outlet so
that's something to consider it's really
not a huge deal because you won't
experience any interruptions so to speak
I mean all you have to do is just mute
the whole system but this led this LED
light just basically just stays on for
the most part so again that's something
to keep in mind now remember this is the
thx version of the pro media speakers
but there are other versions too there
is a non thx version that goes for
around a hundred and thirty dollars this
one has a slightly narrower frequency
response according to its spec sheet so
you're looking at 35 to 20,000 Hertz
versus 32 to 20,000 Hertz it also uses
different connectors between the
speakers and sub there's also a non thx
Bluetooth version that has the same
narrower frequency responses but also
includes Bluetooth connectivity it went
for about $200 USD but as far as I can
see it may have been discontinued
since user reviews were also pretty
mixed for that set
now we bought these speakers from Amazon
and we didn't have any contact with
clips so we don't exactly know what
they're going to be discontinuing these
models anytime soon so if you are
interested in picking them up I would
highly recommend doing that very soon
because as far as I can tell there's
only limited stock available on Amazon
and I'll make sure to leave links to
both of these speakers and their
description down below in case you're
interested in checking them out
switching gears we have the razor no
more Pro desktop speaker systems that
are priced at $500 now these are
standard 2.1 desktop speaker systems so
you get two speakers and a dedicated
subwoofer and if you recall the standard
normal speakers that i looked at a while
back the design should look very
familiar now the one thing that I
noticed right away with the Nomo Pro
speakers after playing around with the
pro medias was the build quality the
main satellite speakers are constructed
out of aluminum materials and it is
quite heavy too the design is quite
unique in my opinion just like the
standard normal speakers these have a
cylindrical look going on so you've got
a separate so don't tweeter taking care
of the higher frequencies and a 3-inch
Campbell are coated drivers to take care
of the mids to low range sound and of
course we have to talk about that giant
subwoofer I mean look at it
it's huge and here's a shot compared to
the sub from the pro media set now this
is down firing unlike the pro media that
is fun firing and it also acts as a
central hub for connectivity
speaking of which you
two separate proprietary left and right
channel speaker ports the control pod
connector which I'll get to shortly
optical in USB for your PC the main
power switch for the system and a power
input so those are a lot of cables to
deal with so good luck with cable
management on your part but one thing
that I found to be really annoying or I
guess frustrated in a sense is that all
these cables are thickly braided and so
it's very difficult to brought them on
your desk because as you guys can see
it's not that flexible they're very
stiff so that's something to consider
but most importantly they're also very
harder to clean during long term use
because remember these are gonna be
staying stationary and of course they
are gonna attract dust particles so
cleaning braided cables by itself is
just going to be quite a challenge so
these are some of the things to keep in
mind
now the included control pot is fairly
easier to use and it's also built really
well you have your volume dial to adjust
the volume into step increments but the
one thing that I did notice is that the
actual dial by itself isn't as smooth as
I'd like it to be because one expensive
product I expected that dial to be a lot
smoother kind of like what you
experienced with some premium sound
systems within this price range as well
conductivity you do have a headphone
jack and an auxiliary input built inside
the control pod which is pretty
convenient and you also have the standby
button that just quickly puts the
speaker system to sleep and this main
button that's located on the bottom is
used to switch between the different
sources so you do have the option to
switch to optical bluetooth analog or
USB now I should mention that I am a
little disappointed with razer not
including a dedicated remote control to
adjust the volume and other things with
the system because the control part by
itself is directly wired to the Razer
system so you have to have it within the
vicinity of these speakers so yeah I
just feel like they should have included
or more controller because my $300
Catana Sound Blaster speaker comes with
our motor controller so that's that's
that just to give users that extra Flair
these speakers do come with RGB lighting
specifically chroma lighting on the bass
stands so if you want to take advantage
of that and if you want to complement
your gaming setup then this could be a
pretty cool addition and of course you
can play around with different effects
and all kinds of stuff through Razer
synapse software which is great not to
mention these beakers do come with
Bluetooth
and it's bluetooth 4.2 to be more
specific so you can actually connect
your smartphone or either mobile device
to these speakers without a problem
what's even awesome or I guess a cool
again given that this is a 500 dollar
speaker system is that Razer has built a
dedicated app for both the Android and
iOS platforms so you can download it
through the Play Store and control
things like your lighting you'd also set
the different sound modes from thx to
Dolby virtual surround sound or even
playing with custom eq's through the app
which i think is pretty nice but let's
actually talk about the sound quality
and I'm gonna kick things off with the
cheapest pair here which is the Eclipse
Pro media 2.1 I was struggling to pick
my jaws off the floor after firing these
up for the first time seriously I
thought to myself how can such a system
cost $150 the detail with every
frequencies is so rich and clear you
won't be missing out on even the
slightest elements within a soundtrack
there is fantastic stereo separation and
the whole sound experience just feel
complete with the pro media 2.1 the base
is so tight and almost enriches every
beat that comes out of the whole system
no distortions whatsoever it's
dangerously powerful and you can feel
that I'm actually not surprised as to
how these speakers have the THX
certification because the hardware seems
to have done a really good job passing
those rigorous tests with flying colors
and these things can handle pretty much
everything that he throw at it and you
will certainly be pleased
I was certainly pleased a lot because
men for $150 this just sounds it just
sounds amazing there's also one thing
that I want to touch base on and that is
even at the slightest volume so say if
you turn the volume all the way say to
something around 10% or something like
that you're not gonna be losing the
detail with this sound because with some
speakers you kind of have to increase
the volume to experience the fidelity or
just being able to pick up those
frequencies but with this case you know
even if the slightest volume you can
still listen to those tracks comfortably
without having to sacrifice on things
like the bass because it's it comes out
in a really pronounced way it's super
it's not completely muted which is
pretty awesome and I'm really really
appreciate that fact with
new clips or with the cliff's pro media
2.1 speakers switching to the eraser no
more pro speakers and this was a little
bit different now initially I expected
the system to be a little bit more
enriched compared to the pro melee
speakers and they are to a certain
extent but I personally think that the
cost isn't justifiable for what you get
now just analyzing it from a sound
perspective there is fantastic
separation between the highest mids and
lows everything is crystal clear and
well projected so you won't really miss
out on the slightest elements now this
could just be me and remember speaker
reviews are subjective but I just felt
like there was not a whole lot of depth
to the body of sound on the razor's
compared to the cliff's pro media
speakers the dedicated subwoofer kicks
in a good amount of bass but it wasn't
as tight when compared to the clips it
just lacks the articulation in certain
areas at least that's what I thought
after constantly switching back and
forth listening to different genres on
both these speakers now guys I'm not
trying to bash razor and their expensive
system here in fact they sound
phenomenal for what they are because
they are THX certified and it is quite
an immersive experience especially when
you're gaming on them but considering
their 500l a price tag I just didn't
feel like I was mind blown or my
expectations it didn't really meet my
expectations after listening to the pro
medias because these by far in my
opinion sounded just a bed or a tad
better compared to the razor's because
it just had that depth to the whole body
of sound which the racers just lacked
now for gaming both these speakers do a
phenomenal job I actually ended up
playing overwatch
on both these speakers and to be honest
I was literally just blown away by the
whole experience because you do get that
oomph when it comes to firing gunshots
and all that kind of stuff it just feels
very immersive you can feel the
vibrations within your legs so it just
it just feels amazing when you're gaming
with these set of speakers especially
because that dedicated subwoofer more
specifically with the cliffs just sounds
phenomenal so having listened to both of
these speakers back and forth I think
I've come to a conclusion and that is
speaker technology has me really evolved
since 2004 in fact the only things that
we've seen improved over the course of
these years is the added features for
example Bluetooth connectivity a spot if
I connect another wireless features a
dedicated app to control a thing
within your speaker system and of course
RGB lighting because it's a thing now
and of course you also have a few things
that you can tweak in tune to help
immerse or create that immersive
experience for the end user but the
other day you know having tested the
normal pros and Eclipse pro media
speakers I just I just can't seem to
justify spending $500 for a system like
this unless if you really need to and if
you want to raise a fanboy if you have
to get the best or if you have to get
the best of the best from razor then
sure you can call it and spend five
hundred dollars but for for sound if
you're really if you're looking to get
an immersive experience out of the sound
and if you don't care about getting
bluetooth if you don't care about having
RGB lighting and build quality then I
think the Pro Mini is are still by far
one of the best sets that you can pick
up right now and of course $150 it's a
steal so I hope you guys enjoyed this
comparison between the Eclipse Pro media
2.1 and the Razer nilma pros what do you
guys think about it in fact would you
actually consider spending $500 for the
Nomo pros or are you actually interested
in the cliffs more than the razor's love
to hear thoughts in fact if you're an
existing owner of the pro medias what
has been your experience like and in
fact are you still enjoying your time
listening to the set I'd love to hear
your thoughts in the comments down below
