great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
harbour canucks and the note series from
fractal design just got an update with
the node 804 this line is designed with
a small form factor in mind and 804 is
actually the largest within the node
family yet pretty compact offering
excellent space efficiency and priced at
over $100 this just might be the cube
case for you the wide and short shell
design has got more attention as more
and more chassis are moved onto the desk
for that glorious showcase two-thirds of
the front panel is covered and brushed
aluminum plate with the ventilation for
the rest and the large size window to
reveal all the internal goodies on the
side we have a pair of USB 3 ports power
button audio jacks so there's no reset
button unfortunately and a slot loading
optical cut out the front panel just
pops open that can house dual SSDs and
the spot for the optical drive behind
which we've got dual dust filters as a
total of four 120 millimeter fans are
supported with one included also the
dust filters are accessible from the
bottom of the chassis without needing to
remove the front panel it is spaced
appropriately to allow adequate air flow
in the left chamber but if the optical
drive is installed they'll be kind of
flush right against the top dust filter
in the right chamber so airflow will
suffer the top panel is just a pig mesh
with a built in filter to catch all the
settling dust and the fins are angled
towards the back directing some of the
airflow noise away from the user so
that's good news and behind the panel we
find a variety of fan options so the
right chamber supports radiators up to
280 millimeters given you remove the
drive cages while the main chamber is
compatible with 240 millimeter radiators
as fan holes are spaced as far to the
left to avoid clearance issues with the
motherboard and you are kind of starting
to see the beauty of the 804 as its
water cooling options are truly
impressive for this form factor you can
still get dual 140 mm
in the main chamber but due to height
restrictions 280 million rads are full
right chamber only and one thing fractal
design did really well as well is sort
of the seamless integration between the
two chambers with large cutouts for
cable management and any size water
cooling tubing to pass through the 804
is equipped with more fans in the rear
allowing excellent cooling in both
compartments with both rear fans
included there's also a speed fan
adjustment for up to 3 fans that is
powered through a SATA port something
I'm happy to see and black cables for
simple routing fractal design I'm also
made sure to fully dust prove the 804 as
2 more filters are included at the
bottom so now let's take a closer look
inside then we get the C usual taste of
fractal attention to detail with the
white blade fans PCI brackets and the
drive cages are all white and full black
sleeved cables now this is a micro ATX
chassis so many components have been
moved behind the motherboard to keep
within the height limits of the 8:04
however it still supports graphics cards
up to 12.5 inches and 11.4 inches with
the bottom front fan installed the
bottom of the main chamber can house two
SSDs or three and a half inch drives and
if additional cooling is required to 80
millimeter fans are supported and coming
around to the other chamber the drive
cage allows for a total of eight three
and a half inch drives to be installed
unfortunately no SSD support here you
mount each Drive with screws and they do
sit on rubber grommets to prevent from
vibrations but I still would have liked
to see some type of tula smelting
positioning of each cage is also
flexible for example you can mount one
of them in front of the power supply you
still have over 190 millimeters of
clearance but you do lose out on these
convenient velcro straps for cable
management and there's also very little
room left behind the drive cage making
cable routing more difficult also the
middle rail that is needed to secure
either drive cage up top doesn't allow
any top fans to be installed so for
example if you want to have just one
drive gauge on the top position the
other fan slot is left underutilized
as there is no clearance for mounting
I also would have liked Verrazano Drive
orientation instead as this makes
swapping and replacing any of the drives
so much easier as with the default
vertical mount replacing any drive
inside a cage requires the removal of
the entire assembly and starting with
our build I really do love the large
velcro straps and from the power supply
to manage some of that clutter right
away and there are cutouts in the frame
to allow front panel connectors to be
routed properly and the same goes for
the rest of the internals as large
cutouts at the bottom and the side are
well positioned for clean cabling and
just to show off how the norator four
handles water cooling here's a system
with a 120mm ride mounted to the front
240 millimeter radiator up top in the
same chamber drive gauge in the opposite
chamber has been repositioned to the
bottom for this type of setup with a 280
millimeter radiator and push-pull for
incredibly powerful cooling setup that's
going to be very attractive for many
builders who don't want to compromise on
either the storage nor the radiator
options and I do have to say the node 84
is definitely among the more appealing
chassis within the rest of the dual
chamber and cube offerings as its water
cooling support is totally impressive
the case is fully dust proof with easy
to remove filters and excellent cutouts
to allow seamless routing between
chambers we have long GPUs and power
supplies are not a concern and storage
options are both adequate and flexible
to suit your configuration now my main
gripe with the node 804 is actually the
drive gauge system itself
it lacks SSD support actually quite
inconvenient if any drive needs
replacement also you cannot utilize the
top pant slot with just one of the cages
installed as the middle rail is on the
way and I feel this space could
potentially house even more mechanical
drives using a different cage system
with better space utilization our frog
design has released a highly competitive
dual chamber chassis complementing bolt
enthusiast builds and storage oriented
as well and we're giving you the Harwick
Knox
damn good and damn good value a words as
for $110 this is really
thing like it on the market but what do
you guys think of this note 804 and
would you potentially consider this type
of cube designs for your next build let
