great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with Hard
Rock Canucks and today we've got two
highly requests the chassis from
Thermaltake this is the urban t81
priced at $108 and I think it's a little
risky for thermaltake to approach this
price bracket as we are seeing more
value oriented the closures really
dominate the market and set the
benchmark for what to expect in each
price bracket so let's hope there's
enough functionality and unique features
packed into the t81
for this to be awarded the competitor in
today's oversaturated list of cases so
first let's start with the aesthetics
and Thermaltake sure does not disappoint
with very handsome full tower their
urban line is really meant to fit in the
modern space with brushed aluminum
accents curvy bottom and glossy frame
edges and ensure got character up top
I'm really happy to see six USB ports
two of which are USB three on your jacks
PR buttons and the fan speed control for
a low or high setting as the t81
features a fan hug behind the
motherboard tray 4/10 fans this is molex
powered only and not PWM unfortunately
so the hub does not connect to your
motherboard and therefore you cannot
monitor or control the fans from the
BIOS on your motherboard the top cover
is removable that has a built-in dust
filter so really glad to see that
further removing the top frame we get
access to the fan area a large 200
millimeter fan is included plus we get
support for triple 120 or dual 140 or
200 minimum fans so flexible cooling and
radiator options here and that is
exactly what we need to see for this
size and of course the price the front
panel opens wide at 180 degrees behind
which we find to optical slots and two
large removable dust filters that are
realistically more plastic than mesh and
I think you would actually do more harm
with restricting airflow
plus the panel closes flush right
against the filters with practically no
spacing in between so total front intake
is reliant on the side ventilation alone
and then we definitely would like to see
this changed now on a better note though
a couple of 200 millimeter fans are
included in the front so it seems a
stock cooling is pretty much maxed out
with a variety of other options
available like triple 120 or dual 140
lumen our fans are supported as well
with their corresponding radiator sizes
coming around to the back we get large
water cooling grommets two keys included
for the side panel the 140 member
exhaust fan eight PCI slots with plenty
of ventilation and in the bottom large
case feet throw with rubber pads and
this massive dust filter spending the
entire floor removal of which may get
problematic and I wish it's let out from
the side instead so coming to the side
panels they are a little different you
can actually lock them the window itself
is quite revealing while the smaller
panel covers all of the hard drives
after unlocking you push a button to
release the panel at the bottom the
window panel swivels open and is
removable
while the drive cover opens only at
about 90 degrees and one thing I wish
they were independent so you can maybe
access the drives without needing to
open the main panel internally I'm very
happy to see many cutouts with quality
rubber grommets pre-installed
motherboard standoffs and EA TX support
thanks to the roomy design the drive
cage system is modular with a total of
eight drive caddy supporting both SSDs
and mechanical drives the cages are
secured at the rear with thumb screws
and removing them opens up clearance for
a radiator and notice the mounting
strips for extra flexibility for both
120 and 140 millimeter fans there is an
additional bracket that holds a single
SSD and the mechanical drives so you're
not completely left without storage the
bracket can also support an extra fan
for improved air flow and two positions
for installation depending on your
configuration now with the bracket in
place holding them can could drive you
still have over four inches of spacing
inviting thick radiators and push-pull
setups furthermore the two optical bays
are easily removable with thumb screws
leave
enough clearance for a thick top 360 or
a 420 mm radiator and one in the front
this wall which is pretty impressive and
I really love how the t-80 one is so
water cooling ready supporting dual 420
radiators simultaneously plus it's very
user friendly with everything that is
removable secured with thumb screws plus
you can remove the panels themselves and
the support frame in the middle if
required for modding or potentially
repainting with the bottom platform
removed you can still mount a 240 or -
80 ml radiator allowing some water
cooling while not totally getting rid of
storage potential with still enough
clearance for a long hour supply that
actually sits on the raised padded
platform for better cooling and silence
with the cages in place we have over 15
inches of clearance so there are
absolutely no issues with GPU
compatibility and even with the bracket
installed there's plenty left for
enthusiast systems even if you place a
fan on the bracket and coming around to
the back this is one of the things get a
little bit disappointing and I'm not
really happy with the direction thermal
tech has gone for a cable management
system first there are no standard cable
type points instead we get these built
in flexible hooks that are only on the
left side and none in the center so as
you can see my 24 pin cable was left
unsecured and I would rather see
standard cable tie mounts all over the
tray plus these additional hooks as
otherwise the t81 really just fell to
the bottom of the list for such terrible
implementation of cable management and
career furthermore as you can see there
is no spacing between the motherboard
tray and the bottom so you cannot tack
your cables but the side panel is spaced
out about an inch away from the trace
you can still have some room to work
with but it's always unpleasant having
to deal with unsecured cables and also
the hassle of closing the panel because
of it and with the build assembled I
love the spacing of all the cutouts and
from the power supply and right below
the motherboard for outing all the
little things and this is what a full
tower should really feel like you know
ready for expansion without compromise
there's over three inches up top for
water cooling with these large cutouts
for routing of any type of case
and it really feels like it has
potential within the enthusiasts
water-cooling market and that's the
thing with the t81
it has impressive list of water cooling
support but proper drive cage system to
complement any configuration plus
removable optical base that really
proves thermal tank design this with
water cooling in mind the fan hub is
always a bonus although it's not pwm so
fan control is limited with just the two
settings and I have to give them this
unique side panel design it's refreshing
and it totally fits the urban character
however the t81
is surprisingly unoptimized for cable
management behind the motherboard tray
for its size without any proper cable
tech points and very inconvenient rear
panel that is just a hassle to closed
front design is incredibly restrictive
first with the panel itself then the
dust filters that are more plastic than
mesh and the overall build quality seems
off with quite a bit of flex and also
rattling side panels all for almost $200
is expensive considering this feels only
partially polished and I really wanted
to like this case giving the unique form
and the crazy water cooling support but
the t81
is a good example of how a few small
details can really ruin the
functionality of the entire enclosure
and that really hope we'll see major
improvements in the urban line from
thermal thing but we would love to know
what you'd like to see changed in this
specific case and I'm sure Thermaltake
would be happy to receive our feedback
along with yours so leave your comments
down below as always thanks for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
