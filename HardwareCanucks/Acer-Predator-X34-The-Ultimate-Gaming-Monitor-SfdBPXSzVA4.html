great technology selection and service
acer has been raising the bar lately
with a full lineup of high end monitors
that target the gaming market one of
their most recent additions has become
the most recognized monitors in industry
the predator x 34 it's big expensive and
it's supposed to offer huge benefits to
gamers who want smooth motion while
still retaining amazing image quality so
without any further ado let's check this
thing out
priced a little over $1,000
the x34 is seriously targeted towards
those enthusiasts who still desire the
best of the best paying that much will
get you a 34 inch curved IPS display
with a resolution of 34 40 by 1440 a
greater gray response time of 4
milliseconds great color depth and a
base refresh rate of 60 Hertz that can
be overclocked to 100 Hertz via the OSD
the cherry on top is the addition of
invidious g-sync module with a predator
gamers won't have to choose between a
lightning-fast refresh rate and image
quality any longer but before we get
into more specifics just look at that
display I have to admit Acer's stole my
attention with the x34 design the edge
to edge panel along with Acer's
excellent matte finish cuts down the
reflections pretty well and makes images
look absolutely stunning the chrome
stand is a great centerpiece for your
desk plus it's just as attractive as
attention-grabbing
as the predator x34 itself the backside
of the panel comes with a glossy plastic
finish that I'm not a fan of as it
attracts to a lot of finger prints but
I'm not too concerned about that since
it would be facing the wall for the
majority of the time do note that this
panel lacks swivel abilities which makes
sense considering the curvature of the
screen but on a positive side it does
offer 130 millimeter of height
adjustment and a whopping 40 degrees of
tilt from negative 5 degrees to 35
degrees the x34 makes use of a gentle
curve and it looks great especially when
gaming it is built to enhance the motion
and it does exactly that by almost
surrounding your vision with one
continuous image however in certain
games the curve can add visual artifacts
to menus and distort key elements of a
game interface the built-in LED
underneath the panel is a fantastic
addition and it can be customized to
different colors and I will guarantee
you that it will look awesome
with your setup and it also adds a bit
of backlight compensation to reduce eye
strain for anyone that finds the LEDs
distracting they can be turned off in
the OSD the IO selection on the x34 is
limited since g-sync can only be driven
via DisplayPort but you'll also find an
HTM
input audio out a USB 3.0 upstream port
and for USB 3.0 downstream ports you'll
find a lot of physical buttons for
navigating the on-screen display and
while testing they weren't as responsive
as what's offered on other monitors
we've seen but it gets the job done
when you press the Menu button you are
not greeted with the full OSD but
instead of small shortcut menu compiling
up quick access features like three game
modes that can be programmed to your
preference there's also an adjustable
overdrive that pushes more voltage
through the liquid crystal forcing them
to change from one state to another
faster for high refresh rates volume
adjust input selection and the option to
enter the advanced setup ASA also greets
you with the picture tab that lets you
switch between different profiles adjust
brightness contrast blue light dark
boost and adaptive contrast the color
tab lets you change the gamma color
temperature saturation and six axis
color the language OSD timeout refresh
rate display transparency and game mode
that can be set through the OSD tab
moving on to the Settings tab this is
where the magic happens the user can
switch between inputs turn on DTS for
built-in speakers change the ambient
light underneath the panel to different
colors adjust the wide mode and the best
part is overclocking the panel to 100
Hertz as I mentioned earlier you can
only use this via DisplayPort since HDMI
port here is only limited to 60 Hertz
now on to testing the picture uniformity
is not that bad actually
in fact it's above-average most of the
variance is due to the panel's curvature
and creating the same level of
brightness throughout the display is
difficult so it's nothing to be worried
about gaming on the x34 was such an
awesome experience I have to admit the
curve panel along with g-sync and the
option to push this beast to 100 Hertz
contributes to bring the level of
immersion to the next level but do note
that driving all these pixels at that
refresh rate requires a high end GPU
somewhere along the lines of 980 or
above g-sync itself is a revelation for
these larger monitors since it gives a
sense of motion fluidity even at lower
frame rates it also eliminates the
judder and tearing
normally associated with situations
where vsync is turned on and off
respectively more importantly it grants
the ability to utilize a slightly lower
powered GPU without any drastic negative
effects to the overall gaming experience
while as fast as refresh rate the curve
panel and gsync certainly helps immerse
you in games less expensive panels can
accomplish the same thing however where
the x34 takes things to the next level
is the inclusion of an IPS panel with it
the predator is able to display
extremely accurate colors reproduce a
stunning detailed image and offer a
contrast ratio that puts those
lower-priced
TN based alternatives to shame yes
you'll pay for it but the difference
really does need to be seen and to be
believed now is there anything wrong
with the predator X ray for well I could
complain about its price but gamers with
the necessary funds have been more than
happy to pay the cost of entry Acer
hasn't made this a plug-and-play
solution either since getting the full
hundred Hertz requires jumping through a
few OSD menus and overclocking the
screen other than that it's really hard
finding issues with what acer is
offering here and that's basically the
story behind the predator X 34 this was
my first time reviewing a monitor of
this caliber and throughout my testing I
was so impressed with the gorgeous
design the curved 34 inch display and
the exceptional gaming experience you
get this is totally worth the price you
pay for and it deserves the hardware
connects damn good award so what are
your thoughts on the Acer predator X 34
would you consider this a solid upgrade
to your current setup let us know in the
