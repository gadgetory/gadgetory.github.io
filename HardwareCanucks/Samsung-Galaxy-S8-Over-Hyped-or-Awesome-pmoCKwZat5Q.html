axe and welcome back to another video
copy text is over it's over and I'm
slowly recovering from jet lag plus
catching up with some sleep but
regardless of that today we're going to
be talking about this the Samsung Galaxy
has a plus now before we move on I need
to quickly mention that this is by no
means a full dedicated review video
because I'm sure you've watched
countless of them online I'll be
focusing this video on the things I
liked about this device and the things I
didn't like because I've spent nearly a
month using this as my daily driver so
here are my thoughts the first a message
from our sponsor the Graham spectrum
keyboard bike this soil comes with a new
mechanical agile switch with low profile
key caps with super fast response and
shorter actuation distance plus all the
customization included with RGB lighting
and macros for a premium user
alright let's address something that
anyone would think of when taking a
glance at VSA
it's just beautiful Samsung has
definitely brought their a-game to the
table after the note 7 recall and they
played it safe this time yet pushing the
limits of a modern smartphone design
I've got the midnight black bear in here
and I've got to admit everything from
the curved edges to the smooth metal
body or unibody construction screens
quality it's a marvelous piece of
engineering that one would have dreamed
four years ago that being said one of
the drawbacks to this design is the
implementation of Gorilla Glass 5 at the
back as it quickly picks up grease and
fingerprints which makes it almost
uncomfortable to use the phone at times
plus it also gets slippery thankfully I
haven't dropped this yet because that
would have been quite a disaster and
obviously a quick fix to this would be
to apply a skin of some sort but like I
mentioned in my g6 review video I would
appreciate if companies move towards
matte finishes in the future because I
preferred those over glass backs the
screen covers 80% of the body yielding
thinner bezels at the top and bottom
while the curved edges on the sides make
it impossible to distinguish it from the
body alone here's a shot of it sitting
next to the 6p yeah I really can't go
back to this phone because I'm so used
to Samsung's view
for infinity-edge display and it has won
me over with resistant bezels in one way
you have a lot of vertical wheels take
to work with multitasking Plus watching
native 21 by 9 content looks amazing and
that brings me to my next point the
display now remember I'm rocking the si
plus which sports a whopping 6.2 inch
qHD plus AMOLED display and given this
panels technology colors are super
vibrant with excellent contours ratio
and deeper blacks that I'm always a fan
of Samsung does include options for
different color profiles I ended up
using the basic mode as the colors
seemed more neutral to my eyes and like
I mentioned earlier watching content on
the screen was a pleasing experience
except for one annoying factor the
curved edges now I'm completely aware
that I'm contradicting myself here
because I just mentioned how beautiful
this phone looks like with these curved
edges especially when you're swiping
things from left to right it's a
seamless transition and works great but
when you're watching content the edges
get reflective and the content starts to
distort a little bit and I didn't like
that the g6 for example has a flatter
display without any curves so distortion
was non-existent and I preferred that
over the s8 screen sorry Samsung let's
also not forget to talk about big speed
because it's Samsung's way of saying
let's make a ripoff version of Google
now and that didn't turn out that great
you see I'm heavily invested into the
Google ecosystem and I do use Google now
on Android phones to check whether and
updates but Bixby is just so annoying it
certainly needs a lot of work done and
it's nowhere close to Google now at
least until the time I'm making this
video but you know what's even worse
assigning a physical button to activate
the damn thing there is no way to
reassign that button to launch another
app plus you can't disable it through
the settings it's also at an odd
location right beside the volume rockers
so you can imagine the amount of times
I'm accidentally triggered this feature
there are third-party paid apps that can
disable this feature but implementing
this physical button was a big mistake
from Samsung in the first place my
second biggest gripe about the si+ is
the location of the fingerprint reader
it's right beside the camera and that
made it difficult for my fingers to
reach and it's also not that accurate
compared to the 6p and the g6 I've ran
into a lot of times where the phone
wouldn't recognize my finger unless I
place it at a certain position it was
really a frustrating experience and I'm
aware of other biometric authentication
like face recognition that's a hit or
miss and iris scanner that kind of works
when I have my glasses on I appreciate
Samsung for including these features but
I'm not sold on them completely you know
what else I do like about the si+ it's
waterproof to be more specific it's
certified with the ip68 water and deaths
resistant rating and I've taken
advantage of that feature a lot of times
when traveling got to live that
germ-free life you know what I mean now
I'm not going to go in-depth into
software experience because there's a
lot of Samsung related features that I
honestly didn't care about you know me I
love a cleaner and simpler user
experience so just like any other
Android phones
I installed Nova my preferred icon pack
and called it a day that's the beauty
with Android because the user has full
control of the software and they can
customize the UI to fit their style
battery life on the si+ was great
samsung has packed 830 500 milliamp hour
unit inside this that gets me roughly
around 6 hours of screen on time the
phone charges via type C and it supports
quick charge 2.0 my usage normally
consisted of checking Twitter Instagram
taking photos browsing the web and
catching up on a few TV shows house of
cards season 5 is out by the way and I
completely binge watch the entire season
on my flight back to Toronto but what's
interesting is that I had 50% of
remaining when I landed albeit the phone
was on airplane mode but still very
impressive remember turning the
always-on display option will shorten
the screen on usage so be aware of that
and the last thing to cover here is the
camera and it's nothing short of
spectacular it's a 12 megapixel sensor
with an aperture stop of F 1.7 pictures
look fabulous on this thing and the
samples you're seeing now was shot in
auto mode without any adjustments to ISO
white balance etc auto focus on the
other hand is ridiculously fast in fact
it is one of the fastest I've come
across on an Android device after the s7
let me know what do you think about
these samples
so in conclusion I really have mixed
feelings about the galaxy A+
because for one this is the best Android
smartphone that Samsung has ever created
because it's beautiful especially with
these curved edges and the design is a
testament to modern smartphone
engineering the camera is outstanding
I'm sure you've seen that those samples
but it's not a perfect device at least
for me personally because the
fingerprint reader is at an odd location
the curved screen can get a little
distracting when you're watching content
the speakers are missed front-facing
speakers and the bottom facing ones on
these are not that great
I honestly also don't get the point or
the motive behind Bigsby especially
assigning a physical button to activate
that feature is pointless in my opinion
imagine the R&amp;amp;D that went into creating
it
you also can't forget the fact that this
is a Samsung device and the software is
known for slowing down over time I guess
I'll have to update you on that later on
well there you have it my thoughts on
the Samsung Galaxy s8 plus what do you
guys think about this device is this the
genius smartphone that you've been
looking forward to and for those of you
out there who are interested or si+
owners how are you liking it so far let
us know in the comments down below a new
bar with hurricane axe thank you so much
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
