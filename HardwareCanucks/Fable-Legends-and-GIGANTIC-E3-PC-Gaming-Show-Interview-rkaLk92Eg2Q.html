great technology selection and service
premiere video that all do you say what
we're looking at is the diverse set
environment that we're going to show off
right the great thing about they will
let them to get to save it to play on
your xbox one gameplay on windows in DC
and what we're really going to build
right now is very nice game later this
year is an incredibly cool soy-based
world if you can spend time in with lots
of different heroes whole characters
when the duck duck different creatures
to finance and all those options with
the air regardless of 5 from you or your
friend to find that way they'll stop and
i need to want to ask about the way that
you are able to use technology we talked
about on board isn't necessarily better
how do you do that do probably us
basically what it gives us how to do is
to put bored with ok so those holidays
right fundamentally no fable legends
about driving this beautiful world that
we never got receivable going back to
housing and i believe another place but
we can do it with you know a level
graphics on both platforms that our fans
deliver you know cutting-edge technology
read it for now triple bit over somebody
place then I was is free to play game
and girl isn't that dangerous stigma
that people have associated with that
the choice from difficult I know we
thought about it's a new kind of game
that we're building a table ladies and
you're giving one of the options but
everyone to play it and make your
decision it's a different kind of game
is not exactly like table 12 degrees has
got multiplayer that bill doesn't play
playoff positioning and I think that
meant for us that the only way for our
fans to find out that they were going to
love fable legends was sifting plate
when we talked about it a lot of that
meant that we wanted to put in their
hands in and let each other and how does
this allow you to do an extended
long-term development origins we're
going to plan for years of content
continue to making characters good quest
and things like that and there had it
some way that we could deliver that user
you know it could just be a six dollar
box or you know subscription for a kind
of all these days so bright when we talk
to audit Justin to be the best way to do
this continue to deliver a great
question head and keeping out new
features and euros for the two sides to
play I mean I cannot disagree with
beauty that we saw there but of course
I'm super excited something on the pc
but wait look so easily yeah it's great
really easy offense yeah we plug it a
controller you can use not some super
awesome of course James I've been
following gigantic for quite awhile
secondly this of the footage brought
here today and you're 44 unfamiliar with
my ks3 unusual for game plan yeah so
ethnic applies to Center dragons
gigantic creatures 505 PDP they only
this plan on across one and each team
consists of time you need hear it they
also have gone far I'm on the INF hole
and if the objective of the game so
you've got your guardian as theirs and
whichever garden guys and I know that
what are the core elements to the game
plays that its a mix of a shooter end of
the moment how do you merge those
together for the bureau great it's
actually been pretty go fluid it's
really fun for us and we're development
standpoint so you know if you look at
these different here at who's ready to
do is just a start with the basis of
shooter controls and we wanted to draw
on Lobos and friend
look at ways to make it a really
compelling strategic backcourt but each
one of experience gives us a chance to
create character they work for people
who have different skill set as players
or like a better place out so some of
these guys really requires two quick am
showing them more well I know those
autumn oak was the heroes are very
statistical base yeah it's defined by
those numbers but it sure so much of
what Sims life wouldn't define character
strengths would be players building
ain't that about a substance oh you know
we assume that you're good at a
character if anyone cared false floor
and some of this as a volume something
don't call for as much a teenage girl
some of them are much more about
tactical thinking positional thinking so
there's character development that
someone's these a coral creature and so
she's not really doing the comment of
something she's got to think
strategically about how to place some of
the characters they learn more about you
know when you're going to get in there
and
back I mean I know there's a lot of very
unusual hero design and everywhere some
of the ones that you're particularly
excited at all when were a lot of fun
you know I you don't experience you have
to go we can watch yeah all right we got
I had a lot fun on the team just just
letting people to put their create
vision anything so you know each
character who represent different
influences in different team members but
madoski is one character so that was
really a place that the forearm she's a
character that can run around heels of
being skilled video but she can also her
panties and with all the characters
during the course of the battle you get
to pick up for it with you go and
there's a bridge or branching upgrades
on me still if I can make your character
plane very insulated you can build a
phenoxy to be sure we ultimate healer or
you can actually build a new career
management well like I said following
developments your games with Tyson under
excited see full products and understand
according to screen the beta is in
August yeah where is going to be closed
beta though we're going to try to live a
pretty good number of people in it and
then for uh maybe later we'll gentlemen
thank you so much for coming out once
again</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
