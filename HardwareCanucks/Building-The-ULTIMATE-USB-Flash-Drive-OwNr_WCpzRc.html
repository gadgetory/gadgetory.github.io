possible and it's a very appealing
process because depending on the
capacity of you USB stick you can load
as many games as you want and having to
run them without reinstallation on
different computers just grab your drive
and go and also make sure to check out
our gaming on a USB stick video because
that will give you sort of a good
reference baseline as to what we'll be
doing today high-capacity USB storage
also have their place for creative
individuals who want to use them to
offload cache files and store different
information without having to unload it
onto the computer itself but today I'm
excited to create the world's fastest
gaming USB Drive using an m2 SSD and an
appropriate enclosure USB 3.1 gen2
enclosures in particular so let's see if
it's worth your time and picking up an
MD 2 SATA base SSD combine them with
enclosure like this and see if you've
got yourself the ultimate customizable
capacity based on the m-dot to drive
that you pick up use B stick for gaming
and productivity right after this oh
yeah it's the new dark base pro 900 the
white edition from be quiet all Y the
exterior and interior with black accent
look gorgeous with a tempered glass
panel and uniform paint job on the other
side too comes with a Qi charger up top
three excellent fans and a fully modular
interior as your playground get yourself
the limited white edition dark bass pro
900 only 2000 mate links below
alright so our hardware for this project
include a 275 gigabyte and a 2 SATA base
SSD that I picked up for under hundred
dollars now the center portion here is
important because nvme and the two
drives will not work with these
enclosures because the power limitations
of the gen 2 interface it simply is not
powerful enough for nvme storage the
drive is 80 millimeters in length the
longest out of the m the two selection
and therefore current enclosures must be
large enough to house these drives and
are significantly larger than the
regular USB sticks but I'm sure that
we'll see smaller enclosures to
accommodate for smaller em the 2 drives
and the cool thing obviously is that
whole DIY aspect of creating your own
USB stick so capacity will be based on
your budget and these M de 2 enclosures
range from 15 to 50 dollars depending on
the interface so I picked up a few to
compare two of which are USB 3.1 gen2
and the
is gen1 and I've compiled a list of all
the m2 SSD enclosures in the description
below so you can check them out now the
most convenient out of the three is the
silverstone ms on 9 that aside from
having the gen 2 interface and the
beautiful aluminum enclosure the USP
slider mechanism is absolutely brilliant
it is very satisfying it also does not
require a cap like on standard USB stick
nor does it require a cable like the
other two enclosures have which are
based on a type c port which is
convenient and have a type-a end of
cable now a quick note about the
silverstone closure that it is thicker
than most USB sticks so it will block
adjacent USB ports on your notebook now
the two things they all have in common
is a screw drivers included and they all
support the largest 2280 format but size
difference varies between all three plus
they don't all support the shorter and
the two drives now installation is very
simple on either enclosure just plug in
the m2 SSD and you have yourself your
own DIY USB stick ready for games just
make sure to format it to the NTFS
filesystem and of course plug it into
the appropriate USB 3.1 gen2 USB port on
your motherboard alright so the first
thing was to compare the speed
differences between all three enclosures
including the HyperX Irish Drive and the
m2 SSD plugged directly into a
motherboard so looking at crystal disk
benchmark obviously the gen 2 enclosures
are faster especially in the 4k
sequential which are important for
smaller files and we're about 10 percent
slower versus when the SSD is plugged
directly into my motherboard next I
copied my small 72 gigabyte video
project folder that maintained good
speeds until about 20 gigabytes after
which the buffer gets full on the SSD so
here we have the SSD being the
bottleneck with some interesting
variation between closures and the
HyperX savage USB stick has completed
the task much faster despite not having
those superfast burst speeds in the
beginning instead we see a consistent
transfer rate whereas the M that to SSD
really slows down after those 20
gigabytes doing the same procedure
backwards we still have some variation
that is not consistent I don't know why
but it's clear that the read performance
is superior from the MDOT 2 slot on the
motherboard and now let's shift our
focus to gaming so I transfer to folders
with many
any files 55 gigabytes worth to show the
benefits of higher 4k write performance
on the SSD versus the HyperX USB stick
that really slows down when those tiny
cs:go files are being moved
next is game discovery from Steam so it
basically looks for those files and
installs the game on their drive with
similar results across the board even
the native and that 2 slot is not much
faster versus the rest and loading into
dishonored to game save it gives us an
identical result of 19 seconds across
all drives and so from my time gaming
off the MDOT two USB stick regardless of
the enclosure I did not notice any
unusual behaviors the games were loading
just fine
there was no stuttering loading between
map sections was just completely normal
and I did not encounter any anomalies
that I did with the HyperX savage drive
in csgo where the game would just simply
freeze up randomly throughout
multiplayer or single-player and offline
mode and I'm thinking I might just buy a
one terabyte ml 2 SSD plug it into one
these enclosures and have my entire
gaming library on it so I'm a little bit
more flexible on how and how many pcs I
can just plug this into and have all my
Steam and origin and battlenet games on
it now it is weird that we're
experiencing these inconsistencies and
performance sometimes I get even better
right in the reap performance of a USB 3
port versus my 3.1 gen2 port on my
crosshair 6 hero motherboard so when I
tested this on my intel based x99
designator from gigabyte i got much
higher reading the write performance
through this little enclosure versus
when I tested the SSD natively on the
MDOT two slot on my aim the motherboard
and when it comes to file transfers on
my into machine the read performance was
a little bit quicker but the write
performance was like we saved a minute
and a half and that whole transfer time
but my M that to SSD is still the
bottleneck here capping out at 150
megabytes per second for the transfers
on both machines and so these results
are quite strange because for example
the HyperX savage USB stick is slow in
synthetic benchmarks but it outperforms
the m2 SSD and let's say transferring
files and stuff and even though I've dub
dated all my motherboard settings and
the BIOS settings and the USB drivers on
my Rison system it still is not as fast
as what I'm getting on my into machine
so perhaps more testing will come as we
figure out what's happening with this
rising machine but regardless you do
gain that convenience of having your
entire game library literally in your
pocket and having that flexibility of
moving it around between pcs if that's
something you're into and lastly from a
value perspective this whole DIY
approach is roughly the same price is if
you were to buy something like the my
passport SSD from Western Digital which
looks better and is also faster for the
512 gigabyte variant the only benefit
here is that you have more capacity
options for em that two drives and you
actually physically have the drive so if
you want to populate it into your
motherboard later on you can do that
alright so building your own USB 3.1
gen2 USB stick is super accessible now
plenty of affordable m2 SSDs in market
with plenty of enclosure options
available as well so you basically
decide how big of a USB stick you're
willing to carry then you courser avoid
pro gaming headset is comfortable
stylish in different colors delivers
fantastic wireless performance even for
competitive gaming with an all-new
microphone for clear communications
check out the void Pro Wireless or wired
in the description below and so this is
awesome for gaming productivity media
and yeah let me know if you guys are
interested in this concept of creating
your own USB stick for whatever purposes
that might suit your best I'm Dimitri
