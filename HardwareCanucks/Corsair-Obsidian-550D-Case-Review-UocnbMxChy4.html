the enclosure market with the release of
new series targeted towards a specific
niche but the Obsidian series sort of
losing the flagship status to the more
affordable carbide and graphite series
so we take a look today the most recent
addition to the obsidian series with
550d courses approached towards a new
chassis is not to redesign something
that works but rather incorporates
something they have been missing on all
their previous cases and that is sound
isolation and noise reduction the two
features that are the highlights of this
product the chassis is priced at $150
and when compared to cases offering
similar features the pricing is actually
pretty competitive and being one the
obsidians you are to expect the premium
quality on the exterior the case is
fairly simple it is constructed out of
rugged steel and a plastic accent for
the top panel the front panel is made of
aluminum definitely adds the elegant
factor to the enclosure and on the
inside noise dampening foam is placed
and so depending on the location of the
case the panel can be switched to open
in either direction at 180 degrees a
really smart way to utilize the front
panel without compromising its usability
and since the panel is attached with
plastic clips which may wear out with
use Corsair includes four additional
clips in case you need to replace them
and starting with the front panel
connectors we have a really sturdy power
button and the recent button audio ports
that match the color theme for the front
panel 2 USB 3 ports with USB 2 adapter
and keep in mind if you have anything
plugged into those USB ports opening the
panel to the left may cause some
clearance issues and the same goes for
the audio ports next up the case has
four optical drives below which the
front intake fans are located behind
this removable cover with an extra layer
of the noise absorbent and check this
out a magnetic dust filter that's an
absolute breeze to remove for cleaning
notice also there is some ventilation
around the front panel to allow for the
airflow take a look at the side panel
Corsa gives the users two options either
to keep the cover on for silence or
optimize the airflow with the extra fans
and a nice little touch by force there
are these rubber grommets for the fan
mounts to minimize vibration and finally
a dust filter for this side panel that
conveniently removes with these in the
back we have two buttons to remove the
side panels our regular exhaust fan and
i/o slot a PCI expansion slots and some
water gun holes and a bottom mounted
power supply with a dual slot dust
filter the case is elevated by these
rubber feet which would also contribute
to minimizing the overall noise the top
panel also has a cover for the fans
including the noise absorbing material
and another magnetic dust filter so you
see the 550d is fully dust proof with
hassle-free cleaning options so getting
inside the case is super easy just push
the button and pull off the side panel
and as with all the covers we've seen so
far a thick layer of noise dampening
foam is attached to both side panels now
looking at the actual internals not much
has changed in the layout resembles that
of the first Carbide serious cases the
only difference we can notice is the
slightly higher tone panel which would
allow a standard radiator and one set of
fans to be installed without interfering
with your motherboard the four optical
drives use a tools melting mechanism and
then two hard drive gauges or removal no
need to take out the toolbox just a
couple of thumbscrews and you're good to
go
removal of the top hard drive gauge
allows for installation of longer beta
cards and just get a better clearance
for the front intake but the hard drive
cage can also be mounted solo on the top
which would leave room in the bottom for
a potential water cooling configuration
the tools mounting brackets are
extremely easy to work with and have SSD
support that can now be placed in the
middle of the bracket without any
clearance issues in
the cages came out 120 millimeter fan
and Corsair provides the appropriate
screws to do so and moving on the CPU
cut out this fairly large should
accommodate most motherboards with
quality rubber grommets around the
motherboard tray to do hole your cable
management with black front panel
connectors that makes you jump even
easier in total fans fans can be
installed for an optimal airflow but the
sides and top covers must be removed
before the air to move otherwise they
will choke the fans it would be nice to
see a chassis that can fully optimize
its cooling potential without
compromising on the selling point in
this case at the back there is a fair
bit of room to work with for your cable
management however since the side panel
is flat most of your cables will be
concentrated behind the hard drive cage
and not behind the motherboard and after
everything is in place the 550d is no
surprise a breeze to work with and
cleans up all the cables without any
hiccups and with the hard drive cage
removes graphics cards in lengths of
seventeen point eight inches are
supported but is really mental direct
the airflow towards the main components
and spying graphics cards today don't
really see the 12 inches mark so to
conclude the Obsidian 550d is really
just a new facelift it doesn't bring
anything new to the table from the
inside just coursers usual standard with
excellent build quality it is the
Obsidian after all cable management
internal hardware options and full dust
cover all extremely well designed to
work with enthusiasts and the highlight
of the chassis is the redesign exterior
it has only one goal
and that sound dampening it does a
really good job keeping the noise in
when poor enthusiasts who want the
powerful but quiet built this is
definitely an item to consider the
chassis still offers plenty of airflow
options throughout but removing the
noise dampening side and top panels sort
of defeats the purpose and that's the
major flaw with this
you have to choose between silence or
airflow or something in the middle as
installation of fans of the top is a
must and putting the cover on completely
chokes the pants
overall the chassis sucks up well within
the enclosure market as it is priced
competitively for stairs at empathy
silent the closure was a good try but
when the user has to choose between
airflow or silence it is a major
drawback and limits the full potential
we were expecting and that is it for
this review thank you guys for watching
and we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
