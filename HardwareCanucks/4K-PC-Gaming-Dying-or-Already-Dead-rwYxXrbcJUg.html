why 4k gaming is dying or already dead a
trend that's been amplified by the
rising prices of GPUs and monitors and
continued scaling issues in Windows yet
we are constantly bombarded with dislike
for key marketing material letting us
know it's disliked luxurious and
hassle-free experience it is not let's
discuss right happiness the new master
keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic rest rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection cooler master
doing it right check it out below
alright so before getting into the 4k
gaming discussion let's talk about some
of the negatives that you'll encounter
outside of gaming so weirdly Windows
scaling still does not properly support
4k resolution like opening the Nvidia
control panel and the font doesn't
follow my scaling properties which I've
set to 125 percent why opening native
computer management tab gives us
slightly blurry text why I am happy to
say though that Adobe finally fixed
scaling issues with Photoshop and
Lightroom in Windows so a 4k resolution
for those applications now makes total
sense
the next relevant thing to discuss would
be monitor size so I've got to
experience something very unique which
was the 43 inch panel from LG and it was
truly something to game on but for that
you need more distance between the panel
otherwise it's just way too close to
your face for this regular on desk use
which is why most common 4k displays
range in 27 inches to 28 inches which is
that perfect desktop size for the
monitor but the main benefit of the 4k
resolution is kind of diminished because
you know the 4k scaling is best at 32
inches and above because at the
hundred-percent scaling on my 27 inch
panel I cannot see anything at an arm's
length distance that's ridiculous so I
have to scale everything into 150% which
is the recommended space which gives me
the exact same real estate as you would
find on a 1440p display at the 27 inches
as well so what are you gaining here
slightly more pixel density it slightly
more clear or text but you can only
notice it if you're like
pixel peeping and close so the one
benefit at 27 inches with 4k display
would be scaling at 125 percent so you
get slightly smaller text but it's not
like super tiny and for me it is more
comfortable and you get a little bit
additional real estate than what you
would find on a 1440p panel and finally
let's talk about 4k gaming so my first
4k playthrough was with titanfall 2 it's
because I actually received a monitor
right around when the game came out and
decided to give it a try to see what the
experience would be like and yes it was
absolutely gorgeous and seeing the
sharpness and the detail something that
was out of my monitor was just
incredible to me but I had this like
internal conflict because I'm coming
from a much higher refresh rate display
144 Hertz in particular to 60 Hertz and
that's where I kind of thought that this
resolution detail is there but I really
missed the whole fluidity aspect and so
I think that is what plagues that entire
4k category even with my GTX 980 and the
Rison 1700 EXA 3.9 gigahertz and 32
gigabytes of RAM I still have to lower
endgame resolution to achieve my optimal
frame rates because remember 4k is 8.3
million pixels and your graphics card
has to drive those pixels not just you
know give you a just an image on display
but has to constantly rework them and
that requires a lot of GPU power and for
reference 1440p is only 3.7 million
pixels and that is 44% of 4k and 1080p
is only 2 million pixels which is 25% of
4k so yes you would need an extremely
powerful GPU and an overall system to
deliver playable frame rates at 4k which
is why over 70% of users are still on
1080p resolutions 1440p follows with
only 3.5% and less than 1% use 4k this
place as their primary based on this
esteem survey and add to this 10 of the
most common GPUs in this hardware server
are not even capable of 4k gaming maybe
the gtx 1070 at low to medium settings
and GPUs that are capable of running 4k
resolutions with good frame rates are
super expensive the 1080 1080
Titan series the aim D stuff is just
outrageously expensive right now all
thanks to mining which is a big
deterrent of going towards the 4k like
gaming system trying to build something
that is capable to run something
playable at that resolution but luckily
the mid-tier cards like the gtx 960 have
not been massively affected by increase
in prices which is why the market has
seen like this really big uptake in
those mid tier carry cards because 4k is
no longer priority it's kind of like
unachievable and unattainable but what
is attainable is all that 1080p goodness
and running really good frame rates at
that resolution and above up to 1440 P
and here where I think the good
framerate conversation kind of splits
the user base based on their own user
experience so for me I like 100-plus FPS
because that gives me the most fluid
experience I feel like my aim is
one-to-one with the monitor and the
mouse and I'm willing to take a hit on
the resolution and even game settings
for graphics in order to achieve the
smoothest possible frame rate without
you know completely diminishing the
graphics fidelity and like not just
looking at weird pixels on the screen
with 4k it's very difficult even with
lower settings to achieve desired frame
rates like a hundred plus good luck my
friends but even if I had some
performance wiggle room I would
prioritize on in-game graphics settings
first make sure the game looks looks
prettier than the resolution and also
remember for lower resolution monitors
let's at aap and 1440p we have super
sampling and in both Nvidia and AMD have
their own versions with DSR and VSR that
allows you to basically have this like
4k image that would be super sampled
into your 1080p or 1440p display so you
get sharper images and without needing a
larger resolution display but of course
it's still as power-hungry on your GPU
and your hardware as you would run it on
like a native 4k display but coming back
to that primary limiting factor of
refresh rate at 60 Hertz you know why
would you want to play a 4k 60 Hertz
with anything competitive or FPS you
know csgo
dota 2 overwatch
filled one pop G all those games require
your attention and like the fluidity of
the environment so you can win you know
you're not there to like basically enjoy
the the gaming environment so 4k at
sixty with any of those games doesn't
really make sense and even with more
beautiful games like Assassin's Creed
origins you would get a better visual
experience by bumping up your graphics
settings first before bumping up the
resolution but for strategy games I get
it for something slower paced sixty
Hertz is not an issue and 4k would
deliver that beautiful detail that you
can expect so it would really complement
games like civilization Warhammer
company of heroes etc and my
recommendation for gamers is to invest
into high refresh rate monitors freesync
g-sync
IPS all those things that combined into
like a really good solid experience both
in gaming and productivity on the 1080p
and 1440p side before jumping into 4k
and price-wise you're actually at a
major advantage having all these extra
features and a slightly lower price
point than you would can expect from a
similar 4k priced panel at 60 Hertz from
the same brand and we also cannot ignore
the rise of popularity for ultra wide
gaming monitors that deliver such a more
unique experience than traditional 4k
and they have that like perfect middle
ground between traditional 1440p and 4k
monitors and if you decide to go with a
non IPS 1440p panel they are much
cheaper and yet still deliver a pretty
decent gaming experience at high refresh
rates and now let's have this
hypothetical where price is not a
barrier to entry we still have this
massive roadblock of actually accessing
the panels because manufacturers are not
producing 4k high refresh rate monitors
and we've seen a Sue's and Acer teases
where they're 4k 1 144 Hertz displays
with HDR and all types of other goodness
but they've been delayed until unknown
time in 2018 and we're far from a point
where 4k gaming makes sense because
1080p still dominates you know ultra
wines are becoming more abundant and
1440p at 144 Hertz just makes more sense
for productivity and gaming than 4k at
60 now there is one exciting development
in 4k
Gaming and that is the appearance of a
65-inch 120 Hertz monitor we saw them at
CES and they look fantastic and the game
experience is awesome too because
they're HD are ready and like all types
of bells and whistles in there too and
so on that scale 4k totally makes sense
the gaming experience is fantastic but
with the demand being so low you are
basically soaking up the early adoption
cost and so the buyer pays that extra
premium because you are one of the first
venue courser avoid pro gaming headset
is comfortable stylish in different
colors delivers fantastic wireless
performance even for competitive gaming
with an all-new microphone for clear
communications check out the void Pro
Wireless or wired in the description
below and to conclude I think 4k PC
gaming is not dying because it never
actually was part of the vast majority
of gamers
despite being constantly bombarded from
all sides about this whole notion of 4k
gaming is better and the insane GPU
prices will continue to be a massive
roadblock to the adoption rates of high
resolution displays for the foreseeable
future alright so that's all I have to
say on the topic let me know your
thoughts and what has your upgrade path
been like to getting to where you are
now and if an upgrade is in the pipeline
what are you considering of getting in
terms of monitor are you thinking of
going 4k 60 or potentially 1440p at high
refresh rate and I've listed a bunch of
recommended monitors down the
description below so check them out if
you want to see what's available and
what the prices are like so yeah let's
have the conversation in the comment
