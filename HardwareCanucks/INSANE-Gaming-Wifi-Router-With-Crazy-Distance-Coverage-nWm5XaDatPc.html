probably watching this video on your
smartphone your notebook or a desktop
computer all connected to your home
Wi-Fi network we all know where the
signal is best in places where it just
doesn't want to penetrate may be due to
thickness and material of the walls
distance from the router and many other
variables and the best Wi-Fi network is
a simple one
no dropouts a powerful connection
throughout your home and simple hardware
upgrades to expand your network to cover
those dead zones and so today we're
talking about asu's a imesh which is a
new feature lets you combine multiple of
Asus router x' together they don't have
to be identical by the way and create
your own mega Wi-Fi network so you can
have Wi-Fi literally anywhere even in a
nearby park as long as there's a power
source for your router the new master
keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic rest rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection Coolermaster
doing it right check it out below now my
home isn't large enough to showcase the
true potential of a imesh you know this
is more targeted for multi store homes
for really large square footages like
2,000 square feet or about 200 square
meters for outdoor areas too so in this
video I'll show you how easy and simple
it is to set up and also showcase my
little experiment to get Wi-Fi in the
nearby park now before the arrival of
the ROG rapture router I had no signal
in the kitchen even though it's less
than 10 meters away from the source in
my living room from the tp-link router
which I thought was powerful and I
thought that the signal just cannot
penetrate through the concrete walls but
after upgrading to the GTAC 5300 it
expanded my coverage to the kitchen and
beyond
where I now get 85% signal strength in a
spot where it was previously completely
absent
and so this beast of a hashtag drone
like spider router is what we'll use as
the AMS router or the source for other
routers to communicate with and this is
where we use the older but supported
routers as a mesh nodes to create that
mega Network and you can see a full list
of supporter routers online on the AMA
product page now the setup is super
simple first step is to upgrade the
firmware and all the routers to support
the new AMS network it actually prompts
to do this right away at the start when
they're plugged in to avoid
incompatibility later the second step is
to have all your AMS nodes close to the
main router for that initial search they
just need to be powered on
so no land connection necessary no
internet connection necessary there just
be found through their own unique SS ID
and after that they are registered as
your AMS nodes and you can unplug them
and move them into the dead zones now if
the nodes are not found during the
search you can manually assign the
router to operate as a a mesh node after
which he'll show up or the easier way is
to just simply factory reset we had the
button in the back and we automatically
detected as the node when the search
continues and once configured you can
rename the nodes you can see how many
nodes you have in total and how many
devices are connected to each node as
well but despite having three routers I
just see it as one network broadcasting
in 2.4 and 5 gigahertz connections and
this means wherever I'm in the space and
costly connected to the most powerful
signal possible so if I'm switching
between the kitchen and my bedroom that
seamless switch happens I don't even
realize it because I'm on this one
network and there is absolutely no
interruption when that switch happens
and this is where my experiment comes in
all right two nodes on the a a mesh
network right now is being recognized
both routers the kitchen one is getting
full signal which is awesome and the car
one is downstairs which about 60 meters
away and we're almost getting full
signal North even 2 bars full 3 bars
awesome all right people the car router
is here and check this out so we are
powering it via 12-volt inverter and no
additional Ethernet cable required it
just requires some power and it's
communicating with the other AI mesh
nodes to get us to full power internet
let's check out the speeds
all right so opening up one of our
videos inside a car about 6070 meters
away from my apartment we're using the
Asus router over here I've just
connected to a 5g network
through the source that's in my living
room and we're right now I'm gonna watch
some 4k videos no problem okay how about
the part that hasn't buffered yet
obviously would not be a networked video
without showing some fortnight I'm
kidding but the reason why I'm showing
this is because so we are actually in
the multiplayer game right now and what
is our Pegman is like over 40 it's
something like 1550 what when you play
normally what do you get around 40 to 16
14 to 16 so the the margin of that
difference probably not as significant
as before and I mean you plank in plain
port like multiplayer inside the car
about from from this guy this this guy
is doing a very good job communicating
to the other router that is upstairs and
do you feel any latency like when the
pressing spacebar or anything let up mmm
for now no I'm not feeling anything
wrong with the game it's running okay
and so after a little bit of fortnight
we have 0% packet loss which is actually
pretty cool to think about so the AMS
network signal was perfect having the
main router in the living room one node
in the kitchen and the second node in
the car to create a unifying network
without interruptions and with this car
experiment I decided to place the
kitchen node onto the balcony because it
would just completely fill the outdoor
area with Wi-Fi and so for example it
would be a perfect opportunity to fill
your front yard or backyard as long as
the router is protected to get you
reliable Wi-Fi where there was none
before okay so here's the second test
using g-force now so this is like the
ultimate network test we are streaming
from a server in Frankfurt so pretty far
away and I'm getting full 1920 by 1200
resolution at 60 FPS on my macbook pro
playing csgo and by the way g-force now
is a cloud gaming service from Nvidia so
everything is running on the cloud so
you're just receiving the video feed so
the most important variable here is your
network and since the closest service to
Bulgaria is Frankfurt
the main drawback is latency okay so
this next test is pretty crazy I have
calculated to move about 50 meters away
from my last node which is on the
kitchen on the balcony right now so it
is exposed to the park area
and I am in g-force now on the Frankfurt
server playing cs:go casual still
receiving full signal at 60fps 1920 by
1200 resolution I'm experiencing a
little bit of latency with the you know
with mouse movement and stuff but
absolutely no framedrops and the network
is solid and stable using this
additional Wi-Fi adapter from a soos now
of course you would not be playing
GeForce now like some competitive games
through all these layers of networking
but just to showcase how it is working
and everything is just going fine of
course there is latency because I'm so
far away from the service but the
networking side of things is working
flawless and that's pretty exciting ok
guys so this is crazy I've just moved a
hundred meters away from the node
playing 4k video on YouTube as you can
see right now and yeah full 4k
resolution no buffering whatsoever maybe
like one or two seconds of buffering and
we're back into the video that is
incredible of course I'm using the Wi-Fi
adapter here so my signal strength is
much better versus built-in Wi-Fi on the
MacBook here but the signal strength and
the distance it's kind of crazy thank
you a imesh and the best thing about
this whole system is the expansion
element in my opinion because if you
already have an Asus router that has a
MF support adding another one as a node
there's a possibility to expand your
range and love how everything is just
broadcasted is this you know one network
you don't have to connect to those
individual SSIDs because everything is
just in this one bubble of network and
you just pick 2 point 4 or 5 gigahertz
and you find and I'm pretty impressed
with the additional range I got having
one node on the balcony sure it's in
this open space nothing interacting it's
not inside the building and then I was
within the line of sight of the router
and also using the additional USB Wi-Fi
adapter but it's pretty awesome how you
can cover such large vast distances
outdoors while also having the ability
to you know fill in the internal
structure with two or three routers to
have like no dead zones anywhere it's
pretty fantastic
and shows the true versatility of this
AMS system alright guys so that is my
experience with Asus AMS I love the
simplicity of this entire system you
know even if you unplug and power down
on the nodes
you'll still remember it as a node when
it's back up and running because it's
already registered on the main a imesh
router but I'd love to hear what type of
network you're running in your own home
and if you're experiencing any dead
zones and might you potentially go the
AMS route let me know in the comments
below I'm Dimitri thanks for watching

will see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
