something that you've all been asking
for but so far we have reviewed 21 cases
on the channel for 2018 but this might
be the case of the year we'll see now
some of you may call me a fan thanks
fanboy but who doesn't get excited about
their flagship and closure let's unbox
oh man what a pleasure seeing DX check
this out a thank-you note animal
accessory pouches Wow
so inside they receive the mini ITX I'm
great kid
it is optional II have to buy it
separately and looks like some hard
drive caddies
well the waiting for this case is no
more let's check it out right after this
menu and their Max lick fusion is their
first addressable RGB all-in-one cooler
with a standard 240 ml rad and
absolutely beautiful RGB ring
illumination on the fence and the pump
to highlight that unique flow indicator
through the transparent top check out
the lick fusion down below so this one's
gonna be a good one let's begin
Soph antics to me has always delivered
that competitive price point which
they're kind of known for and the evolve
X launches at 199 dollars which may push
the boundaries of Kay's features in this
price bracket and really highlight the
shortfalls of many cases in this price
territory of like 150 to 200 dollar
price point because this thing is
absolutely loaded with features now
design wise it's a familiar structure
unmistakeably and evolve enclosure it's
available in black gray and silver I
have the silver one here it's got an
aluminum exterior which looks fantastic
and has that good mix between clean
lines and curvature and to the touch it
feels awesome and it's completely
refined no sharp edges anywhere the
glass is perfect so don't have to worry
about like cutting yourself open when
handling any of the panels which is a
good thing because we have easy access
for that interior frame
by removing all the panels and it's
certainly something that you appreciate
after the assembly is complete because
trust me many cases in a similar price
point do not deliver that frustration
for experience like Devo legs does so
the main physical changes now all
revolve around air flow this means
larger spacing on the front panel and
deeper side cutouts this was an air for
talking point on the original so now it
is 3x larger the top panel is now higher
with much larger ventilation strips on
the sides minimizing the rebalance
factor for exhaust and allowing that
airflow to exit and I only wish that we
saw that ventilation pattern somewhere
else on the case for cohesion purposes
because it's only the top it'll be cool
for it to kind of like span on the
interior somewhere so that you can tell
it's not just like an add-on later on
but kind of like a thought that ties
into the overall design now the side
panels put so many other glass mounts to
shame because they swivel to open are
removable
have an appropriate blackout perimeter
to hide the frame underneath and
complement the shape of the front
element and can even be secured at the
front with two thumb screws during
transport furthermore the rubber around
the panel's help to seal the interior
for better air pressure and actually
block the noise which is especially
noticeable with the GPU the only thing
to be aware of is the tilt of the empty
enclosure if one of the side panels is
removed and you open the other one but
this doesn't really happen if the system
is assembled the i/o is hidden behind
this panel we have a Gen 2 type C port
on here with a pretty long cable along
with a button for RGB control for
cycling and color because that is
actually another big addition to the X
the lighting is now a bigger part of the
score you can see it highlights the area
behind the front panel with a really
soft spill and it continues on the
inside with that thin strip kind of
dividing the main chamber from the power
supply shroud it's a tasteful
integration with several presets and
colors available and of course since
there are all addressable LEDs a 3-pin
addressable connector is included for
your motherboard to allow that full RGB
sync and the ambience as you can see of
the sliding looks stunning it's not too
harsh it's not like right in your face
and blinding you it just looks awesome
now the LED strips are actually at
- behind the front panel with this three
prong connector on it so you don't need
to handle any wiring when removing it
because it is completely wireless now
behind the front panel is a dust filter
with mounting rails for triple 120 or
140 Miller fans with their respective
radiators and you can see the panel is
spaced out for better airflow so in
total we have three 140 mm fans included
with high static pressure at 1200 rpm
the top panel is secured with two thumb
screws at the back and here we get a
rail system much like we see at the
front for triple 120s or dual 140 mm
fans with multiple cable tie points
available we also have a fill port
closer to the front where your reservoir
might be located and the bracket is also
fully removable for easier installation
from the top there's also another fill
port located at the front to accommodate
your water cooling loop I do like that
we have three vertical PCI slots
available to space out your GPU away
from the side panel and this optional
220 millimeter riser cable is available
for $30 which is optional and at the
very top is our optional mini ITX
motherboard mount that would complement
that additional vertical GPU mount so
this ITX motherboard tray is an optional
$20.00 accessory it attaches directly to
the top of the case and has its own
power button which will be accessible
from the back and we'll explore this
entire dual system compatibility inside
the evolve X when the revolt X power
supply comes out that is a single power
supply that has dual eight pins dual 24
pins so you can use one power supply to
power two systems so stay tuned for that
as for included accessories I love the
toolbox it's always super handy the
instructions manual is definitely one of
the best I recommend you take a look at
it the adhesive fantex logo is here
because aside from the fan Tech's text
on the power supply shroud it is nowhere
else on the case which I kind of
appreciate we even get a GPU anti-sag
bracket that actually works and the
magnetic top cover that you can install
at the front or the back to block the
recirculation of air if you're mounting
dual 120 or 140 mm fans up top for
storage we get for drive caddies they're
recommended to be installed in pairs
either in the main chamber for a total
of six or four in the bottom chamber you
just
have to keep in mind the PSU clearance
if these are installed at the bottom and
you also have to kind of deal with the
somewhat unclean area around these
brackets in the main chamber because of
all the exposed cutouts underneath it
and so let's go inside and you can see
the original interior and the four
plastic covers near the front they have
some mobility you know from left and
right to reveal the cutouts underneath
with the intention to close them and
cover the exiting cables now the thing
is it doesn't work that well in practice
because the spacing from the frame is
not that deep and a large portion of
that cable cut out is actually revealed
and I kind of wish that we had the
rubber grommets here as well the power
supply cut out is quite thin giving the
impression of a less tall power supply
shroud which is quite nice and the front
section is already open with 95
millimeters of clearance for a radiator
installation I also like the sliding
door for PCI cables that can open based
on the thickness of your cables and
they're just a really easy way to secure
whatever's coming out of it and overall
I would say this is the Fred approved
interior it's not too roomy the space is
utilized well for a variety of systems
but the biggest design change is
actually behind the motherboard tray and
I love this direction to simplify cable
management work in total so here we get
to swivel brackets that hide the common
area where the cables are normally
passed through and since the right panel
is also glass it will basically
camouflage any mess that might be stuck
there but you are actually well equipped
for dual channels for cables with strong
velcro straps and this bottom paneling
hiding anything that in that power
supply chamber and these panels also
have secondary functions for storage
housing three SSDs each the mounting is
simple and these brackets have deeper
spacing where the SATA cables are
located so that's smart and they're
actually totally removable for
convenience I also like how we have a
discreet fan controller up top with
three three pin and four four pin
connectors with either SATA power or PWM
control via your motherboard and this
hub is in the perfect location to deal
with any cable management's for fans
installed at the front the top or the
rear now for my system build I decided
to go with something simple because I'm
waiting for that revolt X power supply
to do the dual system configuration so
for
the standard build absolutely no issues
handling the large CPU tower all the
cables exiting on the interior aside
from those covers not exactly
fully covering up the cable area and
therefore they kind of look misaligned
and so that is kind of like my only
point of critique for the interior but
otherwise its flawless and it's actually
the back section that's more exciting
because these SSD doors kind of change
the game how you approach cleaning up
your entire build it's super user
friendly dealing with those dual
channels for cables but then you close
up this area and you might as well just
leave the glass panel off it looks
fantastic
I love this tooless approach and my only
point of advice is to push the SATA
cables into the corner when closing the
doors to avoid any uncomfortable bending
now in my temperature testing dealing
with the default fans the front panel
and the dust filter do impede air flow
it's not a significant barrier only a 3
and a 5 degree Celsius Delta for the CPU
and GPU respectively and I will be
installing the new Noctua fans later on
for my actual system to give me a little
bit more airflow and also more fans in
general and so the Evolve x is just such
a nice refresh and the needed reminder
for many other case brands that
refinement is key the user experience
with the evolve X is the definition of
premium and some might call me a fan Tex
fanboy because I might not get as
enthusiastic about other cases in this
price point but the attention to detail
with the evolve X is highly appreciated
and it definitely deserves the harbor
canucks
being good award treat your ears with
the incredibly comfortable
HD 5/8 X Jubilee headphones from mass
drop and some Heiser delivering sound
expected from $500 headphones but only
for 150 bucks making it one of the best
price to performance skins available
check out and join the drop down below
alright guys so stay tuned for my dual
system configuration 8700 k-8 is 600 K
dual GPUs hopefully those are TX Nvidia
cards Boyden dual coolers and one power
supply should be fun now if the $200
price point was in your budget would you
choose something like this for your next
build Y or not let me know in the
comments below most likely this is going
to be the tower of 2018 because it's
just so feature-rich
and I would say like the price point
$1.99
is expensive but so competitive and like
really beats out anything in this price
point from Corsair coolermaster NZXT
yeah all right guys I'm Dimitri
