award-winning fantex our trusted memory
partner Corsair and NCIX EVGA seems to
have a knack at really looking for ways
to push Nvidia silica in such attractive
ways this year at CES we saw a couple of
new iteration GPUs including the new
kingpin card starting with the cost of
performance leader the GTX 970 EVGA
pushed their already successful FTW
platform further by creating the FTW
plus card finally with an included
backplate plus a slightly longer body
because of it they've also added a
support plate onto the PCB that calls
the PCB and all its components EVGA was
able to also expand its power envelope
and push this GPU a little bit further
with power efficiency from the fans
while maintaining what is promised to be
exceptional quality and pulling
performance we also saw asset that
cooled GTX 980 hydro now this form
factor has proven to deliver exceptional
cooling performance it doesn't have a
backplate oh but includes a 120 ml rod
and an internal fan controller which
allows for this beauty to run below 50
degrees Celsius under load will be
testing it ourselves to see how far we
can push this thing to overclock the
tubing has a fabric material finish that
should be long enough for any case
mounting with the shroud removed you can
see EVGA has kept up the blower style
fan to make sure any heat inside the
housing is removed so this is an
excellent card made even better and
finally the gtx 980 king paint is a
beast EVGA has decked out this card with
RGB lighting that would be controlled in
a software to help you color match this
beauty to your color-coded build all
display outputs have been pushed to a
single slot so placing a water block on
this thing would actually turn it into a
single slot GPU very cool to see as we
all know the monster King things series
are capable of insane overclocks and
this one shouldn't defer for those
wondering it needs two 8-pin and 16 pin
and looking at the cooler it is massive
features some pretty attractive accents
like the transparent elements in the
center and off in the corner
and it also very told GPU so stay tuned
for more in-depth coverage of these gpus
and let us know which of the three you'd
want to see a review first with comment
below thanks for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
