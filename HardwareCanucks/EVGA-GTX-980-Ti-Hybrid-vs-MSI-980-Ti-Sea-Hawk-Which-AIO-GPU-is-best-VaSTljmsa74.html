great technology selection and service
hello everyone i'm dmitri with hardware
canucks welcome back to another review
the hybrid series by EVGA has gained a
lot of momentum simply because adding an
additional 120mm a radiator to any
modern case is not a challenge anymore
and the added benefit of cooling plus
acoustic performance is plenty
attractive then not just for tiny
enclosures but for those with limited
airflow as well the EVGA 980 TI hybrid
is an awesome card i'll say that from
the start but around $750 USD and over a
grand for US and Canada this is a
difficult price to accept in general but
lucky for us there is competition
emerging like the newly released Seahawk
card from MSI which puts pressure
directly on the hybrid and we've seen
prices drop closer to 700 bucks the
shroud design is very familiar to what
we've seen with the 980 hybrid but this
time the reflective lighter accents are
more yellowish or champagne color with
the eggs converging onto the blower
style fan that has a silver center and
you can notice the difference here both
the side and top have model text written
that is not illuminated but EVGA is
releasing a completely new shroud for
the hybrid users that are getting the
shroud for free and that will feature
RGB lighting on the top portion that I
think gives EVGA that competitive
advantage because it is RGB the aluminum
backplate here is perforated with
embedded logo and proper text
orientation that adds the beautiful
element to an already gorgeous shroud
the hybrid requires 8 plus 6 spent for
power and consumption is higher than the
air-cooled versions because of the pump
and radiator fan but it is lower than
the MSI seahawk card because of lower
clock speeds and here's the o'clock
speed chart hovering well under 1,400
mega Hertz at stock the radiator here is
standard 120 by 25 millimeters with
close to 14 inches of tubing and that
allows flexible mounting of the radiator
and the fan is rated at 2,000 rpm that
is controlled by the GPU based on
coolant
temperature which allows seamless drop
and play mentality for the hybrid unlike
the fan on a Seahawk that needs
connection to the motherboard and thus
is controlled by the user
we appreciate the small details like
that and the rubber insert between the
tubes to avoid any damage to the thread
in the long run but I wish we had a
better system to hide the fan cable
running between the tubes for a clean
look but this all accounts for an
amazingly cool GPU at just over 40
degrees Celsius at load is just pure
outstanding performance almost 10
degrees cooler than the msi Seahawk but
that is due to lower clocks slightly
faster fan and thus just a tiny louder
operation but inside the case closed
case the acoustic difference will be
marginal so the question remains which
of the all-in-one 980ti is is best
between the two available options the
EVGA 980ti hybrid or the msi 980ti
seahawk both of which utilized the same
asset a closed loop and a price and the
same bracket
however the block on the EVGA card is
designed for the GPU while the block on
the MSI card is the same as on the
original age 55 cooler which was
designed for the CPU so the shroud
difference is evident you can see that
here both cards in my opinion look
unique but the hybrid built quality
feels better maybe because it's a bit
heavier and a Seahawk shroud is just
thin plastic they both have some design
converging on the blower style fan both
have their unique respective aluminum
back plates the MSI card has illuminated
the yellow logo to keep up with the
color scheme of the overclocked series
and a blue LED fan while the EVGA card
with the shroud is a bit muted and I
like them both for the yar so let us
know which one you'd prefer so without
any further ado let us check out the
benchmarks we have both 1440p followed
by 4k benchmarks and feel free to pause
the video for your own observation
so what you saw there the hybrid at star
clocks is right where it should be in
the middle of the pack we are surprised
that EVGA did not overclock this card
hire and factory so there is extra
performance available with an overclock
but given this trick voltage limitations
by Nvidia our final core clock landed
just below 1500 megahertz but still
keeping the card at 43 degrees which is
pretty amazing what this means for games
is extra performance but without
affecting all the temperatures and at
the end of the day the 980ti hybrid is
exactly what we expected it to be you
pay for quite runtime and amazing cool
GPU at load performance wise stock
speeds are nothing special and is with
any overclockable 980ti which is pretty
all of them extra performance potential
depends on your lock of the jaw but with
our experience a little under 1500
megahertz is the average between the 980
key is and those that prioritize on
cooling and cue sticks and high
performance will be happy with this damn
good graphics card and if you're
wondering which of the water-cooled
980ti is to get the hybrid or the
Seahawk both have their strengths
outside of the performance realm and the
better cooling and seamless plug and
forget operation is appreciated on the
EVGA card but let us know which one you
would prefer with the comment below I'm
