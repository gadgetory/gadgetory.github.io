hydrogen axe and yes I do sound sick
that's because unfortunately I did catch
the CES flu and I'm slowly recovering
from it
but anyways coming back to the topic
back at CES seemed he announced their
third generation rising processors along
with their Radeon 7 graphics card which
is a really interesting GPU for the
price so I really can't wait to test
that out and I give you guys my verdict
on it definitely stay tuned for that
video very soon but we spent a good
amount of time talking to AMD and their
board partners regarding these new CPUs
and it was actually pretty interesting
because you know John III gen3 rise in
CPUs have a lot of people talking about
where Amy's going this year and how much
their processors have changed within the
short amount of time so everyone is
excited about it and I think you should
be as well so when we talk about that
right after this evolve with the times
consider nvme storage today the new RC
100 brings affordable nvme storage into
your hands with various capacities in
this super compact form factor that
plugs directly into your motherboard
it's extremely powerful and utilizes
Toshiba advanced 3d flash memory for
awesome speeds so you can be a happy
user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme
drive to consider check it out Phillip
now you guys might recall that when I
covered the AMD Rison 720 700 X and the
horizon 520 600 X I was actually super
impressed by what they brought to the
table not only that but Intel really
didn't have an answer since their CPUs
were just far too expensive by
comparison but now we're actually gonna
start to see third generation rise and
CPUs hitting sometime this summer now
before I get too far into this video
it's super important to understand what
these new processors are made of
basically the first generation Rison
used the Zen whereas the 2700 acts and
other second generation processors use
the Zen plus design which refined the
originals and architecture meanwhile
what I'm talking about in this video is
the third generation rise in CPUs which
are based off these and to architecture
and AMD's new 7 nanometre man
factoring process that seven animator
node should actually allow them to pull
ahead of Intel for the very first time
in almost a decade basically Intel has
been stuck with an endless number of
skylake refreshes and as they wait for
the ten nanometer ramp up and ice lake
while AMD has sprinted ahead that poses
a problem for intel since isolate won't
be ready until the end of 2019 at the
earliest while Amy's Verizon 3000 series
will be shipping in volume to customers
this summer which is awesome part of the
reason why AMD has been able to move so
quickly to the sava nanometer node is
how they're designing their processors
instead of a single large complicated
die that old si si few chords memory
controllers the IO stages and other
elements they broken things off into
multiple smaller sections so they're
easier to manufacture yields can also
increase this way in the case of Rison 3
up to 8 x86 cores are housed on a
smaller sam nanometer die while the i/o
gets pushed off into a separate section
this approach can actually be scaled up
words to create processors with even
more cores for thread Ripper and epic
families but that's not exactly what
makes Rison 3 so exciting what Andy
showed that their press conference was a
very early 8 core 16 thread chip running
equal to an Intel 9900 K at stock
settings in Cinebench based on our own
tests that would make me 3000 series
chip roughly 15% faster than the
previous generation not only that but a
system was consuming just 133 Watts
versus the 9900 case a hundred and
eighty watts
remember this is with relatively early
silicon which means it isn't running the
final frequencies if Indy is able to
further improve clock speeds before
lunch
we may see their third generation Bryson
products easily overcome beaker and
coffee like CPUs and unless Intel can
bake some serious performance
improvements into their isolate
architecture even that may have a tough
time with Zen - this is a huge deal guys
but remember AMD needs to improve their
lightly threaded performance if they
have any hope of beating Intel across
the board games in particular tend to
fall into Intel's camp since their
architecture excels when its operating
at lower thread counts supposedly a lot
of Zen twos internal revisions are
focused on bridging this gap so let's
hope that's true
not only
ambi promising third-gen rising
processors will be the best for
performance and efficiency but they'll
also be technically compatible with all
aim for motherboards I'm saying
technically because motherboard
manufacturers have to release a proper
bios for that kind of support and
everyone we've talked to is planning to
do exactly that while this sounds like a
cool feature there will be some
limitations with backwards compatibility
certain overclocking options may be
disabled and memory support might be cut
down a bit the third
Rison processors will also support PCI
Express 4.0 which isn't a big deal right
now but it could be pretty important for
future and niimi storage devices and
GPUs originally we thought this feature
would be exclusive to the new 500 series
motherboards but I've been talking to a
few reps at CES it turns out all the
generation 300 and 400 series will be
compatible with PCI 4.0 - the reason for
this is pretty simple physically and
electrically the PCI 3.0 and 4.0 slots
are exactly the same the only difference
is the 4.0 standard has a faster
signaling rate because of the increased
signaling requirements traces on the
motherboard can't exceed six inches
before additional components are needed
to drive PCI Express 4.0 has a higher
bandwidth since older motherboards
weren't built with those components only
the first x16 PCI slots would possibly
receive access to the 4.0 standard
that's a big if - because backwards
compatibility in this case would require
substantial BIOS work it's still going
to be interesting to see if any company
actually does it though now I'm not sure
how many people will actually take
advantage of all this backwards
compatibility but at least AMT is giving
people the option Intel really needs to
take some lessons here because I'm
pretty tired of buying a new motherboard
with almost every one of their small CPU
revisions the last thing that I
mentioned is overclocking now AMD hasn't
published any numbers as of right now
but from our conversations with every
motherboard manufacturer they are
planning on launching some extreme
products for the game for platform so
that means expect extreme line of
motherboards for duis and platform and
this also means that they could
potentially be a good clock speed
Headroom with the third generation rise
in CPUs which is very exciting for our
Canadian audience memory Express is a
place to go for home business and gaming
electronics you can try before you buy a
spec
great for peripherals by visiting one of
their stores in Winnipeg Calgary or
Greater Vancouver and more they do
custom pcs and will beat any Canadian
price guarantee so there you guys have
it right now we still don't know all
that much about their generation rights
and processors but even at this early
point I'm very excited about what AMD
has to offer for the rest of 2019 in
fact this is probably the first in a lot
of years that I feel like almost Intel
is far behind what at what aimed is
achieving competition is always good but
if aim D can actually pull ahead of what
Intel can achieve it's gonna be an
interesting year it's gonna be
interesting rest of 2019 so I'm looking
forward to that anyways let me know what
you guys think about the upcoming third
generation bison processors are you
satisfied with your current setup and if
you're planning if you're not would you
actually consider upgrading to the third
generation rise in CPUs also if you're
an existing
x37 your x4 semi motherboard would you
consider upgrading to the new processors
along with a new motherboard
