super review and if you're interested in
learning more you can check it out right
over here but in it we actually have a
difficult time coming up with a
conclusion because we didn't know how
good the AMD rx 5700 series would
compete against invidious new GPUs but
with all of yesterday's benchmarks done
could we accurately predict where the RX
5700 XT and the RX 5700 would land in
comparison to the RTX 2070 super and
the RTX 2060 super did Nvidia get their
older GPUs out of trouble just in time
or does AMD now have a serious problem
well it turns out Aimee did publish some
pretty specific performance numbers at
e3 and that might lead to some
interesting comparison but more on that
right after a quick message from our
sponsor the newbie quiet dark rock slim
cooler offers high physical clearance
for any memory module thanks to its slim
heatsink and the low profile 120 mil
airflow optimized fan so you get great
cooling low noise easy installation and
no issues for high profile Ram check it
out below alright so I'm gonna start
things off by making something very very
clear you should not take this as a
scientifically accurate video and you
should definitely not use this for any
purchasing decisions in fact this whole
video started as a pretty interesting
test or pretty fun little test to see
how accurate and easy three presentation
was but now with the new RTX super
cards around we might be able to use
Amy's own numbers to estimate how well
the RX 5700 series would compete when
they finally launch next week so let's
start with what AMD showed it was this
chart for the rx 5700 which showed a two
to 21% advantage over the founders
Edition RTX 2060 and this one had
everything from a three percent loss to
a 22 percent gain when the RX 3700 XT
was compared against the founders
edition RTX 2070 those are pretty
impressive numbers too I want to pause
here for a bit because thought these ten
games are the ones we use in our own
benchmarking process while Far Cry New
Dawn has nearly identical performance
results s55 since it uses the same game
engine now that got Mike and I thinking
about how
they would line up against the
benchmarks we used in the super series
video from yesterday so basically use
those percentages and extrapolate from
our results right well you guys can hate
as much as you want on this but it would
be really cool to see how the numbers
would line up when we post our full
reviews of the RX 3700 series so before
we get into what we came up with let me
explain to you why this is a you know
quick and fun alone comparison that we
wanted to try rather than being super
serious get it super serious I don't
know I don't know if that was a bad joke
but first of all according to AMD's
testing notes they used a stock 9900 can
and we used an overclocked 9900 ex to
eliminate any CPU bottlenecks
but luckily these games on CPU limited
at 1440p resolution we also have no idea
which scenes AMD chose to benchmark with
yet improvements are usually seen across
the entire game and not just a single
scene but then there's this which
mysteriously says best performing API
for both GPUs and to us that means each
game comparison could have been mixed DX
90 X 11 or DX 12 results which is super
odd and a bit misleading finally we
decided to include the RTX 2070
founders Edition but not the RTX 2060
founders Edition and that's because the
2060 founders is in pre overclocked so I
just used a stock RTX 2060 in this
place plus we know how AMD used founders
edition GPUs since they mentioned it in
a PC world live stream last week but
let's get into what we found starting
with assassin's creed the supers
actually do improve quite a bit and
adding D 2% improvements for the 5700
and the XT doesn't really change things
by all that much then again moving to
Battlefield 5 tells a whole different
story here Nvidia shows some pretty good
improvements with the super cards but
add in the 5700 series and o amd's
claiming 22% and 21% improvements for
the XT and the non XT cards over the
founders editions and that's huge
especially since these two cards cost
less than
it is Super Series on the surface of
things the supers do well in Far Cry 5
but add the five and twelve percent
stated by Amy's presentation and they're
still trailing the rtx 2070 and 2060
Super but really not by all that much
which is likely why Nvidia price their
GPUs so close metro Exodus is a pretty
interesting title too since it is an
Nvidia friendly title but man AMD claims
of between 15 to 16 percent improvements
over the original rtx 2070 and 2060 and
that seems really impressive right here
shadow the Tomb Raider is actually an
interesting one here since AMD was
pretty open about showing the RX 5700 XT
losing by 3% and the 5700 winning by 6%
pop in those into our chart and this is
what you get I won't make any
conclusions but like I said it's nice to
see a company admitting where some up
improvements are needed
finally there's Witcher 3 which hasn't
been a really kind title for AMD since
the beginning but it's still an awesome
game and again the AMD cards slide right
in between the Super Series but imagine
if those cards wouldn't have launched
Nvidia could have been in some trouble
so looking at the results they should
give you at least a vague idea on how md
claims there RX 5700 Series GPUs
would stack up against the RTX super
cards now as I mentioned at the very
beginning of this video please do take
these unscientific results with a grain
of salt and I'm completely aware that
will get hate from both sides but heck I
think that this was a pretty cool
comparison either way now what I'm
really looking forward to seeing is how
these numbers would turn out into
reality when the 5700 XT and the 5700
reviews get published next week some
stoked for that but based on all of this
it's possible that Nvidia may have been
a bit too conservative with the super
series pricing maybe all they did was to
avoid the rx 5700 series rather
than competing with it but that could
also mean that AMD is in a pretty good
position personally I think the most
important aspect is the way T online app
has finally been able to achieve good
results against the RTX series at
similar power consumption numbers
remember the RTX 5700 XT has a board
power of 2
25 watts and the 5700 has 185
however Nvidia needed to really push
their 12 nanometer process here with the
RTX 2070 super at 215 watts and the
2060 super at 175 watts so should AMD
be worried well if we use their
benchmark numbers absolutely not but
we're just have to wait or hold our
breath for just a bit longer so that we
could paint the whole picture as to what
both teams are offering especially for
the price points and we'll have
scientific results to prove that so let
me know what you guys think about this
little quick comparison a pretty fun one
actually in the comments I'm curious to
know I'm me both harken acts thank you
so much for watching make sure to check
out some relevant content over here
subscribe for some cool content coming
the pipeline and I'll see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
