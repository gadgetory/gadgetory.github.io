thermal take case to be reviewed but
first a message from our sponsor
introducing the new OC CVX 500 s all
state drives from Toshiba it offers
great well balanced speeds build with
MOC NAND flash for superior endurance
and is also backed by five year advanced
warranty program learn more about the VX
500 at OCC com
all right people it's time to tackle the
biggest case we've ever received the
thermal take core w200 priced at $459
this is a super tower for commited
enthusiasts it's both intimidating and
exciting at the same time on the full
potential what's possible inside of it
and just so we're clear on the size I
was able to fit on one side of the case
we had an s3 40 from NZXT inside of
which I had this century ITX it's a
little bit of a material case and here's
me next to it it's occupying half my
office I needed to be gone and it's not
just the case but in room for rent
alright so now to address the big
elephant in the room not the case but
its similarities with case labs as Dena
both shared the double-wide case
category and I gotta say that I hear
that argument and I completely sort of
see why people would get upset but it's
not all about just the simple end
product as the experience between
building and something like this versus
something that the case lab produces is
totally different we have reviewed the
mercury case from case labs and that was
a fantastic experience so let's see if
the cheaper version of the W 200 here
how does that reflect in the user
experience and not just as a simple
metal box thing bigger picture and why
some people might gravitate towards
something like this versus something
that the case labs produce everything
here for example is steel versus case
labs built with aluminum which is a much
better material for larger pieces so
there isn't as much bending and
ultimately for the end user you have
more options to choose from if you're
going for the super tower type of build
and you know that's not necessarily a
bad thing so the parts list is actually
quite low for something of this size the
mainframe is a few large pieces of which
arrived in
in addition note bends here for storage
there are five Drive cages with two
caddies and each plus four more caddies
to install in a separate location all
the bits and pieces and screws are very
well labeled to responding to what you
need to use in the manual and an empty
toolbox is present for your convenience
and the only surprise were these gross
oil stains on one of the plastic bags
really not cool so the most part the
instructions manual is clear you have 32
pages for constructing the w200 which
took me about four hours to complete and
I've only made one mistake as the
perspective on one of the pages in the
images in the manual was very confusing
but in the end I was able to put
everything together and put the exterior
panels on and the case was complete I
like the ability to remove any of the
panel's for transportation purposes so
it's not as heavy and all the ventilated
areas have dust filtration at the front
at the top on the bottom and on the side
and that's highly appreciated for what
this case is designed for and all the
ventilation areas have the small square
format which looks pretty nice now given
such large thin metal sheets of course
it's quite flexible you can see it here
the frame is solid though which is
important the same thing we see on the
windowed side panel despite the acrylic
being so thick the secure mechanism is
not future-proof in my opinion it's a
simple hole insert that isn't very
strong and because the side panels can
curve one of the joints on my case
already isn't sticking so as you can see
the core w200 is basically two giant
full towers merged together with 10 PCI
slots per side with the right side
having an inverted mother wood layout
and a power supply installation at the
bottom of each section the front intake
is divided so the left side is only for
firing the quarter inch drive
accessories with two front iOS included
as the case is designed for dual systems
you can install drive cages here
although it's facing the main internals
not really ideal for cable management
while a rotated drive cage system can be
installed but it's so uncomfortable you
have to remove the entire bottom piece
to install the main rails and even
then you're sort of left with a
challenge on how to properly connect
your drives that look clean the left
side can also support a 360 million
radiator
thanks to those flexible brackets while
the right side is for fans only you got
four spots from 120 or 140 millimeter
mounts the right side does not support
radiators since the fans are placed too
far away from each other and the same
applies to the bottom because of the
spacing between the fans it's not
standard and you can only fit a 280
millimeter radiator on each side behind
the main window panel we find half of
the interior with appropriate mounting
locations for those crazy large
motherboards there are many rubber
grommets and you don't really realize
just how large the space is until a full
sized ATX motherboard is completely lost
in this space so this technically would
be my second water cooling build and I'm
a little bit intimidated I gotta be
honest you know I've just populated the
motherboard which looks absolutely tiny
and I figured out the new game what's
called find the mobile inside this
ginormous case and I'm already finding a
little bit difficulties on what to do
with that space for example I have the
power supply on the other sides of the
motherboard looks nice and clean but
then it looks a little bit ridiculous
right if you don't Populi anything here
with the water cooling hardware and this
is where my inexperience comes into play
for example I have the thermal tank
reservoir pump combos the silent Edition
and I really imagine it you know sitting
somewhere here occupying this dead space
beside the motherboard but the fact that
you have no mandatory reservoir
mountings on this side is a little bit
ridiculous no compatibility with your
own work only hardware in a water
cooling main case by the same company
now moving on to the rest of the
hardware the radiator stuff I would 360
radiator here and just for scale
comparison like you still have so much
room beside the motherboard if you were
to install
the top the same idea if you want to
involve at the bottom the same thing and
I find it a little bit difficult to as a
case reviewer to approach how to you
know go about the system because
regardless of how much hardware I put in
this system if I'm not doing dual builds
it's a little bit of a wasted potential
so it feels like foreign territory for
me and I'm going to try to do my best to
showcase what this case is capable of
and so checking out the second half of
the Interior it looks identical since
both sides share the middle wall and
therefore if you're routing cables on
both sides it might be a challenge
however the motherboard tray on this
side is removable which is awesome with
some space behind it and where you can
route the cables for a clean and look I
kind of wish that the main half had a
removable tray instead of being on this
chamber but probably the best cooling
feature on this case are the radiator
brackets that support for fans 120 or
140 millimeter width for 85 60 and in
even 600 millimeter radiator supporting
per bracket in particular I find the
mounting mechanism to be awesome it's to
lists for that initial insert that can
be secured later with a thumb screw and
two of these can fit on the right side
and two more at the top giving you a lot
of area for airflow or radiators which
is why those dust filters are important
and this is one of the reasons why the
top section is completely open as the
bracket can also be installed in the
center perhaps if your dual system are
sharing the top radiator so there are a
lot of options that accommodate for any
scenario auto I still don't understand
why the front side on the right doesn't
have standard spacing between those fan
mounts and therefore no radiator can fit
there now the assembly process is kind
of hot and cold at the same time I like
the included standoff tool but with no
middle standoff that catches the
motherboards you need to flip the case
and this way you need to make sure or
make up your mind on where you have the
PC since it will become incredibly heavy
to move once the system is installed
wheels are provided tow so you can roll
it into position and so the basic
overview of the core w200 is finished
let's take a break and hear words from
sponsor assembling your verdaguer gaming
chair just got a whole lot easier with a
simple insert mechanism of the back seat
onto the side rails so you mount the
side screws much faster a true one-man
job assembly made easy by over the year
and what I'd love to do now is the
actual water cooling build it is how you
get to learn a computer case after all
but so far I gotta be honest I am not
convinced water cooling is a lot of
maintenance a lot of planning and
especially when dealing with something
of this size and this caliber you have
to be full in so I hope you guys enjoyed
part 1 part 2 is coming soon with the
full build and the complete analysis of
the entire experience with the water
cooling assembly and etc a little things
that I will pick up along the way as
well I hope you guys enjoyed this video
make sure to subscribe for part two
we'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
