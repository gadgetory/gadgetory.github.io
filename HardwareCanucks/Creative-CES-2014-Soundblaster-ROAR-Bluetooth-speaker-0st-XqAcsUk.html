brought to you by and CIX
technology connected now we're here with
creative you guys know they they're very
popular for their creative blaster sound
cars they do have a bunch of audio
headsets but you guys know that we are
getting into audio we're starting to
learn more about how what good audio
stands for when it really means and we
came across this very interesting
product from creatives so this is the
creative Sound Blaster roar what's
interesting about this it's designed for
your living room so it's your living
room audio files sort of a Bluetooth
speaker that can be turned into wireless
in two wired speaker as well but first
of all let's take a look at some
instruction is very compact you have
this sort of perforated design on the
top and on the sides as well so coming
up to the body it is fully porphyry as
you can see it is very elegant has a
chrome accents both perforation on the
side so we have two high frequency
drivers two passive bass drivers here
and an active base in the center
providing a thirty degree angle
sort of the dispersion of the sound and
we did listen to it while it was on the
desk and then provided sort of a very
clear and still very loud sound
experience in audio so audio projection
is very nice but that's packing a lot of
functionality so they are actually
focusing a bit on so the high frequency
drivers are really crisp and very
detailed and that's what you want to
hear the base is very tight very deep so
it doesn't overpower and it doesn't sort
of disturb the mid or the high range and
for a very compact speaker like that I'm
actually very impressed with the sound
quality so on the top here let's let's
take a look so this is NFC enabled you
can simply put the phone down there and
it will automatically sync up with a
device the three LEDs also indicate the
charging so it will start blinking when
it's charging it will indicate the
battery and it also would indicate if
you are pairing up or not we can disable
Bluetooth or yeah so this is a Bluetooth
connection we can adjust the volume and
there's also this roar mode I'm not sure
if you can see that but the roar mode
basically amplifies the sound by three
deep
creating a more loud experience so this
is in a large room and you need that
extra power from this a little Sound
Blaster roar speaker that's the
possibility and we also have an on and
off button now coming out to the back
there's a lot of features on the back so
when we look at the entire so we have
all the logo we have the 15 this 15 so
15 watts for charging auxiliary in so
you can connect your connect this to
your iPhone for example we have DC out
so you can charge your wireless devices
USB microUSB actually so you can charge
the sound blaster roar or you can
actually pass audio through this as well
there's a microSD card slot and micro SD
card slot will act will turn this sort
of into an mp3
we have controls here play pause pass
and rewind and sort of loop or shuffle
those tracks that are micro SD card slot
now there is a microphone built into the
system so you can record your
conversation so if you're in a
conference call you can play and pause
them as well and you can mute or unmute
the microphone now there's another sort
of unique feature that you can see here
this is an off one plus and LS this will
take your audio and mp3 from your sd
card and for example it will play sort
of like they gave us an example with
bedtime stories so you can choose
different types of bedtime stories you
can record your own and this is for
let's say you kids going to sleep and it
will automatically sort of roll off to
volume has your kid goes to sleep
there's also the alarm button which
means that if you're in trouble let's
say can you press the alarm button and
it will actually be very loud alarm in
case something happens in the household
and you can turn that alarm on or off
now that's pretty much covers up this
sound blaster roar a very impressive
little device from creative we did hear
what it sounds like and for a Bluetooth
device
it sounds very impressive I was telling
the engineers here that they do really
emphasize an amazing high so they don't
over amplify the bass and the passive
and bold active sorry active and passive
drivers the base drivers do a really
good job in making sure that this
speaker sounds awesome so guys thanks
