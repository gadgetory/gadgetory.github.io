and I want to make this quick video
comparing the Galaxy Note 8 to the newly
announced Google pixel to excel quick
disclaimer this isn't gonna be an
in-depth comparison between the two
smartphones but rather a quick rundown
as to what are some of the features that
both of these devices bring to the table
and which one offers the best bang for
your buck since both the note 8 and the
pixel to excel are expensive smartphones
so let's get into it
but first a quick message from our
sponsor invest in storage that makes a
difference choose toshiba Rd 400 and vme
SSDs that are incredibly fast and
reliable
backed by advanced warranty programs so
you can focus on what matters
Rd 400 check it out in the description
below ok so let's address pricing for
these smartphones the note 8 starts at
nine hundred and thirty dollars and that
gets you a six point three inch Super
AMOLED display with a resolution of
twenty nine sixty by 1440 and a pixel
density of 521 now depending on your
country or carrier it comes with either
the Exynos 88-90 5 octa-core CPU or the
snapdragon 35 processor you get 6
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of
on-board storage that can be expanded
via microsd 3300 milliamp hour battery
ip68 water and dust resistant rating
wireless charging s-pen which is the key
selling feature for the note 8 when
compared to other Galaxy devices now the
pixel to excel is the complete opposite
end of the spectrum when compared to the
Galaxy Note 8 pricing starts at 800 $49
which is just $80 less than the note you
get a six-inch Peola display with a
resolution of 2880 by 1440 so it's a
little lower than the note 8 but in real
world use you're not gonna notice a
difference it comes with the snapdragon
835 cpu 4 gigabytes of ram versus 6 on
the note 8 so perhaps we could expect a
performance hit with multitasking there
are two sorts options available with the
pixel to excel 64 and 128 gigabytes but
that adds additional cost although it
isn't expandable which is a bit
disappointing the battery is slightly
larger on the pixel to excel you're
looking at roughly 3,500 milliamp hours
versus 3300 on the note 8 its ip67
water-resistant it does not come with
support for wireless charging nor does
it come
a stylist from a design perspective I do
prefer the pixel to excel over the
Galaxy Note 8 just because it doesn't
come with an all-glass back I would
rather the hybrid premium coding
material on top of the aluminum unibody
construction feels rock solid in the
hand the note 8 is still built pretty
well but the glass back questions
durability plus it can easily get
slippery
once it's all smudged up so do take note
of that I should also mention that the
fingerprint sensor location on the pixel
to excel is a lot more convenient to
reach whereas on the note 8 it's right
beside the two cameras which is really
hard to get through plus over the course
of my testing period with the note 8
I've had times where it wouldn't
recognize my finger that will so I found
that to be a bit annoying
however the Galaxy Note 8 does come with
a headphone jack whereas the pixel to
excel does not so if that's something
that you consider as a must-have feature
on a flash of Android smartphone I think
you should probably lean towards the
Galaxy Note 8 just because it comes with
a pair of headphones out of the box
whereas with the pixel to excel you're
only just getting the phone in the
charger so from a value perspective I
feel like the Note 8 does offer pretty
much the essentials of what you would
need for an Android smartphone or a
smartphone in general the speaker setup
on the Galaxy Note 8 might be a little
bit concerning because you're only
getting a bottom facing mono speaker on
the device when compared to the dual
front-facing speakers on the pixel to
excel now when you're watching content
on the Galaxy Note 8 you can easily
block the speaker which completely mutes
the sound and it gets annoying
especially when you're watching a
YouTube video before going to bed or
just watching content in general now I
guess the trade-off would be the
inclusion of a headphone jack and of
course the headphones that come out of
the box but again these are trade-offs
that you'll just have to work around
with it I'd like to hear your thoughts
on the speaker setup on the Galaxy Note
8 and the pixel to excel which one would
you pick would you mind taking that hit
with lack of a headphone jack on the
pixel to excel or are you okay with the
fun facing or the rear facing speaker on
the node 8 with the addition of the
headphone jack let me know the comments
down below the camera systems on both
these smartphones are a bit different so
starting with the Galaxy Note 8 we have
two 12 megapixel sensors at different
focal lengths and you can use either of
those to take shots whether that's a
more wider shot if you want a more
close-up shot you can use the set
a telephoto lens there's also another
feature called life focus mode that
essentially uses the two cameras to
isolate the subject from the background
and and you and the user is given the
option to adjust the background blur but
there's also another feature where it
takes a backup photo with the wide-angle
lens
so if you end up messing up the
composition with a live focus mode you
can ought also you can always rely on
that wide-angle shot to at least you
know get something out of it now with
the pixel to excel you're only getting a
single 12 megapixel sensor with an f-1
point in aperture Google is heavily
relying on their AI assistants to create
this portrait mode but essentially
across maximum creates the step map to
isolate pixels and it just refines the
edges cross matches with the database
that includes facial analysis and object
detection and it creates this powdered
effect so we have to like I can't wait
to get my hands on the pixel to excel
once it starts shipping so I can test it
out in depth and stay tuned for my full
review of the pixel to excel when it
comes out the software experience on
both these devices are gonna be
completely different regardless of them
being Android smartphones so with the
Galaxy Note 8 you're looking at Android
7.1 with Samsung's
skin on top of it we should probably
expect Android or your update in the
upcoming weeks
but that's again the downside with
Samsung devices is they're very late
when it comes to pushing out updates
whereas with Google phones they're
straight you know they're first in line
to receive any security bugs software
upgrades even operating system upgrades
the other positive thing about the pixel
smartphone is the clean stock Android
experience it does not come with
bloatware applications which would then
hinder performance whereas with the
Galaxy Note 8 it does come with
bloatware applications especially when
you purchase it through a carrier and of
course updates would then postpone over
time depending on which carrier you're
with so from a software perspective I'd
much rather go with the pixel to excel
smartphone because I'm first in line to
receive updates and it's it's a much
more you know usable experience I prefer
soft Kendra just because of its clean
and fluid UI whereas what Samsung I'm
just its Samsung now as I mentioned in
the beginning of this video one of the
key selling features with the note it is
a V S Pen and I guess that's one of the
distinguishing features of the note 8
even compared to the pixel to excel
because that phone does not come with a
stylus whereas this guy does if you're
someone who has
lilly relies on taking notes and if
you're working on constantly on the go
if you're dealing with a lot of
documents which includes you know
signing some of them the stylus will
come in really handy there are also
other cool features that come with the
stylus so for instance you can take a
screenshot and quickly you know
highlight things and send it to anyone
there's an there's a function where you
can create live messaging features where
it just basically creates animated texts
and it saves it as a gif or Jif and then
you can share it to anyone there's a
live auto translate feature and of
course much more shortcuts that you can
customize it to your own desire whereas
with a pixel to excel smartphone like I
mentioned earlier it's a much more
cleaner experience you're not getting
all those extra set of features that
Samsung gives you with the note 8 or
even the galaxy estate in the SI plus
lastly I want to talk about Bigsby and
Google assistant so lenore-- does come
with Google assistant built-in but you
can also use Bixby if you want to really
take advantage of that button by the way
it's really annoying but I'm glad that
you can actually disable it Samsung has
rolled out an update with the note 8
smartphones where you can disable the
function completely but with a pixel
it's just in much more cleaner
experience as I mentioned beginning it
comes with Google assistant you it's
there when you need it there's a squeeze
functionality that activates Google
assistant but that can also be disabled
so we have options it ultimately comes
down to user preference so I'd like to
hear your thoughts on the Galaxy Note 8
and the pixel to excel which one of
these smartphones would you consider and
in fact which one of these two
smartphones would you recommend to a
friend or family member
let me know the comments down below stay
