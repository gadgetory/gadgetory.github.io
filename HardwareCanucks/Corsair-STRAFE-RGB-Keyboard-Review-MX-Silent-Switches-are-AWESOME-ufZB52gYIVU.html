great technology selection and service
hey guys hope you're doing great today
I'm here to share my thoughts on the new
Corsair strafe RGB mechanical keyboard
you might recall that we took a look at
the non RGB version of the strafe
keyboard that was priced around a
hundred and ten dollars but now for an
extra forty dollars you get the RGB a
new silent mechanical switch and a few
extra features so without any further
ado let's check it out at first glance I
noticed that the design of the strafe
RGB shares a lot of similarities with
its non RGB younger brother the auto
frame along with the build looks and
feels the same the spacebar texture is
the same way the brightness control and
the windows lock buttons are located on
the same top right hand corner although
you might notice that the Corsair
branding is shifted underneath these
buttons and towards the top left hand
side of the keyboard you may notice the
hidden illuminated logo that lights up
when plugged in now like that there's a
USB pass-through port on the back side
of the keyboard which is a nice addition
but I would have preferred an extra USB
port with the added price you also get a
detachable wrist rest with the strafe
RGB and the soft textured finish on it
is comfortable to type but attaching it
was just a matter of snapping it onto
the keyboard at the bottom there are
several anti slip pads and flip-out feed
to adjust the height of the keyboard and
it does a fantastic job preventing the
keyboard from movement the media
functions for volume adjust and track
controls have been programmed as
commands in the f5 to f12 keys and they
can be accessed via the function key I
would have preferred a dedicated media
command section but course I decided to
preserve the same design of the original
strafe with this model course it also
includes two set of contoured and
textured key caps just like the non RGB
variant the WASC set is meant for FPS
gamers while the Corpse set for mobile
players I really enjoyed my time gaming
on this key cap since my fingers are
placed perfectly on them and you also
get a key cap puller which is nice
speaking of typing this keyboard comes
with four types of Cherry MX switches
the MX blue MX Brown MX red and a new
silence which which is the one we have
here tapping on it is familiar and
that's because they are based off the
red switches both with 45 grams of
actuation force but the MX silent
switches are much quieter so if you're
looking to minimize the audible clicky
clack while gaming or typing the MX
silent switches is what you need
take a listen for yourselves now on to
the best part that RGB lighting you guys
have no idea how beautiful and bright
this looks seriously this is by far on
the best nope I'm going to phrase that
the best RGB lit keyboard ever the
colors are vibrant the spectrum cycling
effect is so smooth without any lag the
secret behind this glorious illuminance
is that the support plate is coated with
white paint which in turn intensifies
the lighting through the gaps and I love
how they look in low-light scenarios the
driver software is very simple and easy
to use the profile tab comes with three
different sub categories the first
assignment tab lets you assign every
single key on a straight RGB to your
preference the lighting tab allows you
to change the lighting effects to
different modes like Spiral rainbow
rainbow wave visor rain color shift
color pulse color wave type lighting and
ripple you can also adjust the direction
and the speed of these effects which is
pretty cool the performance tab lets you
disable certain keys and that's it
not a lot of options here also do note
that you can create multiple profiles
within the software and it's directly
stored onto the microprocessor built
inside the straight RGB
I was really excited to review the
strafe RGB from Corsair when I took a
look at the regular strafe keyboard the
only thing that was missing was RGB and
think Corsair has delivered all the
things you need with this gaming
keyboard plus the new cherry MX silence
which is a nice addition to the line
that silences your keystrokes and
because of that we're giving it the
hardware connects dandy reward well that
concludes our review of the Corsair
strafe RGB mechanical keyboard would you
consider this over the non RGB variant
for that price premium let us know in
