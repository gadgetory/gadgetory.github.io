since we last review the courser case
that changes today with 500 d the new
master case MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic wrist rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection coolermaster
doing it right check it out below hello
good people I'm three tree and the
Corsair 500 E is an interesting closure
because it's their new obsidian which is
their most premium series and this
curved visual artifact on the wall is a
good representation on Corsairs
direction they're no longer going with
the whole like boxy and like squared
corners look now it's more curved at
$149 it looks beautiful with some
interior refinements so let's see what
the experience is like first is it a
good feeling having the entire case
covered with this protective film it
gives you that impression of something
premium but at the same time also
something super sensitive to
fingerprints like the brushed aluminum
front and top panels and to save you the
hassle of cleaning I would peel
everything after the build is finished
but here is an interesting accident when
I was peeling off the front protective
film the logo or half of the logo peeled
along with it leaving only the top
portions of the sails attached to the
case and that I thought looked even
better and more discreet on the front
panel and I could easily reapply the
sticker if I had some glue but seeing
that this is the application method from
the factory be careful when wiping off
the fingerprints as the sticker could
easily come off okay so it's been two
weeks and courser has delayed the launch
of the 500 d just to fix that exact
issue of the logo peeling so i have the
replacement case here so let's check it
out alright the moment of truth
BAM all into ahh
alright so all good in the hood that
burnt lead the peeling logo was only
present for the first batch of review
units that were sent out and the retail
units are all fine they fix this issue
back to the review now let me know if
you agree with this thinking that glass
has sort of lost its premium appeal
because now it's found everywhere even
on $60 cases so how do you differentiate
between quality glass versus you know
whatever mounting so of course there
have done a really good job with the
mounting approach as the side panels
smoother to open to make access easier
so we have strong magnets at the front
to hold the panel's plus I love the
aluminum plating that get on each side
that also curve in a little bit to
complement this whole curvature of the
front panel that looks absolutely
gorgeous and don't worry about the air
flow as the front panel is properly
spaced out from the fans by almost a
full inch that by the way is also
covered with a magnetic dust filter it's
easy removal from the side so the slight
curvature of each side panel helps to
conceal the front intake without
blocking air flow meaning we have this
gorgeous facade of the front that
deserves the Obsidian name the glass is
pretty dark and it's the same color on
both sides and we have a screw that must
be removed in order to lift the panel
off the hinge now I'm not surprised that
majority of the weight comes from these
glass panels but this is the first time
where the case could not support the
weight of the side panel when it's open
and it caused the case to tilt if the
opposite panel was removed and this of
course would not be an issue if the
system was installed or you have both
side panels in place also the glass is
not flush against the frame but we have
this four millimeter gap that might
cause additional dust entrance and of
course noise vio is standard with
illuminated power button there's a
type-c connector that's awesome and then
easily accessible reset switch in this
good-looking IO the top panel is
interesting because the raised sides
benefit airflow so the ventilation is
only present in the center that I must
say has this really unique ventilation
pattern but it is not found anywhere
else on the case and I find that strange
also you would think that these
aluminium panels would be removable for
easier access for the front and top fan
areas but the
part of the frame and are not made to be
removable that I think is super
unfortunate because accessing those
areas is now made more difficult so
instead we have these fan brackets that
at the front is fine because access is
not an issue and you can run at 280 in
two positions or a 360 rod with this
bracket but my issue is with the top fan
bracket and it deserves its own fail
award you can check this out the frame
at the top completely blocks your access
to the thumb screws that hold it in
place that by the way are not captive
making reinstallation a lot harder than
it needs to be then the bracket is
identical in size to the front bracket
yet it only supports a 280 or 240 Miller
sizes for readers and the case is large
enough to mount a 360 up top so you
could switch them from the front bracket
but I still don't understand this
limitation now the interior is based off
the 570 x case that is roomy we have two
fans included a power supply filter 7
PCI brackets with 2 vertical the non
removable shroud has been closed off at
the front and they've added a rubber
grommet for better cable routing and
some additional mounting locations for
pump or reservoirs at the bottom I also
appreciate the long standoff in the
middle to catch your motherboard and at
the back we get 2 large drive caddies
and three individual SSD brackets so
storage is exclusively for this area now
with my system completed there are no
glaring issues that I could think of
with the assembly nor are there any high
praises either if you like an open space
and feel your hardware deserves some
breathing room
the 500d does that well even with my H
150 I installed in the front and you
have additional 4 inches until the
shroud wall so you could do push pull
easy or go with the thicker radiators
cables under the motherboard are routed
just fine but this is the first time I
notice how the ventilation on the shroud
isn't all that pretty when you can see
the power supply underneath there's a
lot of space above the motherboard but
due to the top bracket and it's terrible
mount you'd want to avoid putting
yourself through that but we have 8
centimeters of clearance until we hit my
ram slots cable management is ok but I
honestly was hoping they would improve
on some things since 1/2 years ago so
all the cables entering the main
interior must be channeled through this
metal cover first it's pretty tight to
fit all
basic cable's so it would be nice if the
the bracket was wider and second the
thumbscrews again are not captive making
reinstallation more difficult
they also used really short thumb screws
that might not even reach depending on
how many cables you have bundled up
behind it so I swap them out for longer
ones to make my life easier and so it's
weird to have all these missing small
details that pull together and detract
from an otherwise excellent experience
like why not have captive thumb screws
on all the panels just as they have on
their SSD caddies and finally putting on
the side panels you can see the 500 e
was made to be beautiful and I
personally love the darker tint on the
glass panels to mute any lighting on the
inside and hide anything on the cable
side but I wish more was done to improve
the top fan bracket and the cable bar
and spread this awesome ventilation
pattern throughout the case for that
cohesion element and so to me the 500 D
feels like an odd Obsidian because my
interpretation of the series means they
put their best designs forward that will
then trickle down into like the carbide
and lower tiers and I was expecting more
because NZXT is doing a lot of cool
things be quiet is flipping their
interiors you know cool master is fixing
their errors but they all feel like
they're moving forward and there's some
progression and with this being Corsairs
first 20:18 release let's just say I'm
excited to see what they have for later
in the year because this was kind of
underwhelming and I say that because the
interior is basically copy paste from a
case that was launched here and half ago
with some minor refinements I love what
they've done on the exterior but I think
they can step up their game for those
interior unique features a bit more than
2018 but let me know if you agree so
that's it for me the Corsair obsidian
500 d let me know what you think of in
the comments below I'm a tree tree
thanks so much for watching I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
