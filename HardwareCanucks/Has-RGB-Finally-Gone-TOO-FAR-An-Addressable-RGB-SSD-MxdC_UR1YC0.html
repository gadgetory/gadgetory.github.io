as you can see by the title of this
video we are looking at an RGB SSD yes
those I finally come to the market I
guess it's a little bit kind of late for
them everything is RGB now but we'll see
what it's capable of and since I don't
have any more surprises for you why
don't we just roll the epic b roll
sequence for the unboxing
all right so this delta r gb SSD looks
pretty good and it's coming from team
group the company that brought us this
beautiful RGB memory so my expectations
for this one are pretty high I don't
particularly like the whole branding
approach here with delta T force text
and the teen group logo but the texture
of the SSD is nice and from what I can
expect the RGB element will be epic and
so I've set up an RGB system behind me
the p300 with all types of RGB goodness
in there we're going to add this our GB
SSD inside the system and see what type
of flare it adds to our system so should
be fine let's check it out right to this
are you ready okay watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P managed by
Coolermaster check it out in the
description below alright people so the
epic RG penis begins with the
connectivity so this particular Delta
SSD is the Magnificent version as they
call it which means it has an
addressable RGB header instead of your
standard RGB and so this got me all
confused what is the difference between
an addressable RGB header versus your
traditional RGB header so let me break
it down to you in two simple terms so
the technical difference is the
addressable RGB connector is a 3 pin 5
volt connection versus your standard RGB
connection is a 12-volt 4 pin connection
whereas the color differences for the
addressable RGB each LED can be assigned
a different color therefore you can
create these beautiful gradients versus
on the non addressable standard 12 volt
RGB headers each channel can only be
assigned one color and therefore you
cannot create a gradient on something
like this where with addressable of
course you can't so there you go now you
know what this whole addressable RGB
really meant for is color customization
and gradients and that explains why they
have multiple versions of this SSD the
Magnificent ones for addressable RGB to
create those gradients or the simple one
that is one color only now I find myself
in a little bit of a pickle because the
only motherboard with a 5 volt
addressable RGB header is this one the
z3 70 ITX for my soos but I don't have a
processor for it because it's inside my
main workstation so instead I'll be
using the fantex digital RGB starter kit
because I can connect the SSD to the
controller from the fan techs and
actually have this full control of
illumination and lighting effects and it
syncs up very well to this entire RGB
direction so that you know it's not just
two random colors over here they
actually correspond to what I have set
to you know the LED strip and the Lux
fan frames so they all match up and so I
do like their simplicity for
connectivity we have a micro USB which
right beside your other connections so
it's not in some random location and
this cable breaks down into your five
volt RGB header for your addressable
header on the motherboard or a separate
three pin connection which is optional
so you can connect it to other
accessories like this fantas controller
now my initial impressions for this
thing is wow the color illumination is
beautiful and I'm so happy we're moving
into the addressable RGB direction
because we can create these smooth and
beautiful gradients and not just having
one single color for this large
illumination area and one interesting
observation is that this illumination in
terms of color accuracy and color map
mismatch is actually perfect to what I'm
seeing from the fantex digital RGB kit
with the lux frame and the LED strip -
so that's that brings me hope that I can
mismatched brands for RGB illumination
as long as they are addressable they
will receive the exact same information
for the illumination and each LED will
display hopefully the exact same color
as the rest of your peripherals however
you want
all right so what is the moral of this
story
I mean RGB as these are coming out but
more importantly addressable RGB is
expanding to a point where it's the
right approach to lighting up your
peripherals be it the power supply be it
an SSD or whatever addressable is the
way to go forward now it is an
absolutely beautiful product when it's
lit up the color just vibrancy is just
incredible
you also get pure white unlike on other
RGB peripherals that have like a slight
of blue and some where they're hidden in
the background it's not like pure white
which is awesome with addressable RGB
that is the side effect now in terms of
uniformity they've done a pretty good
job but it's not 100% the LEDs are at
the bottom here and they shine the light
through this transparent top the t4
section is lit up very well but you can
definitely tell the bottom section
beside the Delta is the brightest of
course for RGB peripherals it is very
important to be multi-platform
compatible so it is supported across all
our dress about RGB headers and with all
types of motherboard software - so what
else can I say
oh it is slightly thicker because of the
additional RGB layer so you're not going
for the traditional seven millimeter
thickness this is more like nine which
is not really an issue you're not trying
to stash it in a notebook somewhere
you're trying to really show it off and
clearance for nine millimeter SSDs is
never a concern now in terms of speed
this is a simple solder base SSD nothing
to say here no huge advancements you get
regular Sauer speeds as shown on the
screen and so I made this video because
I feel like this SSD being the only RGB
SSD on the market right now it's almost
like foreshadowing the future you know
it's giving us a little glimpse of
what's gonna be coming in couple months
because our GPS as these will be the
huge craze you know that's the only
component that has not been totally
occupied by the RGB craze so it is
coming now a few negative pointers that
I would love for other SSD brands to
take note of when they actually finally
launched their RGB SSDs is designed
that's important here way too much
branding like so much text so much going
on I mean slightly aggressive slightly
you know texture like just way too much
when it's in the vertical orientation
the RGB illumination is non symmetrical
because we have this section there's
nothing here and so it's most likely
going to be in the vertical orientation
in the first place and not like this
so yes design is important and I would
love to hear your ideas about what would
be your ultimate RGB SSD
appearance-wise alright guys so that is
it for this conversation about this
particular SSD and this whole
addressable RGB direction I like where
we're heading but it's also risky
territory of it being too much at the
same time so I guess we shall wait and
see I'm Dimitri thanks so much for
watching make sure to check out this
other relevant content and we'll see you
in the next RGB</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
