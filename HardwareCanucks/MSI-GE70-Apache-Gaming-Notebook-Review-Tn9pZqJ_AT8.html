speed meet the Linksys
hello everyone this is Dimitri with
heroic Knox and today we're going to
take a look at an extremely powerful
gaming notebook from MSI featuring
invidious latest Maxwell GPU this is a
ge70 from their apache series and like
with any notebook in this class price is
determined per configuration the base
model starts at 1300 and this is
actually pretty affordable considering
the hardware packed inside this machine
so let's take a look
what we have here is a core i7 at 3.4
gigahertz at turbo mode 12 gigs of ram
nvidia gtx 860m with 2 gigabytes of vram
and windows 8.1 on a painfully slow one
terabyte mechanical drive that is the
sole bottleneck for this powerhouse the
GE 70 is a 17 inch notebook 17.3 to be
exact with a 1080p display and an
integrated HD webcam this is an LED
backlit panel with very good side to
side viewing but contrast suffers
significantly with vertical angle
adjustment it's a non glare display and
does open up at an acceptable wide angle
the screen is bright and also vibrant
and I love the amount of real estate you
get with the 17 inches the notebook for
the side is actually surprisingly light
at 3 kilograms and at only one point six
inches thick so it's quite portable for
this form factor and also take a look at
the size of the power brick it's very
small for a gaming notebook so I'm
really happy about that aesthetically
the ge70
carries the standard boring MSI notebook
feel nothing has changed that within
their Apache series much with the
brushed aluminum body throughout so
expect to have a fingerprint covered
shell the moment you lay your hands on
this thing the logo does illuminate in a
subtle white glow it's very nice and
aside from the keyboard there are no
additional lighting with the g17 the
brushed aluminum also found its way into
the internal frame with the glossy
accents surrounding the keyboard and
while that looks great this is
absolutely not a place for black brushed
aluminum this is a shot after 10 minutes
of me using the keyboard and I certainly
don't want to constantly wipe the
surface and I really dislike this
material choice here the trackpad is
also slightly grainy making smooth
navigation almost impossible and quite
frankly a real pain after 15 minutes of
use as it picks up the oils from your
fingers the left and right click are
also very hard to press requiring a lot
of force and many times it would
register the left click when just
tracking on the surface or get stuck
with the continuous left click without
me even touching the trackpad so I'm
very impressed on a better note though
all the notifications and activity LEDs
are located right where they should be
below the trackpad now moving on to the
keyboard it is designed by SteelSeries
with great tactile response and quick
bounce and the keys are actually
slightly heavier than my MX cherry red
switches also the keyboard does exhibit
a lot of flags so I wish there was a bit
more solid support underneath there are
three colors zones that you can play
around with with multiple color modes
like this music mode that changes color
based on music playback it's quite fun
the game mode that only illuminates the
left portion with a fade on the right
and many others that could personalize
your experience the keys are curved as
well and the height of the notebook was
not a problem at all for either typing
or gaming obviously however in the main
heat pockets with the g7 TR on the side
where the exhaust is on the left with
the entire left side getting noticeably
warm along with the area underneath the
space bar so my left hand was constantly
sweating and thus leaving that mark that
nasty mark on the surface while the
temperatures were not an issue with the
CPU and the GPU hitting around the 90
degree mark it was still fully stable
but there's no other exhaust on the
other side or the back this leaves a lot
of heat concentrated on the spot where
you don't want it the most on your left
side it's for connectivity on the left
we have an SD card slot audio jacks with
two USB 3 ports an HDMI 1.4 so it's
fully capable of 4k output at 60 Hertz
but they are all sort of crammed into
this one spot populating all which may
cause clearance issues and this should
not have been overlooked and spaced out
a little more then there's a side
ventilation that we've taken look before
power plug and the Kensington lock on
the other side we have a USB 2 port
optical drive that's rather loose when
it's out it's not a big deal but I
thought I'd mention it there's a high
power USB port for charging and powering
power-hungry USB devices VGA output and
also a Gigabit Ethernet
the ge70 does feature AC wireless as
well so network performance was always
top-notch one thing I'm impressed with
are the speakers these are from Dyna
Audio and I'm very happy with the sound
quality and the placement the a located
right beneath the panel providing
excellent directional stereo audio with
red lining underneath the frame that
looks pretty exceptional very small
subwoofers are also located at the
bottom for a little bit extra bass
response they don't exactly rumble or
vibrate the machine but instead provide
a full range like sound now it's finally
take a listen at how loud this laptop is
hey this is three tree with her broken
ox and today we're checking out a
wireless solution for your gaming needs
and I'm going to say this would be a
truly cross-platform audio solution
between consoles PCs Macs or any other
device that outputs audio taking a look
at the bottom one thing that really
bothered me was the non warranty
friendly user upgrade the belly of the
notebook is removable with a few screws
to get your RAM and drive slots however
the last screw is covered in the
warranty void if altered sticker and in
the market where these types of upgrades
are very common MSI's should allow users
to upgrade that painfully slow terabyte
drive and perhaps reconsider their
warranty policy next is the noise test
that complements what I just said about
upgrading that terabyte mechanical Drive
as you can hear the drive spinning
that's very annoying especially when
this happens all the time even when on
idle the fan is audible and can yet
actually pretty loud when gaming now
there's even a dedicated fan speed boost
button that helps with cooling but it
sure isn't quiet
and beside it is a color switch button
for the keyboard to quickly cycle
through the color options now let's talk
performance numbers and being gaming
oriented battery life is very important
the G 70 does come with a removable 44
milliamp hour battery that recharges to
100 percent while powered off in just
two hours as for gaming time I got 42
minutes with Metro last slide benchmark
on the loop on battery and since this
also features invidious battery boost
technology that basically works to
manage resources that are needed for a
specific frame target so it will adjust
frequencies and voltages of your
components I get extra 5 minutes of
gameplay with a 30fps target while 1
minute less with battery boost at 50 FPS
so gaming on battery in this sort of
worst case scenario still looks pretty
disappointing the ge70 does underclock
both the CPU and the GPU quite heavily
while on battery resulting in less
impressive results requiring you to play
at 720p for decent frame rates the CPU
frequency drops from 3.4 gigahertz
plugged in to 1.3 gigahertz on battery
while the GPU drops from about 1
gigahertz mark to about 650 megahertz so
in Crysis 3 at 720p on medium we get an
average of 41 fps Metro last light and
720p on medium we get about 40 and
Assassin's Creed 4 at 31 fps and also to
demonstrate the performance dropped
while on battery 3dmark scored 28 12
while plugged in we had a score of 49 34
this is a 43% performance drop while on
battery however when plugged in playing
the latest triple-a titles maxed out
yield some while performance for the
price and form-factor color duty ghosts'
averaging in 56 fps with full AAA
BioShock Infinite at 60fps easy Metro
last light is very demanding maxed out
at 35 fps Assassin's Creed 4 at over 30
frames a second which is nice
Crysis 3 drops anything to eat
sneeze fully maxed out so 22 FPS isn't
particularly surprising in battlefield 4
and ultra preset averaging at 37 FPS of
course maxed out gaming performance is
important for sort of comparative
analysis but in reality it does come
down to playable settings with each
system so optimizing the game through
GeForce experience is both very simple
and yields very satisfying frame rates
at 1080p and high settings now I know
it's been a long one here but let's
quickly recap the ge70 is light and
things for its own factor with a very
small power brick steelseries keyboard
is excellent in terms of feedback and
backlight as well the display is vibrant
although it's not an IPS Dynaudio
speaker is a very satisfactory and the
ge70 features the latest Maxwell NVIDIA
GPU that yields very capable gaming
results on pretty much maxed out
settings and the $1,300 this is very
impressive however regardless of how
attractive this price point may be there
are so many small details that have been
overlooked like the OL aluminum casing
inside that leaves your machine looking
terrible after use the trackpad is both
difficult to press and lacks smooth
tracking making navigation in Windows
true patience tests all the ports on
left side are way too close together and
might introduce clearance issues plus
only one exhaust on the left it gets
quite loud and heats up the entire left
side of the notebook causing unavoidable
hand sweat user upgrade for the drives
and memory are also locked up with a
warranty sticker making the painfully
slow 1 terabyte drive a real bottleneck
for Windows tasks if you're used to
working off speedy SSDs and lastly the
performance of battery is both
disappointing into poro scales as
squeezing out about 45 minutes of gaming
and the significant drop in performance
that would not think we want to gain
while on the go and before we conclude
make sure to watch our Maxwell overview
video outlining all the features and
many other things that we haven't really
touched up in this video by taking the g
