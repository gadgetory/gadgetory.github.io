yeah yeah it's been raining for the last
three days but now we'll get the proper
sunny base
wow thanks Acer for a nice right hook up
good do you like the deburr yeah but it
happens the limousine man but he missed
the hole I'm not a fan of limousines to
be honest you missed a limousine says
Eva
all right so we initially went to a sir
to look at their gaming predator line
and this new oversized RGB 5
underpowered gaming PC didn't exactly
catch our attention so Ebor was roaming
around and found something super
interesting instead okay guys so this is
the Acer swift 7 an amazingly thin
little noble width and i7 processor
inside so let's take a look but first a
message from our sponsor thanks to
fantex schoolmaster and Corsair for
making this trip possible and we were
all immediately blown away at the
unibody aluminum frame and the screen
because apparently this is the world's
thinnest notebook at 8.9 8 millimeters
the first generation of Swift 7 was a
tiny bit chunkier so the progress is of
course appreciated it's only 2
millimeters thicker than the 1 + 3 t
smartphone that's crazy this is pretty
cool check this out so looks like a
regular very thin notebook but you wake
up in the morning and you just gotta
open this thing up like that I think you
should presume you Shane you know but
seriously look at this if Davey was here
he would spin it like a bow I wouldn't
do it though just lay this flat on the
table its touch me - and because of the
thin frame the port selection is
obviously limited but we have a
headphone jack and the two type-c ports
one of which is used for charging
there's a power button and a SIM card
slot on the other side to turn this into
a 4G LTE capable powerhouse the screen
is 14 inches it's IPS and only 1080p but
we have Gorilla Glass coating for that
premium feel and lack of flex plus it's
also a touch screen the bottom chin is a
little chunky but the webcam is located
here and look who we found Austin in
actually super nice quality so the angle
may be a potato but the camera isn't now
Michael found the keyboard super
enjoyable to use with fast rebounds and
good travel distance so it must be great
for typing it's also backlit and there's
a fingerprint reader on the left side
the trackpad is pretty decent and the
coating around it hides the finger
smudges very well and we certainly were
not expecting such a thin machine to
have incredible speakers powered by
Dolby audio how good is the audio
it's it's impressive Wow now spec wise
we're looking at the core i7 Y series
processor with ultra-low voltage which
is why the estimated battery life is
about 10 hours it's still a seven
generation CPU so not coffee-like
but it is an upgrade over the i-5 model
which was found on a previous Swift 7
there's 8 gigs of ram and a 256 gigabyte
nvme storage all for a pretty expensive
$1,700 price point now the good thing is
this feels like a premium notebook with
the design and the screen to back it up
but it approaches the XPS 13 and the LG
gram territory in the form of
functionality so let us know which you
would potentially pick if you're in need
of something like this alright guys so
that concludes our Acer coverage the
Swift 7 looks so awesome let us know if
you would know potentially pick one up
like that something that thin that has
you know that foldability on the table
but yeah I'm a tree tree this is zebra
we got that mysterious mic in the front
I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
