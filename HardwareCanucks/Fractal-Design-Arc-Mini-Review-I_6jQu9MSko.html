table today we have a micro ATX case
from fractal design this is the arc mini
tower it is ringing in at just over a
hundred dollars so the price may look
unconventional for a micro ATX case but
the overall design may prove otherwise
so let's check it out
the external design actually looks very
familiar to some of their other cases we
have filtered mesh at the front acting
sort of as a dust filter along with two
five and a quarter inch drive base right
above now notice the plastic panel has a
brushed aluminum look so that's always a
bonus without leaving any nasty
fingerprints and keep the price of the
case at reasonable levels the panel can
easily be removed from the front to
reveal spacing for dual 120mm fans with
some clearance through the hard drive
cage now the panel is where you'll be
mounting the fans with these clips they
hold the fan in place pretty tight so no
worries there and one fan is already
included here with a nice sleeve cable
also already pre-installed is the three
and a half inch drive bracket and I
doubt it will come and useful but it
might for some people now let's talk
connections we have the power and reset
buttons standard audio ports and three
USB ports one of which is USB 3 the top
panel as you can see is completely
covered in the mesh and the reel of the
dust filters at the top now it can be
easily taken off with two thumb screws
for cleaning or to get to your top fans
what we have here are dual 120 and 140
millimeter mounts so all of you water
coolers are going to appreciate this
looking at the back we have the exhaust
fan tubing holes IO area for expansion
slots plus a vertical one and they
bottom mount the power supply with dual
dust filter now as part of the
accessories fractal design includes a
fan controller for three fans and it
would be perfectly utilized in that one
vertical slot so the side panel also
supports 120 140 millimeter fan combo it
is unfortunate however that this is
not a window case now the case stands on
excellence rubber feet and is very
stable so finally getting inside the
cage system is modular and I love it it
only requires two screws to rotate the
top part for improved internal air flow
if you do require to use all six drives
and of course the option is yours if you
want to completely remove it just keep
in mind the additional cable work you
will face if the drives are rotated
since they are pretty close to the front
fan of course removing the front panel
will allow for easier access and the
drives are mounted onto these brackets
this is not a tula system but it works
really well indeed especially with
rubber grommets to prevent vibrations
and of course 2.5 inch drives are
supported and moving on we have plenty
of rubber grommets around the
motherboard tray
however the CPU cutout could be expanded
to avoid the hassle of this assembly and
good news for stock air cooling as both
rear and top exhaust fans are included
and an optional 120mm fan can be mounted
at the bottom however since the case is
relatively small you do have to take
into account the length of your power
supply so anything up to 170 millimeters
will still have clearance for that
bottom fan and at the back we have many
cable tie notches and a lot of area to
work with for all your cable management
needs there's a large gap between the
motherboard tray and the side panel so
even if this is your first build you'll
find it a breeze and installing our 11
half-inch graphics card was no problem
even with the top cage in place spacing
will be limited however 2 to 60
millimeters for your GPU if the top cage
is rotated and once assembled what we
have here is a clean system that still
has a lot of potential for future
upgrades I really extract those approach
towards designing a functional chassis
they really have not forgotten about the
basics like simplifying your workflow by
providing lots of room
or a need cable job also we have an
excellent modular cage system dust
filters on every intake especially one
in the top very useful to keep things
clean and finally great air flow options
with three quality fans included however
while the case is designed well for its
purpose and priced reasonably well for
the function it offers some of you still
may not justify the price tag especially
if you're thinking of upgrading to fool
ATX set up sometime down the road now
there are a lot of options at this price
tag however if you require a solid and
well thought-out chassis the arc mini
may be a good choice and since it was an
absolute breeze to work with we're
giving in the hard okanagan
damn good a word so that is it for this
review let us know what you think of the
arc mini in the comments below or in the
heart or Canucks forums and we'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
