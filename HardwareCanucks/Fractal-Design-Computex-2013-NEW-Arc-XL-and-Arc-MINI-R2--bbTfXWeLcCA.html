incompetent when T 13 we're going to be
looking at two new cases they've just
announced the first one is the fractal
design arc ex-l continues on with sort
of the similar the internal design and
as well as external just slightly over
oversized case here supports for XL ATX
motherboard so you know we have great
water cooling support the top triple
radiator plenty of fan configurations if
you do want to install 240 millimeter at
the top it is offset slightly towards
the side panel so you have a little bit
more clearance there if you do have a
North heatsink weather for your
motherboard slightly higher and an
exhaust fans very fairly straight
forward here coming to the hard drive
cage this one here has been repositioned
because as you can see there is the push
and pull water cooling configuration set
up in this case so in the default
position the hard drive cage will be
placed here there'll be another
removable smaller hard drive cage and
the top exactly what we've been seeing
from practical design great internal
configurations that support for water
cooling and pull the top and the front
has excellent airflow as well and the
side panel that will be installed here
also will feature a tinted acrylic
window that will show off your internals
now coming out to the back the cable
management here as you can see is
absolutely amazing for a case full tower
of course so we have lots of space for
all your cables one cool addition is
they've finally added the SSD bracket so
no longer do you have to remove the
motherboard to install these excellent
brackets remove them with schools
install your SSDs as you can see gramma
rubber grommets fairly straightforward
plenty of Kabletown notches and overall
lots of room for any of your cable needs
and so coming to the front we have
similar aluminum looking front panel
it's actually plastic so minimizing on
the cost thus filters on here on every
intake over here and on the top is also
a dust filter dual front intake fans so
overall a very excellent full tower case
from fractal design lots of space lots
of airflow and water cooling
options lots of hardware options as well
modular hard drive which can you remove
and accommodate for water cooling and
also the optical drive will support for
optical drive so the second case that
they've releasing this year from
practical design is the arc mini are two
now it takes on the same concept from
the original our committee the arc midi
lots of our tools and middies the minis
very complicated but this is a one
pretty cool case because it's a micro
ATX and mini ITX capability but check
out how thick of ready you can fit both
on the top and on the side while still
having so much space to put any of your
vertical in components 360 millimeters
support radiator for the top if you
hundred forty millimeter radiator on us
on the front here the for the front
panel now that's quite impressive for a
micro ATX and mini ITX case as you can
see it has can still support plenty of
hardware inside all your water cooling
components a monster GPU in there as
well and bottom intake fan they can be
installed as well so a pretty plenty of
features here integrated into such a
small package so coming onto the back
again we see these SSD editions it's an
excellent choice from fractal design to
put these on there because it's quite a
hassle to have to remove the motherboard
to install these and this is one of the
one of the complaints that we had while
reviewing the previous revisions of the
case and the one thing though of course
as you can see the CPU cutout is fairly
small this will definitely be an issue
with this particular motherboard cable
management as you can see has been very
tidy for the for this computer and
working fractal design cases it's been
pretty seamless all their cable
management rubber grommets plenty of
Kabletown notches and the most important
is plenty of room for all your cable
mess so this is it for fractal design we
have two new cases the arc excel and the
arc mini are two</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
