practical design maturity fans not just
for computers
oops
the our ninth fury is becoming a
favorable choice for users choosing the
red side with appetite for outstanding
performance without entering the pricing
territory of the fury acts one of the
most appealing aspects of the our ninth
fury launch is bort partner range as
availability is not a concern and each
VG hbm GPU is covered with some sort of
outstanding cooler the asus r9 fury
Strix is on the review table today
priced around five hundred seventy
dollars us so a $20 premium over
competing try X card from sapphire or
power color which you can check out in
the eye or in the description the Furies
Trix comes equipped with the new directs
you three cooler design that looks and
performs fantastic with silver red and
black accents plus the Strix branding
all over the place like on the fans and
on the backplate with that distinct owl
notice the red element surrounding the
core this is the GPU for the fire not
only does it add the beautiful
structures of the backplate but it also
strengthens the PCB around the core to
eliminate the risk of flex and the long
term given how heavy the heatsink is the
triple fan design spent the entire
heatsink instead of the dual fan on the
previous generation and the fans now
provide higher static pressure and
better air flow at reduced speeds plus
they shut off completely when the card
is idle for totally silent runtime the
aluminum heatsink is massive and dual 10
millimeter heat pipes plus a few smaller
ones carry the heat away from the core
and add to this awesome appearance but
the entire coil design truly shows off
the thermal load potential as the Furies
tricks at load remained at 70 degrees
Celsius this is a good 5 degrees cooler
than the Sapphire card all this while
operating quieter at load than the Triax
card although we did notice some coil
whine when frame rates went over 200
buzzing was audible coming from the GPU
and would recommend enabling vsync or
free sync to eliminate such high FPS
that causes this GPU wine and it looks
like the large and heavy cool design
pays off
and the temperature Department and noise
the card is just over 12 inches so it's
not intended for ITX builds and for
those interested in a really compact
form factor welcome there's the r9 nano
the card requires duel ain't pinned for
power with accompanying LEDs to indicate
if a proper connection is made when PCI
Express cables are plugged in and power
consumption is actually lower than the
reference GPU not by a lot but it looks
like this quality component selection
that asus is doing here is paying off on
all fronts for the i/o we have the
standard triple DisplayPort a single
HDMI 1.4 and DVI out now that the fault
clocks for the fury Strix is 1,000
megahertz on the course just as on the
reference but an overclock mode is
available through the GPU tweak utility
that boost the core hole this is a
pointing only 20 megahertz and the Strix
has no problem keeping the core at 1020
megahertz
at all time and now with everything out
of the way here are the benchmarks
so as you saw the core frequencies are
only a tiny bit higher than reference
with just marginally better performance
across the board and/or clocking is
limited but we were able to push the
core to 1107 megahertz which brings it
right below the more expensive fury acts
and you gotta wonder if this
overclocking limitation is just in place
to keep some separation between the fury
line cards but the few restricts is a
beautiful card with great thermal and
acoustic delivery one that offers
marginal overclocking but enough to
close the gap between the flagship card
the r9 Fury currently occupies the price
to performance spot that is not filled
by anything from the greenside and the
Strix additions from a soos deserves the
hardware canucks
dam could award now it's me tree with
hardware canucks thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
