H 700 I has been assembled let's see how
it plays out in terms of configuring its
own fan profiles based on temperatures
because of that built-in device that
controls both RGB lighting and the fan
curves and see how the RGB lighting
interacts with the Krakken x52 that I
have installed in there because it's all
controlled through the cam software and
I'm hoping that it's nice seamless
integration that lets me do all those
things from one piece of software so
let's check it out right after this
creativity is fueled by the best
instruments it doesn't always come easy
and in the process you often realize how
important quality is the Rd 400 bio CC
gives you quality and speed with M de tu
interface the Shiban and flash and a pci
bracket making it possible to focus on
what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty alright so welcome to my full
review of the NZXT H 700 i if you guys
want to see the initial impressions
video and the overview of the whole
specs situation check it out over here
but for $200 NZXT is trying something
new because of that built-in smart
device which is basically a hue plus
which is a lighting control and a grid
plus which is a fan control built into
one and those two things combined sell
for over $100 which kind of reflects in
this $199 price point for this case but
I hope that we'll see a version of this
case without the whole smart features
for people who are not really interested
in the whole adaptive noise and fan
curves and stuff like that and just want
to have the frame as is and so the smart
device I'll call it the hub it's a
discrete unit installed on top behind
the bracket with this cool perforation
pattern it is powered via SATA and you
must connect it to the motherboard with
a USB 2 header and since I'm also using
the kraken X 52 that also requires a USB
2 header and also the front io needs to
be connected to the motherboard you have
to keep this in mind because my
motherboard only has two USB 2 headers
and therefore I had to keep the front IO
disconnected for the other two things to
work properly
there are three fan channels connected
to the hub each with three fan headers
so in total you can have up to nine fans
all controllable via the smart device
the RGB strip is at the top it's already
pre routed and it has an extra plug that
looks like a standard 12 volt RGB
connector but it is not it only works
with NZXT Zone RGB strips that must be
purchased separately and so it does lock
you into the unified cam software which
from a convenience standpoint I can see
because you have fan control and
lighting control and all these other
things that are built into one but it's
not without its issues for example there
are 26 pages of reports from users many
of which I've experienced myself not
with this one but with previous versions
of crack and coolers and this can be a
major deterrent to avoid the age 700 I
with the smart device luckily my
experience throughout this review with
cam with the age 700 I has been flawless
I have not had any issues with updates
and installation and it recognizing all
the things that they're you know
installed in there
and the only point of alarm was when the
middle channel for the fans showcased
zero rpm but I realized that it's
because I have nothing plugged into that
channel on that fan splitter in terms of
lighting I do love the sync option with
the Kraken but you know I don't agree
with the placement of that LED strip at
the top so I initially thought that the
blackout edges on the glass would hide
the bright LEDs but they're annoyingly
visible with each harsh LED piercing
right through that glass when viewed
straight on
you know interior lighting for me is
supposed to be ambient and this is kind
of a Miss on NZXT part also because the
LEDs don't spend the entire top portion
of the case it kind of stops behind the
bracket so to me it doesn't look
complete and now I want to touch up on
the internals and the assembly so this
cable management bracket helps to add
character to the inside but you know the
more I look at it the less I like it
partially is because of the color so you
have to approach your whole Hardware
build with that in mind so color
coordination has to be on point but it's
really kind of in-your-face and kind of
cuts the interior into halves it does
have two mounting positions and can be
removed completely toe and the spacing
is perfect for
pee-yew clearance but I find it too
tight for the thick 24 pin cable and
this angled top portion
even with my radiator at the top it just
doesn't feel right
but this spacing is there and it's large
enough to allow tubing to pass through
from the front if needed and you can see
that in Paul's build of the micro ATX
version of the case so thanks Paul
looking at the rear this is one of the
best pre routed cable systems ever on
the case because of these plastic
channels to guide and organize cables
accordingly this is very much needed
because the rear side panel sits on this
tooless hinge and so making sure
everything is flat as possible is very
important to close the panel properly so
I left things a little bit bulky just to
see how the panel would handle it and
with a little bit of force it closed and
it's not pumping out unless I push that
release button on the interior the
perforated power supply shroud is very
nice because you can maneuver those SSD
caddies but it may reveal colored cables
underneath so be careful with that but
otherwise it's a clean and hassle-free
assembly all right so now I'm setting it
from the cam software and we're gonna do
this together and from what I understand
it's supposed to cut of give the system
some load and see what happens with
temperatures and then adjust the fan
curve accordingly
I am still curious about how they're
determining in the noise level of the
system currently it's saying like 52 to
56 I doubt there's a microphone there so
it must be calculating it based on the
fan rpm all right so the idle baseline
has completed it says dude I should load
into a game and keep the CPU greater
than 20% and GPU greater than 50%
all right let's I'll tap out so I'm at
only 7% game running I don't think I'm
in the parameters of at load situation I
might have to launch it to pop G for a
little bit more intense gameplay alright
so now I'm playing pop G everything on
ultra and one thing I noticed is that as
soon as I launched it through the game
and we were in like the spawn screen
this turned purple and we haven't seen
it purple just yet so I'm thinking maybe
this is the indication on when your
system is actually being fully stressed
out so whereas in csgo I was cycling
between green and red
let's see what we are on cam software
okay I'm with 90% its excellent all
right see the problem is it didn't tell
me when the first step of the
calibration process was complete in the
preset so now in step 2 and my system I
think they're telling me that they're
stressing it out right now so I have to
maybe exit the game for it to continue
doing its thing okay so it did wait for
me to exit the game so we can do its own
stress test
all right so 35 to about 40 minutes
later the whole thing is completed in
the calibration department so both the
stress and the idle tests are currently
calculating and I've already changed my
shirts and you know what I'm thinking
that in this time that I've spent just
waiting for this thing I might have been
better off setting my own either
performance or the silent curves that
already preset in the cam software
already but it is an exciting idea as a
concept of the fans knowing how much
they need to spin up based on
temperature the cool thing is that the
whole adaptive procedure is that it will
learn based on what you do and change
those curves accordingly so that you
have the quietest and coolest system
possible but I feel like that's already
built into the cam software with those
silent and performance profiles that's I
doubt that the adaptive thing is very
much needed so it looks like we have a
little bit information about the
calibration process in the adaptive
situation so with idle situations this
is sort of our preset here whereas so
the fan the rear fan is not spinning at
all and we're not gaining any noise
reduction and then the front fans are
actually a little bit faster than that
my preset so here's our data when you go
into the load situation so the thing is
known GPU or CPU temperatures are
different from my preset but you can
notice that the noise levels has reduced
I don't know exactly how NZXT is
calculating this but I'm assuming it's
based on the RPM of the fans the front
three fans are spinning a bit slower and
then they're reducing the fan the rear
exhaust fan to zero rpm I'm guessing
they're determining in that it's not
needed anyway based on the temperatures
so therefore you get this
noise reduction now of course the
temperature in the calibration process
will be different per system basis but
it's funny to me that the rear fan isn't
even spinning but as I just jumped into
the game and you know the load both in
the CPU and the GPU has increased the
fans are working in more harmony to cool
the whole system so yeah that makes
sense
so I'm looking back at my entire
experience with the h7 100 I I think the
shell is excellent in terms of the
airflow it's you know it's a bit more
restrictive obviously because of the
paneling and that is a reflection of its
design even toward the perforations on
the side I feel like or adequate enough
for the intake because of the three fans
and the exhaust is not really an issue
at the top because of the spacing
between the fans and the top panel and
with the whole conversation about
adaptive machine learning acoustics
versus temperature
I think only time will tell to see if
users stick to that and they like that
approach you have to be logged in into
cam for it to work properly it does not
work offline so that's a deterrent to
some people but I also feel like those
presets are much easier to set and you
don't have to wait patiently for the
whole calibration to proceed although it
does turn off one of the fans as you
guys saw at idle situations and ramp
things up based on load and CPU and the
GPU and those temperatures as well so it
is taking the entire picture into
consideration in terms of temperatures
and acoustics so I guessing in in that
regard you are saving a little bit on
the acoustic side so the system being a
bit quieter but in the general scheme of
things is it really necessary and so
this is a perfect segue into my
conclusion I want to hear what you guys
think about this whole cam software in
this direction that NZXT is taking in
terms of just doing the whole automatic
thing so you don't have to worry about
temperatures and noise levels of your
system is that something you guys are
interested in or you prefer to do it
manually you know those performance and
silent profiles and custom fan curves
let me know in the comments below I
think there is a place for adaptive fan
calculations in a smaller
which is why I'm excited to review the
micro-atx an ITX versions of this case
but on a bigger scale like this I really
don't see the point on having that
really fine control of you know fan rpm
based on the cue sticks because usually
in a larger case you have a bit more
airflow to deal with and usually
temperatures with that many fans inside
the system are not an issue and so that
is it for me make sure to subscribe and
