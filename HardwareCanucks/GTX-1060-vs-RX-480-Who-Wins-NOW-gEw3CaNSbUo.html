been one of the most hotly debated
topics since both cars were launched
this summer the reason for that is
simple
they're both affordable and cost almost
the same we've even done a few tests
here on the channel comparing both these
cards in titles like Deus Ex and Gears
of War 4 but now that the holiday season
is upon us gamers might be looking for a
solid upgrade on their existing systems
to play some of the latest titles nearly
4 months have passed for both these
vendors to patch up their drivers and
update things in preparation for games
like Call of Duty infinite warfare
battlefield 1 and titanfall 2 so where
does a gtx 1066 gigabyte and the arcs
488 gigabyte line up now welcome to our
performance update for them where we'll
be putting these cards to a huge battery
of tests including more than a dozen of
games in dx11 and dx12
at 1080p and 1440p resolutions I won't
be touching on overclocking though since
Headroom can vary widely from one car to
the other this is going to be a big one
so before we move on quick message from
our sponsor the z9 neo-byzantine budget
with a large windowed side panel 5
included fans and the excellent interior
layout with super simple cable
management get it now link in the
description below now you might have
noticed we have four cards lined up at
the table and there's a reason for that
two of these cards are reference base
which means there are no factory
overclock or custom triple fan cooler
design whereas the other two cards are
slightly overclocked out of the box for
better results and have upgraded heat
sinks this should give us a clear
representation of the performance gain
you can achieve when you decide to spend
a few extra dollars so let's start with
team GeForce the first one highlighted
here is the EVGA gtx 1066 gigabyte
gaming that retails for just 250 dollars
before rebates while it might not look
like that much this is a very important
little graphics card unlike the
ridiculously priced $300 founders
addition we've originally reviewed this
card retails for less than in videos
baseline 260 dollar cost for the gtx
1066 combined this is a basic gtx 1060
without any significant upgrades and
what I like about it is its compact form
factor at just six point eight inches in
length it also features a single large
fan to cool the GP 106 core and I think
this would be a perfect fit for micro or
even mini ITX build moving on we have
the GTX 1060 super clock from EVGA that
retails for two hundred and sixty
dollars so that's a $10 premium over the
basic gaming Edition but the exact same
starting price that Nvidia first
discussed at launch a few key aspects of
this card is that the core clock gets an
increase of a hundred megahertz and it
features a heavily upgraded but still
very compact heating design while this
version utilizes the same three plus one
phase PWM and PCB as its reference clock
sibling that's where the similarity is
pretty much end the super clock variant
features an extensive heatsink design
with a copper core integrated heat pipes
and an extensive fin array whereas the
standard model that has a very simple
anodized aluminum setup this should
theoretically yield better temperatures
and even provide additional Headroom for
overclocking now on to team red and the
start of the side has to be the
reference based arcs for 80 because it
still serves as the backbone of AMD's
current GPU lineup while the blower
style cooler received some critique at
launch
AMD's driver team has been fine-tuning
this card on the software side so the
performance is now more balanced and the
power consumption remains within its
specs I also have to point out that
finding in arcs 488 gigabyte GPU at its
240 dollar launch price is a bit
challenging as most reference based
models float around the $250 mark before
rebates just like several of the GTX 10
60s like EVGA is gaming sapphires arcs
488 gigabyte nitro plastics thanks to
the next level
priced at $270 which is a $30 premium
over the reference launch price it is
the most expensive among all these cards
but it packs a ton of features the core
clock speed reaches up to 13 42
megahertz
you get a heavily upgraded PCB RGB LEDs
that can be controlled through the Trix
software suite quick disconnect fans
that can be easily swapped out in a
highly efficient cooling system that's a
lot for an extra $30 you also get a
backplate with this card and while I'm
not a fan of the design some of you
might like this transformer themed
there's a small cutout in the back plate
where you'll be able to locate a red
button this button acts as a hardware
based control for the LEDs and it's
bordered by a small v bios switch what I
found interesting here is that sapphire
included two biases within this card one
of which is a more efficient and quite a
preset while the other setting houses a
high performance mode which ensures that
13 42 megahertz core frequency can be
achieved more often oddly enough the
location of the power input connector is
on the rear edge and while that might
not affect installation on most mid
tower cases it can limit Nitro+ s
compatibility with smaller and more
compact chances so without any further
delay let's roll out the benchmarks to
see if team red or team green offers the
best bang for your buck
starting with 1080p in dx11 the super
clock 1060 and the Nitro+ arcs 480 we're
playing a cat-and-mouse game fighting
for the lead so if I were to put it in
simple terms it really boils down to
what titles the users are interested in
one interesting thing is how well the
arcs 480 cards do in many of the newer
games for example in titanfall 2 and
NVIDIA game works tattle and Call of
Duty infinite warfare see AMD cards far
out front while NVIDIA does very well in
battlefield 1 and some other titles
switching to 1440p index 11 and these
are the results
we see the same trend with the GTX 1060
superclocked
and the Sapphire arcs 480 Nitro+
fighting for that lead but things are
even closer here with the cards pretty
much time meanwhile the reference cards
fight back and forth and it's almost
impossible to determine a winner
AMD seems to have really closed the gap
let's see how this translates into some
very basic numbers as you can see while
the reference arcs for 80 was pretty far
behind back in July it has now almost
completely closed the gap with the
reference gtx 1060 it really does look
like AMD has been improving on the
drivers with their new architecture and
more importantly in new games this card
does very well indeed now onto DX 12
here the Sapphire arcs for 18 Nitro+
took the lead and pretty much every one
of the titles outperforming the super
clock gtx 1060 over and over again even
the reference based arcs for 80 did
surprisingly well taking second place in
front and even the super clock card
while the reference gtx 1060 tended to
take up the rear and videos cards don't
seem to like Microsoft's new api that
trend continues to an even greater
extent as the resolution increases and
here we are in DX 12 at the high
resolution of 1440 P and there's no
doubt about these winners being the two
AMD cards but did AMD really increase
their lead in DirectX 12
so here you have it and this chart put
things into perspective while the arcs
for a tea has been able to narrow the
gap with Nvidia's GTX 1060 in dx11
it is also able to further expand its
lead into x12 there's absolutely no
denying the potential of AMD's
architecture as more titles move towards
this new API whoo sorry for the chart
heavy video guys but this one needed to
be done the results really do speak for
themselves as AMD has made some serious
inroads towards improving the arts for
ATS performance against the GTX 1060
even though it's extremely hard to find
an RX 480 for $240 right now even at
$250 I feel like it is now the winner
from a pure budget-friendly perspective
AMD has been able to message its
performance to the point where it
completely rights against GTX 1060 in t
x11 and tends to dominate when dx12 is
factored into the equation but what
bothers me the most is trying to find
the card at its initial launch price if
you find this card for $240 I would
blindly pull the trigger no questions
asked now if you're willing to spend an
extra $30 to get better results along
with features like RGB lighting and a
custom heatsink the Sapphire are X 480
Nitro+ will not disappoint the GTX 1060
and particularly EB J's well-priced
super clock card on the other hand is
highly competitive and I think it would
be a good choice for titles like
overwatch doom OpenGL and battlefield
one in DX 11 three of this season's most
playing online games and so that
concludes our performance update between
the gtx 1060 and the arcs 480 boy this
has come a long way and the results sure
took an interesting turn since the last
time we looked at them back in July let
us know your thoughts about this
comparison and which one of these cards
would you actually pick looking forward
to your responses I mean bar with
hurricane axe thank you so much watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
