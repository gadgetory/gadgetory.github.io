great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hardware conducts and today we're taking
a look at an interesting product from
Logitech known for their wide range of
consumer and gaming related peripherals
this is the g502 proteus core tunable
gaming mouse priced competitively at $79
the build quality feels solid with
rubberized sides to help with a secure
grip and this interesting and angular
form that really suits the gaming appeal
logitech is going ahead with a more
narrow design with g5 a2 for larger
hands that say a claw type grip is more
suiting while a palm type for smaller
hands would be appropriate due to the
curvature of the top and a slight slant
to the right to be honest i'm not a fan
of this narrow style design as there is
no support for your ring and pinky
fingers on the right lengthwise the
mouse feels great but a slightly wider
form would have been more appropriate
for larger hands I think the smaller
form complements the weight perfectly at
120 grams that can be adjusted thanks to
this customizable weight system this can
be done by removing the magnetic bottom
plate that exposes the area where you
can add or remove the weights at your
preference around the sensor allowing
users to really fine-tune the weight
balance and consequently how the mouse
feels during tracking also the
individual weights are stored inside
this very convenient little housing so
you don't lose them and one thing I'd
like to mention and I hope Lodge that
grows out with a solution quickly are
the mouse feet many have expressed
issues with peeling corners that really
disturbs smooth tracking and even on our
sample the adhesive started to wear down
so an additional set of feet should
definitely be included the g5 a2 has 11
programmable buttons that can be
assigned through the software three of
which are easily accessible by your
thumb and I'm very impressed with the
way these feel I would tactile feedback
and consistent presses between all three
buttons the DPI shift button for your
point finger also feels great with the
dpi
indicator on the side with five steps
the primary left and right click aren't
too heavy and travel time before each
registration is quite short that is
preferable for quick presses during
gameplay the metal scroll wheel can
either be used as I click to click type
or the hyper fast mode that is useful
when scrolling through long documents
and especially giant excel sheets this
is enabled by the button sitting behind
the scroll wheel the scroll steps are
really defined which is good and it also
features the side-to-side clicks that do
not activate any scroll steps nor the
actual middle press that does require
quite a bit of pressure so this
implementation is pleasing there's also
the chef's profile button located behind
the scroll wheel with LED indicators for
the three profiles so that's always
useful the cable is braided with a
proper name tag attached for simple
differentiation between everything that
is plugged in behind your computer and I
always appreciate that the only lighting
Zone on this mouse is the blue logo
sitting on the rear left side that is
still visible when using the mouse which
is pretty cool the logo is not
multicolored and in this price
especially within the gaming category it
would have been nice to color match to
your other peripherals the optical
sensor on this mouse is tunable which
means it can adapt different surfaces
for optimal tracking and precision and I
haven't experienced any issues with
tracking unless you applied the wrong
preset in the software nor did i notice
any hardware acceleration with a g502
since this is an optical sensor it
cannot track on white surfaces nor on
glass so that's something to keep in
mind
sensitivity can't be cranked up all the
way up to 12,000 dpi that is totally
overkill unless you're gaming on
multiple 4k monitors now the g502 driver
software is simple and pretty clean too
the user is greeted with the option to
store the settings either on the mouse
itself or on the computer with three
different profiles and five stops for
dpi adjustment the 3d interface of the
mouse helps a bit when it comes to
adjusting all the 11 programmable
buttons the sensor tuning option can be
applied accordingly depending
on the type of surface you're using as
well as you can add surfaces to tune the
sensor on the mouse manually there's
also a bunch of pre-loaded gaming
profiles that can be applied to save
yourself some time on button mapping and
throughout my gaming experience g502
served really well at my usual 800 dpi
with precise tracking and once you get
used to the more narrow form I was able
to go on some pretty crazy kill streaks
and to conclude the g502 proteus has hit
the market with a lot of advantages like
excellent build quality and great
tunable sensor that can adapt itself
into different surface environments as
well as customizable weight system that
can be adjusted accordingly to the
user's preference overall button
placement is right on for tactile
response and consistency throughout
busts intuitive drive software is always
helpful however a few gripes exist like
it's narrow form isn't as ergonomically
pleasing for palm grip and the lack of
customizable led option is a bit
disappointing plus the issues with the
mouse feet are concerning
and we hope logitech addresses them
quickly the G 502 is still toe a great
choice for those wanting a well balanced
and an excellent optical performer he's
just so shy of a damn girl word because
of those peeling mouse feet the issue is
still apparent today however Logitech
does send out replacement feet but it's
just a hassle for needing to go through
the process and so that concludes our
review of the g502 proteus core tunable
optical gaming mouse thanks for watching
