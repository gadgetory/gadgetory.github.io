you guys ready for this another day
another gaming keyboard that we could
add on to our playlist because hey
that's our job and I should kind of like
doing this kind of stuff it's really
cool and we've heard of the term basic
premium gaming keyboard most probably
not because I just made that up after
testing out this new gaming keyboard
from HyperX this one's going to be a
really quick one so let's take a closer
look right after this the pure bassist
600 is now available with a tempered
glass panel with an easy mount a couple
of pure Winx two fans one of which is
140 millimeters with three modular
interior drive caddies along with dual
SSD brackets have nothing to hide
whether be quiet
pure bass is 600 alright so what do we
have here well this is the new hyper X
alloy elite gaming keyboard it's priced
around $110 so think of it as the alloy
FPS gaming keyboard that we took a look
at a while back and that was priced
around $99 so this one is basically an a
low FPS gaming keyboard with a few more
additions let's start with the design
and the build quality it's constructed
with a solid steel frame that's robust
so there are no flexes which is good
considering the premium price the lay-up
is also pretty much the same when you
compare it to the a low FPS keyboard
it's a full-size keyboard that comes
with a dedicated numpad so that's pretty
nice if you're working with a lot of
numbers HyperX has also included a
single USB 2.0 pass to report for quick
data transfers and it was something that
the alloy FPS lacked and that was partly
due to the removable cable which was
short and thin so it wasn't capable
enough to drive that bandwidth the elite
on the other hand comes with a super
thick cable I mean this is similar to
what you'll find on the Corsair are
higher in Corsair keyboards and that
kind of makes sense because the USB 2.0
pass-through port requires a bandwidth
and so that's why they have to make it
super thick because it carries the
signal cables inside but again it's the
downside to this is that it's difficult
to reroute in your desk so I would keep
that in mind again this was designed for
stationary use so not portable used like
what the a low FPS keyboard was designed
for so again two different purposes so
yeah keep that in mind one of the nicest
additions to the alloy Elite is the
inclusion of these dedicated media
playback buttons honestly I prefer them
over secondary function keys plus you
also get a date
volume dial for those quick adjustments
what do you guys think of dedicated
media playback buttons is that a
must-have on a gaming keyboard or is it
something that's overlooked let us know
in the comments down below
HyperX has also included a detachable
wrist rest which is awesome it's mostly
made out of plastic with an embedded
texture grip for your palms don't expect
silicon like material found on Corsairs
$200 k95 platinum but it gets the job
done really well they've also included
contoured and textured key caps for both
FPS or mobile configurations but we also
get a key cap puller so that's a nice
touch so let's talk about the switches
on the HyperX allo le tme keyboard and
interestingly enough HyperX played it
safe this time by going for a
traditional Cherry MX switch type
instead of some custom design mechanical
switch like what other reputable brands
do I have the model with the MX red
switches and honestly it was refreshing
to try these out again after switching
between multiple keyboards over the past
few years my daily driver the Logitech G
pearl features romaji switches which
took me a while to get used to since
they were lighter and a bit faster the
MX red switches are a great option for
starters who are looking to switch from
a typical membrane or even them chemical
keyboards as it provides a good balance
between actuations and tactile feedback
it only requires 45 grams of force to
register a press and actuation takes
place at two millimeters so it's not the
fastest when compared to the MX speed or
the Romer G both of which that actuate
at one point two and 1.5 millimeters
respectively
honestly in real world use you're not
going to notice a huge difference when
typing or even gaming because all you
need is a keyboard that's quicker or
faster to respond to key presses and
also anti-ghosting which is also an
important element to have because you
don't want to get screwed over in an
intense gameplay session when switching
weapons there's a dedicated game mode
button that locks the Windows key so you
won't accidentally land on the desktop
gaming on the keyboard was a pleasant
experience in fact if you're looking for
an alternative to the MX speed switches
that are found on much expensive
keyboards the MX Reds are a great option
especially if you're into FPS titles I
hopped into a quick battlefield 1
deathmatch session and I was comfortably
able to switch positions throughout the
gameplay the switches were responsive it
didn't require much force to register
and even performing regular productivity
tasks or
great so overall the owl elites check
marks the basic criteria is that most
gamers are looking for but ultimately it
all comes tough to switch preferences
for the end user some people prefer the
click enos and tactile responsiveness
found on the MX blue switches while
others prefer more silent experience and
there are other factors to consider and
that's kind of the reason why there are
vast majority of switches that are
available in the market today the HyperX
alloy elite can be picked up in two more
variants so you can get the keyboard
with either the Cherry MX blue switches
or you can up for the Cherry MX brown
variant let's take a listen to how they
sound the lighting is pretty basic just
like the a low FPS gaming keyboard all
keys are individually backlit by a red
LED there is minimal spill across the
device and I like that lack of RGB may
be a deal-breaker for some but it is
kind of difficult to find a keyboard at
this price point that features RGB
lining so just be aware of that it's
also driverless so it's designed as a
plug-and-play solution which can either
be considered a positive or negative
depending on what you expect from the
peripheral at this price point the
lighting effects are built into the
keyboard you can adjust brightness
through a dedicated button located at
the top left hand side of the keyboard
next to that you'll find the lighting
effects key that cycles through six
lighting modes there's a static effect
breathing followed by a keystroke effect
then ripple then a simple wave that only
flows in one direction and finally it
ends with a custom mode that lights up
the lost keys the inventory Keys
spacebar and the control key it can come
in useful when playing FPS titles say
goodbye to tables it's time to enjoy
wireless audio with the course they
avoid RGB gaming headset with the light
and comfortable frame low profile mic on
headset volume control and mic mute +
dual side illumination check out the
void RGB by Corsair the perfect way to
hear your game so to conclude the HyperX
alloy elite gaming keyboard is an
interesting addition to hyper axis
in keyboard lineup because if you think
about it they started off with the
HyperX a low FPS gaming keyboard that
was priced at $99
it was compact it was portable and I
quite liked that keyboard but for $10
more you're only getting detachable
wrist rest I dedicated dedicated set of
media playback buttons USB 2.0 class
support and that's pretty much it
nothing more nothing less
if you're looking for RGB lighting then
I wouldn't recommend this keyboard
because it doesn't feature that in the
first place but I am aware that they're
launching the exact same keyboard with
that feature for a bit more so if you're
willing to pay that premium price and if
you like hyper access design then yeah
by all means it's a great option but one
of my concerns is the inability to
program commands to individual keys
because first of all this is a
plug-and-play solution so there is no
dedicated driver software to command
them in the first place there are no
multiple profiles to switch between so
if that's something that you value then
I would completely skip the Alawis
lineup because now their keyboards have
that feature so what do you guys think
of the HyperX alloy elite gaming
keyboard as I mentioned previously is
this a premium basic keyboard let us
know in the comments down below I'm evil
