ox welcome to another video the RGB
phenomenon for gaming peripherals is old
news now for SteelSeries because today
we're taking a look at the mouse that
vibrates think about that
so the SteelSeries rival 700 has many
cool features that maybe justify the
high price in a few months because right
now unless you are a hardcore csgo dota
2 or a minecraft fan you can skip it
altogether the main highlights here are
the OLED display on left side that can
show custom bitmap pictures resolution
is pretty bad but you can sketch in the
editor for little messages and whatever
and its placement is actually not bad
you can let the mouse to view the screen
but in all honesty even with game
specific features for those csgo dota 2
and minecraft after even forcing myself
to look at the screen more often to
gather information it was anything but
useful it is kind of cool though to see
the number of headshots your kill to
death ratio the team score and many
others and I also got to give it to
SteelSeries for doing a fantastic job
with giving users a lot of options with
what happens on screen but with a very
poor UI unfortunately and it took me
some time to figure out exactly what I
wanted to show and how to show it on the
display so is the OLED display a gimmick
yes a big fat yes I don't even see how
it would be used in eSports you know I
can sort of justify the RGB colors and
branding and all that but you would
never see like a camera zoom in on a
mouse player to see how much ammo they
have in the competitive match that's
just not a possibility since our eyes
are glued to the screen and never do we
give the mouse any visual attention and
this is where SteelSeries has introduced
a new fantastic feature with tactile
alert which which vibrates the mouse and
that's I would say a lot more functional
useful than an oled display so again
this is only tied to those three games
and I bet it's challenging to develop
those custom api's so for example in
csgo every event can have a distinct
vibration like you get a kill your
health drops below 20% or you can select
the range let's say you only have 10% of
your ammo left you get flashed and all
those combined can have different
vibration indicators and this is
actually pretty cool if you narrow down
too
or play style for example I have a
double vibration every time I get a kill
and csgo which means I don't have to
look at the kill feed and detract my
eyes from the crosshair the same thing
with my health bar every time it drops
below 20% I have a distinct vibration
that I know what it feels like so that I
know to be more cautious and you can
loot certain things and create your
custom vibrations so that you you know
you know what's going on inside the game
without having to detract your eyesight
from the crosshair and look to beyond
those other UI elements and you would
also think this is a big fat gimmick but
actually has improved my concentration
on the crosshair again because I don't
have to look at those UI elements for
information everything is coming from
the mouse and those vibration indicators
as for the rest of the mouse it is very
well built this great surface all around
the back cover is removable for extra
plates the rubber piece in the back is
removable too the cable is removable you
have to included one long one which is
braided and one soft one which is the
soft PVC rubber one and finally the
sensor is also swappable the optical
Pixar 33 66 is included it is considered
to be the best sensor ever and also
found on many other fantastic mice with
an optional laser sensor module
available you can buy that separately
and I can kind of see what SteelSeries
is trying to achieve here with having a
good core body that is customizable as
for the rest of the stuff we have
excellent buttons the primary clicks
feel the best out of my entire
collection the scroll wheel is submerged
exactly how it should be with a nice
light middle-click and every scroll step
is recognized even if you're spinning
like a madman and I like that we only
have to CPI settings I always only
enable two on all my other mice and the
only thing that I would say is out of
reach here is the bottom thumb button
the browser clicks are great but needing
to reach all the way to the front is a
big no that requires grip readjustment
which brings us to form and weight we
have great curve in the right side
slightly taller body on the Left which
supports my hand very well no complaints
here but the way it is 135 grams without
cable so it's a pretty heavy Mouse I'm
used to the united gram FK 1 or the 9
for Graham caster but good thing though
the balance of the rival is great and
totally smooth glide feed help with the
transition of getting accustomed to this
heavier Mouse what you're seeing now is
csgo gameplay the sensor here is
brilliant no acceleration with very low
LOD the vibration is just subtle for you
to notice it but without affecting the
aim and this has actually replaced my
Zoe for csgo because of those primary
buttons I feel the pressure required to
press them is just perfect out of my
entire collection
now I like their engine three driver
software integration so you can adjust
your CPI acceleration polling rate and
buckling customization plus the two
lighting zones but I'm surprised that
left off distance is not configurable
and then entering the game sense tab is
where you can go nuts which screen and
tactile control for these three games
unfortunately those three games only
honestly I wish that they ditch the OLED
display and drop the price $79 which is
that sweet spot and very good quality
mice that are available for that price
point especially since you know for 95%
of the time you don't use it and pass
the point of like experimentation with
it and seeing if you can actually find
functional I didn't but that tactile
vibration is absolutely amazing and you
know I was more impressed with it than I
initially expected so that concludes the
rival 700 of you I hope you guys enjoyed
it the vibration motor is great the Olin
display not so much I'm Dimitri with
Hera Canucks thanks so much for watching
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
