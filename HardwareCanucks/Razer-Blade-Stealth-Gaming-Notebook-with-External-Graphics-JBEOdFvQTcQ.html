possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex and NCIX without them we wouldn't
be here so we are approaching a time
where external hardware power is
inevitable as our desire for compact and
light machines grows right in line with
the technology that's making it possible
Thunderbolt 3 or USB type-c is the star
behind this sort of availability and
Razer showed off an outstanding example
of how a balance can be achieved between
portable ultrabooks and insane graphics
horsepower this is the Razer Blade
stealth at twelve point five inch
ultrabook starting at $9.99 for the base
model which is a really nice price you
get an led-backlit 2560 by 1440 P
display with 70% Adobe RGB color space
at dual core i7 6500 you up to three
point one gigahertz eight gigabytes of
RAM and 128 gigabyte m2 SSD with the
higher tier models adding a 4k display
with 100% Adobe RGB color space and
obviously higher amplitude capacity SSDs
this is in direct competition with the
MacBook as the form factor is very
similar we have full unibody aluminum
with the solid screen that is touch on
all models RGB keyboard with plenty of
effects built in but you'd require Razer
synapse to take the full advantage of
that but this is the first blade machine
that I would actually want for portable
use and the power squeeze on this
product is of course the razor core aka
the gorgeous external aluminum body GPU
enclosure I do think this is the
best-looking GPU enclosure that I've
seen so far with ventilated parts where
needed built in RGB lighting that can
sing to your blade with the lighting
underneath the GPU itself bust with the
front on the globe the GPU rail just
slides out with a convenient handle that
supports 12-inch GPUs with a little
extra height than the reference and
allow you to power multiple displays if
needed and or just deliver that extra
graphics power to your blade if you
desire and from the IO we get four USB
3.0 for peripherals a Thunderbolt 3 4
main power Gigabit Ethernet port and AC
power input as the core has a 500 watt
external power brick with 300 watts for
the GPU and the rest for the notebook
and whatever less you connect to it this
for example is a very nice demonstration
of how the blade stealth along with the
razor core work in conjunction to power
dual 27-inch 1440p displays for all that
productivity thanks to a beautifully
designed GPU enclosure and Thunderbolt 3
make sure to let us know if you'd like
the full review of the blade stealth and
the razor core because perhaps this is
the future of letting us enjoy proper
graphics horse power for gaming and
other creative tasks while keeping the
main machines super light and portable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
