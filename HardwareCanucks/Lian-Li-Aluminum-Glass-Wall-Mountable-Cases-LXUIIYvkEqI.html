two-time case of the Year winner fantex
the always incredible Corsair and NCIX
so lien Lee showed off a strong line-up
of Open Series cases here at CES this
year and now with tempered glass
integration for the side panels similar
to what in wind is doing the first one
is the PCO 5 for a mini ITX system that
supports an ATX power supply and thanks
to the GPU bracket it allows the
graphics cards to stand with the case so
the chassis itself is super slim you
would need a GPU of 190 millimeters or
shorter to fit plus a low profile CPU
cooler so a very specific build inside
this wall mountable case they have a few
extra options for the sizes so a pc 0 5
s has a slightly taller body but
everything else is identical that can
fit a 240 million radiator for extra
cooling for your cpu it's still wall
mountable and provides extra flexibility
for cooling and if you can notice the
progression the pc 0 6s is even bigger
now supports a micro ATX motherboard ATX
power supply 290 millimeters for GPU
multiple locations for three and a half
and two and a half inch drives and
follows the same slim idea with the GPU
bracket that allows the showcase of that
beautiful card and the entire system as
well the top has three 120mm fan mounts
so a three sixty millimeter radiator is
supported and that was very surprised at
how much available space there is at the
back for all your cable management and
extra drives - and so this would be that
benefit of the rotated GPU pricing
starts at low 300s so the target market
will be small for these unique and
beautifully built pieces we also finally
get a chance to see the Leonie desk
computer case it's such an interesting
concept for those enthusiasts who want
to try something new the entire tray
slides out and you've got fan slots on
both sides for airflow and the removable
drive caddies plus this is ATX
compatible both for the motherboard and
the power supply so you can go all out
with your creative building process
there's also a dual system desk I mean
here we are talking about two
full-fledged systems one ATX and the
other
mini-itx this is all built out of
aluminum where that glass top is sure is
unique very pricey though it cost one
thousand dollars but for those in the
right mind to build inside this Leonie
computer desk should also discover a
pleasant experience working on it too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
