connect sport review today we're taking
a look at the very interesting and
promising case from silverstone this
their third revision to the Raven series
chassis which if you're not familiar
with implements unique interior design
with a rotated multiple tray to take
advantage of the rising hot air the
first two cases proved successful
however not without its flaws the new
Raven 3 chasse not only gets a facelift
on the exterior but Silverstone also
throws in a couple of interior
modifications that could make this the
best raven case so far so let's take a
look the case is made from 0.8
millimeter thick steel and reinforced
plastic at the front and the top the rv0
3 is to be available in the market in
june 2011 and the case retails just
under $150 making this the most
affordable raven case at the time of its
release the outside look reassembles its
predecessor the rv0 2
however silverstone has added a touch of
color with two champagne stripes
although this may not be everyone's
choice of color starting from the top
under the lid we have a pair of 3.0 USB
ports your audio and mic input power and
reset button and what seems to be the
staple of Ravens series cases the angled
blue LED bar which lights up when you
power on your system and it also acts
like a hard drive activity light next up
we have seven external drive bays all
have built in dust filters with
removable covers the side panel features
a window which seems to show only the
important parts of your interior and at
the bottom right this is the venting
area for your power supply looking at
the back we have mounting holes for a
single 120 millimeter fan the other side
panel has more venting for your power
supply and mounting for an optional 120
millimeter fan now this fan will provide
additional airflow to the back of your
motherboard and cool any of the hard
drives or SSDs installed at the bottom
of Silverstone's unique magnetic dust
filters which are extremely easy to
remove for cleaning
removing the top cover we have a fan
controller for the bottom two fans with
either high or low speed setting to
water cooling holes 120 millimeter
exhaust fan io area 8 PCI ventilated
expansion slots and plenty of venting it
would also have been nice to see a
second handle installed at the top for
easy transport of the case both side
panels are removed with two thumb screws
and the interior is all black the
pre-installed case wiring is already
cleaned up and when the major changes to
the Ravens series cases is the
relocation of the power supply this
allows all the cables to be facing
backwards and avoid any cable mess to be
seen when the case remains open and
interfere with the airflow here we have
Silverstone's tools designed for your
optical drives and 3.5 inch hard drives
the two hard drive cages can be removed
although there are 12 screws they have
to be removed first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 and 12
alright so 12 screws later and 4 bay
covers removed you can finally slide out
the hard drive cage each cage mounts up
to three hard drives and two 120mm fans
although of both fans are installed it
blocks off any wiring to your hard drive
so installing a fan either at the front
or the rear of the cage is recommended
if you want to utilize the extra cooling
and storage needs
speaking of fans the main cooling
mechanism of this chassis are the two
bottom air penetrators notices one is
slightly pushed in behind the
motherboard tray to provide additional
cooling if you do decide to install
drives at the back
since the case is designed for extremely
effective air cooling water cooling
options for the Raven 3 are limited only
a dual route can be installed at the
bottom and another one on the hard drive
cage the case supports a wide range of
motherboards including extended ATX
there's also a large CPU backplate
opening with markings on the case to
guide you during installation
there are also cutouts for your main
cables around the motherboard at the
back you get an idea why silverstone has
widened the case from previous two
models this where you're able to install
additional one two three and four 3.5
inch hard drives and up to to 2.5 inch
drives the 3.5 inch drive bay uses
anti-vibration grommets too alike quiet
operation and silverstone provides
specific screws for mounting so now on
to the assembly getting ready to install
all the components into the case was
quite easy and simple process except
dealing with a hard drive cage due to
the amount of screws that have to be
removed first as you can see the
relocation the power supply does
eliminate any cabling to be seen at the
front and to no surprise the cable
management at the back was no sweat
either the 5 centimeter gap between the
motherboard tray and the side panel is
plenty of space for any experienced
builder and should be fairly simple for
beginners as well in the feed more cable
room you can move the drive mounts and
instead use the drive cage for your
drives
if the power supply extension cord is
too short remove the twist tie behind
the front panel and the extra length is
enough to plug it in the power supply
can only be installed in one position
with the fan facing downward maximum
support length of the power supply is
180 millimeters this may be a potential
problem for 1,000 plus watt power
supplies as they tend to be quite long
after wiring in the system the front
looks extremely clean and the absence of
cable clutter will result in better
airflow the case supports graphics cards
up to thirteen point five eight inches
only with the bottom fan removed or up
to 12.5 inches with the fan in place so
in the time of this review any card on
the market should fit just fine with
even some room to spare besides its
innovative and unique design silverstone
has done a great job with cable
management options it really feels roomy
on the inside
considering this being a mid tower
chassis there are many drives mounting
options available and the rotated
motherboard tray provides a really
effective airflow and for the case of
this caliber we feel it is fairly priced
on the downside interior water cooling
is limited but not impossible and the
removing the hard drive cage is quite a
tedious process would have been nice to
see a simpler and quicker removal
options
thumbs up for Silverstone's knew damn
good case and that is it for this
