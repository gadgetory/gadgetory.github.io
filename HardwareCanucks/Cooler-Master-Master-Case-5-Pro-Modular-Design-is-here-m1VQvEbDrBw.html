you by fantex
nvidia corsair and CI x silverstone and
in win make sure to support them for
helping us bring this great content to
you so I personally was really excited
to visit Coolermaster at Computex they
were to unveil something that goes back
to their roots something totally unique
and something totally new and so this is
the master case five pro the premise
behind the design is modularity allowing
users to be their own creators with
having a base model upgradable with all
types of different panels whether you
prefer high airflow mesh or more of a
closed design for the front and top
portions and so the idea is to roll out
with a physical selection of
configurations where would you choose
the top panel you'd want which side
panel the number of drive cages and the
different fan brackets to really
customize your master case 5
the idea is to eventually have the
configuration website for your own
customization which is definitely more
convenient to emphasize the build
quality we had one of their reps stand
on the case he looks really comfortable
so the steel frame used is very well
made design wise it looks like a cooler
master doesn't it there are a few great
little features built in like the side
panel sits on this hinge when unscrewed
so it doesn't immediately fall off the
drive cage is totally modular there are
many insertion holes in the frame to
allow almost precise positioning of the
cage and everyone seems to be including
velcro straps these days behind the
motherboard tray and I'm happy to see
that because it's one of the best
non-permanent ways to secure large
cables there are two SSD brackets on the
top of the power supply shroud that you
can install on either side of the floor
I find that unique so if you like a
totally clean look inside but still need
that extra drive capacity that is an
option and you also have two SSD mounts
right behind the motherboard tray
airflow seems to be taken care of with
removable dust filter at the front and
triple 120mm fans support and dual fan
mounts in the top panel I was very happy
to see a version with tempered glass
panels that looks absolutely stunning
and with these solid front and top
portions
you get a slightly different looking
chassis but without sacrificing airflow
you probably get a more silent operation
thanks to proper spacing between all the
panels now coming back to this modular
concept the mastercase 5 is not entirely
unique as there's nothing totally new on
the interior frame but as a concept of
customizing your chassis based on your
needs is appealing and as an end user
what are some of the things that you
would like to see implemented with this
concept like color combinations material
choices and what are your thoughts on
the design of the chassis itself I think
Coolermaster would have to go and offer
many more exterior options as right now
there are two panel options only and
only inside you build either a custom
loop a standard gaming rig with a nice
open interior for least resistance or a
server slash storage option with all
these drive cages populated and
Coolermaster slogan for this new release
is make it yours so leave a comment
below of how you'd like to configure
your master case 5 and we can't wait to
review the final release
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
