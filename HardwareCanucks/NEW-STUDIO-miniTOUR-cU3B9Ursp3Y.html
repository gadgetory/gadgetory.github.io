happening outside Jesus
you know the best way to stay productive
is to have no internet which I don't not
yet the dark bass 900 may be the most
innovative case of the year with a
built-in Qi charger interior lighting
tempered glass that can be installed on
either side and a fully modular interior
that can be inverted if you so desire be
quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below new place is
coming along well the bag of cables is
deconstructed now I'm trying to arrange
them by display cables power cables
power supply cables and stuff the desk
is all ready to go right now I am going
to be connecting my Q plus strips from
the computer
I'm giving routing them behind the desk
here that's why there's a spacing so I
can sort of get in there and make sure
that all these strips are nicely aligned
but the problem is I have no adhesive
yet so right now I just want to make
sure they're perfectly working
also just an FYI I was wobbling like
that because I'm listening to music
don't want to show it on camera because
of copyright stuff so yeah I was just
trying to make sure that all the LED
strips are working fine because these
guys have been through a lot
multiple cases multiple builds multiple
feature videos and I want to make sure
that the strip that I will be applying
behind the table is all 100% and it is
aside from the very corner LED here that
doesn't display proper channels in the
blues which kind of sucks but whatever
it won't be able to see it alright a
little change of plans I have decided to
move the desk from my original spot over
there I mean this is my filming desk not
my actual working desk because the
sunlight was just way too hot there and
the reflection on the screen was just
too much for all of this light so I had
to move my desk on to this position
where I originally had my filming desk
so they're basically swamped so
basically I had to move my desk and look
at how clean all of that is I did some
work here which is fairly simple
and now you can't see it from this angle
from where I'm standing so it's nice I
have the giant thermal take case waiting
to be built in this is coming later but
yeah it's scientistic with a single 4k
display by speakers nice lamp obviously
my plant actually you should probably go
over here the keyboard cable here really
thick though I am using a wireless mouse
the g4 3 or 4 2 from Logitech really
good Mouse I decided to ditch the cable
here because with a wide desk it already
have ruins the whole aesthetic but I'm
really dislike the thick cable from the
keyboard I have the PC with tempered
glass on the Alex cabinet which looks
amazing
I have populated all these cabinets with
a bunch of stuff for example I have a
mice drawer and then my my gear which is
great because no longer this has to be
like on a shelf this shelf comes with
little hooks and I was able to put a few
headphones here that I normally use and
so this wall will be used
as my standard whitewall filming and
because now I've clear out that area
I'll be able to use that corner for some
really cool stuff like see this type of
shade differences between the corners
that's amazing and I definitely can
utilize this with some light play this
is my other shelf I still have to move
it but that's pretty much it
I also have a nice rug yeah that's my
new setup it's fully fully built I think
I'm a hundred percent sticking on this
location I just have to clean up the
rest of this stuff so it's been a week
let me show you what the office looks
like now so as I expected the slightly
smaller space would be a little bit more
challenging to work in but so far I've
been doing great I mean utilizing the
metal shelf over here I love the texture
and I love the shape I'm experimenting
with that mediators is the same the
white wall behind me is the staple with
a good price s340 elite check it out in
description below I'm really liking the
new desk space so I can shoot on the
white tabletop as the Sun comes in and
I'm going to show you some of the shots
now and they look really good reset
between these two is identical
gone are the white bladed fans and the
only thing really you have to worry
about is this corner I've been using
this as a storage corner but that will
change in the upcoming days as I'm
reviewing some of the things from that
pile and I'm very excited for one
particular beautiful case in particular
it's the DB or four from streak um I
cannot wait to unpack this and this is a
little power supply to come with it
build a system into it and we have some
exciting cool project in the works so
stay tuned so the first video I've ever
shot here is processing right now it's
the HD 6x X very proud of this video
it's the first product that I shot
entirely in this office space which I'm
pretty happy with I'm you I actually
utilized this corner because of this to
shade color and add a very dramatic
lighting with this softbox and actually
this tripod is exactly as remain in the
same position where I filmed it the shot
turned out to be really cool and moody
but recently I've actually started
running with my
HD 598 which I love basically what I'm
trying to do next is set up some type of
a template for what to do after I'm done
shooting in a previous space because it
was larger I was able to just sort of
tuck away the lights tuck away my tripod
and stuff and now I just have to be a
little bit more cautious on this space
and be a little bit extra clean just so
that I have some maneuverability when it
comes to shooting something else a lot
of fun fact I've been editing these
videos on the Mac Pro the 2015 edition
and just something that for people that
have purchased the new ones I mean oh
yeah
yip-yip see that or a different one mmm
no dongles required yeah sorry about
that
so another fun timber is that I'm
recording these vlogs on the little
rx100 mark 3 from Sony but I apologize
for the crappy audio and from now on
we'll try to use the g7 which is
currently with a rode microphone so the
audio quality should be much better and
the video quality also I'm actually
using this as my main 4k camera right
now but it has a 1080p 60 mode so I can
be you know mixing the footage between
these 10 cameras just perfectly well so
let me know what you think about the
audio upgrade with this little
microphone there and also some of you
have been asking to see Eber in these
over of vlog episodes so if you want to
see that let us know in the comments
below we'll make sure to deliver I'm
gonna meet you with our Canucks I hope
you guys enjoyed this episode of behind
the scenes what's happening in this
space we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
