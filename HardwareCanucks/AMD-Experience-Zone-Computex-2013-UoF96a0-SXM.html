experience zone here at computex 2013 we
just finished up with the game the
conference and what we've seen here is
they're really hyping up the apu they're
really pushing towards the apu both on
the mobile sector and on the desktop
sector as well so let's go inside I
check out exactly what type of products
they have on display here both tablets
and notebooks along with the desktops so
one cool notebook that we saw here at
the aim the experience zone was the asus
you 38 and what's cool about this
notebook is a 13.3 inch screen so not
too large great for you know a small
compact spaces but it's a 1080p display
so great resolution at such a small
scale now also it seems like the
contrast ratio is pretty good you know
playing far cry 3 blood dragon lowest
settings but at full 1080p resolution
it's running pretty good again not your
best frame rates but again this is a
very thin extremely thin notebook
running the aim da 1050 745 m so of a
pretty powerful mobile apu rid the AMD
radeon HD 686 10 g six gigabytes of ddr3
so all in all specs wise is pretty good
and as you can see it can run gaming at
acceptable levels on the side here we
have two USB 3 ports HDMI port micro USB
and a headphone jack also the power plug
is fairly small so hopefully the power
brake is also going to be not too large
that's going to have an issue with
notebooks these days on the other side
we have SD card slot and another USB 3
ports so plenty of connections is again
this is a notebook so we are missing an
optical drive unfortunately would be
nice to have a slim optical drive
installed there but we can't have it
also really cool notebooks here from
Asus so now the cool thing we see here
is this quantum tablet powered by aimed
ease apu the a for 1200 aim d radeon HD
8180 has 2 gigabytes of ddr3 memory and
cool thing 128 gigabyte SSD so very
fluid perform
in terms of responsiveness and also wake
up kind of a very important for tablets
as well not a physical windows button it
is a touch button let's go back to
desktop as you can see it's fairly fluid
because of that a 128gb SSD plus all the
hardware that's installed in the tablet
this is a full HD display so very nice
and crisp display looks like an IPS so
viewing angles are really good yeah
viewing angles are actually really good
on this one unfortunately we don't have
any dedicated keyboard buttons something
that I would like to see so only can be
accessed through desktop here on the
side here we have a mini HDMI port
headphone jack and micro SD and a sim
card slot no USB unfortunately on that
side and then we have a USB 3 port for
charging and also connected to computer
and transferring data a charging port a
screen lock button and volume rocker so
pretty standard here on the top also
have the power button to turn on and off
the device now one thing that we also
noticed is there's no nothing in the
bottom so it's completely bare which
means that there is no docking station
available for this tablet so this is the
OEM design so that the white label
meaning companies can brand it as their
own therefore quanta has come around and
picked up this tablet and branded it as
the quantity tablet a really cool
product here we see here at AMD
experience zone so apart from seeing the
APU is being pushed for the mobile
market also the desktop market we're
also seeing AMD really pushing towards
the gaming experience as well as serious
so apart from the AP use this is the
running the AMD 7990 so the world's
fastest graphics cards at the moment so
the sheer scale of this gaming
experience is actually quite amazing so
we have so many five screens this is
1920 x 1200 resolution / screen so
fairly fairly a lot of pixels on this
single single panel set up here but it's
running tomb Raider's so fairly graphic
that sense of gay
but again this is an experience like no
other five monitors out of one card
actually quite quite unique and the
frame rates are very very acceptable and
the graphic settings here aren't maxed
out but I'm sure that with some
optimization it can run this game fully
maxed out settings so what else we are
seeing here the aim the experience zone
is the diversity of applications of AP
use throughout the entire range of
either be a mobile system a desktop
system or an all-in-one system like this
one you see here this is a 42 inch
display 1080p resolution is also touch
so that's a that's a fancy addition but
it's all powered by this apu the GX x 42
5 GA this is a quad-core clocked at 1.5
gigahertz the total power draw from this
apu is only 15 watts so it's a very low
power solution it's also right in the
AMD Radeon 8330 II and has ddr3 memory
slots here so that can be customizable
but again a really cool solution all in
one perfect or kiosks and things like
that apu applications not just for
mobile computing and gaming but also for
real life for the useful applications so
what we have here is the msi gx7 t so it
features the world's fastest mobile GPU
which is the HD 8970 m it's running by a
shark on three screens from all of them
from this laptop so again very
impressive performance this laptop also
has an APU installed which is the a-10
5750 running it's running Windows set
windows 8 and also the GPU is two
gigabytes of gddr5 memory so again
allows us to run this 33 monitor
resolution that no problem at the fairly
acceptable frame rates as well 8
gigabytes of ddr3 memory a very
impressive performance from AMD all
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
