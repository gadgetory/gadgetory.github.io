possible by our partner nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to corsair
phanteks and NCIX without them we
wouldn't be here so CES was mainly
dominated by VR and automotive content
and NVIDIA has a large and passionate
foothold in both we have to see the
latest progress on their Drive px
ecosystem that looks very promising for
the future of driving in all types of
elements from safety too smart
navigation to collision prevention and
finally autonomous driving which is kind
of scary but also super cool the drive
PX has a compute power equivalent of a
hundred fifty MacBook Pros and utilize
invidious drive net to learn the
environment to detect objects in the
real world to separate between objects
such as people are the cars trucks
traffic signs driving versus pedestrian
zones and the list goes on the demo day
showed was of a sensor fusion in front
of the car where natural objects like
water to similar train and then a bright
flashlight to simulate harsh direct
lighting on a sensor so multiple sensors
can work together to produce the most
accurate representation of what is being
seen in front of the car all the
pedestrians that cross the path were
recorded as such and outlined via a box
but taking that a step further to see
the full potential of these spatial
sensors to detect your surroundings the
passing cars the notifying you when it's
safe to change lanes and even in really
poor weather conditions where the human
eye may not pick up that distant car
ahead of you but the drive px2 will and
this is what the dr px2 module looks
like it will feature pascal GPU 12 cpus
and it will be water cooled with a 250
watt power envelope this representation
of a liquid-cooled supercomputer inside
the car is plenty exciting especially
when you see the tests that have been
performed with this side type of sensor
fusion to reach this next level of
information collection in real-time what
all types of dynamic variables on the
road Volvo would actually be the first
manufacturer to implement the drive px2
system which they are known for their
safety reputation is strong and that in
my opinion says a lot about the dr p x 2
and so in regards to pascal it is
exciting and
we will be doing more coverage on when
things are more updated and solidified
so make sure to stay tuned for more
updates</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
