dammit
level 20 notes level 10 alright what's
up guys I'm Dimitri with Harbor Canucks
here at thermaltake checking out their
new level 20 so they're celebrating 20
years as a company and this has been
inspired by level 10 if you guys recall
that for what 10 years ago I'm guessing
paneling so obviously you can see that
here to triple chamber layouts with the
main chamber for your system it's kind
of like a compact mid Tower a very large
section the front that accommodates
radiators and cooling and the reservoirs
and tubing and then the top chamber is
basically just for your power supply and
to accommodate the entirety of this
cohesion of this whole channeling
there's the giant the biggest rubber
grommet that I have ever seen inside
there it's kinda hilarious and kind of
cool at the same time and by the way
this video is sponsored by fan tech
schoolmaster and Corsair thanks to our
sponsors for making this video possible
so starting off with the top IO so we
got four USB threes a type C port this
is a first for Thermaltake and just the
general IO panel and then moving it to
this front chamber so I asked them as to
why it has to be this big and why this
entire case I mean this thing is
gigantic you probably gain some you know
gains by lifting this thing around but
it's about you know perspective and
what's the word you know what I'm
talking about like when like different
sizes what's the word so what I meant to
say was that the chambers are laid out
this way so that it looks to scale so if
you had very nice compact sort of mid
tower section here and if this was
anything smaller the whole thing would
just look you know out of proportions
proportions that's the word okay okay so
in this front chamber what we can do is
basically it's meant to be for radiator
and you can mount up to a 480 millimeter
at the front it's this wide as well
because you can route a reservoir and
this whole thing is just kind of just
dedicated for you water cooling hardware
and one of the cool things is that you
can route your stuff from either the
bottom or the top into this main chamber
and collect and connect everything
throughout all right so removing the
front panel although I've got locked
okay there we go
it sits on this like little Tula's hinge
at the top and
here basically you can see you have full
access to that entire chamber you can
remove the fan bracket and thus all your
fans install your radiator install your
reservoir and ya have that entire nice
accessibility for that entire thing in
the front and in the main chamber as you
can see here we have additional rubber
grommets above here so you can pass your
tubing through that and you don't have
to utilize the very bottom or the very
top and additionally if you don't
potentially want to use any water
cooling you can populate 6 Drive caddies
that will be for your storage
compartment and that's for the side
panels so we have three tempered glass
side panels and they're all tempered
glass nicely tinted with nice blackout
perimeter and they're all sit on nice
quality hinges and are secured with this
tooless mechanism on top now in terms of
illumination and the fancy element
they're still unclear about what - how
many fans to include them what type of
LED strips but the built-in LED strips
in between the chamber are a nice way to
actually separate between the front and
this section here and they kind of this
transparent illumination that connects
to their hubs so you can control the
lighting the effects and all that stuff
so let's move on to this chamber so here
we have EA TX support right now we have
a standard ATX motherboard layout at the
front here we have another radiator
support for 360 mm and radiator or like
you can do like a 280 lumen radians in
there as well
the vertical GPU bracket comes included
and it's incredibly sturdy this is not
going anywhere at the bottom here so
there are some space for SSD caddies and
one of the cool things you can notice is
the tubing from the front chamber so the
whole idea is that you can mount all
your water cooling support here and
route your tubing below so it's a little
bit hidden it's a little bit discreet
but as soon as it enters into the main
chamber you can go crazy you can use
your creativity to disperse that you
know that tubing for really cool
showcase right now it's a little bit
boring but it does showcase on exactly
how that tube passes through those
chambers and then we enter into this
hilarious top chamber again the
perspective here needs to be present
obviously this which is why this top
chamber which houses only a power supply
but it looks hilarious because the thing
is like another micro ITX
or like no micro tech smell like a mini
ITX enclosure alright so the power
supply is mounted verdict
so you can see the fan and their
illumination obviously it's a thermo
tech power supply that is illuminated
but Eber check this out we have this
giant like incredibly it's probably the
size of an ITX motherboard rubber
grommet that allows all your power
supply cables and all the tubing to pass
through from the main chamber into the
power supply chamber and then enter into
your you know water cooling chamber
there so it's definitely an interesting
approach obviously the space gray and
the design layout I really like this
it's not my style in particular because
the thing is just ginormous and I
wouldn't know what to do with it but in
terms of modularity so because it's
aluminum panels you can go crazy with
creativity in terms of coloring it or
you know doing certain cut outs but
unfortunately you can't easily remove
the the front front section or the top
section and that would be hence
something that I would love to see but
if you are committed to disassembling
this thing it is a possibility so there
are some rivets there's some screws so
you can go nuts now so for case this
size I was expecting to see maybe
support for a dual system because this
whole thing you know it's quite large
you could probably fit something inside
and you potentially could but I'm kind
of you know it's kind of sucks that
thermaltake didn't include that as your
default support but they're seeing it as
like this really high quality premium
enclosure though so people are most
likely just gonna do something simple
and just enjoy the novelty of having
something like it so now comes the price
point talk so the thing will be launched
at $9.99 so $1000 you know on top of my
head is gonna be competing with the Fant
excel eat which is $8.99 you know has a
lot more options for the user but
obviously this thing looks a lot
different so if you potentially love the
looks and you just fall in love with
something that you could potentially
explore on how to navigate your hardware
throughout all these three chambers then
ya go nuts and coming to the back as you
can see it's quite bare a little bit
standard no tamper claw side panel but
of course that aluminum structure is
continuing here and I really love this
perforation over here because obviously
that's where the exhaust happens from
that main chamber and
use follows the same shoeless approach
for removing that side panel and because
this case is so wide like like it's
really wide you have an inch in some two
inches of cable management room so you
regardless of what you put in there
regardless of how many hubs so many fans
somebody whatever cables you will be
fine alright guys so that's it for the
level twenty what do you think about
that large enclosure for the size I feel
like the options and the hardware
configuration are a little bit limited
but maybe that's the whole point is
trying to turmeric is trying to channel
your particular build into a specific
direction so you enjoy the case and you
enjoyed the building experience but yeah
what do you think of it let me know in
the comments below thanks so much for
watching we'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
