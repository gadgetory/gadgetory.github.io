enclosures is getting pretty tight and
it's quite challenging to design a case
that can utilize the space in the most
efficient manner without too many
compromises on the hardware and the
Super Series from silverstone has gained
its recognition in doing exactly that
offering small form-factor computing to
be used for HT pcs or mobile systems so
the new ASG o 9 is really pushing the
boundaries with an extremely high space
efficiency that lets you build a
high-end system so let's check out how
this $99 small form-factor stacks up and
starting off with the front panel we
have a brushed aluminum look that is
actually plastic which allows this
luxury aesthetic without you having to
pay the premium now the design may look
neutral and utilitarian but it is far
from a good-looking case next up is a
slim optical drive mount which includes
a mounting bracket to secure the optical
drive along with the adhesive rubber
pads to reduce vibration and there's
just enough room for the cables in the
back but like with everything else with
this case things are going to be pretty
tight and moving to the front we have a
dust filter that is easy removal and
it's actually meant to be used for your
power supply then we have all the
connections are also located in the
front with your power and reset buttons
2 USB 3 ports and your audio jacks and
silverstone includes a USB 2 adapter
which is an added bonus on the side we
have ventilation holes for your power
supply to breathe and a full strip of
airflow options for your graphics cards
which includes a built in dust filter
that also can be removed and accessed
from the side and here we have the
mounting holes for 80 and 92 millimeter
fans for the left two slots and 120 or
92 millimeter fan for the right slot now
this array of cooling is specifically
designed for your graphics cards and
especially would be useful if you are
running dual GPUs now on the other side
we have more ventilation for an optional
80 millimeter fan along with the little
outdent that helps with the cable
management at the back we have an
exhaust fan our area power supply plug
fan speed adjustments for the top fan
with low or high setting and four PCI
expansion slots with additional venting
and the top house is a similar
filter is on the side also easily
removable for cleaning and it covers and
included 180 millimeter intake fan now
this fan is a cooling powerhouse
Silverstone's own air penetrator it
directs airflow in the well controlled
manner towards all of your internals and
also included that these transfer
brackets for installing a 140 millimeter
fan for the top but you are probably
best with sticking to the 180 millimeter
air penetrator and so getting inside the
case does require you to dip into your
toolbox for a handy screwdriver now
that's because the outer shell is
separated into the side fan panel and
the main top panel now the bottom is
completely flat and Silverstone includes
adhesive rubber feet that will add some
stability to the case and also give the
user a chance to mount the case either
horizontally or vertically depending on
your situation and notice there is no
ventilation holes at the bottom so your
second GPU may get choked and that's the
main reason there are three side fans so
getting inside the case we get an
additional 120 millimeter exhaust your
motherboard area with support for micro
ATX motherboards this is very impressive
for a case this size and really opens up
your options in terms of building
high-end system the power supply is
located and the rather unconventional
spot in the front with the cables facing
the back panel then we have all this
room dedicated specifically for your
graphics cards and check this out we
have thirteen point three inches of
clearance and went for expansion slots
dual card support makes the SGO nine
very appealing also CPU coolers up to
165 millimeters are supported which
means most high end towers are
accommodated despite its small stature
and to further help with cooling an
optional 80 millimeter intake fan can be
installed at the back and to avoid any
unwanted noise from the fan Silverstone
includes an adhesive foam to be attached
between the fan and the side panel now
let's show you how space-efficient this
case really is starting with the power
supply first we have the bracket that
allows you to install the power supply
either facing the inside or the outside
and working with our longer unit
measured at 180 millimeters in length we
have no problems fitting such a
powerhouse inside this tiny
ah see and once you connected the power
supply on the inside you're good to go
of course if you are working with longer
units modular cables would be ideal so
the back to 3.5 inch drives can be
mounted onto this bracket with the
connections facing the bottom and since
cooling is very limited at the back we
would recommend staying away from high
speed drives but you can also mount for
SSDs at the bottom with these brackets
however you will have to remove them
first in order to secure the SSDs and
due to such limited space one of the
SSDs must be upside down in order for
the connections to have clearance moving
on there is a cutout right underneath
the power supply to route your cables
but unfortunately no zip tie notches to
secure the cables so let's wire this
thing up and see how it handles with
cable management
now again modular power supplies are
highly recommended just to avoid any
unused cables taking up unnecessary
space and you can route the main cables
through the top as well and use the
bottom portion of the chassis to
concentrate all of the rest of the
clutter and with everything routed it is
actually quite impressive however you do
have to spend some time tucking away the
cables and making sure things are
properly connected and also their
assembly requires very specific building
sequence and the manual really was a
savior with great deal of information on
how everything should be installed
properly one thing popped out with the
accessories is this molex to three fan
connections cable and Silverstone
recognizes that you might not have
enough fan headers on your motherboard
to connect all the possible fans in this
case so it's a useful thing to include
for those wanting to utilize all the
available fans inside the chassis and so
when it was time to mount the panels
back onto the case there seemed to be
interference with the right fan and the
PCI cables coming from your GPU you
might encounter this issue depending on
your PCI cables but slightly pushing in
the panel and tightening it with screws
we got it to fit and the fan has a
pre-installed grille to prevent the
cables from hitting the fan blades now
the same issue arose when trying to put
on the top panel it really is a
challenge especially with all the cables
coming from your power supply but
nonetheless it snug fit for both side
panels and you have yourself a high-end
system in the
absolutely tiny package and for those
frequent LAN events Silverstone offers a
travel bag that can be purchased
separately that fits the SGO nine and
many other cases in the zubur series so
arriving to an event with a gaming
machine inside the gym bag is doing it
in style and this type of portability is
very appealing and for those just
needing the small stature due to space
limitations this chassis does it all of
course except water cooling so this new
addition to the sugah line is one
engineering masterpiece you'd never
expect to fit this much into a 23 litre
enclosure and that's the beauty of the
SGO 9 it's small form-factor does not
limit your options for high-end system
with micro ATX support dual graphics
cards with up to thirteen point three
inches of clearance
165 millimeters for your CPU tower with
power supplies in lengths of 180
millimetres are all taken care of and
your default cooling options are also
quite impressive with three included air
penetrators and some three extra fan
mounting options to avoid overheating
and then total of six drives can be
installed inside the chassis and again
it all comes down to small stature
without any hardware compromises and
lastly routing all the cables does
require a specific assembly sequence so
make sure to spend some quality time
with cable management now in the critic
aside the only thing I can mention is I
would have liked to see ventilation
holes along with a dust filter at the
very bottom of the case this would be
useful for dual graphics cards as the
second card will practically be choked
by the bottom panel but the default
cooling should suffice for even dual
GPUs so the SGO nine really surpassed
our expectations and could set a new
standard for small form-factor
enclosures it's functional space
efficient and most importantly welcomes
enthusiast hardware so at $99 this is
one damn good and damn good value case
alright I hope you guys enjoyed the
review and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
