generation mainstream mobile processors
a little over a month ago and while
there isn't a significant architectural
shift with these new lineup they did
manage to tweak a few things here and
there and of course add some more CPU
options that Rock some wicked specs now
we're all aware of Intel's processor
release schedule I mean on the mobile
side of things it's a bit confusing
especially with whiskey lake and now ice
lake rolling into the mix it just gets
way too confusing for the consumers out
there but if you look at the mainstream
like high-performance lineup on the
notebook space I think the biggest shift
in that space was obviously with the
introduction of the eighth generation
processors because when you roll back a
couple years ago the biggest or popular
the most popular CPU option was the core
i7 7700 HQ it was a fork or 830 CPU that
was plenty enough for a lot of tasks but
as soon as Intel announced those new Inc
generation CPUs those two extra cores
those four threads
it was a huge benefit in terms of
multi-core performance for video editing
and of course a lot of other workloads
that could that could take advantage of
those two extra cores and now we're here
with these new nine generation
processors and it actually got me
thinking what percentage improvement are
you actually getting out of these new
processors in certain workloads let's
find out but first a quick message from
our sponsor the new razor blade still
defines portability without compromising
on performance featuring Intel's latest
agent CPU and NVIDIA MX 150 GPU up to 16
gigabytes of memory and up to 13 hours
of battery life experience some of the
most popular games wherever you are
learn more about the blade stealth down
below alright so let me set the stage
for you guys before I hop into the
performance segment you're gonna be
finding these new 9 generation high
performance mobile processors in a lot
of gaming laptops as well as
professional workstation notebooks
because they still use the same 40
nanometer architecture just like the K
generation CPUs what's really new with
this lineup is the support for new
things like Wi-Fi 6 support for Intel's
new octane memory H 10 up to 128
gigabytes of ddr4 ram support versus 64
gigabytes on H end models and most
notably it's the introduction of the
core i99
a thk and the 98888 core 16 threaded
CPUs and if you're interested in
learning more about the new lineup you
can check out our explained video right
over here I should also mention the D
core i7 8950 HK from last year was an
overclockable CPU that was the flagship
mobile processor at the time so the
nitrogen offering Intel is offering two
additional course without compromising
on overclocking capabilities now the
primary difference between the 98 a th K
and the 98 a th is that the HK variant
is an overclockable chip and you'll find
that in a lot of desktop replacement
notebooks now the 98 a th will be found
out a lot of relatively thin and light
performance notebooks like the gigabyte
air or 15 which I also got a chance to
take a look at at Computex and that one
will have a little bit or would have
some limitations as to achieving those
clock speeds but at the same time it's
not overclockable like the HK intel has
also implemented something called
thermal velocity boost on these new CPUs
and essentially it gives these new chips
an extra hundred megahertz boost
provided that thermals are under control
and again this is all depending on how
OMS decide to cool these new processors
but today my friends weren't gonna be
taking a look at the core i7 9750 H and
compared to the 8750 H now luckily I
happen to have the gigabyte Aero 15 X
featuring the H n CPU and big gigabyte
15 classic featuring the new 9 gen CPU
they both have the exact same hardware
with the same amount of memory in dual
channel as well as the RT X 2070 max Q
so pretty much an identical notebook so
you're gonna see it's sort of like an
apples to apples comparison with these
new processors so that way I can sort of
tell and give you guys you know if
you're actually gaining a certain
percentage improvement over a gen now
what the 9750 H Intel has enabled
something called partial overclocking
and that means that it can be boosted
for up to 400 megahertz
provided to the OEM allows for it
resulting in frequencies reaching 5
gigahertz now in my case I wasn't able
to see those clock speeds at least on
the arrow 15 classic obviously the
cooling hardware isn't really capable of
that but it's pretty cool I mean if OMS
the side to kind of somehow figure out
to cool those six core 12 thread CPUs
and at the same time
being able to achieve those five Baker's
speeds that would be awesome
now the primary difference between the
9750 H and the 8750 H is that the base
boosts clocks are slightly higher you
also get more cash more memory support
and of course the new things that I
talked about earlier and that's about it
so with that out of the way let's get
into the performance segment starting
with some synthetic and we'll world
tests and as you can see with Cinebench
r15 and blender there isn't a
significant difference between the two
CPUs but in Geekbench four I didn't
notice a substantial improvement with
both single core and multi core
performance and that's probably because
of those higher clock speeds
moving on to video editing performance I
took this 30 minute 4k project exported
it to the YouTube 4k preset using Adobe
Media encoder and I noticed a pretty
interesting improvement would be ninth
generation CPU as you can see the 9 gen
took about 10 minutes and 22 seconds to
render compared to 30 minutes and 40
seconds with GA generation processor and
I think that's primarily due to the
higher bass blues clocks on the United
750 H moving on to game II performance
and this is exactly what I expected I
didn't notice a substantial or a
significant improvement between the
ancient and the ninth gen in fact they
were pretty much the same with both you
know 3d mark firestrike apex legends
overwatch battlefield 1 and of course
doom now even though the GPUs in these
notebooks are technically identical
there's absolutely no way to determine
if they're operating at exactly the same
frequencies at the exact same time
frames even with that built into the
results in gaming at least the GPU
becomes the bottleneck which makes both
these CPUs perform almost identically
and my last test was to compare battery
life and as you can see there is a bit
of a difference between the 9750 H and
the 80s and oth especially in the heavy
workload scenario as you can see there
is almost a 12% reduction between the
two and I think that's most likely to be
higher clock speeds on the newer 19
processor so there you guys have it the
numbers really do speak for themselves
it's not like we're getting a
significant percentage improvement with
a 90 cent of th compared to the 80 cent
50h
unless in certain workload scenarios
those slightly higher base boosts clocks
do come
Andy but for other tasks like gaming it
doesn't really make a difference but I
want to hear your thoughts on these new
najin CPUs if you're in the market for a
gaming laptop would you actually
consider you know going for a 9
generation CPU or a discounted ancient
notebook because a lot of them I mean I
do see a lot of them floating around for
a really good deal so yeah let me know
your thoughts about that in the comments
down below I mean we're with Hardwick
UNIX thank you so much for watching

sequence channel I'll see you guys in
