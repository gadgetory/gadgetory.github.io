connects and today we saw some really
cool stuff at Razer our first video
which you can find up right here covered
razors new a raptor monitor but this
time there's something a bit different
this is actually the first time we're
covering something for consoles but
there's a PC gaming spin here too
okay so this is the turret for Xbox one
and yeah that's the mouse on keyboard
it's been designed as part of the direct
partnership with Microsoft and Razer to
see if they can bring more controller
options to the console Razer is already
officially announced it but this is the
first time we were able to go hands-on
so let's take a closer look at this
thing but first I want to mention our
sponsors for this show without the help
from Razer MSI fantex internal take CES
would just not have been possible
there's actually been a lot of teasers
from both Microsoft and Razer about this
launch because the turret is actually
the very first completely wireless
keyboard and mouse combo available for
the Xbox one it actually allows for a PC
like gaming experience which could
seriously benefit certain game types for
example controlling strategy games with
a regular console controller is
frustrating and it could also give
gamers a very real competitive advantage
in FPS games and I'm not quite sure how
Microsoft and game developers will
address that speaking of games not
everyone is supported right now but
there are about 25 of those included
with you know inclusions like pub G
fortnight Rainbow six sage minecraft and
warframe the approach here is basically
a repeat of the original RAZR turret but
with upgraded components that means it
is designed to be used on your lap while
you sit in front of a TV rather than in
front of a desk and a monitor there's a
plush cushion for your lap that has an
integrated holder for the keyboard and
mouse mat the other thing that I need to
mention is that the turret for Xbox one
is completely compatible with Razer
chroma and in some games it has full
ambient light integration for example in
vermintide 2 and X Morphin defense the
keyboard and mouse can change the color
based on the events that are happening
on-screen so that includes you know
health status and whatnot what's really
interesting is that both the keyboard
and the mouse can be controlled here
this single 2.4 gigahertz wireless
receiver and there is a compartment
within the mouse to stash that receiver
which is pretty convenient I should also
mention that viola was playing around
with the setup the mouse was actually
really magnetic to the trackpad and
there are some magnets holding the mouse
from falling completely from the surface
so it is a good and a bad thing but
again this is all something to be tested
along in long-term so definitely stay
tuned for our review there's something
else we needed to mention and that's
pricing because this thing costs two
hundred and fifty dollars us
yikes the turret isn't cheap for sure
but it will be really interesting to see
how a keyboard and mouse setup will
change a console landscape there are
plenty of games that will benefit from
it but we can also see this being
considered a cheat in some online games
like kanji since aiming with a mouse is
so much easier than with a controller so
there you guys have it what do you think
of the turret is it something that you
guys would add on to your Xbox one setup
there's gaming with a keyboard and mouse
combo on a couch even appeal to you let
us know in the comments down below and
stay tuned for more coverage from CES
2019 I mean bar with Hardwick connects
signing off and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
