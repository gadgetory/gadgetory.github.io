canucks welcome to another behind the
scenes this is a very special episode
because this is something that we've
been actually contemplating and putting
sort of in the shelf in my closet
literally for five months and the five
months time is a very long time for us
not to share something that is inside
this box I'm super excited to share with
this this is our a word from YouTube the
silver gold silver button silver button
the silver but not gold we haven't
gotten the gold yet now behind the
camera is Eber hey guys super here
behind the camera and we're very excited
to share this moment with you because
the reason why I've been contemplating
of actually not opening this because I
wanted to do something that is live on
camera and now since we started to doing
this behind the scenes series which you
guys can check out in the description
where we go behind the scenes of horror
Canucks and just explore the different
techniques filming things and just tell
you our story of how things are handled
on our and fun fact you have to actually
request the play button from YouTube so
there's a code that is been giving out
and you have to go in and actually say
yes I would like to receive the award
and you have to give them your address
and all that jazz I didn't know that so
what I expecting I was just waiting for
it to be at my house and I was following
up internally guys has anybody seen the
silver play button yet because back in
April actually when did we reach 100,000
subscribers we reached it sometime while
ago so I apologies for this delay but
like I said I was hoping for for YouTube
to send this out to you but you have to
manually request it and you have to let
them know where to ship it so guys this
is the silver play button okay I think
they're supposed to be some type of
message let me just check if I have this
oriented correctly i don't think i have
it oriented correctly but this is the
back
hmm okay so let's do this let's put it
on the table okay there we go this is
the writing so 100,000 subscribers the
moment of truth oh wow really nice let
me just unpack the this material here
Wow okay so look at this hi records
congratulations for surprising 100,000
subscribers I just can't believe that I
finally got it to open and just see it
live with you guys because like yeah
this is the silver button this is what
we've been waiting for I mean right now
we're over 260,000 subscribers so again
apologies for the delay but 100,000 was
a huge milestone for us and it's all
about appreciating the viewers
appreciating the the feedback and
everything and that's actually part of
the reason why we started doing this
behind the scenes series is to show you
guys how much work goes into our
productions how much just heart we're
pouring out to deliver content that you
guys want to watch but this wouldn't be
a harbor connects video without some
sexy b-roll for the silver button
100,000 subscribers so without further
ado this is how we want to end this
video
the silver play button the Ord every
YouTube channel strives to achieve the
grantee recognition beyond the already
established fantastic audience of
100,000 subscribers it's a unique piece
of wall art that will remind us and
everyone involved in this milestone of
exactly what it took to get here now for
me I used to rearrange my entire living
room so I can set up the white
background the couch was all the time on
its side when I was filming and I only
could film during the night because this
was the only way I could achieve perfect
white balance at the time it was a
learning experience for me in our entire
team after which it was time to move out
after living room and into a proper
white space that was dedicated for video
production only so now on to the award
the dark wood grain is visible on the
frame wood elegantly presented YouTube
play button that is silver coated on a
dark grey background the edges on our
award were a little rough on one of the
corners but we can forgive it's no big
deal and the glass piece had a bit of
play also but i want to see these minor
flaws as a non coincidental just because
we all started with some type of flaws
and i always tell myself to strive to do
something better and give me that
excitement to see how the gold play
button will compare to the silver and
the build quality department now I
really like the reflective aspect of the
button as regardless of the environment
it's almost be a constant reminder that
the space you work in is the space that
allowed you to achieve or to receive
this award in the first place and so to
our amazing community on YouTube from
the entire Harbor Canucks team we thank
you the viewer for clicking let play
button
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
