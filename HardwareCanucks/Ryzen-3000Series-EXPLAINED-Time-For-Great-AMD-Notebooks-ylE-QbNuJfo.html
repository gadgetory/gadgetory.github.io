Hardware Canucks and you've probably
realized by now that in our explain
series of videos we try to put new and
interesting technology into perspective
in simple and shorter videos we've
actually covered everything from Intel's
latest command center to AMD's driver
updates to a lot of you know new things
like processors and graphics technology
as well this time I wanted to tackle on
something that isn't really new but
you'll see it in the upcoming months and
that's AMD's 3000 series
Ryzen processors on mobile rather than
desktop actually the difference between
mobile and desktop may cause a bit of
confusion this year since they are
completely different animals so
hopefully this video will give me a
chance to straighten things up but first
let's take a quick look at our sponsor
the new Razer Blade 15 is a machine for
people who know exactly what they want
when you need a reliable keyboard and
one custom lighting when you need an
accurate display and once insanely fast
144 Hertz refresh rate when you need a
portable machine and want a gorgeous
thin aluminum unibody in the world's
smallest 15.6 inch gaming laptop when
you need powerful gaming hardware to
truly dominate with GeForce rtx the
Razer Blade 15 when you need the power
for anything you do and want nothing to
hold you back
check out the configuration you want
down below okay so let's get the obvious
part out of the way AMD officially
launched their 3000 series processors
back at CES this year and they targeted
the notebooks and Chromebook market now
there's not a lot to talk about the
desktop variants or the desktop
processors right now but we could still
discuss the key differences between
desktop and mobile starting at the top
the 3000 series mobile parts are based
off the Zen+ architecture and 12
nanometers manufacturing process used in
the 2000 series desktop parts likely
2700X that makes them second generation
Zen CPUs
the upcoming desktop 3000 series will
use a new 7nm manufacturing
process and the hugely updated third gen
Ryzen 2 architecture
finally while 3000 series notebooks
processors are available now don't
expect next-generation desktop CPUs to
be announced before Computex this year
so anything I talked about from this
point onwards will be based on the Zen
architecture that's currently available
on the notebook platform what AMD's
trying to do with this
series of mobile processors is cover
every possible market that includes
Chromebooks as well basically the
Ryzen 7 and 8 series will cover mid to
high level gaming and productivity
notebooks
while the you processors will hit these
slim and light markets then the risin 5n
Ryzen 3 will take on the premium to
mainstream Windows segments respectively
while the new Athlon would likely hit
the value market in laptops that costs
less than 750 dollars another thing to
take note of is that every processor
here is actually an APU with integrated
vaca graphics which is awesome
the last thing here are the a 4 and a 6
which I won't really talk about here
since they're really for entry-level
Chromebooks rather than pcs another
interesting thing that AMD brought up is
that an average consumer has a notebook
that's almost 5 years old actually
coming to think of it that seems like
Mike from our team who's been rocking
the Vails II back from 2010 and he just
recently got the chance to upgrade it to
the x1 carbon from lenovo but coming
back to my point
according to AMD there's an expectation
of upwards of 60% improvement from back
then till now which may or may not seem
like a huge bump but if you guys are
interested in us testing out those
claims definitely let us know in the
comments down below because I'm sure we
can find out where that they are z
laptop is this must be like somewhere in
his household so we'll make that happen
if you guys are interested so here are
the specs of all the AMD 3000 series
mobile processors and instead of boring
you by talking about a bunch of specs
I'll let you pause here but I also
wanted to highlight some important
points like I said before take note that
the Ryzen 7 3750H and the Ryzen 5 3550H are quad core eight 335 watt CPUs
that target gaming notebooks meanwhile
all the other processors you see here
are meant to maximize battery life and
lower Heat by operating at 15 watts ask
for graphics nothing really has changed
since the 2000 series notebook
processors other than the tall nanometer
manufacturing process allows for a bit
higher GPU clock speeds all of these
feature of Vega graphics with between 10
and 3 computer units that means
Vega 10 here has 640 computer units
which translates into a bit less
performance than the Radeon rx550 so
what does that mean for gaming
performance before a discrete GPU is
factored into things in a MIDI zone
tests they achieved better gaming
performance on the integrated graphics
than Intel's
whiskey lake core i7 85 65 you with a
UHD 620 GPU core but honestly guys this
is splitting hairs since these results
were taken at just 720p whereas almost
every notebook these days has a 1080p
display so the AMD 3700 you can provide
more performance but honestly I think
they should be a bit worried
remember Intel's new gen 11 graphics
core is on its way with ice Lake and
they should offer almost 50% more
performance with intel's GPU division
now being run by a bunch of ex AMD
employees that could cause some issues
now in our briefing with AMD they said
that they were supposed to have 33% more
design wins this year and I really hope
that becomes reality because right now
it is really and I mean really hard to
find an all aiming notebook that doesn't
fit the cheap category let's actually
take a look at the a suicide for example
so even though they have over 50
notebooks there are four with AMD
processors and of those two of those are
tough models that aren't available yet
one of the vive books is from 2016 while
the only one available to actually buy
has an older 2000 series
CPU luckily companies like HP Lenovo and
even Dell are starting to include more
aimed at offering 'z but it's been a
really slow process as a matter of fact
we actually looked at the tough FX 500
5dy during CES and you can find that
link right over here unfortunately back
then a lot of you commented that for the
specs of a Ryzen 5 3550H and an rx560
GPU it was really overpriced
not only that but the build quality was
pretty terrible and you know what I
think Asus agreed with all of us since
now it's available for about $700 and if
rumors are right
it'll be relaunched soon in a more
powerful version with an NVIDIA GPU so
that's a guys and honestly even though
the B CPUs look good on paper I feel
like I say the same thing every year
with AMD's mobile platform and what
they're offering because
being able to buy them after is just
nearly impossible which is just really
unfortunate honestly things could change
this here because what we've seen Zen to
is able to deliver great performance and
good efficiency in a relatively
affordable package I guess it's just a
matter of time for noble manufacturers
to implement them and add them as an
alternative option to what Intel's
offering so I just can't wait for that
to happen I want to know your thoughts
about this new CPU or this new 3000
series mobile CPU's from AMD would you
consider yourself upgrading to an all
and in notebook in the future because of
you know what they're offering right now
but they potentially look like they'll
be offering I loved in your thoughts
about that in the comments I'm Eber are
with Hardware Canucks thank you so much
for watching make sure to check out some
relevant content over here subscribe to

and I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
