back to another Eric Knox review we're
checking out the throne a massive and
they're really heavy full tower from
Rosewall price competitively for a full
tower at the hundred sixty dollars but
still very premium price to pay for an
in-house brand for example the latest
phantom full towers from NZXT are a lot
more feature packed and they're actually
less expensive also bring in the very
popular CM striker or the trooper and
some of the latest fractal design cases
and the price tag becomes less and less
appealing so let's see if this case
holds the throne and this insanely
saturate arena are full towers as you
can see the static sued the name with
this medieval look obviously not for
everyone but it sure has character
behind the front panel that seems a
little too weak and wobbly we find three
optical covers with built in dust
filters a reset button is awkwardly
placed at the top and we also have a
front fan LED switch at the bottom of
the panel taking the panel off we have
two front intake fans with the built-in
dust filter inside the panel which
unfortunately is not removable for
cleaning coming around to the side this
side panel has a massive mesh that
accommodates either for standard fans or
a single large one which is included
that's a bonus so site cooling certainly
is not going to be an issue the mesh
also protrudes to fit with the
aesthetics it certainly isn't clean but
serves well for cooling and also allows
better clearance for tall CPU towers
that you might have taking a closer look
at the back we have an exhaust fan 10
PCI expansion slots lots of venting
holes everywhere even some for the area
behind the motherboard tray now you guys
know I'm a huge fan of removable dust
filters and the throne keeps us happy
with an oversized filter that
conveniently removes from the side it is
a high density filter and it's
unfortunate we don't see the same filter
style in the front or the top now one of
the cool features of the throne is the
ability to open or close the top vents
that not only are practical but give the
throne a more aggressive look the
mechanism seemed robust and while closed
it will prevent against settling
and while open allow a more efficient
exhaust given the cases already so tall
placement of all the important
connections has definitely questionable
and absolutely undesirable we do have to
fan controllers with four fan supports
each six USB ports with audio jacks a
large power button and a hot swap dock
for both 3.5 and 2.5 inch drives it
certainly is refreshing to see six USB
ports and a docking station but be aware
of your space as placing a throne under
a desk just won't cut it now it is very
disappointing to see all the connections
attached to the top panel and not to the
frame and another disappointment is the
lack of any clearance for fans to be
mounted above the frame because of the
supported plastic bits there's certainly
enough height for fans so unless it's
user modified you won't be able to fit a
secondary role of fans all right let's
take a look inside
really nothing unique to note here seems
like a standard chassis with a massive
drive cage I mean why not make it
modular this is targeted for gamers and
not for servers plus say goodbye to
front airflow as that's mostly blocked
by the cage drive caddies here on metal
so not a tooless assembly unfortunately
on one hand they are sturdy but on the
other it will require a screwdriver for
installation now luckily additional fans
can be installed on the drive cage to
help channel front intake and an extra
bottom fan for improved cooling and out
of the box the throne manages to hold up
pretty good in terms of air flow with a
total of six fans included now the
throne really is a mix between excellent
and poorly designed features for example
having a ton of quality rubber grommets
is always helpful with Tula's optical
mechanism on both sides and an included
8 pin CPU extension however they did
cheap out on these extremely poor and
unreliable standoffs for your power
supply and my major complaint here is
the lack of any reasonable cable
management for a full Tower there is an
inch of room in the back but nowhere to
talk your cables because of how the
sight
sits on the case but that's not even it
there's only three camo tie notches now
who thought this was a good idea so I
would recommend to stay away if your
patience is thin Plus for full tower the
throne internals feel a little tight
with almost no room between the memory
and the top 10 so beginning with wire
management this is definitely one of the
more difficult cases to work in because
of the poor design but our GTX 590 fits
in just fine and you can see despite
some hassle the internals look very
clean flipping the case around there are
many unsecured cables but I did manage
to close the side panel just fine so to
wrap it up the throne aside from the
looks and great air flow out of the box
does not impress because it doesn't
offer any type of gaming oriented
features aside from its size the drive
cage isn't modular spacing and the top
is very limited so goodbye water cooling
and my main disappointment is a lack of
user-friendly cable management providing
just rubber grommets doesn't cut it
especially at this price point so thanks
guys for watching like this video if you
want Roseville to perhaps improve on
their next design and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
