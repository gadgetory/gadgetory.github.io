great technology selection and service
hey guys Ibrahim with her equinox and
gamers today have higher demands when it
comes to features that they should
expect on a gaming laptop options like a
nice vibrant display thin profile and
the most efficient horsepower to drive
modern games and high settings today we
have gigabyte on board with the be 35 k
version to me that tries to satisfy
those demands but for $1,500 is this
gaming notebook even worth considering
over the competition let's find out
our configuration here has an intel core
i7 quad-core processor clocked at 2.6 g
hurts that can turbo boost up to 3.6
gigahertz with 8 gigabytes of 1600
megahertz memory 128 gigabyte SSD along
with a one terabyte hard drive and a gtx
960 5m video card with four gigabytes of
vram and it's awesome to see an adequate
amount of memory on the GPU also note
that gig buy it sells an upgraded
version of the p35 that houses a quad HD
screen 16 gigabytes of ram and a gtx 980
m for almost double the price of the
regular 335 the bell quality of the
notebook is outstanding the chassis
itself is made out of aluminum that
gives it a nice robust feel although the
dark aluminum is a fingerprint magnet so
you'll have to wipe it often to maintain
a clean presentation gigabyte did go
with an understated design with minimal
visual aesthetics like the logo engraved
on the laptops lid and the two exhaust
vents at the rear to help with cooling I
wish they were consistent with the
quality of the material used to the
notebook for example the top lid is made
out of aluminum but the bezels are on
the display are plastic the screen shows
signs of flex when force is applied on
both ends so if gigabyte chosen
all-around aluminum frame for the bezels
this would not have been an issue the
15.6 inch matte display sports a
resolution of 1920 x 1080 that's IPS
meaning that viewing angles are
excellent without any contrast ships
with deep blacks although I did notice
some backlight bleed in the corners one
thing to point out are the hinges
between the display and the chassis are
so delicate opening up the display at
about 30 degrees will not hold up and
will result in the lid closing at a
faster rate the p35 weighs about 2.2
kilograms and is impressively thin at
only 20 point 9 millimeters the 15-inch
form factor should fit most laptop
backpacks that can house an average size
15 inch notebook and I didn't have any
trouble traveling around
then the LED notification lights at the
front are subtle there is a power check
button that indicates how much power is
left on the battery using the
notification likes taking a physical
tour of the i/o ports on the p35 there
is a Kensington lock Gigabit Ethernet
two USB 2.0 ports a separate headphone
microphone jacks and an SD card reader
on the left side towards the right you
will find an AC power input VGA and HDMI
outputs two USB 3.0 ports and a mini
DisplayPort 1.2 that can drive an
external 4k monitor at 60 Hertz
surprisingly there is an optical drive
included at the front that can be
swapped for expandable internal storage
at the bottom you can easily access the
rank apartment where memory capacity up
to 16 gigabytes is supported although
opening the compartment did require
using tweezers in order to access the
RAM slots so be extra careful the power
button sits in the middle of the speaker
Vril with decent loud and detailed
stereo projection with audible bass
response let's take a listen
and right below is a full-size backlit
keyboard with a whc zone highlighted
with an extra outline for easier
distinction while gaming the wrist rest
area is quite large that is a plus but
the keys have a very short travel
distance making typing quite unpleasant
also they require a bit more pressure
than expected so there's definitely a
learning curve making sure you can type
on this keyboard properly furthermore
the mouse pad is terrible and I mean it
it's unfortunate gigabyte decided to
slack off on one of the most important
parts on laptop first the tracking
surface is not slowed making any fine
cursor navigation a total pain second
the left and right clicks are built into
the bottom off the track and are really
difficult to press and the surface still
recognizes tracking so if you press left
click and your finger slides a little
the cursor will still move on the screen
as well I would highly recommend using
external mouse if you don't want to pull
your hair out we were really surprised
by the battery life with its 75.8 watt
hour battery that lasted almost four
hours in our standardized test hardware
optimization is very good coming onto
our gaming performance the gtx 960 5m
with its whopping four gigabytes of vram
had surpassed our expectations and
launching battlefield 4 on ultra at
field of view at 85 we are rocking 49
FPS on an average with acceptable
minimum at 29 GTA 5 on very high is
staying somewhere strong with 41 frames
on average and dipping to the mid-20s
for our minimums lorda fallen looks
gorgeous and we're staying about 30 FPS
or average but stable at 25 frames for
the minimum opening a metro last light
at high settings with advanced physics
on wasn't expecting much out of this
with 25 frames on average and hitting
the minimums at 16 less demanding games
like dota 2 maxed out once totally fine
with the high 70s on average and high
minimums as well lastly natural
selection 2 maxed out
one's not as smooth as I'd like hitting
just below 40 and just occasionally
dipping to the low 20s or minimums now
remember the 965 M is a mid-ranged
mobile GPU intended for medium to high
settings and it easily cheese frame
rates above 60 with a few settings toned
down for cooling the p35 could be better
getting 51 to 60 degrees Celsius for the
GPU and CPU respectively on idle while
the temperature spiked up during load at
pretty high 80 and 97 degrees Celsius
luckily the cooling system was not
outrageously loud and it's totally
tolerable thermal footage looks great
not particularly a hot spot for any of
those contact points that's a big plus
considering how hot the CPU against and
the area around the power button gets
really hard to touch overall we're
pretty happy with the be 35 k from
gigabyte the chassis is well-built it's
thin and light for its form factor 1080p
is all we need for 15 inch Windows
machine and we're super happy to see an
IPS panel for wide viewing angles the
performance is what you'd expect from a
mid-range mobile GPU and the battery
life is impressive if only gigabyte
didn't skip putting more effort into the
trackpad and keyboard this be 35 would
have been a totally solid contender for
the price range but when fundamental
elements are not perfect you cannot
expect the rest to make for its
shortfalls and that concludes our review
