connects and I have a few trips coming
up soon that are very exciting for the
channel so I decided to kind of showcase
what I carry with me in my backpack that
helps me kind of make these videos and
of course guide me through the editing
process as well so stuff that I bring
along with me for launch events and
coverage and shows like that so this is
it this is gonna be a what's in my
travel backpack this is actually my
first what's in my bag video and
everything you will see here will be
linked in the description down below so
let's get into it but first a quick
message from our sponsor give you
Hardware the power deserves with be
quiet straight power 11 power supply
with a wire free internal design
fantastic cooling with silent wings
three fan a fully modular layout with
black cables and 80 plus gold efficiency
check them out below alright so let's
address the obvious thing that I carry
with me and that's backpack so this is
the pin design everyday backpack it's
the twenty liter version they do offer a
slightly bigger thirty liter version for
bigger gear and bigger items and stuff
like that but the reason I chose this
particular backpack is simply because of
the compact size and the aesthetics but
also the million compartments that it
has the most important thing that I love
about this backpack is the mag latch
mechanism it's just the best when it
comes to accessing your gear and it's
important to me especially when I'm
traveling and if I want to showcase my
journey with you guys I want to be able
to quickly access my camera so this is
this is come in really handy they're two
zippers on each side that can actually
be opened in one way or another which is
kind of awesome and obviously when you
open that up you'll get access to the
internal panels which actually has some
pockets inside but moving on inside we
have the dividers that are customizable
so that's where I kind of house and
organize my gear so of course my laptop
charger my microphones my recorders and
of course my camera can go all-in right
over there and I do have a separate
laptop compartment at the top which can
easily accommodate a 50 inch notebook so
that's pretty nice and it's perfectly
fine for my blade 15 notebook there's
also an integrated luggage strap that
has come in super handy
when
walking through airports and whatnot
it's just perfect to have that
especially in a backpack of this size so
just overall when it comes to
versatility the everyday backpack frumpy
design has surprised me in a lot of ways
I did pick this up last year and it's
been great so far no signs of wear or
tear I'll be it this isn't a cheap
backpack and I feel like you get what
you pay for in this case and if anyone
else have any alternative suggestions
let us know in the comments down below
now let's start with obviously the
notebook of my choice which I used to
edit my videos and photos and whatnot
and that is the razor blade 15 base
model it's the one that came out last
year and it last year that I want to say
I've done a few modifications I guess a
few upgrades on this guy so first and
foremost I upgraded the RAM from 16 to
32 gigabytes and I've also replaced the
stock one terabyte hard drive with an
SSD so now I have two storage options so
this actually helps me a lot when it
comes to editing I haven't really had
the need for an external SSD because I
offload some of the footage on my
secondary SSD so it's been working out
really fast now one of the things I
missed on the razor blade 15 is the
inclusion of an SD card reader because
it's important to me as a content
creator to transfer the footage from my
camera to the computer so that I can
start editing to solve that I ended up
picking up in a USB 3.0 card reader from
Ankur this is like ten dollars so it's
fairly inexpensive and it gets a job
done I just can't lose it next up is the
mouse that complements my editing
experience so this is aji 603 light
speed Wireless from Logitech and it's
been a great mouse so for I love the
design and the body is very much similar
to the G 403 that I use with my desktop
PC now the reason why I prefer this over
the MX master and a few other options is
simply because the battery life has been
great and there is a compartment for the
USB receiver which is super awesome and
I hope brands can actually start taking
notes from this it also runs on two
double-a batteries which is awesome so I
don't have to like keep constantly
charging it or plugging it in for that
and it's been efficient so far the
wireless performance is fantastic and it
also has bluetooth support so that's a
nine-second connect it with another PC
without having to
unplug fuse be receiver now if you do
have something like the g6 or three or
just any wireless gaming mouse you
obviously need a mousepad or I guess
something that's compact so you can
travel with easily so this is the
corsair mm 300 at least that's what I
think it is but it's fairly compact and
I think this was a swag from Corsair but
yeah it's it's pretty cool it's very
comfortable
I love clock gaming mouse pads is
something that I'm super comfortable
with I don't really like the aluminum
surface isn't hard mouse pads because
it's just not my cup of tea but this has
been great it's super flexible it just
easily tosses in I can easily toss this
in my backpack okay so when traveling
you obviously need a good pair of
headphones so what did I go with well
believe it or not it's the Sennheiser
PXE 550 s now if you remember I did a
video on this a little while ago so if
interest and checking that out link will
be right over here
but this is what I've been using to you
know edit videos and listen to music
while I'm traveling and stuff like that
and it's been awesome I mean except for
some of the issues that I've had with it
the sound quality is amazing buy your
life is also really good and it's super
comfortable too so I don't have any
issues in that realm but yeah it's been
so it's been great so far I just don't
want to just want to make sure that I
don't accidentally turn this on so
that's off by the way so finally I just
want to wrap things up with some of the
things that I carry in my pocket with me
when I'm traveling so that involves my
smartphone and my SmartWatch which is
something that a lot of you guys have
been asking me about in the comments and
reaching me out on Twitter and whatnot
so the smartphone of choice is the
galaxy s 10 for now because I'm
currently testing this guy but the
SmartWatch that I'm carrying is the
diesel full guard its SmartWatch from
diesel I know it's not super popular but
it was impulse buying a couple years ago
when I was Christmas shopping and one of
the reasons why I picked up this
SmartWatch is simply because of the way
how it looks I love this stainless steel
black frame it's circular which is
perfect and it also has a genuine
leather strap and it's also running
Android wear it's been getting updates
over ton which I'm actually surprised
considering it's a diesel watch and not
something from Motorola or Google's so
that's very interesting lastly my
battery bank this is something that's
important when you
traveling this is the anchor I believe
it's a 20 thousand milliamp hour unit so
yeah that's what I use to carry or to
top-up my electronic devices so that
pretty much covers the items that I
require for editing so notebook
headphones Mouse and all that kind of
stuff so now let's move on to the gear
that I use to film all these videos so
currently I can't really show that
because it's filming this or filming me
right now but my primary choice for
shooting video is the sony a7 3
it's a full-frame mirrorless camera
great sensor and it can shoot beautiful
4k video and as well as 1080p at 120 FPS
slow motion it just looks awesome now to
pair with that I do use Sigma 18 to 35
millimeter lens this has been a
legendary lens among youtubers it's
still amazing I just threw it in a Sigma
MC LM an adapter to mount it to the sony
e-mount system because coming from my
Canon c100 that was the only option that
I had I do carry another set of lens
with me and that's the sony 28
millimeter eff 2.0 lens this is the only
full frame lens that I have in hand at
the moment but it's what I use when I'm
kind of taking the slow-motion shots
when I'm traveling and kind of
showcasing my journey with you guys so
it's been great so far but I am planning
on picking up a 16 to 35 millimeter lens
from Sony it's the f/4 just because I
think that that's a perfect lens for
vlogging with the a7 3 because 16
millimeters will give you a really good
field of view especially on full-frame
sensor that would look amazing and
that's what Dmitri uses as well speaking
of vlogging I obviously need a
microphone to go along with that so I
use two microphones when I'm traveling I
carry two of them actually so first one
is the rode video that was not supposed
to happen but it's the rode videomic pro
and this has been a great mic so far
battery life was also pretty good I
haven't had to replace it since I bought
it last year so quality has been great
this is what I primarily throw on to my
camera when I'm walking the other
microphone is what I'm actually using to
record this video so it's a shotgun
microphone synth from Sennheiser it's
the Mk II 600 this has been with me
since I mean forever if I want to call
it because I've been using this with my
C 100 and quality coming out of it is
amazing so this is what I use for
voiceovers and
on cam setups and and now that I'm using
the 873 I obviously have to use an
external recorder to go along with it
and that's why I picked up the zoom h5
external recorder it is a great preamp
and what you're hearing right now is
literally straight up coming from the MK
602 the zoom h5 recorder now when I'm
traveling I really can't carry the
microphone stand with me because it's
quite heavy and it's pretty large to
accommodate inside this backpack so I
decided to do a little bit of a a little
bit of an interesting approach so this
is my gorilla pod it's what I use when
I'm vlogging and what I did is I ended
up picking up this adaptor that can
mount my shotgun microphone so that way
I can easily sort of position this you
know by I don't know a window beside a
hotel or probably hanging off a ceiling
light or something like that I somehow
make it work I somehow managed to make
things work if I'm filming a non cam
segment in a hotel room for an event or
something like that so it's a pretty
interesting setup if you are someone
who's thinking about a DIY mic stand for
your shotgun mic there you go this is
this is one option right here so that's
pretty much it guys that's what I carry
with me in my backpack when I'm
traveling when I'm covering events and
stuff like that so hope you guys enjoyed
