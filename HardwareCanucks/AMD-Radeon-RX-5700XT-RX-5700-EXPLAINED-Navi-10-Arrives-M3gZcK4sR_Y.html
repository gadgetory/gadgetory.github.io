and I'm here in LA attending E3 and I
just finished my briefings with AMD
about a bunch of stuff including Zen to
the you know Ryzen 3000 series
processors and the upcoming navi based
graphics cards now i will be covering
Ryzen 3000 and a separate video because
we do have a lot more information
regarding the architecture and what AMD
has brought to the table with the new
offerings so definitely stay tuned for
that but right now i think the most
important announcements are the graphics
cards the RX 5700 xt and the RTX 5700
which will be available to buy later
this summer but will they be enough to
give nvidia some competition well we now
know a lot more information about these
new GPUs so let's take a closer look but
first a quick word from our sponsor
excuse me please explain is easy to
systems fully powered by a single power
supply just like me and you two bodies
powered by a single mind
just imagine the good we can do the
revolt X by fantex a high-performance
unit for multi CPU GPU and dual system
configurations with 80-plus platinum
efficiency with entirely silent fan mode
and twelve year warranty and clean cable
management explore the opportunities
with the revolt XPS you buy fan tax
links below okay so before I get into
the specs of these new GPUs I think it's
important to understand the underlying
architecture of these new GPUs and
that's Radeon DNA or RDNA and for
those of you are wondering it's based
off a brand new 7 nanometre
manufacturing process the name RDNA
actually gives a good hint at how AMD's
approaching this generation of
graphics cards so instead of being the
jack-of-all-trades which are great for
everything from deep learning algorithms
to gaming there's you know focus laser
focus on just gaming this time meanwhile
the Vega architecture will stick around
for you know high-performance computing
tasks and machine learning algorithms
basically RDNA is meant as a solution
for an entire product stack that will
include you know everything from
graphics processors to pcs or
smartphones to notebooks to consoles and
a lot more so the first thing that AMD
went about doing is optimizing power
consumption versus performance you see
valve a
did provide relatively good frame rates
it was super power-hungry and it
produced a lot of heat of course the
seven nanometer manufacturing process
helps with overall efficiency but
there's some extra special sauce added
to RDNA as well so there's reduced
latency across the entire core which
increases bandwidth for better use of
resources and pipeline optimizations
which generate pretty big performance
per clock improvements those will
eventually lead to each chip providing
better performance than Vega but at
lower power needs when all of these
items are combined things start to look
pretty impressive AMD has also designed
a new computer unit which theoretically
doubles the instruction rate since two
of those CEOs can be combined to work on
the same task in parallel within each
compute unit are 64 stream processors
that means a full Navi 10 GPU with 40
compute units will have 25 60 cores
which is much lower than the 4096 found
on the Vegas 64 so what is that result
in well from an apples-to-apples
comparison RDNA and the Navi
architecture will have a 25% improvement
over Vega when compared at the same core
layout and clock speeds meanwhile the
full Navi 10 GPU found on these new
cards will have about 14% better
performance than Vega 64 while consuming
much less power
that's actually pretty interesting since
Vega has a lot more compute units than
Navi 10 but maybe the most amazing thing
is how small the Navi 10 GPU actually is
instead of it being 495 square
millimeters it's just 251 which is
really really impressive so now let's
get on to the actual specs of these
cards and yes there will be two of them
let's start at the top with the RX 5700
XT which uses the full Navi 10 core it
has 2560 stream processors and operates
with a base frequency of 1605 megahertz
and a game clock of 1755 megahertz now
the game clock is basically what aim D
expects will be achieved while gaming
while the boost speed of 1905 megahertz
now seems to be a target that very fruit
applications will hit there's also 8
gigabytes of gddr5 a DP lluvia a 256 bit
interface that hey
14 gigabits per second of raw speed
meanwhile it has 256 texture units and
64 our Opie's and according to AMD it
has a board power of 225 watts or about
the same as an overclocked rrtx 2080
founders edition the RX 5700 uses a
cut-down Navi 10 core with a slightly
lower amount of stream processors
compared to the XT variant and lower
clonk speeds of 1465 megahertz and 1625
megahertz for the base and game
frequencies other than that it has the
same memory texture units and ROP layout
as its bigger brother personally I think
this will be a sweet spot even though
it's 180 watts of power puts it even
higher than the RTX 2070 and both of
these cards will be launching in July so
now let's take a look at the card itself
and there are a couple of things that
jumped on to me personally first of all
it is a blower style heatsink which
makes me think right away of these super
loud reference AMD cards from the last 5
years or so there's also 8 plus 6 pin
power inputs and connectors for
DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 the radio
team also made a big deal about the PCI
4.0 interface but they're likely won't
be any practical uses for that in the
foreseeable future I think it's just
simply a marketing checkbox that they
wanted to take now as for the overall
performance honestly guys don't expect
flagship frame rates here what AMD showed was a bunch of charts that tended
to raise more questions than actually
answering them so starting with this one
which compared the rx 5700 XT to the
Vega 56 and considering AMD spent most
of their time talking about Vega 64
seeing Vega 56 was a bit odd but well at
least it's Navi 10 with its 40 compute
units that can easily up form a Vega
with 56 compute units that's progress I
guess moving on AMD did show some very
straightforward performance numbers as
well now these show that the RX 5700 XT
outperforming me RTX 2070 by an average
of about 6%
at first glance that's good news but it
also points towards the Radeon lineup
slipping further behind Nvidia since
they're not even close to competing
against the RTX 2080 not to mention the
2080 Ti
not only that but we can't
again that the RX 5700 XT has a board
power of 225 watts whereas the reference
RTX 2070 is about a hundred and
seventy-five watts and I guess that
makes sense because AMD is targeting a
larger market with the rx 5700 XT and
the 5700 and if you think about it most
people aren't really particularly
interested in the higher-end GPUs like
the RTX 20 80 and the 2080 TI but
rather you know they'd lean towards the
RTX 2060 and the 2070 and most likely
the GTX 1660 TI as well personally I'd
love to see more competition in that
area compared to some of the extreme
ends that's just my take now the RX 5700
could be the new budget King if these
results are anything to go by as you can
see they're supposed to be the RTX 2060
in literally every test and even though
it consumes more power I'm getting more
and more excited about what it can offer
but what do you guys think do you think
this card is for you now what about ray
tracing honestly that's a question less
and less people are asking and AMD is
taking a pragmatic approach to it right
now their implementation is simple
shader based ray tracing without actual
hardware acceleration but as you
probably heard in yesterday's Microsoft
presentation the next generation project
scarlet console will include a Navi GPU
and hardware based real time ray tracing
acceleration when it launches in 2020
that means it will use the next
generation RDNA and Navi architecture
that will not only include hardware
acceleration but will also leverage
cloud-based resources to optimize ray
tracing performance speaking of those
next generation of RDNA you can
expect to see RDNA to launch
alongside next-generation consoles in
2020 and it'll use a refined seven
nanometer process there's no word on
what that will mean for the PC market
but I wouldn't be surprised to see if it
makes an appearance in 2021 or very late
2020 remember guys that's more than a
year from now so anything could change
by then so I guess it's time to wrap
this up and guys what amy has shown
isn't super exciting but these new cards
do look like they will hit very
important markets you see the RTX 2060
and the RTX 2070 don't
have any competition right now so you
know any alternatives will be a
welcoming addition but let's get this
off the table right away at this point
AMD has no plans to launch a GPU that
will compete against the best of what
Nvidia is to offer you see they're
focused with RDNA RDNA 2 and Navi
is to offer you know console and
smartphone manufacturers and efficient
GPU architecture that will fit their
needs so they'll take that design and
scale it upwards to create you know
entry-level to mid tier graphics cards
for the PC market
so while aim D claims that their focus
is on PC gamers Navi's DNA is obviously
rooted in the console space and I don't
think that's a bad thing either so
overall I think there's a lot to look
forward to when these new GPUs launch
sometime next month so definitely stay
tuned for the reviews but in the
meantime let us know your thoughts about
the rx 5700 XT the 5700 Navi man it
looks like every year or as generations
go by the naming scheme just gets even
more complicated so yeah let me know
what you guys think I mean we're with
horican axe thank you so much for
watching make sure to check out some
relevant content here subscribe to our
boot sequence Channel I'm signing off
and I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
