satisfying it's actually it will relieve
all the stress in the world tapping away
the quality mechanical switch and now my
friends a magic trick nice
alright good people so before we get
them to really cool keyboard content at
Computex I would like to thank fantex
and SteelSeries for making our visit
possum so our desire to explore really
cool keyboard contact at Computex really
started with still series and their
introduction of a new switch called omni
point they're using the whole effect
technology in which you can customize
the actuation point from point four
millimeters to three point six and that
is a cool concept but it is not a new
concept because the Hall effect switch
is been out I think for like thirty
years or so so let's start with Wooting
keyboards the winning one was my first
analog keyboard and you could customize
the actuation point as well just like
with Omni point switches and now Wooting
is releasing a new lacquer switch so it
is using the same Hall effect technology
as SteelSeries does so there's a magnet
at the bottom there's magnet in the
actual switch and they're measuring the
signal between the two magnets to
calculate or calibrate the actuation
point so the licker switches will be
linear of course that is needed when you
have the customization of the actuation
point but one cool thing is they're
introducing this dynamic reset point and
that is if you bypass the actuation
point and you still do not reset the key
anytime you go slightly up the key will
reset so you could theoretically
activate the key and then perform these
minor up-and-down movements and the key
will again activate to granting you much
faster actuation so you don't have to
bottom out and reset the key every time
all the way to the top because the
dynamic reset point will already be
active beyond that first actual
actuation point I don't know that makes
sense
they will be introducing a
special-edition keyboard from Wooting so
this is the booting - so a full-size
keyboard with a really cool graphical
and vibrant layout and obviously using
pvt key gaps quality lacquer switches
nice body and they're trying to shift
away from the gaming demographic and
move into and
enthusiast and serious crowd for
keyboards I'm really excited to have
more Hall effect switches on the market
now and by far the most visually
impressive keyboard we saw the show was
the ducky one two SF s f stands for
sixty-five percent this is the year of
the pig edition from ducky which has an
incredibly unique font it has this dark
rich red key caps really cool body
additional special key caps both for the
escape and for your right key caps both
of which have meaning and they describe
to you exactly what it means in in the
culture we have a little bit of golden
accents behind a type c connection and
the overall keyboard is just it's so
unique that you most likely will not be
able to buy it because it's not that
expensive either only like it's under
$200 and for that type of special
edition TV tiki apps like a really
fantastic build quality the space bar
also has this really unique Pig graphic
and they are using PBT keycaps with dye
sublimation technique and what's really
cool is the new one to SF keyboard is
also available in your standard edition
white or black ranges from $89 to $119
and it really removes that stigma
surrounding ducky being like a really
expensive brand because of their quality
it's not like that they deliver really
good quality keyboards but are actually
not that expensive
moving on to cooler master we finally
have a properly low profile keyboard the
sk851 it will use Imran's newbie 3kl
switches which are incredibly low
profile it will come in both linear and
tactile formats and just from our typing
experience alone the switches felt much
better than the linear low profile Reds
that they have currently on their SK850
line of keyboards and I'm really really
excited for this type of the SK851
keyboard to come out because it will be
fully wireless right now it's only full
size but it'll be both PC and Mac
compatible and hopefully the battery
life will last forever and the switches
themselves feel really awesome and so do
the key caps and then we found very low
and this is something that I'm really
excited to share because they're this
boutique slash enthusiast slash almost
budget-friendly
keyboard manufacturer and where you
customize
absolutely everything from your switch
type to your key cap color to your font
to your spacebar design to the actual
body of the keyboard TK l versus full
size everything about the whole
customization process is up to you they
use p bt key caps which are super high
quality and dye sublimation techniques
in which the actual font or whatever is
written on the actual key cap is
imprinted throughout the entire body so
if you were to have a cross-section of
the key cap you will actually see that
dye of the font or whatever else so it
will never wear off it's not laser
printed it's not a sticker
it's literally imprinted inside the key
cap and the most impressive part with
Varmilo keyboards is the price so II
broke ustym eyes himself at ek a layout
with different switch types throughout
the board so the walls area was
something else he got himself additional
key caps a wrist rest and that price was
a hundred and fifty dollars and that is
usually the price point of a your
regular traditional gaming keyboard that
is very mainstream yet here you have
something that there's literally
tailored by you in your color
customization and I'm really just wanted
to pass that information to you because
I feel like they deserve some attention
and then the wooden guy's tipped us over
into direction of Leopold as supposedly
a company that makes really high-quality
keyboards but their pricing tops at one
hundred and twenty-five dollars but from
what we saw in terms of the
customization of the different layouts
and different color options different
wrist rest it was all really really high
quality for example the PCB underneath
all the soldiering points were really
well done and this is coming from wooden
guys that make keyboards themselves they
said it's a fantastic job on the actual
soldiering points so for all silent
enthusiasts this is something really
cool they had this silent focused
keyboard that had felt underneath the
PCB and the frame the frame was aluminum
and this is to minimize any vibration
noise they had felt underneath the key
cap itself and the little rubber piece
on the body so when the key cap bottoms
out that sound is being absorbed
they had additional stabilizers on the
space bar and simply typing on the
keyboard
not only did the felt and additional
materials kind of dampen the sound but
it also gave the the keyboard a little
bit of a different feel and that is so
unique and that keyboard was a hundred
and nine dollars and then we got to try
their new switch that aims to compete
with opera and that is one most unique
switches that I've ever typed on and
that after the actuation point the
switch becomes heavy and that descent
advises you from bottoming out it was so
enjoyable to type on and so that my
friends concludes our little keyboard
exploration and Computex this is
something that I never expected to see
here and the fact that we were able to
just see these five companies in the
span of like 30 minutes just is
incredible and I'm really looking
forward to doing more exploration at
next Computex because I'm sure we'll
find some gems in the future but if you
guys have any experience with duckie or
very low or leopold let us know in the
comments because i would definitely want
to branch out into that target that
premium and niche keyboard market that
isn't so expensive as it turns out I'm a
Dimitri
thanks much for watching and check out
this other relic content as usual I'll
see you guys in next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
