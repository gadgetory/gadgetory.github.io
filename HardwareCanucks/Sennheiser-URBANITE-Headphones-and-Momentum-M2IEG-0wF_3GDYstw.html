great technology selections and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Haruka
knucks and there are two new headphones
from sennheiser that aim to cover a
wider audience base with the urbanite
headphones that come in a variety of
colors with both on here and over ear
versions so depending on what size you
prefer either smaller ones or slightly
larger over the years the urbanize don't
have a sophisticated form instead they
focus on the functionality of the
construction with really flexible
headband articulating earpieces and
adjustable size design all done with
great attention to detail with a fabric
headband cover and soft rubber pieces
underneath the cable is removable and
the court is flat so you can say goodbye
to tangled cords plus we have a inline
remote for both Android and iOS Sinise's
approach towards the sound signature
with urbanites was to create a fun
sounding headphone for you know slightly
younger audiences with emphasis on
clarity and excellent focus on lower
frequencies so the bass response is
tight and controlled and it is meant to
be dominant without leaking into the
mid-range nor sounding muddy in any way
so I really enjoyed my time listening to
the urbanites
both on the ear and over the ear and
something to note here is the over ears
are tuned slightly different providing
it slightly bigger soundstage and
appearing to be more balanced let's just
say less Basie and the urban life line
is really meant to complement the
already large selection of audio gear
son Heiser offers while following in the
footsteps of the momentum line world
multicolor options and a distinct sound
signature now speaking of the momentum
line there's a new pair on the block
these are earphones the m2 ieg becoming
a protective pouch with red threaded
accents to stay in character inside
they're nicely tucked away and take a
look at the earphones they have a dark
red metallic glossy finish on the
outside with a curved form to help to
channel the audio properly into your ear
canal there is a Sun Heiser logo
embedded cleanly on the
and overall the momentum in ears look
gorgeous something we said about the
cable as well it's tangle free and
that's really good to see the house 10
donated dryers that are very large for
this form factor of course ear pieces
are interchangeable with extra small
small medium and large sizes included
and from the sound quality perspective I
was pretty impressed at how much depth
there was with every song bass response
was almost comparable to what you can
get with actual headphones with tight
presentation although there was obvious
invasion of lower frequencies into the
mid-range but nonetheless it was a fun
headphone to listen to with pleasing
amount of clarity as the treble was
plenty high now as for color options
they are only released with this color
scheme currently but knowing Sennheiser
color variety may be a possibility
sometime down the line so make sure you
subscribe to channel to get notified

headphones come out and make sure to

coverage and we'll see you in the next
