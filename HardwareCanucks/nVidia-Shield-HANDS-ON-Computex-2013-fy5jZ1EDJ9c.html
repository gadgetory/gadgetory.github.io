about project shield so tell us about
project shield and what brought you guys
to make somebody competes against the
PSP and Game Boy and des and that kind
of stuff sure project shield is a device
built by gamers at Nvidia for gamers out
there it's a pure Android device and if
you notice lately android gaming us
becoming really big lot of premium
titles are coming to android space and
android gamers are really trying hard to
like get this console experience on
their android devices like that version
using like you know controllers like the
Mogul controllers and xbox controllers
and we felt it was time for us to build
a you know full scale open android
gaming device okay that there was a
great experience a console great
experience moretti or android shake on
so great so Tegra 4 can push out
graphics that are on par with consoles
definitely I mean not current generation
consoles but you know if you look at
some of the games like GTA vice city GTA
sonic those were all console games now
we are available on Android devices let
me talk a little bit about the hardware
here yeah this is powered by Tegra 4
obviously it's got a 5-inch screen 720p
display 296 PPI so it looks really nice
from every angle that you look at it
console gate controllers in all
joysticks dual joy sticks a d-pad
triggers and bumpers it's got a tune
bass reflex speaker system which gives
you really loud and rich I no audio let
me give you a brief demo here so let me
so it's almost like a jam box built into
this device yeah sure right and you'll
notice here on the home screen if I go
to the home screen it's just pure your
you know the Android UI that you know
and love jelly bean on it and you can
play all your android games you just log
into your google account and all your
previously purchase content games
everything automatically shows up and
you can ok and out here at the center we
have something called as a shield button
and when you press this you know it
immediately takes you into the shield UI
which displays all the games that are
current right so as far as James what
you have for Monster House with the
shield a whole bunch of titles are
coming up some of these like you burn
zombie burn aliens vs predators Bart
Steele was a Tegra 3 game but it has
controller supports you can enjoy it on
shield some of the new games are are you
golf zombie driver Zen Pinball shadowgun
dead trigger whole bunch of titles are
coming and I think at e3 we'll be
talking a little bit more about newer
titles you have a price it down for the
shield yet yeah the unknowns are pricing
for she like a couple of weeks ago and
it's priced at three forty nine dollars
and I'm gonna be available in the US and
canada to start off with you can
purchase it at nvidia com newegg
gamestop microcenter and canada
computers right thank you so one of
shields big selling points is the fact
they can stream games from the nvidia
cloud you tell us a bit about that sure
that's a really cool concept what it
does is you basically have your nvidia
you know home pc system of the geforce
GPU and you have your entire pc games
library here through steam or locally
installed and through a sheet you can
actually access these games and you know
stream those games from
your chamber was okay and enjoyed in
your living room on okay cool have to be
ever right exactly can we see that in
action games going to pc games i go in
here it immediately recognizes there's a
you know home pc on my Wi-Fi network and
i just log into it it connects to my pc
and it immediately shows locally
installed games and my Steam application
so let me launch team and you notice
when i launched it it also launches it
on a pc of there okay and it basically
now we'll start streaming that to my
shield device right so i go into library
and you'll notice that the lag between
those hardly any lag it Janice
instantaneous and my entire pc libraries
available for me right now this can only
be a Wi-Fi or will it work eventually
over the internet to right now it's why
I Wi-Fi alga you know we are working on
enabling it over the internet but we're
not ready to write talk about it here
okay let's launch Borderlands get a cool
game
so borderlands on your android mobile
gaming device very impressive yeah and
if i want to put another game I just go
back so as far as our frame rate goes
that comes out how many frames per
second whatever the pc is capable about
it's basically doing what it's rendering
it locally and then compressing it and
selling it out as a 720p video street
okay with white folder H dot 264 okay
right and I'm back to my android
interface and you know enjoy all my
local content your movies videos focus
what other things out there you think
about it like you know compared to other
gaming portable gaming devices you are
not paying like forty fifty dollars per
game the cool thing about this being
pure Android is you get all your android
games here for like a buck or two most
of the games about or two maybe five to
ten dollars at mass so it's really you
know as far as a android games go what's
the killer app for the android gaming
system Oh what's the must-have game for
the and right I've got a whole bunch of
games are already available like GTA
vice city s okay well dead trigger 2
version 2 is coming up yeah shadowgun
deadzone is a really cool multiplayer
you know you know shoot-'em-up game and
i think they have a bunch of other
titles and books and we will be talking
about it in the next few weeks okay the
shoe leather great design it looks a bit
like PSP idea vs had a kid it's very
lights it's not too heavy you don't get
tired after playing it for a few hours
the trigger buttons down here are quite
responsive and they fit your hand
naturally the two joysticks I feel a lot
like a say a ps3 s joysticks on the
quite responsive the buttons as well
they've got a nice bounce back to them
they fit your hand now actually I've got
you know bigger hands so it's an easy
fit for me the screen is very nice high
resolution it's a touch screen so you
can control it either via the two
joysticks or by touching it there and as
far as gameplay goes the shield can push
out pretty impressive frames per second
for most of these games the games don't
feel like it all I feel very natural
but the problem with the games though is
right now there's not one killer out for
the shield right there is a great
selection of ports but it's hard to name
one great game that's a shield exclusive
that would really make the device or
making one of by it's the shield comes
with Hulu Plus which is great but
unfortunately in Canada that doesn't
work yet it comes with other built-in
apps like YouTube like the usual Android
browser Chrome video looks great push
out HD quality video the color contrast
is fine so it comes with a whole
selection of ports we've got when the
hdmi microSD and the USB meaning that it
can connect into most of you that your
devices in your home theater or office
so the cover comes off like this pretty
easily so if you want you can buy
probably customize colors if you don't
like the standards metallic a color
comes off pretty easily and the device
itself feels very nice it's not flimsy
doll it's a nice well-made device
doesn't feel like it'll break and your
hand the top opens quite easily like
this they have a great display range so
it looks good from the angle
that's our shield hands on thanks for
watching and stay tuned all week for
coverage of computex
