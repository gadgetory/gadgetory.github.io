level meter so that we can test to see
if sound dampening material on PC cases
actually works there's going to be
non-scientific but before we get into
that I want to establish a sound
reference as to how loud certain things
are around the household in our everyday
life so guys I'm super excited to hear
the difference between sound dampening
material inside a PC case versus no
sound dampening at all and this is going
to be non-scientific we're just going to
have fun with it
I'm excited hope you guys are too let's
begin right after this it's time to try
something new with the key 900m
mechanical keyboard by Zalman with kale
brown switches on board macro recordings
and absolutely gorgeous RGB illumination
with the white frame even your dog will
go nuts check it out in the description
below alright so the test subject so
this one is the Silverstone klo 7 from
the coup Black Series I'm using it
because it's one of the only cases that
I have that has a completely closed off
interior and also it is silence focused
so we have this really thick noise
dampening material plied on all of the
side panels so on the rear side panel on
the front and top and the main side here
and for the fans I am basically
populating every single fan slot inside
of it so I'm keeping the two star fans
that came with the case I'm are also
populating two more 140 member fans at
the top 140 more fans for exhaust and
also there's the one fan for the CPU
core plus the GPU and so there are six
fans in total I'm using the bit quiet
silent wings three 140 Miller fans
because I love you spend they are quiet
so it's not like I'm cheating and stuff
but I will be stressing the mount thing
is having two fans for the top is
totally overkill but the whole idea is
to introduce as much air flow and noise
as possible and basically see what
happened and to just quickly prove so we
have sound dampening on the top on the
front and
both side panels so this is how the case
comes stock interesting thing about this
material is it's the thickest I've ever
come across on the PC enclosure as you
can see it's like almost as thick as my
finger usually sound dampening material
is like very thin piece that is dense
and just kind of applied on the side
panels but here Silverstone has gone a
different approach where we can actually
see those dimples and I guess they would
help to capture the sound wave so they
vibrate in between them and will not
allow the sound to escape but this
material is interesting it's almost
memory foam like and it's very porous
looking it's almost like if you were to
pour water on here it will just absorb
everything so the rear side panel is
closed and the main build is complete
all right so I got my four stations for
audio setup so one in front here
measuring from how much noise escaping
from this side panel we got one behind
the monitor over here so facing the rear
to see if there is any difference on how
much noise is escaping the case based on
the air flow from the one exhaust fan we
have one in the front over here and one
over here measuring to see if there is
any audible difference from the rear
side panel so everything is on equal
distance from each other so now the
computer is off my phone is on silent
everything else in this room is
completely off aside from my light but I
don't think that's making any noise
anyway I'm going to do three tests first
of all is to do an ambient sound so turn
off the system and measure the audible
DBA or all these four locations without
the system on I'm going to then turn on
the system and measure what the DBA is
without all the side panels and then put
on all the side panels measure that and
then take out all the sound dampening
materials like literally rip it off the
side panels and see if there's any
progression and have that DBA changes
wish me luck and one more thing I want
to mention is the sound meter level is
on a little tripod I will not be
touching it during its recording time
all right so the first sound stage is
complete but I realized I made a mistake
even until all the frames inside the
system are running at 100% fan speed
then you be quiet fans you're way too
quiet for this test the GPU is idling
and therefore I want to increase the fan
speed on the GTX 970 to 100% to get the
system is much lower this possible to
potentially give me a greater difference
between one side to another on and off
and the sound dampening material we've
moved as well all right no turning back
let's get rid of all the sounding foam
but good thing that kind of just glued
on there and it's all one thick piece so
I feel like I can just peel it off no
that's a good thing
all right first panel complete next
panel hoping that this would be easier
one with a panel
oh yes clean BAM
so the only thing not to do is put those
panels back on and redo the audio too so
just looking at the graph the ambient
variation and VBA is probably due to
different heights of the microphone on
where it was placed so that's
understandable but there is there unique
thing that I've discovered here and that
is when the panels are off and we're
recording from the rear the audio is
actually quieter when the side panels
are not on the case and I'm thinking
that is because when the side panels are
on any audio that escapes goes through
the back vs. if the side panels are open
the audio kind of disperses throughout
the case and can exit wherever it wants
and therefore the case is the loudest at
the rear when the side panels are
completely closed because there's no
other area for the audio to escape cool
so the moment of truth has come here in
the graph and you can see that without
any sound dampening foam the general
system noise levels is higher the DBA
has increased not by much by a little
bit more so on the rear and on the left
side versus right in the front but it
has risen and just to make sure that I
was accurate I tested the ambient room
sound as well and my results were
identical to what I tested a few hours
prior so that any differentiation that
you will see without any foam removes is
associated with the foam removed and not
other factors inside the room but more
interestingly when I turn a GPU fan to
100% this is really cool because on all
sides we see about a point nine DB a
increase very consistently as you can
see from rear right front and the left
and this is pretty
because as the system gets louder it
seems like the sound dampening material
helps to absorb and dampen more of that
sound versus when the system is a little
bit quieter so in our example we shaved
about 0.9 DBA with the GPU at 100% with
the foam installed
versus about 2.5 2.6 DBA with just the
same at 100% with the GPU at dial but
with all that said the DBA difference
between foam and no foam is only 0.9 DBA
so that is well within margin of error
even though I try to reduce the
variables that could impact those tests
and so I still think that you know the
foam quantifiably has proven to reduce
and dampen some the sound but we cannot
ignore the fact that mathematics tells
us that if we are you know in that
margin of error that something else
could be the factor in tinkering with
our results
so what does that mean for your future
Kings buying decisions if you are going
the silent route I always said that
you're choosing the right hardware
component is more important if you are
you're building a completely silent
system so choosing quality expands at
the lower rpm
maybe avoiding a anos so you avoid any
pump noises and stuff like that going
with a custom GPU that has a larger
heatsink so it maybe doesn't even spin
it sound like idle and low load
situations but that's not to say this
case is not important and as I proved
today that slight reduction in the DBA
levels with the south dating material
installed inside the case is something
and will help to overall reduce the
noise level of your system so guys I
hope you enjoyed this video coming along
with me to experience this project
together make sure that my ambient
acoustic levels were the same is when I
started to eliminate any potentially
other noise that was introduced into the
room so I'm happy that the ambient
acoustic levels for exactly the same is
when I started and so that leads me to
believe that the foam the sound F in
foam actually works even though it's
only a slight you know difference of 0.9
DBA at full system load with GPU and a
hole although spent at 100% the most
interesting finding for me was the DBA
readout from the rear without any side
panel sources when the side panels are
on as that shows you that there's more
audio or the rear is louder when the
side panels are on because I guess
there's nowhere for the sound to escape
aside from anything from the back and
that was cool so you know maybe
potentially will help you to place your
case accordingly based on this data
so guys I'm Dimitri with how architects
thanks so much for watching this one's a
little bit of a long one but I hope you
enjoyed and we'll see you in the next
