great technology selection and service I
know man well enjoy your voiceover guys
enjoy him talking to the camera all
right bye Eber bye
the curve on the desk is a growing trend
that is for sure and is a fantastic way
for media consumption and entertainment
but is it any good for editing and
gaming meet the LG 34 UC 98 the latest
hot curved panel from LG spanning at 34
inches 34 40 by 1440 resolution it's in
10 bit IPS panel and aim D free sync
support and a pretty extreme curve price
to 1200 bucks you got to think long and
hard before taking the plunge to see if
the curve is everything you want it to
be so here's my side of the story now I
wanted to see if I would be comfortable
replacing my dual monitor setup which
are 144 Hertz IPs and 1440p panels with
the LG 34 UC 98 that from an
organizational point alone that would
add extra order to my desk set up and
actually let me place speakers on each
side of the monitor given my limited
desk space I really love the design
language of this monitor with an
aluminum stand that has a curve of its
own a bit more aggressive than the panel
itself but still beautiful in design it
may be challenging to organize the
little things around the stand because
because of that curve but I honestly
think it's totally fine now unlike the
previous model this monitor has some
flexibility with the stand allowing
plenty of height adjustment angle
adjustment and even small horizontal
rotation to allow you to strengthen the
panel in case it slightly cricket the
rear housing of the monitor is white
which may look odd at first but I think
it has the potential to blend in more
within your space if it's not facing the
wall versus a fully dark frame and
behind the stand is a VESA mount for
walls or monitor stands the i/o includes
dual Thunderbolt 2.0 dual USB 3.0 with
quick charge support so that's awesome
in there DisplayPort to run the screen
in free sync mode dual HDMI 2.0 a
headphone jack and power in now I love
that we have Thunderbolt in here to
diversify your input options but no
Thunderbolt cables included we only get
an hdmi and displayport cables which are
also in white to keep up with the color
scheme for cable management I love the
simple and tiny clip that attaches to
the bottom of the stand and helps to
hide anything from the front view which
is awesome the built-in seven watt
stereo speakers are actually quite
decent and loud enough with detailed
projection so let's take a listen so now
let me play you this sound sample
now let's focus our attention on the
panel itself as I said earlier the curve
is a little extra curved so at arm's
length it wraps around your vision in my
experience with the earlier model I
could not stand video editing as
everything on the screen is distorted
and so all your lines are skewed and for
creative professionals not having
reference straight lines you know is
just very difficult to work with
with this model the curved lines are
amplified because of the extra curve but
I gave it extra shot as my daily driver
where the majority of time was spent on
my premiere timeline so shifting the
video preview window closer to the
middle is quite helpful to reduce the
curvature and of course going fullscreen
with sixteen by nine content means black
bars on either side but as users migrate
towards this 21 by nine format I'm
pretty confident that we'll see more
compatible content which in this native
resolution in native format is
absolutely fantastic and combine this
with the calibrated colors and pleasing
contrast to make media consumption so so
awesome
now take this trail II for example which
fills the entire screen so give you an
idea of what watching a cinema format 4k
movie would feel like and then there are
content creators like ash Taylor whose
movies in 21 by 9 deliver such a unique
cinema feel it makes me want to produce
in this aspect myself so I can enjoy
content with this monitor now I feel the
hesitation from the consumer side who
want to experience 21 by 9 content is
the availability or the lack of it sure
you find some amazing gems here and
there to watch let's fill up the screen
without black bars anywhere but even
still it feels fantastic to be among the
early adopters of this aspect ratio and
this is where we come to talk about
gaming since LG has equipped it with
free sync support via DisplayPort with
an extremely limiting variable refresh
rate range of 55 to 75 Hertz so the
refresh rate at native resolution is 60
Hertz but with free sync our refresh
rate ceiling goes to 75
Hertz so effectively overclocking the
panel for smoother gameplay the sucky
thing though is about free sync is the
minimum supported refresh rate which is
55 Hertz so when your framerate drops
below 55 you will still encounter
tearing and stutter
now gaming and the scale is pretty
awesome with the aggressive curve giving
you extra round warp but it's not easy
to drive this resolution above 55 FPS
when I was gaining with my 980 TI the
framerate was okay but I just couldn't
handle all the tearing and stutter so
freesync support is totally attractive
this however means a beefy AMD GPU is
required for gaming on this panel with
carefully selected in game settings so
your framerate
does not drop below 55 because then you
start to stutter and tearing occurs it
is definitely an upgrade over the
previous generation models but if only
the minimum supported refresh rate or
while in free sync mode was you know
below 55 Hertz somewhere around 40 so
the gamers aren't really stranded for
their fps and have to lower in game
settings in order to play at the proper
native resolution now I would still
prefer faster refresh rate for FPS games
where I don't really care about the
visual experience auto playing squad
with the sunset map was crazy satisfying
or the forest map to give you extra
field of view which actually is helpful
and this visual beauty is only made
better for a slower pace hack-and-slash
games like victor ran which is stunning
in native resolution beautiful colors
and this extra wide resolution also gave
you extra visual of the map which turned
out to be super useful and seeing beyond
my usual 16 by 9 aspect when I open Tomb
Raider which is part fighting and part
exploration this unique environment
isn't any more pretty in 21.9 but it
feels like more of a cinema experience
which to some degree improved my game
time now when we talk about backlight
bleed on previous models which was
significant here it is minimal with some
minor spots visible around the perimeter
which are honestly only visible on
camera
when your overexposing and this is what
it looks like to your naked eye which i
think is totally fine
now when we talk about this phenomenon
of 34 inch curved desktop displays
making it into our lives and the most
common term used to describe it as in
the mersive experience you know simply
because the thing sort of wraps around
your front vision I don't particularly
think that's the best way to describe
your entire experience instead I would
call it a tempting experience because
the real drawback here is the lack of
available 21.9 content which isn't the
fault of your monitor manufacturers but
it's the fault of us as consumers
catching up to that format and really us
even as content producers trying to
reach that same 21 by 9 output which
isn't to the level that we want to be
just yet I have gotten used to editing
with this monitor with shifting a few my
windows around but when it comes to
gaming sure with a powerful AMD card and
it's it can be satisfying as long as you
maintain your frame rate within the
freesync range within the 55 and 75 but
that is extremely limiting so the 34 you
see 98 is not a gaming monitor by any
means instead it has fantastic color
information and depth and to my eye very
good screen uniformity to make for an
awesome multimedia package with some
gaming tricks up its sleeve we'll make
sure to produce some 21 by 9 content
ourselves so we can also contribute to
you know the rising popularity of this
format so guys thank you so much for
watching this video I hope you enjoyed
it if you have any questions about the
panel and my experience with it moving
forward make sure to clean in comments
down below and I will make sure to
respond to you I'm Dimitri with heart
Knox
thank you so much for watching we'll see
you in the next video I'll call you up
again when you want done go okay okay
all right all right
yeah okay Huber's gone
