two-time case of the year winner fantex
the always incredible corsair and NCIX
by now everyone should be aware of Blue
Microphones many youtubers use them for
voiceovers and they have established the
reputation for reliable USB desktop mics
that also look freaking cool well blue
now is also in the headphone business
and we get a chance to try out there
mofi headphone from the looks of it they
are continuing with that retro /
industrial / slightly futuristic design
they are not skipping out on metal parts
like they tell you that and this thing
feels like a tank seriously it's like
it's been taken out of the army or
something so at the top you have this
wheel to adjust the resistance of the
joints and the form is rather
unconventional and putting them on I did
feel quite a bit of pressure settling in
regardless of how loose I said the
joints resistance the foam padding both
on the headband and the earcups is very
thick there's no chance of sound leak at
all and isolation is excellent the cool
thing with these is they have a built-in
amplifier so regardless of the source
you can pick out the detail and usually
better lower frequencies for extra body
in the sound the amp has 12 hours of
runtime of course once that's done you
can still use the headphones just just
won't power on the amp you get three
analog audio modes so passive active and
enhanced bass allowing users to tune the
sound signature on the fly based on your
music genre and there's also the micro
USB port for charging the amp and from
what we heard the Mafia delivered a
detailed high end with just ok base and
we weren't totally blown away in the
sound quality but we should be getting a
review sample to test them in our
controlled environment so make sure you
subscribe to be notified when that
review comes out we appreciate you
watching our CES coverage and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
