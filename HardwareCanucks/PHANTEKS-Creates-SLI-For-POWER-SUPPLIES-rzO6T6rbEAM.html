excited to see what they have
hey Eber you got something to say like
thanks for sponsors man check sports
there and Coolermaster oh yeah yeah
okay so we're finally here at fantex
might I say they have the best sweet
lighting even this is evening right now
beautiful bokeh which is for your
pleasure but who knew that power
supplies gets so exciting you know it's
mysterious mike was very excited here
because actually his first written
review on harbor Canucks was about power
supply so shut out but today we are
talking about the new power supplies
from fantex and collaboration with C
sonic so we're basically talking about
power supplies in SLI so when the
mysterious Mike our editor-in-chief gets
excited about power supplies we do too
so in this case fantasy is actually
coming up with a few interesting new
products that were developed by
partnering closely with C sonic to build
and design brand new generation of
adaptable and expandable those two are
the key words of power supplies so let's
start things off with the revolt Pro
which will be available at the end of q1
so on a surface it looks like any other
power supply with simple but compact
silver and black exterior and completely
modular interface but you might be
wondering why there are two power
supplies powering a single system but
only one set of connectors is actually
going towards the motherboard but that
isn't even the coolest thing about the
revolt Pro unlike every other power
supply in the market there are both
output and input connectors here so
those input connectors allow you to
piggyback a second power supply into
your system and have the revolt deliver
the electrical current from the power
supply into your system not only that
but due to a custom designed PCB and the
controller for fantex the overall power
available will be the sum of the two
power supplies so if you plug in a
revolt pro 850 watts and connect a
separate $500 supply you'll have a total
of about thirteen hundred and fifty
Watts available so think of this as SLI
for power supplies once the two power
supplies are combined the internal
controller within the pro will be able
to dynamically adjust and distribute the
load across both units based on
whichever is more efficient at the given
so in most cases the power supply will
not be evenly loaded and this approach
could actually increase the overall
efficiency since each power supply will
remain within its zone of optimum power
delivery and according to fantex
combining 280 plus gold power supplies
with this continuous load sharing could
lead to almost 80 plus platinum
efficiency levels and that's really cool
another thing this setup allows you to
do is protect the system from damage or
any unwanted shutdowns and so check this
out we unplugged one power supply and
the revolt was immediately able to
direct power requirements to the second
one and it was a completely fluid
process so what happens if your system
requires more power than the power
supplies can deliver in that case the
overcurrent protection will be triggered
and the entire setup will safely lose
power and in the past we've only seen
this type of feature from a fully
redundant power supply that could cost
thousands of dollars while not
conforming to desktop ATX specs and
fantex is also keeping this ecosystem
completely open provided you have a
revolt pro and any other power supply
that can be attached to it and all those
features that I've been talking about
will still be available really good
stuff antics and so moving on to the
other system that fantex was showing off
so this one is based on their upcoming
revolt x power supply which will offer
1200 watts of power while being rated at
80 plus titanium efficiency and unlike
the revolt pro that can use two power
supplies to power a single main system
the X comes with two set of CPU and 24
pin connectors so it can power two
systems in parallel and you can see the
fully modular interface here with two
sets of power connectors for each system
so imagine having a gaming rig and a
workstation in a single large case like
the Antho elite provided your case has
two power buttons and a reset button
that can actually be used to control the
second system so this new power supply
could be your answer to some amazing
possibilities and builds so let us know
what you think about this new approach
to power supplies I know it's really
only for high-end users with space in
their cases for two power supplies or
have two systems but they're still
really good to see power supplies
heading into a new and a unique
direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
