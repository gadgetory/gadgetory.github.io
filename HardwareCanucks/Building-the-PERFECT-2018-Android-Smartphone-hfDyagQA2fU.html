Android smartphone I like what I have
right now but there's always something
that bugs me right I mean I love my 5t
hey I love my pixel too as well man but
what would make the perfect Android
smartphone for 2018 let's discuss
prejudice creativity is fueled by the
best instruments it doesn't always come
easy and in the process you often
realize how important quality is the Rd
400 bio CC gives you quality and speed
with M de tu interface the Shiban and
flash and a PCI bracket making it
possible to focus on what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty alright so one of the most
important aspects of a smartphone is the
handling
it's a device did you carry with you
pretty much everywhere you go whether
that's transiting with you that's going
to work or school you want something
that you can rely on you want to invest
on something that can last you for a
really long time you don't want to deal
with you know just cheap buttons or
things just starting to like follow for
example I've seen smart phones that come
with fabric earpieces that sort of rip
off over time and that that gets a
little weird so you want something that
you can rely on and I think when it
comes to handling my best bet goes to
the BlackBerry key one and the LG G six
here's why the soft textured rubberized
material found the rear side of the key
one contributes a lot towards the grip
and it's far superior than glass backs
with the g6 what I really like is the
aluminum unibody frame throughout the
chassis it just feels secure in the hand
and it doesn't blend in with the screen
that much unlike the Galaxy s8 the V 30
and the note 8 it's a separate element
from the front and the back and that's
what I like plus it's so much easier to
hole in the hand now hypothetically when
you combine that with the soft touch
material phone of the BlackBerry key one
I think you'd be looking at a smart
phone that inspires a sense of
confidence when handling I'd also like
to point out that implementing a squeeze
to a wake feature on Android smartphones
would be an awesome idea because with a
pixel 2 you can just squeeze a device to
activate Google assistant and you don't
have to say ok Google 2
you can just activate the thing by
squeezing the phone and you can ask
whatever you like whether that's you
know telling you asking it to tell you a
joke or playing an audio game with it or
just just things that you would normally
do like being able to turn off your
smart lights so I think that'll be an
awesome feature but also give users the
option to remap that to activate another
program say maybe the camera or maybe
Twitter or Instagram but also just a
sensitivity and ultimately give users
the option to turn it off as well so in
terms of button placements there's
really nothing much I could add - other
than the fact that as long as the user
can comfortably reach both the power
button and the volume rockers that's
what matters
I don't need any dedicated buttons like
you know buttons to activate Bixby or
BlackBerry's messenger app with the key
one that's just pointless I think what
really matters the most is tactility we
need buttons that can just feel solid
when you're pressing them we don't need
mushy buttons I kind of feel cheap so
yeah high-quality buttons within smart
phones would be great as for the
fingerprint sensor location it's mostly
ideal to leave it at the back right
around the center area because it's
easier to activate or unlock the device
I much rather not have it sitting beside
a camera like the Galaxy Note 8 and the
si+ because it's just so uncomfortable
to activate or use your finger to unlock
the device this seems like a better
placement because I think the pixel to
be 30 and the g6 and some other
smartphones have to just do it the right
way except for Samsung now more
smartphones that we've taken look at in
2017 do come with support for wireless
charging with the exception of the pixel
2 and the blackberry key one if you're
designing a smartphone in 2018 with your
glass back here's my suggestion perhaps
add a texture on beat the back so it's
more grip here to hold a hand but also
it will come with support for wireless
charging the only problem with the clasp
backs though is that it's prone to
cracks so if you drop it you might end
up destroying the aesthetics of the
device and of course replacing it would
eventually become another investment but
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this
what what would you prefer for the rear
back of the device which you rather go
with a glass back phone or would you
like something like what's fun of the
pixel - because it's really nice to hole
in the hand but it doesn't come with
wireless charging are you willing to
take a compromise on that feature
let us know in the comments and the last
thing I want to talk about is
waterproofing Android smartphones if
you're paying 500 plus dollars for an
Android device you should expect it to
at least come with some sort of
protection
ip67 IBC stated waiting I would take
that anytime of the day so if you're
designing a smartphone in 2018
make sure to include waterproofing some
sort of waterproofing with that device
alright so the next crucial thing to
consider would be the phone size and the
screen to accommodate it so right now
most premium Android phones are like
around the 6 inch format which is
fantastic once you get used to it so
much real estate and really fantastic
for media consumption but what if you're
coming from something smaller around the
5 inches like the iPhone 7 and still
want to stick to the Android ecosystem
but be more comfortable with the format
of that slightly smaller body it would
be awesome to have more options on the
smaller side of things for the premium
Android arena so that you can be more
comfortable to use a slightly small
device over a gigantic thing in your
pocket and to complement the size
variety it'd be awesome to increase the
screen to body ratio so you can have a
smaller device with larger screen the
essential phone versus the pixel 2 is
that perfect example they are pretty
much identical in size but look at how
much more beautiful and just larger and
more immersive that display is on the
essential phone versus the pixel 2 I
think the aspect ratio should be guided
into the 18 by 9 arena because just
having a tall display allows you to
multitask better and just have more
stuff on the screen when you're in these
scrolling apps I would love to see a
bump up in the resolution to qHD unlike
your standard reference Android model
but of course it would be a bit up a lot
more battery so some software
customization that allows you to
automatically in dynamically switch
resolution to let's say 1080p when
you're on the home screen versus going
to back to qHD while you're consuming
content and this for the panel itself
AMOLED of course is fantastic everyone
wants HDR even though the HDR content is
quite limited but still it's kind of a
nice future proofing especially for 2018
and also higher refresh rate so we don't
need to go to 120 Hertz like on the
razor phone but going from like 60 Hertz
to 75 or to 100 Hertz you will
definitely feel the difference and I'm
hoping that they can meander their
techno
in a way that will not impact too much
on the battery life and will still allow
us to have a really bright super bright
display and of course choosing different
color profiles and temperature
adjustment that is accurate so in
detecting your ambient environment and
adjusting the screen tint based on that
so that you get less eye fatigue but
without really distorting your sort of
perception of the image quality and all
the colors on screen I think the one
plus 5t and the note 8 screens are like
the perfect example on what needs to
happen in 2018 in that merge of quality
display high resolution fantastic
picture quality and all that is needed
is that high refresh rate and then will
be good
next up is software because as much as
smartphone manufacturers try to push
their boundaries when it comes to
designing their smartphones hardware
wise the software is poor then the whole
user experience wouldn't be pleasing now
when it comes to my pick I always prefer
stock Android just like the one found on
the Google pixel too because it's the
best of what Android supposed to be and
it's clean there's no bloatware
applications but I'm not necessarily
forcing manufacturers to adopt stock
Android our way I mean if you could
implement features like you know taking
some features from Samsung's ecosystem
like smart selects where you have the
ability to select a certain part of an
image and extract that text and copy
that to a clipboard that would be great
and of course giving users proactivity
options within the operating system
would be fantastic another cool feature
would be giving users the option to
rearrange the home navigating buttons
plus adding custom buttons in the nav
bar because you can use them to pull
down the notifications or access certain
things customize it to your own liking
that would be you know that would add
that extra personal touch or personality
to your device furthermore I would love
to see more gesture customization so
like the three fingers swipe to take a
screenshot or drawing something on the
screen to open some apps or to start
your flashlight or to pause and play
tracks
that's all awesome I also would love to
see more system customization in terms
of choosing in different font choosing
your theme color and more Android phones
need to incorporate reading mode as an
option because I love reading on my 5-t
and that black and white warmth really
helps
to eliminate any eye fatigue and there's
only one thing that I would love to port
from iOS and that is 3d touching your
text so that you can select certain
letters and words much easier than what
you can do on Android right now because
right now the selection tool within text
is just super inconvenient and need to
have a better software option for that
on Android next up is audio because we
all love listening to music now I'm
completely aware that smartphone
manufacturers are slowly moving towards
the removal of a headphone jack but
trust me guys I mean using a USB see to
a headphone 3.5 mm an adapter just
doesn't feel practical I mean sure you
could pick up a pair of wireless
headphones and call it a day but I still
preferred wired pair of headphones
instead of going of Wireless route
so if smartphone manufacturer is a thing
about re-implementing them great we
would take people from with my headphone
jacks any time of the day over wireless
pair I'd also appreciate if smartphone
manufacturers can implement better
internal DAX within their device if they
decide to keep a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and also give us software
presets so that we can adjust the eq's
and play around with settings to fine
tune our preferred liking when it comes
to listening to music a good example of
this would be the LGV 30 that comes with
a 32 bit quad hi-fi and it comes with a
lot of software presets that you can
choose to fine tune to the way how you
listen to your music if it's an awesome
feature and I would love to see
smartphone manufacturers sort of adopt
that and implement them on their devices
next up is front facing speakers I would
love to see them on smartphones next
year and I know that it might be a
challenge to implement them in bezel
like displays for example the Galaxy
Note 8 and the LGB 30 but personally I
think the pixel to excel strikes a good
balance between thinner bezels and
front-facing speakers you've got an 18
by 9 display you've got the two speakers
now it might not be as pretty looking as
the Galaxy Note 8 and the B 30 so I'd
love to hear your thoughts on the audio
segment for this video in the comments
down below and now for the cameras I
think it's a little bit difficult to
predict on what will happen in 2018
because Google impressed everyone and
surprised everyone with the quality leap
forward in portrait mode dynamic range
and color reproduction on a 2 and a 2
excel so I would love to still stick
around with dual camera system either a
telephoto or a wide-angle zoom and
users have the option upon checkout so
you have more customization on your
taking picture style and one of the
biggest things that manufacturers need
to do is avoid cross processing we've
seen that on the g6 and the V 30 both LG
phones that really over process their
images to a point of having this
fantastic wide-angle lens and just
really capable and camera system that is
basically destroyed thanks to their
software portrait mode is huge this year
and I think is going to have even bigger
next year especially maybe portrait mode
in video that would be cool but I love
the direction in terms of eliminating
that tight zoom and going wide and
having a I process things around the
edges so that gradient in depth of field
has to get better in 2018 and it will
thinks to machine learning manual
controls are kind of a niche thing but
it would be so cool to have a pro mode
or like a full manual mode so you can
take raw pictures along exposure shots
and really impress everyone on what you
can do with a smartphone camera fast
focusing has not been an issue in photo
mode for the last like three years but
what has been an issue is smooth
autofocus in video so it's quite jerky
in terms of just jumps to your subject
but what I would love to see in video
mode is tap to focus and it smoothly
transitions to the next point mimicking
a manual focusing lens in video mode
that needs to happen processing power is
becoming so good so why aren't we seeing
more quality slow-motion options like
1080p and 120 frames or 4k at 60 on
Android that needs to happen with the
proper compression in camera so that we
get nice rich files that we can play
around with so that your smartphone
becomes your everything even for
potentially small video production stuff
the microphones have to also improve so
you can capture quality audio while
you're capturing video and lastly
stabilization I know that is a lot to
ask for but digital image stabilization
is becoming so good and combine that
with a tiny optical little gyroscope
stabilizer
for a really fantastic video experience
from your smartphone in 2018 on Android
side really looking forward to it
battery life is a tough one because the
majority of devices that have tested
the studio came with excellent battery
life this all depends our hardware and
software optimizations so if you have
good hardware and great software that's
running in the background you can expect
at least a day and a half of use out of
that device I would also appreciate
features like wireless charging
implemented on all flagship smartphones
for next year it's a great convenient
feature and I'm sure a lot of you guys
would love to take advantage of that
also quick charge protocols would be
fantastic I think that charge is
probably one of the fastest that we've
come across on an Android device with
oneplus and I'm sure smartphone
manufacturers are constantly working on
improving the battery efficiency with
devices so I'm pretty excited to see
what they come up with next year and the
last thing to cover would be the price
and value conversation so me and Ebro
discussed on what we would consider to
be the sweet spot for a smart phone that
we would consider to be like higher and
a premium and there will be like between
650 to 800 dollars and I think it's a
good compromise between potentially
losing some features but still having a
really good overall package where as
we're getting so accustomed to spending
$1,000 on a smart phone that has some
compromises one way and another and
therefore you feel cheated of not having
all these other features that you expect
at that price point I think the 1 + 5 t
hits that perfect sweet spot of price
and feature sets and more companies need
to fold that pattern in delivering all
these little things and some compromises
of course that are present but because
the price you kind of ignore the
compromises whereas if you spend $1000
you don't expect any drawbacks
whatsoever which of course is not the
case so let us know if you agree with
our picks feature wise for the perfect
Android smartphone for 2018 I'm Dimitri
