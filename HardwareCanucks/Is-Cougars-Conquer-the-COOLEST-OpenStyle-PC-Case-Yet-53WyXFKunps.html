case video without the first trying to
clean up the space so we could fit a
case in this office let's begin actually
I cannot show you what behind that light
it's covering up the cases under MDA
still a very exciting one but that right
there the orange box is what we're
talking about today so this my friends
is the cougar Conqueror conquer really
that's your name absolutely love how
this thing looks this is from the rear
this is from the right and this is from
the left and there's a that a little bit
of the orange accent that will sync up
very well what might be quiet cooler so
up until now I've been using the cooler
master six Pro I like the case but it
doesn't really suit my space I think it
needs a little bit more character also
you guys want to see something girls yep
ever since building in it I haven't even
closed the side panel and all my drives
are just sticking out so instead of
doing a normal case review video I
decided to put my whole system inside
the Cougar conquer conquer still such a
bad name I'll have to rename my PC
because that will not fly and with this
transition I'm testing a new approach
towards drag capacity and drive storage
because I have SS the only workstation
and I want to house them on the exterior
of the case so I don't want any drives
inside system that way if I want to
replace the case my drives are not
affected because they'll be sort of
placed inside it's only closure on the
exterior so this is what can make it
possible to keep all my storage on the
exterior having this tiny enclosure that
does not require any phantom power just
power everything through the PC through
the motherboards so I'm excited this
alongside the conquer let's begin wrap
this
what is that that you 31 you should put
a ring on it yes time to make it
Argentine official
there will take ring high static
pressure fans because your case is
therefore the ring cool details in
description below where's all the glass
it has no glass oh it's in pieces
what ok I am boxed it from the wrong
side there and of course you always got
a good a catalog so here are all the
parts one thing I'm surprised about is
the tempered glass side panel is
actually part of the frame it's not just
there as a visual thing as you can see
there's absolutely nothing on the right
side of the case that is being occupied
by the side panel tempered glass side
panel I like the combination of
aluminium and of course tempered glass
feels very nice in premium so we have
three fan grille three of these correct
quite ugly fans these support beams a
power supply bracket these two case feet
which are also aluminium a little bit of
accessories a drive bracket and this
little mesh thing and not sure exactly
sure what it's for so unfortunately one
of these support beams doesn't have the
end tip something that you screw on here
to hold the glass while the other second
one does as you can see there's the
little cap to screw on and this one is
missing it so not sure how that will
impact assembly but not exactly a happy
discovery for $300 case and while we're
renting a little bit so the Cougar text
on both side panels is way too large on
the side I dislike it the case is so
beautiful why do you have to ruin with
such large logos on the side the
instructions manuals it's ok it's clear
and you can see sort of see what what to
do but you know we have something like
this on $40.00 cases not $300 cases and
finally the side panels it seems like
there's some film residue I prefer a
simple film that I peel myself and not
something like this that's in leftover
from I don't know what so this whole
unboxing experience has just doesn't
align for the asking price I do like the
orange accents they're vibrant but not
like over-the-top and also black cables
from the i/o so that's appreciated for
very exposed chassis like this it is
very needed and so this open format in
general is used for showcase PC builds
and I think cougar have done
fantastic job with this transformer type
look that is not boring using high
quality aluminum panels and cutouts
throughout the entire case that fits
with the character and now I understand
where the conquerer name comes from
since the top and front plates have this
mask look that complements the angular
frame
I don't like the golden logo at the
front and I don't like how the aluminum
is not treated with anything so your
fingerprints get all over and Cougars
would have sandblasted these panels for
a better effect since the glass panels
are part of the support structure
without them installed the frame does
wobble and bend at the feet so
tightening the mounting points is
recommended I appreciate the tooless
nature of these beams though they are
large enough to screw in by hands and
can even be used to carry the case the
glass mount is sturdy using the end tips
on each beam but there are no support
pegs to hold the glass in place instead
you have to hold the glass near each
point and secure manually that leads to
a lot of fingerprints all over but the
good thing is you can still get in with
a microfiber cloth to wipe it because
there's a lot of room between the frame
and as you can see the glass is not
tinted and it's shaped accordingly to
match the design and the Cougar text on
the side is actually slightly muted to
be less visible of course because of the
fully open nature of the frame take into
account dust and other elements and your
surroundings before taking the plunge
and also be prepared to do your best
cable management job ever
and otherwise the right side panel will
expose your weak spot the IO is at the
top with black sleeve cables there are
70 CI slots without the covers included
and I wish that the orange accident
piece on the side was reviewable so I
could really remove it and repaint it
but instead it's riveted and four case
of so few parts it should be fully d
constructible which unfortunately it is
not the power supply plate and the mount
has three positions to accommodate for
larger units there are no additional
pieces at the back so KL management
should be fun and your motherboard is
mounted in about a 45 degree angle that
should incentivize creative ways to
route you tubing for water cooling and
that's exactly what this case is
designed for having triple 120mm fan
mounts at the top that is accessible
with
opening panel it's a good design but the
top panel is not 100% refined in that
it's very tight and causes the rubber
inserts on the sides to move and it's
very annoying to reinstall the front
panel is straightforward though with six
screws that are accessible through the
front cutouts and we have dual 120mm fan
mounts here so in total you can do five
fans inside the con core and for storage
you can mount doulas as these or a
single three and a half inch drive on
this bracket that is in the very awkward
position in front of your motherboard
above the power supply it looks like my
original plan of mounting my workstation
PC in there and going full air cooling
inside the Cougar concur it's not going
to exactly work because the case is so
open and because the motherboard mount
is slanted with a CPU tower it's just
not going to look good at all
and so I'm going to mount my skylight
game machine in there instead with an AO
also happy to report that with both side
panels installed the case is no longer
bendy at that those seat positions
because it's only a single point of
contact between the feet and the frame
but with the glass that kind of secures
the whole structure in place both on
this side and on the back so this case
is clearly not for air cooling and not
for a or solutions either but for water
cooling so how does it stack up up top
you can fit up to a 360 radiator with
1600 thickness supported and EK provided
us with some radius to test for
compatibility if your 360 rad is wider
than 12 centimeters then you must
install the fence first as otherwise the
front eye or PCB is on the way and
cougars certainly could have improved
this area for more friendly water
cooling for one the top support beam
basically touches the radiator and you
have no wiggle room for flexible
mounting and since the orange piece is
non removable sliding in your radiator
with fans is more difficult than it
should be with my 40 member stick rad
push pool is fine clearance wise away
from the DIMM slots but it does cover a
little bit of the motherboard and since
this being strictly targeted for like a
showcase water cooling piece cougar
should have opened up this area for
easier mounting and since I'm not doing
a custom water loop I decided to show
you guys what cable management is like
in such an unusual
Aereo with the power supply at the front
almost like an engine for your build so
the cable exit is totally exposed a
plastic shroud would have cleaned this
up but underneath the motherboard you
can route your cables just fine without
them showing up ice leave my aao tubing
with keel mod to match the rest of the
sleek cables and to highlight how tubing
pops out in such a scenario and because
the motherboard is angled you can play
around with tubing either following the
same orientation or sticking to curves
and there's also a large area beside the
motherboard for a tube reservoir I'm
pretty happy with my cable management
since there are no wearable grommets and
no plastic covers to hide your stuff and
so you can use sleeving to bunch up your
cables and at least group them by area
and where they're exiting so cougar does
include a few adhesive clips that helps
you to tidy things up but the main
hurdle is with that main cable exit in
the front and I have no idea how to hide
it unless you have a 3d printer and you
can print yourself a cover so they
clearly leave this up to your
imagination but for me it feels
incomplete as you get a good frame but
the little details to help you with
wiring are missing and finally powering
up the system it's encouraged to light
up your hardware in some way but then
this orange side piece can be seen as a
limiting factor in your color
combination so let me know what you
think of the orange and if this would be
your color of choice for an open system
build oh hey there NCIX comm is Canada's
leading a tailor for anything your mind
desires just keep it in those categories
which are plenty and get tempted by the
weekly deals visit ncx com for all those
sweet deals and so despite the very cool
looks of the conqueror you know this is
one most unique open style tempered
glass and aluminum enclosures that we
were taking a look at it's not exactly
for me even if I was water cooling I
feel like cougar kind of missed the mark
and making sure that water cooling is
user friendly in terms of radiator
installation at the top I don't know why
that orange piece is non removable it's
simply on the way and installing things
at the front is also kind of challenging
in terms of radiator and especially if
you have that SSD bracket installed in
the center then accessing everything
inside becomes a lot more challenging
then it has to be because everything is
open yet
feels very cramped in especially when
trying to mount radiator in terms of
cable management I understand that a lot
of enthusiasts who deal with open style
cases like it would want to go in and
tinker with each individual cable and
how its routed themselves so you know
that's why it's like an open plate for
you but I feel like cougar has missed
the mark and making sure that it's more
user friendly on cable side as well
because it's completely open and it
requires a lot more work that you have
to put in so not just for installation
of your water-cooling but we have to put
it in time for cable management as well
so yeah let me know what you think of
the Cougar Conqueror and would you
gravitate towards something like it if
you were to do an open showcase water
cooling system I know I haven't use this
in this video because I'm not going to
be using the Conqueror from a
workstation PC but the external drive
enclosure will have to wait for another
case so thanks so much for watching make
sure to check out all these other
relevant videos and we'll see you in the
next video I'll make sure to of course
