hard-working locks both of you this time
we're looking at the mid tower from
lenku this is the pc k9 be the different
versions are available one and silver
the other in full black interior and one
with a side panel window now line calls
side branch of lien lee who stand behind
quality aluminum cases and overall smart
and practical designs the chassis itself
is very simple but as you can see
elegant sort of a breath of fresh air
from the rest of the aggressive theme
cases and exterior of this canine is the
common brushed aluminum however as you
will see the inside is made of steel the
release date is 4 sep tember 2011 at
around one hundred thirty dollars now
the sizing of the Smith Tower seems to
suit the criteria as the case is quite
small but seems to handle everything we
throw at it except internal water
cooling the top of the canine is quite
minimal only two USB 3 ports your audio
reset and the power button and right
below that is where your hard drive
activity light is located the front
panel has three optical base with a fan
grill under which 240 millimeter fans
are installed with what seems to be
designed staple from Lian Li and land
cool easily removable dust filters and
the drive back covers can also be
removed from the front without the need
to remove the side panel and at the
bottom case another removable dust
filter is located right underneath the
power supply the rear of canine features
an exhaust fan I oh area water cooling
holes 8 ventilated PCI expansion slots
and the bottom mounted power supply
alright so this is where the fun begins
two or three optical drives have the
stool of securing mechanism below which
to hard drive cages are located and
lentils incredibly easy tools design
allow the users to be flexible with the
mounting of either of the cages check
this out we remove four thumb screws
which are able to remove the top cage
completely either to allow for better
airflow or installation of longer video
cards and by removing another three
thumb screws you're able to rotate the
entire heart
drive cage assembly if you so desire
once the hard drive is in place using
four rubber grommets and screws raising
the log buyer guarantees for a secure
mount of your hard drive now each cage
can house up to 2 2.5 inch drives and 3
3.5 inch drives as you can tell the CPU
cutout is quite small it may not have
full coverage for some motherboards but
plenty of cutouts around the motherboard
tray for rowdy new cables also another
staple of land cool is this tulus pci
card secure mechanism which works
excellent in practice and holds just as
good as with regular screws and finally
the bottom the power supply is slightly
raised and sits on two rubber strips to
prevent any noise caused by vibration
now in terms of GPU sizing capabilities
with the hard drive cage removed cards
in lengths of up to 16 point 3 inches
are compatible otherwise only 11 point 2
inches is available for the maximum size
for your GPU with the top cage installed
taking a look at the back of the case a
really convenient cable clamp allow us
to run your cables in an organized
matter without peeking into the interior
it is plastic though so it would not
hold too many stuffed cables but use it
wisely to run smaller cables through it
alright let's begin the assembly along
the accessories you receive motherboard
screws making it easier to secure your
motherboard a retention bracket for your
power supply which holds just as well as
screws however we do recommend using
screws if the case is in transport also
the canine comes with a USB 3 2 USB to
internal adapter in case you do not own
a compatible motherboard one less you
ran across while hooking up all the
connectors is the 8-pin cpu power
connector did not have enough clearance
from the back but a quick solution was
to remove two screws that hold the top
panel lift it up pass the 8-pin
connector and secure back the top panel
now there's quite an inconvenient to do
this and the whole plan tool doesn't
make the same mistake in the future ok
so fully assembled this is where the
canine really shines having a little
room to work with at the back cable
management was surprisingly easy to do
and the inside just shows the
effectiveness of the cable clamp making
the interior looking clean and tidy and
as airflow is only limited to three fans
it is crucial not to have any cable mess
interfering with the inside cooling
lamp poles PC canine be is one excellent
case if you're looking for silent and
moderate set up with an elegant side
with a great tools designed all around
making it a breeze and enjoy to work
with beside the slight hiccup during the
assembly with the 8-pin CPU connector
and its compact size doesn't sacrifice
on cable management and while having a
very limited space on the back cleans up
nicely with minimal effort and it also
offers flexibility for the hard drive
cages allowing the users to install
longer video cards and to improve on the
airflow which is quite limited to only
three fans additional fan mountings at
the top would have been perfect but as
you saw the tail panel can be easily
removed and replaced with the one that
has spent support but that is sold
separately overall the canine is very
impressive in features but for some it
may not be enough due to its limitations
thank you guys for watching and we'll
see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
