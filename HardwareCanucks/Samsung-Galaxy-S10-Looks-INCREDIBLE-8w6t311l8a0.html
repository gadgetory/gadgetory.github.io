Samsung's Galaxy S 10 we have three
models sharing a lot of features in
common including the Infiniti o display
a headphone jack yep
they still hear guys and a variety of
color options to choose from what's up
everyone
Eber here with Hydra connects and this
is my first impressions after spending
about 30 minutes with the Galaxy S 10
let's get started
alright so first and foremost there are
three models of the S 10 for 2019 the S
10 II which is the cheapest among the
three then there's the standard s 10 and
the S 10 plus and here the color options
so there's prism white prism blue prism
green prism black flamingo pink that's
right my friends and the highest spec
s10 plus can also be picked up in a
ceramic white finish which honestly felt
amazing in the hands it's a welcoming
upgrade over glass back finishes for
sure but it does come at a cost
now do keep in mind that all these color
options are gonna be scattered across
different regions so if you live in
Canada you may be unlucky because
unfortunately we won't be getting the
green the pink and I think a few other
color options too so again it's very
dependent on where you live now one of
the key features of the s10 lineup is
the introduction of the Infiniti o
display or in other words an all new
dynamic AMOLED screen so essentially
they've extended the screen size all the
way to the top and the bottom giving it
well over 90% of the screen to body
ratio as well as implementing this in
display camera sensor I like to call it
the punch hole display and honestly guys
I have mixed feelings about it
I certainly have to spend a little bit
more time to get used to it but but yeah
that's that's what it is that's what
we're dealing with with the s10 it sure
gives the phone a cool concept vibe and
you know there's no denying the fact
that Samsung loves to push their
boundaries when it comes to smart phone
design and engineering and I highly
appreciate that so the instant eye and
the s10 comes with a single front-facing
10 megapixel sensor that can now shoot
4k video which is pretty neat
while the s10 plus comes with dual
cameras so one of them being an RGB
depth sensor that allows the user to
play around with different portrait mode
thanks and other things while the other
sensor is a same 10 megapixel shooter
just like its younger siblings the
display by itself looks absolutely
stunning this is probably the best
aching yet Samsung does still take the
crown here once again when it comes to
display technology it now comes with the
HDR 10 plus certification although I'm
not exactly sure how users are gonna
take advantage of that because content
being shot in HDR is still very limited
it's not mainstream yet so I'm kind of
curious to see how that will play out in
the future and you know in terms of
color accuracy it's pretty awesome if
you're looking for you know that cool
vibrant and contrast you look s10
certainly delivers and you know it's
pretty similar to what you would
experience with other previous Samsung
devices I should also mention that
they've also increased a screen
brightness so visibility outdoors is
certainly going to be a lot better
speaking of the display I think it
probably good time to talk about the
security built inside the S 10 and the S
10 plus so basically what Samsung has
done is they've implemented a 3d
ultrasonic sensor underneath the glass
so every time when you put your finger
on it it'll scan a 3d contour of your
finger or your thumb depending on which
finger you decide to use and it'll store
that into the anoxia built inside the
device for the best possible security so
it's a cool feature and from my quick
demo or just testing or playing around
with it it seems to be working just fast
although I still have to get the unit in
my hand to test it out and give you guys
my verdict on that technology but it's
certainly gonna be a lot better than
what you would normally find with the
oneplus 60s in display fingerprint
sensor because it's still you know not
the best in the business
so that's definitely something I guess
I'm looking forward to testing out now
the s10 II you're not gonna be getting
the ultrasonic sensor because Samsung
decided to implement a physical reader
on the side of the device which is okay
because it's organ ami just a perfect
spot to kind of hold your phone and
unlock the device and I guess I don't
really have anything to complain about
that next up are the cameras and Samsung
decided to go all out this time
by implementing three sensors on the S
10 and the S 10 plus unfortunately the S
10 II only comes with two cameras but I
think that's still something so the
triple camera setup consists of an ultra
wide-angle 16 megapixel sensor with a
field of
you of roughly 123 degrees you also get
a standard wide-angle lens which is 800
megapixel shooter and a telephoto lens
for that extra reach now an awesome
thing baked inside the camera
application is the ability to seamlessly
switch between those three lenses by
simply zooming in and out within the
camera app and I things will come in
super beneficial for the average
consumer now another thing that Samsung
baked inside the camera application is
an intelligent camera assistant that
essentially gives you shot suggestions
and when it comes to framing a
particular subject and I'm really
looking forward to testing that out when
I get my hands on this device another
key feature of the s10 is wireless power
share so this essentially allows you to
charge your Qi enabled devices
wirelessly on the s10 and that can be
turned on through the quick settings app
so it doesn't have to be turned on you
know pretty much all the time and I do
have to mention that it doesn't support
fast wireless charging but rather you
know it's rated wattage is around 4.5
watts so you know if you're charging
your SmartWatch or just regular things
that don't necessarily need or require
fast charge I think this is a pretty
cool feature the last thing to discuss
here is performance and the rest of the
specs so you're getting the latest
Snapdragon 855 CPU across all three
devices ip68 water-resistant rating
expandable storage fast charge 2.0
there's also support for next gen Wi-Fi
six or eight oh two dot eleven ax
support which is pretty cool and you can
pick up the s10 a the S 10 and the S 10
plus and different memory and storage
configurations I think the absolute
specta version that you can get on the
s10 is the STM plus with 12 bytes of RAM
and a terabyte of storage so there's
that and I'm pretty sure that's gonna
cost you an arm and a leg so do keep
that in mind
now speaking of pricing I think that's
probably the most anticipated part that
you guys were looking forward to so here
it goes the s10 II is gonna start at
$749 the s10 is going to start at $8.99
and the s10 plus is going to be $1000
you can actually pre-order the phone
today and it goes on sale on March the
8th and there are different trading
programs that Samsung does offer so you
know that's one way to get your hands on
the new s10 so that's it guys that's my
first impressions with the Galaxy S 10
three new phones from Samsung for the
of 2019 I'm sure there's the note 10
that's coming later down the road we're
looking forward to testing out this
device because for one you know it's
priced differently across different
models they all share something in
common you know some I mean it's but the
SME doesn't get a lot of the features at
the s10 mes 10 plus have so it's gonna
be interesting to see how these phones
play out for the rest of the year but
stay tuned for my long-term review of
these devices and yeah that's pretty
much it let me know what you guys think
about the s10 you know is it a phone
that you would consider upgrading to in
2019 if you're coming from I don't know
an essayed or even an s9 well tune your
thoughts in the comments also I do want
mention that now might be a good time to
pick up the s9 because it's on sale for
around $500 and actually leave links to
those phones in the description down
below if you want to pick it up for a
really good deal so there's that yeah
that's pretty much it
