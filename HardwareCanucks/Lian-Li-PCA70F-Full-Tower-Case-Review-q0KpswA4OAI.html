out within the Shasta's market with its
aluminum construction and one of the
best Tula's designs that we have seen
this PCA 70f is slightly outdated being
released in 2009 so let's see if it
still stacks up to our expectations this
full tower is priced around at $300 mark
so while provides many of the same
features as cases around the similar
price tag it also lags in areas that are
becoming more and more important for an
enthusiast builder this then lead F
initely resembles any other Linley case
with its brushed aluminum which you can
only appreciate in your own site this
case is therefore extremely light
however don't be fooled it is also very
tough starting at the top there is the
power and reset button audio jacks four
USB 2.0 firewire and eSATA port at the
top right there's also where your hard
drive activity light is located the
front has five five in the quarter inch
drive bays with a 3.5 inch adapter at
the bottom with 240 millimeter fans
under the cover both with removable dust
filters
looking at the back as this is a foot
our power supply can be mounted either
at the top or the bottom we have our
usual IO area exhaust fans water cooling
holes and seven ventilated PCI expansion
slots the case is lifted by for
removable feet which are standard for
Lian Li and can be swapped for the
wheels instead which are sold separately
taking of the side panel it's no
surprise seeing non black interior from
Lian Li so common flashing the cables in
this setting is a little more
challenging it no longer becomes a
matter of hiding the cables but cleaning
them up instead the power supply is
elevated however there is no venting
right at the bottom but instead it's
located at the back of the case the
power supply itself is secured by this
toolless clamp and to no surprise
manages to keep it in place quite well
now let's see how Lindley manages with
the cable mess this is where this tool
is clamp comes in being secured right in
from the power supply it sort of manages
to keep the cables out of clutter and
really makes a huge difference in
keeping the inside looking organized the
toolless installation for the 3.5 inch
drives really comes in handy and is
hassle free you also have an option for
the drives to be either facing the back
or the front however for most users the
back would be a more preferable choice
in order to keep the visible cables to a
minimum you must also raise the locking
mechanism to prevent the drives from
sliding out
only two of the five in the quarter in
drive base use the tula system all you
have to do is align the optical drive
and pretty much snap it in place the 3.5
inch converter can be removed with four
thumb screws with two on each side if
it's not utilized and to keep things
uniform on the front panel just replace
the 3.5 inch converter with a regular
five and a quarter inch bake cover the
hard drive cage at the top of the case
can house up to three drives and then
120-millimeter exhaust fan is installed
cool the drives unfortunately if you do
decide to install the power supply at
the top you're only left with one
exhaust fan as hard drive gauge cannot
be mounted at the bottom the case
supports micro ATX ATX and extended ATX
motherboards there are cutouts available
around the motherboard tray to route
your cables and the CPU cutout is fairly
small to current standards but keep in
mind this case is also prone to a lot of
modding in total 11 3.5 inch drives can
be installed inside this case so issues
surrounding storage should not be a
problem however there are no mounting
options for 2.5 inch drive so you will
have to get converters if you wish to
mount any source and drives inside this
case also if you want to mount the power
supply at the top you must use screws in
order to secure it in place
airflow is where this case is lagging
behind its competitors around the same
price tag because no offense can be
installed either at the top or the
bottom and none on the side panel also
with the installation of the power
supply at the top of the case it leaves
you only with one exhaust fan
moving on with the installation lien Li
provides slightly longer thumbscrews to
use for your motherboard and securing
your graphics cards or any other PCI
device will be done by this convenient
Toula system which holds up just as good
as your regular screws the cable routing
inside the case as you see requires a
bit more work and unfortunately there
are no cable tie mounting at the back of
your motherboard and you will have to
get creative if you desire a
clean-looking interior talking where the
cables inside the hard drive cage would
be a common approach towards cable
management but keep in mind the modding
options available to turn this case from
a moderate full Tower and to an
enthusiast gaming chassis the Leon Lee
PC a 70 F has its strengths in aluminum
construction that has quality written
all over it one of the best tools
designs that we have seen incorporating
everything from the power supply mount
to securing your motherboard and the
large size of the interior can house
pretty much any available hardware and
the overall exterior design gives the
user stylish aesthetics that meets the
leonie craftsmanship on the downside
airflow for case this size may become a
potential issue and no interior water
cooling options means a big drawback for
this boot our chassis and that is it for
this episode of hardware connects
