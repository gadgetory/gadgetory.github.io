brought to you by and say XCOM
technology connected hey guys so we're
here at the Zalman booth at CES 2014 and
we want to show you some pretty cool and
innovative coolers as well as some
gaming peripherals cases and a couple
other little things that we think are
pretty damn sweet so that's actually
going to take a look at some of the air
coolers right now so one of the first
things that we want to show you are the
fanless CPU coolers these are for air
cooling obviously this is the older
brother the fx100 but now we want to
introduce to you the FX 70 which is a
phallus but it does have fan options
there are fan clips on the side here and
it has six heat pipes and the fins are
actually twisted a little bit so that
actually gives you a little more
resistance so that the air can actually
pull the heat out and dissipate it very
well as well one thing to mention is
that it is passive but we don't
necessarily recommending recommend using
it with enthusiast grade CPUs just
because of the heat of dispensation but
Zalman did think of this beforehand and
included fan mounting options so if you
wanted to you can mount a high static
pressure fan now one of the cool things
that we saw last year was a rezar
now we want to talk to you guys about
the resonator 3 max duel now this is it
looks pretty unorthodox in comparison to
other duel radiator setups that we've
seen before and there's actually a
reason behind it not only because of the
branding they as Amon likes having their
circular flower brand but it's also got
a purpose in the middle of every single
fan is a dead zone so you're not gonna
get a lot of air pressure to push
through it so how did Amon go about
creating a systems that you could
actually push the hot air out and that
was limit how much of the hot air or how
much of the heat is distance ated
through the center so they did that by
having the heat pipes wrap around the
outside so that the fans can actually
pull the air out another really
innovative option is that we've seen the
majority of 240 radiators or even 120
radiators have the pipes or the coolant
tubes on either side they've decided to
mount it directly in the middle
specifically because it's closer to the
CPU that you're cooling which reduces
the tube length with actually helps out
with the dispensation of heat another
really cool thing is that with this
specific model you can replace the fins
which you haven't been able to do in the
past models so if you have higher static
pressure fans you want to use on this
specific CPU cooler you can going over
to some of the newer fans we're going to
take a look at these rates here the zm+
that actually use the shark fin so these
shark fins actually reduce turbulence
and boost air performance and air flow
so that's one of the new designs that
you've seen here today another really
cool thing is this right here it's the
dual blade system fan does that MDF 12
which basically uses a inner turbine and
outer turbine it also features a
specific well not only the fan design
but it also features a button that turns
it's from quiet mode to performance mode
now why do they have these turbines in
the center well it's actually a really
good idea or it actually has a really
distinct purpose and that purpose is to
increase static pressure but also it
gets rid of the majority of that dead
zone right in the center of the bearing
so enough about fans they also have some
pretty cool and innovative gaming
peripherals Demetri alright guys so
coming on to the peripherals Zalman as
you know has a few gaming gaming
peripherals lined up but this is their
new gaming mouse so it takes to design
this module design of being able to
adjust the width adjust height and also
the weights so this is the zem zem gm4
it incorporates the latest Avago 9800
DPI laser sensor not sure if anybody
will ever use 9800 dpi but it is there
and it is the latest of our sensor so
we're told that it has nice precision so
that's always good to have and
especially because you can always bump
down the settings anyway so in terms of
button layout we have sort of your
standards or your browser buttons back
and forth here and I actually did test
it out with my with my right hand
it works perfectly there's also this
function button as you can see right
below and it's not your conventional
button because it actually sort of has a
sliding mechanism so it goes back and
you have to hold it in order for it to
be activated so one use I could see this
being incorporated is you know if you're
playing Battlefield 4 if you want to
talk and talk function you sort of slide
this back and there you go
my load kind complain about this and I
did not a fireman team about is the
little notch that you kind of hold here
it's a little bit entertaining it's
slightly sharp and this should be
smoothed out or maybe like a circular
button there would be a little bit more
comfortable but coming over here we also
have another button which is on auto it
goes a little slightly below we have the
DPI sensitivity one two three and four
that is adjusted with the button in the
middle scroll wheel and your left and
right clicks now the right left clicks
they're using a new type of switch which
is the omron switch and it's actually I
do like the switch because it is a
little bit lighter than sort of the rest
of the gaming keep the gaming mice so if
you want to have a higher you know press
per minute this would be definitely one
of the switches that would be very
helpful there you can see there's a
weight adjustments in the center you do
have to take off the slight slight screw
and take out the weights but so let's
now take out take out this little
adjustment tool as they is it is
included with the mouse it there you go
it's just a very simple tool and now we
have to see three points of adjustment
so we can either adjust the right side
by the width as you can see there's the
little mechanism that you would unscrew
and it would widen you can adjust the
Middle's portion so if you just push
this two in it will raise the actual
body it will raise the body so if you do
have a slightly larger hands and you
want to the master have a slightly
larger form factor this is a possibility
and also on the left here which is also
adjusting the width so giving us this
very flexible design in economics
depending on how big your hands are
depending on if you're a palm style palm
type or whether your claw type grip the
salmon what is it called the GM for
miles could be a very good
option and bring up all the sort of
gaming features gaming functionalities
in this new Mouse so now let's go ahead
and check out some their audio and then
Rwanda cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
