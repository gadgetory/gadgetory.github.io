master is always fun let's see what they
have in store but first huge thanks to
our sponsors Thermaltake Corsair fantex
msi and razer for making see as possible
so this is what happens when we get swag
we got a woman's large yeah put yours on
alright check this out so this was not
expected at all
we got the high reckon axe dust filters
with printing over here on the new Q 500
l + q 500 P now if you guys recall this
is that whole modular micro ATX
enclosure that have now been modified to
support ATX motherboards I find that
whole direction really good because the
enclosure itself you know because of the
perforation on all sides that means you
can mount all the types of things
regardless of you know where the fans
are located on the the top frame or the
the front frame and now because the
power supply has been relocated because
the power supply bracket you have you
basically open up a lot of space at the
bottom so this is the power supply
bracket that will now be installed in
the front of the case it only attaches
with several screws to some of the
perforation material over here now the
thing is you could technically align the
power supply bracket with a power supply
at the bottom as well to turn it into
the you know traditional micro ATX form
factor if you want to power supply at
the bottom but the whole idea was to
just make some rooms so that you could
fit a long graphics card and then ATX
motherboard inside a micro ATX chassis
they're also trying really hard to
expand their modularity elements for the
Q you know 500 L and Q 300 series cases
with these almost like fabric pieces
that you can magnetically mount to the
front or the top they are still working
out on the ventilation areas but they're
I think really hoping they would stick
with a great color scheme and they have
a bunch of all types of patterns on dust
filters which I find really cool
especially for the lower tier model
because that way you can
is the exterior so it's all just a bland
metal box but have these cool filters
that reveal a unique pattern they're
also working on different place and
different colors so this is not wood
it's just a plastic piece that looks
like wood that you can mount on the
corners which I find really cool the
customization element with handles as
well and really going kind of like out
of the way to also make these whole
thing stackable so you can actually
install a second case on top of the
original case if you're going for that
type of thing and the i/o has now been
improved with the type C Gentoo
connection pattern all right so I found
the age 500p mesh this is by far my
favorite color this is the asrock
edition so some red accents which are
tasteful but the metallic gray is still
here
what a beautiful release let me know if
you agree once again we're drinking so
this is interesting we're at the master
suite and they have a professional
editor over here working with premier
yeah we got the new keyboard them behind
there a little beer it sounds like a fun
time at Coolermaster and then we have
the new master box and our 600 so it's
the refreshed model from the original
and 600 I like this approach it's kind
of basic very similar to the like the
350 X from fantex in terms of the layout
so a tempered glass side panel power
supply in the shroud that's kind of
built into the frame I do like the
approach for the front panel because
it's kind of like a dust filter and the
mesh at the same time so there's nothing
blocking the airflow and the internal
frame is kind of cool because there are
three families built into the same 360
sort of combination which is pretty cool
a $69 enclosure and there's the NR 400
that is a micro ATX variant basically
everything the same in terms of power
supply shroud that's built in we have a
little space in the front for power
supply shower to fit through and
the N R 400 as you can see looks pretty
compact a micro ITX variant $59 version
here so really happy to see me only and
400 and 600 get updates so that's all
that's near with cool master in terms of
Ches design the new Q 500 LMP and in an
RS 400 and 600 let us know if you'd like
us to review any of these thanks for
watching we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
