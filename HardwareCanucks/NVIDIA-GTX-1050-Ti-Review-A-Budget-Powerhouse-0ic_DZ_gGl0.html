launch of the GTX 1060 which was
designed to compete against Amy's R X
480 but soon after the more affordable
sub $200 pocket was occupied with AMD's
rx 460 &amp;amp; 470 this was actually a very
important price segment for mass-market
gamers and at the time Nvidia lacked
anything that could compete since the
GTX 950 used the previous generation
Maxwell architecture so the green
response is here with the gtx 950 and
1050 TI price to the 110 and $140
respectively in this video we will
primary focus our attention on the
custom overclocked 1050 Ti from gigabyte
the g1 gaming 4G you can find how the
less expensive gtx 1050 performs in
comparison on our website full
performance analysis is linked in the
description it's super compact with a
lot of potential
the azrog desk mini lets you populate
your own 6th or 7th gen CPUs there are
two MDOT two slots for storage and
network accessories and two SSD mounts
inside the crazy small 5 inch chassis
building a tiny PC just got super
affordable with asrock
so this price point of $140 for the TI
version slots perfectly well between the
$100 ARC's 460 and $170 RX 470 filling
in the price gap that was previously
occupied by the 750 Ti we will see no
founders edition of this card so users
can pick their flavor of a custom card
however the gigabyte card I have here
costs $30 more than the reference
pricing placing it right against the
arcs 470 which is in good news at all in
terms of upgrading the gtx 950 tia is
supposed to offer a great path for
people still using gtx 750 ti and GTX
650 TI cards meanwhile users upgrading
from the gtx 950 will see an FPS boost
especially at DX 12 but don't expect the
quantum leaps forward like previous
pascal cards remember when it launched
the gtx 950 that was about 15 percent
more than the gtx 1050 TI interestingly
the gtx 1050 TI actually costs less than
the 750 Ti did when it launched the 1050
Ti shares the same number of cuda cores
texture units are Opie's and memory bus
as the GTX 950
while having a lower T
of 75 watts with 4 gigabytes of gddr5
memory the real differentiating factor
is evident in clock speeds since
Nvidia's new GP 107 core is able to
reach higher frequencies while still
maintaining very low power consumption
numbers now some of these cards are
really focused on a plug-and-play
mentality for upgrading existing systems
since they don't require a 6-pin
auxiliary power connector II since the
motherboard slots applies all the power
however in this case our pre overclocked
g1 and other higher clocks at 10:50 T is
a 6 pin connector is required and that
grants plenty of headroom for
overclocking one thing to note is that
the cards without additional power
connector won't be able to overclock all
that much since Nvidia's GeForce boost
strives to maximize clock speeds with
the given 75 watts per gigabyte 1050 Ti
comes with two performance modes the
gaming mode clocks the base and boost
frequencies 6 percent higher than
reference clocks
while the overclocked mode boosts
frequencies about two extra percent
versus the game mode this is possible
thanks to the extra power provided by
the six been otherwise the reference
design cards are strictly limited to
factory boost clocks physically this
card shares some characteristics with
the bigger g1 GT x 1080 the plastic
construction on the shroud feels less
high-end and the orange accents give the
car some character the windforce 2x
cooling has dual 80 millimeter fans with
unique blades which are also found on
the g1 1080 this hand enhances the
airflow by 20% over traditional fans
plus their fan stop feature turns off
the fans below a certain core
temperature the use of custom components
on the PCB like efficient MOSFETs and
solid capacitors should help blue system
performance and durability of this card
in long run especially once the
overclocking mode is engaged the
backplate is clean and simple it comes
with brushed aluminum finish but I also
wanted to point out the size of this
card compared to offerings from EVGA a
2's MSI etc the g1 1050 Ti is a bit
longer at just under 9 inches but still
on the safe side of upgrading older
systems with smaller cases the i/o
consists of single dual link DVI port 3
HDMI 2.0 ports and a single DisplayPort
1.4 connector RGB has made its way into
this card with just a logo and the fan
stop sign lid customization is done
through the
stream engine utility app giving us six
different effects with brightness
control this is also where you'll select
the performance mode with a
user-friendly overclocking tab with no
hidden settings or switches plus you can
play around with voltage curves and fan
speeds which is a nice touch so let's
begin with the benchmarks the g1
framerate you see was achieved from the
overclock performance mode gaining us
between five to eight percent higher
frame rates than the reference version
and that was consistent throughout the
titles at 1080p at the high settings as
expected it performed right in between
the arcs for 60 and 470 with a
significant improvement compared to
older gtx 950 and 750ti now that was for
dx11 titles we've since expanded our
dx12 testing suite and added a bit of
Vulcan testing as well as you can see
even our overclocked gtx 750ti can keep
up with the arcs 470 this has been a
longtime concern for us because it seems
the large frame rate advantages Pascal
card enjoy so much in dx11 don't
translate into dx12 will this continuous
time goes on we'll make sure to look at
this as more games using Microsoft's new
API or released what's fascinating is
how efficient the 1050 Ti is are
performing the arcs 460 by a good margin
while consuming less power that's
important for people looking to upgrade
older systems since they won't have to
upgrade their PS use gigabyte mentions a
lot about their custom cooling being
extremely quiet so let's have a listen
honestly it was pretty much inaudible
over the noise from my case fans and
even without additional fans running I'm
not sure I would have heard it as for
temperatures the g1 gaming went
extremely cool and didn't surpass 65
degrees Celsius during our testing even
after hours of gameplay in terms of old
clocking the best I was able to achieve
was a core based clock of 1542 megahertz
and boost of 1650 six megahertz it's not
going to significantly improve frame
rates but I respect the results I'm
going to stop you for a second and talk
about the price of the gigabyte g1 gtx
1050 TI because i actually find it to be
quite expensive at this price point
$140 the gtx 750ti
has an excellent value for someone
looking to do a drop-in upgrade in their
aging gaming system but paying $30 more
for this card alone is just too high I
mean if you put it in simple math that's
22 percent more than the reference card
at which point you might as well pick up
the Arts 470 and that will run circles
around this card especially in dx12
environments the additional overclocking
Headroom on cards with the six pen might
feel appealing but value is stripped out
of the package when prices of the TI
version approach the $170 mark so the
success of the new card lies in
reference pricing otherwise this
affordable slot in solution loses focus
on what makes the 1050 TI such a good
card and for conclusion at the current
price of gigabytes higher-end 1050 TI it
appears to have a poor value the sweet
spot for the 1050 Ti hovers between the
$140 mark and $150 mark and that makes
it perfect blend for performance and
ease of use if you do want to spend that
kind of money gigabyte as asking for
this card look towards AMD since the
arts for 70s newly reduced price of $170
mix it the outright winner here
assembling your verdaguer gaming chair
just got a whole lot easier with a
simple insert mechanism of the back seat
onto the side rails so you mount the
side screws much faster a true one-man
job assembly made easy by over a year
for more in-depth analysis on dx12 and
how the gtx 1050 performs make sure to
read our full review article link down
below we also have the asus and EVGA
cards tested on the site and we might do
a 1050 TI round up video to
find the best card so if you're
interested let us know in the comments

I mean boat with Harbor connects thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
