and today we're checking out a wireless
solution for your gaming needs and I'm
going to say this would be a truly
cross-platform audio solution between
consoles PCs Macs or any other device
that outputs audio the H wireless from
SteelSeries looks very promising
especially since the main hub has a
pretty versatile input-output option so
let's see whether this $300 price tag
can be justified for that cross-platform
gamer so let's start off with the
headset it's just under 300 gram so it's
pretty lightweight but putting them on
and they have a very snug fit the
clamping force is really tight in the
beginning so wearing them for the
extended periods of time was very
uncomfortable but after three weeks the
headbands did low slump a little bit and
the memory foam padding absorbed most of
the clamping force and now I could say
this the padding is definitely one of
the best the headband could be slightly
wider but once broken in I really got
used to the snug fit the headset feels
really solid and that's something I was
expecting for the $300 joints don't
crack and the headband expands with
tight control now knowing steel series
of course we have a retractable low
profile microphone that's flexible and
the ester is quite a bit of noise but
for in-game it would be totally
acceptable not over $300 I was expecting
something of a higher quality on the
right ear Cup we have a share
pass-through port so a friend can join
in if playing in split-screen for
example but connecting an analog cable
in here to your phone you have yourself
a wired headset although you have to
disconnect it from the hub for to work
in Wired mode there's also a chat port
that allows connectivity to your xbox
360 controller right now Xbox one is not
yet supported below that is a multi
functioning button that powers on the
headset and is used to mute the
microphone in which case the mic LED
will line up in red on the same ear cup
we also have a dial that can control the
volume and use to navigate the menu on
Hub so a lot of fun
Nalini built into the h wireless and
placement of these dials and buttons is
very convenient now when it comes to
battery SteelSeries opted for a
removable battery inside the left ear
cup that holds 1,000 milliamps hours of
charge and you have two batteries so one
is always charging inside the base
station and you swap is needed I
definitely think this is a more
preferred approach over needing to
recharge the headset itself and I got a
few days worth of charge between
batteries swamps so this dual battery
configuration means you never have to
worry about overnight charging and you
will always have power removing the
cover on the right ear cup reveals a
mini USB port that is used to upgrade
the firmware on the headset so now let's
take a look at the H wireless hub and
one thing to mention the headset only
communicates to the hub so you won't be
able to wirelessly connect this directly
to your phone but the Bluetooth
connection would have made this a really
multifunctional headset the hub is
fairly compact and stylish with glossy
sides and matte top with the battery
compartment easily accessible on the
side the front has a pretty bright o LED
display with a navigation wheel and a
small back button and the rear we get
all the necessary ports with an analogue
in chat out DC for power mini USB for
audio input optical in and out I'm still
series also includes all types of power
adapters depending on your region that
is very appreciated and all of the
cables that you could possibly need to
get you started on any type of
configuration so an analog cable Xbox
chat cable that's connected directly to
controller mobile cable with a ninety
degree connector mini USB cable and a
single optical cable and setting it up
on our desk it is very low profile
complements the space very well so now
let's take a look at how to set up your
H wireless I plugged the USB into our
motherboard and using the front wheel to
select my source s PC choose the correct
input select your USB output for the
microphone and you are ready to roll the
front displays your source headphone
icon to indicate the headset is
connected the battery level of your
headset the Dolby icon whether or not
the surround sound is turned on and
finally there's the level for the
charging battery inside the station
using the front wheel you can
all the volume and navigate through the
extensive many of this receiver where
you can enable Dolby Surround choose an
equalizer preset or create your own live
mix which will lower end game volume
during chat while chat minx I will allow
you to balance game versus chat sound
you can switch between sources
on-the-fly so in this case using an
analog in and the mobile cable connected
to my phone I can switch between PC and
auxiliary inputs directly from the
headset using the volume dial so there
are plenty of customizable features that
allows the H Wireless to be a true
cross-platform solution and as for
actual audio considering this is a
wireless setup it's actually pretty
decent for gaming the bass response is
powerful enough to deliver pleasant
explosions and gunfire under a balanced
preset bass bleed is just slight but
still serious drivers are able to
deliver forward mid-range without drown
down details it's a dark sounding
signature without much Sparkle on the
high end so choosing the performance
preset will bring up the footsteps and
tiny details that otherwise would be
muted there's also a first headset where
I use the Dolby Surround hearing game is
that actually expands the soundstage
improving directionality and your
surrounding awareness with just a slight
compromise and slight compression of the
details so your mid-range is like
distant and therefore muted gaming with
Easter was enjoyable with excellent
isolation keeping the sound in allowing
you to really crank up the volume to
about 100% it was plenty loud at 100%
but I would have preferred to have a
little extra power especially when using
optical cable from the motherboard the
audio output at a hundred percent was
noticeably quieter so I did opt out for
USB instead during testing the range on
the H Wireless was pretty great too I
walked away from the office with
multiple walls across and did not lose
signal but given these would be ideal
for a console gamer who can sit on the
couch you know probably within three
meters you gain the convenience of
losing the wires and enjoying the
gameplay so the final verdict with the H
Wireless is this a cross-platform audio
solution that is extremely convenient
with appropriate inputs and outputs to
set
this when your PC Xbox Playstation Mac
or any other audio source that has
optical or analog the premium build
quality and memory foam padding are
excellent with a retractable low profile
microphone and within reach volume dial
and power button on the headset itself
the share port is thoughtful especially
for on the couch gaming with a friend
and a pretty immersive audio quality for
a wireless headset with great range I
also love the dual battery system that
lets you gain without interruption now
on the other hand the clamping force is
definitely too tight in the beginning
and even after a few weeks of breaking
them in also the microphone quality is
disappointing especially at this price
point but I can say the price may be
justified if you plan on using this for
multiple systems for gaming I do think
the H Wireless has potential within the
gaming community particularly because of
its versatility and actually very
capable on equality for your gaming
needs and we're giving you the hurrah
Canucks damn gonna award of course $300
could be spent on better wired non
gaming headphones to give you better
audio quality so it's really up to you
whether you can utilize the full
functionality of the H Wireless for your
gaming needs in which case the price can
be justified but what do you guys think
given you had such a budget would you
consider Wireless or stick to wired
headphones for gaming let us know in the
