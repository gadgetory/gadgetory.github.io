Eber saying that he's arrived and he
should be on his way after he picks a
polite it's only 5:30 a.m. but look at
how bright it is outside
huge thanks to our Computex sponsors for
sending us out here
shout out to nvidia fantex and cix and
msi recording - come on in man
coming in okay so pre Computex
preparation laptop check camera check a
little bit of a problem that laptop it's
now gonna fit inside this bag so I'm
gonna have to carry that laptop in
another bag
so I finally made it
the hotel I think it's just about time
to meet Dmitry
you vary according to coming in man
coming in all right I am no longer alone
this little buddy showed up
Ibrahim how was your trip it's good
that's very good a little bit of an
update
Demetri is playing out and c100 I'm not
sure what exactly he's doing but I hope
he doesn't break the camera
so I won't be able to use it for comedy
I'm not gonna break the camera man I
usually shoot at 16 I on my Canon c100
for most of my videos and so to me if
you wanted to test and see if 30p makes
a difference and he's testing my c100
inside a bathroom
well hello Eber I'm not that thing
inside a bathroom it's just the best
view from our hotel room here you guys
can see that for yourselves just close
this just be polite for the audience but
yeah Eva shoots at 60 I you just
interlace it so whenever I see those
artifacts when the lines are passing
through you know this is this happens
when you have some motion stuff and I'm
wondering if the 33 version or the 24
key is in give us a little better better
detail in the image and based on that
bathroom test that you just saw we
carried out that Ibrahim has been
shooting in the wrong frame rate this
entire time how long have you had the
camera for now I'm gonna let you hold it
it's yours it's going to be like a it's
gonna feel like and you can almost
likely now that you are shooting in the
proper frame rate no so we did the test
between 24 P and 60 I 60 I being the 60
interlaced which is conformed to 30 P
when you import it into a timeline and
you said that you've been importing this
68 footage and slowing it down to 50%
yes because sometimes I've had really
fast but I'm thinking
Inchon subsonics so what I do is a trick
there's a little trick that I bring it
into premiere and then I change the
speed to fifty percent to make it slower
and sometimes if I'm running out of time
like if I need to do my voiceover if I
need to just fill that works out reports
with one shot and if it's too short then
I reduce it to 50% slow it down
basically and fill the fill that's the
remaining thing but the weird thing is
that 60 I doesn't give you actually 60
frames it gives you a 30 p output but
with extra for the frames sort of
interlaced in between so it's strange
how I have never noticed any stutter but
I have been noticing like lack of detail
and some of the more you know zoom then
shots and I'm thinking this is not
what's even though there's supposed to
be like anyway 24 Peas on the horizon
are you excited to start filming with a
brand new camera yes I am because he
opened my eyes so now I'm actually gonna
be using the c100 to its full potential
and most importantly the detail the
amount of detail we were able to just
achieve by comparing 60i
and 24p
you little tripod legs for the little
camera that's recording me now
and where are we heading right now
I have a little detour that the Samsung
store and they had Legos on display how
cool is that
hye-won you guys are awesome
so they have green here big nice trees
on the sidewalks and nice green
buildings - it's only 33 degrees but
it's humid so this is a very open area
on the inside as you can see and instead
of benches there are no benches anywhere
this is a station bus station and stuff
the pattern look at this people just
hang out on the side the squares minding
their own business let's play a game
fine Eber there he is just exploring
you're symmetrical artistic creative
side look at that picture
green-green right let's see if buying
two of these is cheaper than buying one
well one of them is 49 it's actually
cheaper
we were going to walk to the sim card
shop but we just take the cabin standing
all right as you can see we are
extremely sweaty nice little park though
and it seems like the rain is coming but
we just came back from my phone and got
our SIM cards so we can call each other
right honey words I would hug you but
I'm sweaty man very very hot right now
so the funny thing is whether they did a
speed test gets very nice speeds but
look at what happens when uber does the
speed test with his Taiwanese SIM card
this is what it shows for his server
location for his speed test in Taiwan
Windsor Ontario and we have no idea why
maybe either what do you think it's just
attracted to Canada your phone I think
so I'm Canadian
weird all right even got your key let's
go check out your room yeah first thing
to check out uber as with any hotel room
is the view to me you can't go out
though man nope Oh doesn't work oh it
does work your face man no yeah now here
you don't have access to the balcony but
look at that view
Jesus we're gonna see Taipei 101
so I hope you guys enjoyed that the vlog
our second day in Taipei second video
Eber how was your first day in Taipei
did you enjoy yourself yeah I did it was
awesome we went outside walked a lot and
within what 10,000 steps today 10,000
subsidy according to the razor Naboo
watch yeah okay before we head out check
out this gorgeous sunset built by the
beautiful urban landscape that is Taipei
and the current rush hour traffic this
is happening us below us</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
