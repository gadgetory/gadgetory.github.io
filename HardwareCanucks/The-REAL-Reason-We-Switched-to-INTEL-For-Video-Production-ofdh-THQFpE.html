the last few days I have not been
editing and I have not been building
anything cool I've just been sucked into
Adobe premieres latest update with their
whole hardware acceleration so I've been
testing multiple hardware so I want to
show you guys how you can save a lot of
time using this hardware acceleration if
you are on an intimacy n-- and are an
adobe premiere user sometimes i wonder
how people imagine what editing for me
is like
damn amazing edit where in reality it's
more like this huh what music should I
use two L's later oh I think I found a
good track or maybe not all right so
this whole experimentation began with me
not necessarily experiencing the
smoothest editing experience on my
rising machine inside Adobe Premiere so
I swapped out to Intel popped in the
coffee lake I 580 600 K that is
fantastic for games but in fact Rison
was slightly faster in exporting 4k
video and significantly faster exporting
to 1080p video but then Adobe rolled out
a lovely update that allows for
additional hardware acceleration for
Intel's 6th generation plus so your
skylake cabling and calculate processors
that allows the full utilization of the
Intel graphics that's built into the
processor for encoding and decoding for
significantly faster export times and so
we wanted to dig deeper and really
explore the full power potential of this
latest update of utilizing the IGP and
your Intel CPU to really speed up render
times so let me guide you through the
entire process right after this are you
ready ok watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P managed by
Coolermaster check it out in the
description below alright so this whole
hardware acceleration begins with
Adobe's 12.1 update that enables
hardware acceleration to be actually
built into Adobe Premiere Pro and you
can see it in encoder settings and
allows you to actually select hardware
acceleration or just simply software
acceleration it basically would utilize
an otherwise idle integrated graphics on
your Intel chip 6 generation and higher
and actually use that graphics
horsepower to accelerate encoding now I
want to clarify that in my most recent
barrage of tweets praising Adobe for
this update because the rendering
improvements are so significant I refer
to this acceleration as quick sing
support where in fact we don't actually
know what's happening in the background
for this hardware acceleration so Adobe
could be using quick sync function block
to accelerate encoding and decoding
because quick sync is so efficient
because it's designed to do that one
thing so well but they could also be
using some form of OpenCL acceleration
for the Intel u HD or HD graphics so if
they respond to us regarding this
clarification about hardware
acceleration we'll make sure to let you
know in the comments below and so first
we must enable the info graphics on your
Intel processor make sure that your
Intel processor actually has Intel
graphics otherwise you will not be able
to take advantage of this additional
hardware acceleration so you'll need to
access the BIOS and enable this
integrates in side for some reason on
Asus model boards it's listed as
multi-monitor support so just make sure
that is enabled and boot back into the
system the next thing in task manager
you still will not be able to see your
Intel graphics enabled there because you
need to install the latest Intel drivers
so just navigate to your processors name
and make sure you download the Intel
graphics for Windows 10 and restart the
system and BAM now we can actually see
both GPUs and we can now go back into
Adobe and enable hardware acceleration
and by default Adobe sets appropriate
encoding settings based on the available
hardware so if you have an eye GPU
available for Adobe to use based on
those steps of actually enabling it in
the BIOS and downloading the right
drivers then you have hardware
acceleration is enabled by default
otherwise it'll revert to software only
and it's actually quite impressive while
rendering a video seeing CPU utilization
your GPU utilization and the integrated
graphics from Intel also working
together to output that video file much
faster all right so here's the first
performance graph we are rendering in
one minute forty sequence out into 4k
again so we have hardware acceleration
and blue and software acceleration in
gray now keep in mind that software
acceleration uses both open CL or CUDA
acceleration depending on the graphics
card so that gives you a bit of
reference point however the performance
improvement with hardware acceleration
while it's using the integrated graphics
is actually pretty substantial and so in
percentages were spending about 16% less
time on the MacBook Pro about 20% on the
coffee Lake system with both our X 480
and the GTX 980 about 28% on the skylake
machine and we're literally cutting down
our render times in half when that
gigabyte air of 15 X and so all those
integrals are utilized and really brings
that notebook to like desktop
performance level as a video production
monster and if you guys want to check
out that review I'll be right over here
moving on to a larger 13 minute 4k
project so the time difference here
again between hardware and software
acceleration is pretty significant about
30% time saved on my coffee like machine
36% on my skylake machine and again
we're cutting down the render times in
half with that arrow 15 X notebook and
what's interesting about these numbers
is just how close the Intel graphics
brings all this Hardware together so you
know our notebook for example it's takes
the longest on the software side one is
just using the CPU and the CUDA
acceleration on the gtx 1070 but it
really shrinks down that render time
when you enable net Intel graphics it's
pretty fantastic
but what about a notebook that does not
have a discrete GPU and it only
the CPU and it's integrated graphics
well I've tested both skylake coffee
lake and the XPS 13 and the results are
a little bit surprising so check this
out
software acceleration on all machines
was faster in outputting our one minute
file not by much but in my observations
in software encoding we are utilizing
more of the CPU and it's still using the
IGP because the OpenCL is still enabled
in the Adobe Media encoder but I noticed
that the CPU usage was higher and
potentially maybe that's why things are
exporting faster when we're using
software only method whereas the
hardware method did not use as much of
the CPU itself and obviously utilized
the full IGP you that was available for
the encoder and you may be wondering why
the coffee like machine is slightly
slower than our skylake machine so the
skaldak processor is a fork or a thread
part versus only six core six thread
part on the coffee like machine so the
additional threads I think help with
encoding when you're using you know CPU
and the IGP
only without a discrete GPU now many of
you may see these graphs and say sure
you're rendering something so much
faster but what about the quality
degradation obviously there must be some
sort of compromise right and so I used
the YouTube 4k export preset at 40
megabits per second the output files
both the sizes and the bitrate was
identical on both so there's no
difference there however when I did
screenshots from the hardware
accelerated output video versus software
accelerated output video and overlaid
them in the exact same frame in
Photoshop and shows the opacity to
difference there was no difference even
if you zoom in to like 500% that's where
you start to potentially notice slightly
more blotchiness on the hardware
acceleration versus like the smoother
stuff on the software accelerate file
but the difference once it's uploaded to
YouTube will be negligible and you
rather save the time on the export then
pixel peep something that you will not
even be able to notice when it goes out
to the world to see and so this whole
thing has been very exciting because I
was actually thinking of ditching Adobe
Premiere altogether because the
rendering difference has not been
improving for ages now but I feel like
with this added acceleration support
using you know Intel graphics it really
does bring Adobe Premiere to a
competitive level with rendering times
for you know the Vinci's resolve and
also Final Cut Pro X not exactly on
their terms and they're like
compatibility for hardware and
optimization but it is definitely
getting better and I'm going to put this
charge for the conclusion you know Rison
has been fantastic and it's a really
good value platform but with this whole
rollout of hardware acceleration using
Intel graphics it really makes sense to
switch to Intel for Adobe Premiere for
our needs because the rendering
performance is so much faster without
losing quality and I really want an 8700
K because we double the threads and so I
feel like performance will be even
better of like one to one rendering
versus my sequence to the output render
times that is what I want to see moving
forward all right so I'm gonna leave it
here let me know what you think of the
results and if you are on an Intel
platform with a compatible CPU with
infographics let me know what type of
accelerated results you get with
hardware acceleration and you know I
still love Rison but if you are
potentially thinking like a 2700 X or an
87 100k the question that's been asked
so many times for me in the last week or
so you know potentially this could not
you in the direction if you are
considering going for Premiere Pro for
video production so thanks so much for
watching I'm Dimitri make sure to check
out this other relevant content and
we'll see you in the next video this
video ran there so fast I'm excited
