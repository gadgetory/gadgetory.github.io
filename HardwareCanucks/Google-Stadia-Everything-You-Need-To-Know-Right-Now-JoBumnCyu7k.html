connects pardon me for my voice I'm
still recovering from a cold that I
caught a Computex but nonetheless three
months ago at GDC Google unveiled
project Stadium a new streaming gaming
platform that could potentially
revolutionize the way how we think of
gaming in the future
now stadia is all about giving access or
instant access to everyone who just want
to get into the whole gaming field and
experience the best of what they can
especially share their experience and of
course get together as a community and
not worry about dealing with you know
hardware requirements or whatnot it's
certainly it's a different approach to
gaming for sure now today Google
actually unveiled pricing and
availability for Cydia so here's
everything that you need to know about
stadia but first a quick word from our
sponsor the newbie quiet dark rock slim
cooler offers high physical clearance
for any memory module thanks to its slim
heatsink and the low profile 120mm
airflow optimized fan so you get great
cooling low noise easy installation and
no issues for high profile RAM check it
out below alright so let's get to what
exactly stadia is and I'm sure most of
you are aware of it but just for those
of you who are wondering it's
essentially a cloud-based platform that
allows users to stream any game at any
time on any screen wherever they are and
given how Google has entered this new
game streaming service it's supposed to
work efficiently with other Google
services like YouTube you see one of the
biggest trends these days is game
streaming a lot of people love watching
their streamers play their favorite
games on YouTube or other platforms like
twitch so it's stadium it actually gives
users the ability to stream any game
anywhere on a screen so for instance if
you're watching someone's stream
Assassin's Creed Odyssey or Metro Exodus
on YouTube Stadium will actually allow
or give you an extra option where you
can play that particular game with a
matter of seconds so you don't have to
worry about any hardware requirements
everything is based off Google's data
centers so there is no installs no
downloads of patch or whatnot you'd have
to download a 50 or 60 gigabyte folder
on your system to get this thing up and
running it's just you know simply click
a button and you're instantly in the
game in your world doing your own thing
not to mention stadia will give users
the option to stream their particular
game
play on the platform so for instance if
I want to hop into a game play and if I
want to stream my gameplay on youtube I
could do that simultaneously without
having to worry about a separate
streaming machine and the hardware
clients for that or fiddling out with
OBS or other you know services it's
genuinely really really exciting now
there are certain requirements for
stadia and that primarily revolves
around your internet connection so they
claim that you can stream up to 4k at 60
frames per second in HDR with surround
sound as long as you have a 35 megabits
per second internet connection but if
you have something in the lower 10 or 20
you can stream up to 720p at 60 frames
per second in stereo sound the other
requirement is that if you're on a PC or
notebook you just need to have chrome
installed on that and you'll be able to
hop into this whole new platform right
away if you're on Chromebook or Chrome
OS it's a same story as long as you have
the Chrome browser you're good to go and
especially for those of you who I have a
pixel 3 or pixel 3a the Google stadia
app will natively support those devices
at launch and Google will be planning on
adding or supporting other devices later
on now let's talk about the stadia
controller it comes in a few colors
including clearly white just black and
wasabi that's right my friends Google's
naming scheme is quite interesting
actually there's also a limited edition
knight blueberry and that's only
available to users who've bought the
founders Edition and I'll get to that in
a minute the controller itself is pretty
straightforward
it uses Wi-Fi to connect directly to the
game running in the data center to get
you the best experience there are
certain buttons conveniently located on
the controller for instant capture
saving and sharing your gameplay and it
also comes with a Google assistant
button as well stadium also supports
Xbox one and ps4 controllers and a
standard mouse and keyboard input as
well which is awesome I should also
mention that if you want experience
stadia in your living room say for
instance your TV you can just plug in
the chromecast ultra module to the TV
and set up stadia that way moving on to
game support and this is this is a big
one you see at launch you have access to
the newly announced voltage gate 3 Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon breakpoint the
division 2 Assassin's Creed Odyssey
Mortal Kombat 11 grid Autosport NBA 2
kay Metro Exodus doom eternal and more
Google has promised to expand the game
library moving forward and their
partnership with EA and Ubisoft could
mean that stadia could be the ultimate
game streaming platform and I can't wait
to see what they could come up with or
what they would turn out to be in the
next five years now with all that being
said we have to take a look at the
competition because the one thing that
does come to my mind is in videos
GeForce now which weirdly enough is
still in beta mode so the users would
have to access a request for access to
their beta program and while the library
is fairly vast it's mostly steam related
games and nothing more than that so this
is certainly an interesting take around
with stadia they're definitely
partnering up with a lot of these
developers around the world to bring
most or the best of the games as
possible as they can to a lot of users
all right so let's get on to pricing and
availability starting off with stadium
Pro which is a $10 per month
subscription fee and that gets you the
highest streaming quality up to 4k at 60
frames per second in HDR
wood 5.1 surround sound you can
unlimited access to free games starting
with the entire collection of destiny 2
there's also stadium founders Edition
founders Edition that actually is quite
interesting I've heard of that name
before
how does Edition oh and video dad that
certainly rings a bell it certainly does
but anyways it's $130 u.s. or $170
Canadian and think of it as a bundle or
a starter pack for users who really want
to get into this hole or get to
experience stadium at first or they want
to get their hands on as early as
possible so it comes in as a bundle and
what you're getting is a chromecast
ultra module along with a limited
edition knight blue state controller you
also get three months of stadium pro
subscription as well as an exclusive
stadium which means that as long as you
hop into the platform you get to claim a
name for yourself that's pretty cool
there's also a three month buddy pass so
you can gift stadia Pro access to a
friend or family member for three months
at no cost
also you can purchase an additional
state controller for around $70 u.s. or
$90 Canadian and you can pre-order the
founders
right now and Google did mention that it
is only for a limited time and only in
limited quantities so not exactly sure
you know when it's gonna run out I
certainly have placed my pre-order for
sure because I really want to get my
hands on this and share my experience
with you guys as soon as I get my hands
on this definitely stay tuned for that
there's also stadia bass which is a free
service and it allows users to stream up
to 1080p at 60 frames per second and you
can buy and keep the games you want and
stream them wherever you are now there
are some things to consider stadia base
is only going to come next year so if
you really want to experience it right
away you're actually better off you know
going for the premium subscription fee
which is the $10 per month option with
stadia pro or the stadia founders
edition that comes with a bundle pack
the other thing that Google really
didn't get into is accessibility and
availability with stadium pro and
stadium base you see even though that
you can access some of these games
anywhere you are
it looks like stadia is gonna be a
combination of game store as well as
being able to play some of these games
but at the same time you're gonna have
to buy some of these games with your own
money in order to access it from any
device so it looks like you might have
to pay the full premium price for a game
on stated base whereas would stay a pro
you would get some discounts with some
of these games that roll out later on
plus it looks like a lot of these game
libraries will be exclusive to stay a
pro whereas database will take some more
time to get access to those titles
stadia will be launching this November
in 14 countries including US Canada the
UK and of course the list that you see
over here Google is planning on
expanding then as time goes on so I
guess we'll just have to wait and see
how this all plays out in the next few
years
now what's really interesting is that
Google has actually integrated AMD
weight on GPUs into the data center and
they've also included developer tools to
create the foundation of stadia so it
looks like they do have the hardware to
back it up because they're using
second-generation HBM to memory to
provide fast and predictable performance
it also features error correcting code
to ensure protection is key but my
biggest concern is obviously gonna be
latency and I'm sure a lot of you guys
would agree with me on that as well
because in the past I've tried a lot of
these streaming services and they
weren't really that great particularly
with NVIDIA and gamestream I mean I've
tried streaming a game for my PC to the
shield over my Wi-Fi network and it
wasn't really that great
we've also try and aim DS game streaming
service actually I'll leave a link to
that video right over here where you can
watch our experience going through that
setup and you know it worked seventy
percent of time latency was still
present it wasn't really perfect so like
I said I guess we'll just have to wait
and see what stadia has to offer and I
can't wait to get my hands on this and
share my experience with you guys but
let me know what you guys think about
stadia is it something that you know you
would consider trying out yourself and
but at the same time you know do you
think stadia is the future of gaming now
if it turns out to be successful it
could also be a little bit of a problem
as well because you know it will be
difficult for gaming brands to start
promoting their products for certain
things because you know if latency is
not even an issue if it doesn't even
exist with stadia things could just turn
a whole new way a complete complete
degree could take a complete turn in the
whole industry so yeah I guess we're
just going to wait and see let me know
what you guys think about state in the
comments down below I'm even with
hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching make sure to check out some
relevant content over here subscribe to
our boot sequence channel and I'll see
you guys in the next one I gotta go I
think had to go drink some hot tea or
something because my throat is my voice
is busted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
