is brought to you by and cix technology
connected
alright guys i'm here with greg from
valve and what we're going to be
discussing right now is probably one of
the most innovative things to hit gaming
since I you know what since Atari and
Nintendo basically that's the pedestal
I'm putting this on because of the fact
that this is probably the biggest thing
to hit gaming the biggest innovation hit
gaming in an extremely long time and I'm
incredibly excited to talk about it so
what are you holding your hand right now
this is the steam controller it really
was built in order to allow gamers to be
in the living room and have access to
the complete steam catalog awesome now
this is going to feature a lot of
customizability but you're going to be
doing a lot of crowd sourcing for the
button mapping how are you going to go
about doing that what really steamed
gives us a kind of a jet
get-out-of-jail-free card when it comes
to supporting a hardware device on on a
PC the input device it used to be that
you'd bring a innovative input device
home and you'd have to wrestle with
configuration for each individual game
that you wanted to play or hope that you
know the maker of the hardware device
had built something that would
facilitate that process but steam lets
us sit in between individual titles and
gamers and provide a lot of that value
through button mappings but not just
ones that we've authored you know back
at steam HQ but ones that we've
workshops through the community so that
everybody on the in the community is
deciding helping to decide what is the
best default binding set for each game
and you know there are thousands of
games on Steam at this point none of
them have been designed with the steam
controller in mind all those games some
of them have been designed for
traditional controller but when you play
most of the catalog the games think that
they're being played by a mouse and
keyboard this device emulates both of
those hardware devices in such a way
that it's seamless for the game but
there needs to be a translation layer it
needs to you know when I press one of
these buttons on the face of the
controller it needs to be an
intermediary deciding oh that that
actually maps to the spacebar and it
helps
jump in this game for example and the
community is going to help decide what's
the best mapping between between those
services and this is just an early
prototype right this is an early
prototype we've sent three hundred of
these to end users theme a lot of these
are also going to content Parker's right
now so we're getting a tremendous amount
of useful feedback from people who are
having a chance to play really the whole
catalogue of games using the controller
also know I know from personal
experience that whenever you try to come
up with something you are going to come
up with and meet a lot of different
roadblocks can you go into a little bit
of an explanation as to some of the
roadblocks that you guys have
experienced and how you actually
overcame them so I think that's a really
important key piece to explaining how
you guys got this to market well we're
still getting it to market the kinds of
roadblocks we have encountered along a
design process we're ones where
initially we it was a daunting task to
look at what PC gamers have always had
as far as input goes is about a hundred
and four keys on the standard windows
keyboard and a tremendously high
resolution 2d pointing device for analog
style input with a mouse and the
prospect of taking all those things and
putting him into a package that was
comfortable in your hands but didn't
force you to lug in those legacy devices
to sit on your sofa cushions it was
really some of the that was the tall
order that we we felt like we had to
figure out yet and this device is the
one that we think actually on those
fundamental requirements that we've
accomplished our goal that you can
actually sit down and play the entire
steam catalog and have access to all
those functions in a way that is pretty
great experience so that was that was
the thing that you know we started with
early prototypes with around track balls
and all kinds of different you know we
built controllers that had a
number of buttons on them because we
were just you know we're doing the
inventory and trying out early
experiments but getting to the point
where we we realized that through a
combination of software that runs inside
the device and that runs on Steam and a
clever hardware design that we came up
with a solution that we think it's going
to work and on the retail I've heard
rumors that these buttons here are going
to be touchscreen you know that's the
current plan so actually a lot of that
inventory on a keyboard traditional
keyboard is it access through the touch
screen here in the center of the screen
we're going through some design
revisions right now based on some of the
feedback that we're seeing from end
users and we've actually been pleasantly
surprised about how well people are able
to play the entire catalog in advance of
that functioning existing so we're kind
of reevaluating the button layout and a
number of features as we have had
designed it before we feel really
fortunate because being able to do this
in public with real users it's making us
way more confident in our design
decisions then we would be if it was all
being done behind closed doors so guys
this has been our I guess sneak peek at
the steam machine controller and I can
tell you from playing with it it feels
incredible it's got great feedback the
button layout I'm gonna be honest with
you i love the button layout i think
it's perfect just the way it is i mean
if you change it I'll deal with it all
adapt but guys I'm incredibly excited
for us i can't wait for launch to happen
i can't wait to get one in my hands so I
complete the thumbs a little bit more
and guys if you want some more some more
news reviews and kick-ass CES 2014
coverage make sure you subscribe hit
like if you like it don't dislike it
because I'm telling you right now
there's absolutely nothing here to
dislike and make sure you keep on
following guys see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
