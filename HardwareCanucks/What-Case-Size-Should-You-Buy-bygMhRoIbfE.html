what's up guys in this video I want to
discuss key sizes and what some of the
things you should be aware of talk about
some of the misconceptions when it comes
to small or large cases and ground some
my own expectations when it comes to
case sizes moving on in 2017 so let's
talk about all that right after cool and
after master keys keyboard lineup is now
available in three sizes to fit within
your space with large medium and small
boards with either beautiful RGB or pure
white LED illumination a little
something for everyone make it yours
with the master keys pro by Cooler
Master now we review a lot of cases one
of the things that I'm starting to
notice about myself is start to
appreciate what companies are doing with
regards to exterior and interior design
on the exterior in particular to really
minimize the footprint of paneling so
the case isn't too large to sit on your
desk and not too bulky and on the
interior completely module amount so we
have options with regards to our
hardware but why would one choose a
ridiculously large super Tower like the
fantasy elite or its double wide monster
the core w204 Thermaltake ware and
motherboards really gets locked and to
answer that question that's perhaps a
topic for another video because in this
video I want to talk about the
mainstream case category so like the ITX
mid tower and full towers and skip away
from like the really really giant and
double wide PC cases because they only
serve the niche market those
enthusiastic want to water cool and
really put their heart and soul into the
build and spend you know quite elaborate
skiing around a case but in this video
let's talk about the mainstream and the
mainstream only and so let's start with
the smallest ITX cases that are always
super rewarding after build completion
there are usually challenges though with
cable management and needing to follow
strict compatibility rules for hardware
so everything can fit no problem and
there's usually minimal storage options
you get usually like dual SSDs and hard
drive
they're somewhere but pretty much all
XCX cases support 11s GPUs and a
low-profile CPU coolers and a good bunch
of them also support 120 ml all in ones
with an X effects power supply
recommended but many icx cases still
allow 480 X units to be installed with
some science restriction the main
drawback here I feel for ITX cases comes
the perceived poor value because for ITX
cases prices range from the affordable
$50 mark rising all the way to like $100
and even reaching $150 without water
cooling niche audience sfx power
supplies also tend to be higher in price
and by the time you're full icx system
is assembled the total price may seem to
compete with that of a mid tower and
that perhaps may throw off people from
going to the ITX direction but also keep
in mind that with anything compact there
is that inevitable price premium and
that just something you know there's
strings attached with the ITX direction
and based on my small twitter survey
majority of users utilize amis our
chassis that's unsurprising that's very
common then 25% use a full tower and
only 9% are in a small I TX arena and I
would really love to rerun these tests
maybe a year from now just to see if the
market trends carry over with these
statistics and I feel like the hotel
category will decline and we'd get more
users in the ITX space definitely and
maybe it's like increase in the mid
tower category also and they say this is
because space efficiency on mid towers
has drastically improved allowing very
similar cooling configurations as on
full towers with the opening of the
interior allowing that front portion
that used to be occupied with drive
gauges and five and a quarter inch drive
bays to now be filled with the radiator
as our needs shift to minimize hard
disks and emitting optical drives
completely which is why all these mid
towers have very similar front cooling
options accommodating dual 140 member
fans by default in order to support the
rise of popular 280 no matter all-in-one
like the X 62 the new EVGA cooler and a
bunch of coarser 281 offerings also and
today you simply don't need a large
enclosure to achieve good cooling in
many instances the power supply shroud
and other elements are modular allowing
the removal of that front piece and
relocation of the drive cage to fit
triple 120mm fans at the front and
radiator in there also which is
something totally unique for a package
this small Corsair 400 C is a good
example the fans XP 400 has that removal
plate on the shroud also and the defined
C from practice design is by far my
favorite implementation of this cooling
potential the cooler master 5t is
another great example in the mid tower
category without modular space at the
front with appropriate cutouts on the
shroud so you can fit the radiator there
plus the long forgotten 5-minute quarter
inch drive bays are present here just in
case but they are removable to
accommodate triple 120mm fan setup mid
towers also seem to work around the
height limitation with clever cutouts on
the power supply shroud to route cables
from below which means motherboards can
be as low as possible leaving enough
room at the top for set of fans and most
of time comfortable clearance for a top
radiator - and it's easy to see why mid
towers are so popular especially as this
category offers the most choice with
cases like s340
that is the perfect example of simple
system with an AO in the front while
slightly larger enclosures like the
mastercase 5 the P 400 or the age of 40
try to accommodate for more cooling
options and system options in general
but all comfortably fit ATX motherboards
dual GPUs at least to its aziz and two
hard drives with minimum 5 fans for
cooling and comfortable cable management
without needing a thicker chassis which
is defined see from fractal design being
an amazing example of space efficiency
by reducing the height with smaller case
feet and making the case shorter in
length to fit long GPUs but also
allowing a radiator at the front and
just really minimize that space in
between them so then why would someone
go towards a bigger full tower
I think we know when the courser 800 D
came out everybody really wanted that
type of experience also because it was
one of the first cases to offer anything
that we wanted in a large spacious Tower
and many cases now take the same concept
of this open interior without being
bulky on the exterior
that's the brilliance of it but if
you're going for a full tower then you
are most likely needing that extra
storage capacity that mid towers may not
offer right now and also if you are
going for more comfortable water-cooling
loop and honestly it's a little awkward
for me to work with full towers simply
because my reference test system is too
small to be filling such large and
spacious interiors that are designed for
water cooling it's like correctly lit if
you go into a full towers you've got a
water pool so take a look at this
example with the core w200 is definitely
a prerequisite to water cool in this
case and the same goes to the fan fics
elite that feels to be a showcase only
case and not really for consumers
then there's the EVGA DG 87 is a giant
Tower but all the exterior panels kind
of close off the openness that full
towers are supposed to offer and then
the dark base 900 from be quiet is the
only traditional full tower that we've
reviewed recently that expands the
interior with fully modular option and
water cooling and then there cases like
the panzer max from cougar that is the
size of a full tower with tall and bulky
exterior elements but with the mid tower
frame still allowing fan installation
outside of the frame to create more
clearance above the motherboard area
where everything else remains almost
identical in feature sets to something
like the mastercase 5 t that has a much
lower footprint and so it's important to
recognize that larger case sizes may not
be may not offer advantages when more
compact enclosures can fit exactly the
same configuration but you may ask how
does that impact cooling and so to test
this I used an overclocked 4690k at 4.5
gigahertz with a pretty standard CPU
tower cooler with a reference GTX 1070
across the define mini C a slightly
larger P 400 and the master case 50 and
then the dark base 900 full Tower to see
how temperatures would vary between a
small the standard mid towers and the
large full tower with their default
factory cooling and here are the temps
that reveal interesting results with the
larger cases giving a slightly better
CPU temperatures but with higher GPU
temperature on the full tower most
likely due to have a more
resistance at the front and also being
further away from those fans the 5 T is
utilizing 140 more fans on both intake
and exhaust that might explain cooler
CPU readouts but notice the 2 degrees C
difference between the mini C and the P
400 both of which utilized identical
stand setups but on a smaller case the
fan is closer to the GPU that results in
better system cooling and so to take
away with these temperature tests is
that regardless of case size you might
have to reconfigure your fan placement
and fan size to achieve optimal cooling
and it's just so interesting to see how
their default cooling configuration
these 4 cases at different sizes
performs practically identical with like
3 degree Delta s which is not
significant so guys this conversation is
never over let's continue the chap in
the comments down below I'm curious to
know if you agree with me and my
thinking of this decline in the full
tower market and really the shift
towards the compact space for ITX and
mid towers and everything in between
and let me know what case category size
your main system is in and if you're
thinking of doing it on the build which
direction are you leaning towards doing
something bigger or doing something
smaller let me know in the comments down
below I'm Dimitri how are connects
thanks much for watching we'll see you
