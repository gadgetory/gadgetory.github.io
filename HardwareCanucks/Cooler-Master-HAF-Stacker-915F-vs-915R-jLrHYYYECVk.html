knocks and welcome back to another view
in the previous stacker video we took a
look at the half 935 that incorporated a
metal plus a smaller companion to be
used for water cooling or drive storage
which proved to be effective for that
exact purpose but that wasn't as
effective for a secondary system and
that's exactly where the 915 F comes in
play so that $70 is a bit on a high end
considering it's only a mini ITX chassis
and on its own it's not really the best
option for a mini ITX build however in
conjunction with another stacker this is
a whole different story
now while the concept of the stacking is
not entirely new with custom pedestals
available from only a handful of
companies cool masters expanding the
possibilities with the stacker line to a
whole new level at the front we get a
power button audio jacks and USB 3 ports
as with the 915 our top panel is
removable and the chassis looks very
much identical with the same side panels
to house triple 120s or dual 140 million
fans but coming around to the back the
915 F is designed for a mini ITX system
so we get an exhaust fan and a power
cable pass-through as the power supply
is now relocated to the front with the
extension cable now I don't know why ku
Moscow still uses these really annoying
dust filters for the power supply and I
really would like to see that changed
there's no dedicated drive gauge in here
unlike only 915 R so drive mounts are
really kind of scattered around with
both 3.5 inch and SSD support in the
optical barrier using rubber grommets
furthermore on the floor of the case and
finally on this drive bracket for a
total of three spots for storage
installing our mini ITX motherboard and
starting in with the initial cable work
the 915 doesn't really seem to have any
cable management system in place all the
cables are basically facing inside and
there's really nowhere to tuck them in
or hide them now good news with the long
GPU support as there is nothing abstract
away
our 11 half-inch card fits in perfectly
and as you can see from above I wasn't
able to pass any cables behind drive
bracket so it really comes down to
having a minimalistic build in order for
it to clean and one thing I also wish
colormaster would have taken into
account is minimizing or at least hiding
all the front panel connectors cables
which is you can see just adds to the
overall cable clutter and while you can
install fans on the side panel lengthen
your GPU will determine compatibility so
airflow is really not up to the half
standard now where the 915 F really gets
interesting is when you get to stacking
mounting the 925 on there you're able to
run two completely separate systems in
this fairly compact package and this is
something very unique and functional for
the more mounting the 915 are on top of
your main system for that skyscraper
look for a little punch of water cooling
or drive storage and the best part of
all of this are the multiple stacking
options for optimal and user preferred
configurations you can have your own
little render farm located inside this
one massive stacker and it managed to
work well between chambers or is
individual compartments I do whoever see
value in the stacker only if you're
stacking otherwise the 9:15 F or the R
fall short in space efficiency and
layout for a mini ITX build and to
conclude with a stacker 9:15 F I'm
really starting to appreciate the
concept more with the purpose of multi
system builds I mean the ability to have
three pcs inside this combination is
very appealing and while size may seem
like an issue in the beginning if you
think about it having three separate
chasis to perform the same task and the
stacker really comes out to become space
efficient for what it can do I also like
the chamber integration to work as a
single three-piece unit with appropriate
cutouts to pass cables and tubing
through between the entire case however
the stacker is far from perfect this
concept will certainly improve over time
hopefully but when it comes to internal
space efficiency and layout for both the
915 R and F it could definitely be
better cable management for one is a
complete
9:15 F with a full system installed and
air flow this does not live up to the
half standard power supply test filter
is extremely inconvenient for cleaning
they really should change that to
something more common and at this time
there was no window panels available for
smaller compartments which I think would
look excellent for a gaming rig now let
us know how you would configure the
entire three pieces it would be
interesting to know how many different
functional configurations the stacker
can handle as always leave your comments
