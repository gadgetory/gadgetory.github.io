for CES is going to be a little bit
early we are going to razor yeah the
three musketeers are landed we are back
again
alright good people so at the razor
suite we have the razor tomahawk elite
their first case that they've designed
by themselves this is just a prototype
it looks sick let's check it out
but first the huge thanks to our
sponsors for making this see as possible
alright so this whole razor tomahawk
case is a very interesting direction for
razor because it's the first case that
they're designing by themselves you know
they've done some collaborations with
the NZXT and other brands in the past
which looks you know look they look cool
but this is legit their first case of
course it has you know a lot of
resemblance in this current state to
NZXT the H series like the H 700 it's
about the same size and has the same
kind of like metallic shape the
ventilation pattern for example is the
same square so I'm really hoping that in
the final revision that we'll see some
unique elements in terms of design that
you know separates this case from many
other cases in the market and NZXT in
particular so the tomahawk elite what's
so special about it so what they're
trying to do is go into the direction
with these mechanized side panels so
they're both tempered glass on both
sides and they are supposed to raise up
so the prototype sample we saw is just
you know it's a handmade sample but what
they want to do here is you press a
button they open up but they're also
inserting in this top panel which is
also tempered glass so it's a three side
tempered glass design and letting you
raise that a little bit for airflow so
my question in terms of this interior
layout was because it is inverted
you know you'll need definitely fan
brackets up top otherwise you know this
whole raising section up top will be
pointless I really like the power supply
shroud design it is all enclosed and
they're still debating on whether or not
to put anything in the front and I feel
like they should because if it's just a
front solid piece then the case is you
know is going to limit its airflow
potential if the whole basement is
covered with the power supply shroud and
the top has no fan bracket so where you
know you know install fans so the rear
has some
an allocation of course it's not final
yet and so I'm really kind of excited to
see how and in what direction race it
will take this tomahawk Elite what I
really like about the cable management
design I'm not sure exactly how it will
be in the finished product but I love
the motherboard sort of cover at the
back so this is where you can hide
certain cables routing them for your 24
pin and the eight pin cable while having
that little transparent section so you
can see the motherboard cutout which i
think is a you know a very unique take
on paneling design especially since that
whole area is tempered glass side panels
so it will be visible throughout I do
like the SSD mounting locations however
the SATA cables are facing towards the
front and not towards the motherboard
tray so exactly how you're going to
route that so cable measurement still
needs a bit of work especially on how to
access the power supply shroud area of
course the top i/o will include type-c
connector and I'm hoping you know nice
collection of buttons so you can control
the top hydraulic system for airflow and
those side panels pricing is not yet
available but I'm really excited to see
in what direction Razer takes the
Tomahawks series and just really looking
forward to the final production samples
and this is the Razer tomahawk a
slightly more basic version compared to
the tomahawk Elite this one is a little
bit more complete state so let's check
it out and as for the lower end razor
tomahawks so that's in a more complete
state so the tooling is almost complete
and it does have three resembles to a
lien the Alpha enclosure so a similar
kind of roomy interior power supply
shroud with those covers on to which you
can install either fans or SSDs you can
install a 360 radiator at the front but
my only concern is with the top mounted
fans since those fan holes are not lined
up for flexibility for radiators for
example because they are fixed and
that's an issue illumination of course
though it looks awesome
bottom firing LEDs plus the Razer logo
at the front it kind of Falls and what
Razer has been doing with NZXT that
designed by Razer formula but now the
tomahawk is razors own creation all
right so that's the Razer tomahawk elite
and the regular tomahawk what
think any feedback is of course
appreciated this is going to be
launching in q3 of 2019 so lots of time
for revisions and you know market trends
to catch up hopefully we'll see many new
features as well that are not included
in this prototype so thanks so much for
watching the CES coverage I'll see you
guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
