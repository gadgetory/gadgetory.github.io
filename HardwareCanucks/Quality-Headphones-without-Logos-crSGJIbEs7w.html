and extensively marketed with paid
promotions product placements and
celebrity endorsements from some of the
bigger brands today we're looking at
headphones from status audio whose
slogan is no logos no celebrities just
sound let's find out if this claim holds
up and if status audio can deliver we
have two headphones today the open
backed ovie one and the closed back CB
one priced at $79.99 USD which is an
excellent price for the target audience
the first thing to realize is that these
headphones aren't the same they're quite
different in both design and sound
the first major difference is the closed
back design of the cb1 compared to the
opened back nature of the ob1 for those
who aren't familiar open back design
means that they're not sealed don't
isolate from outside noise and also leak
noise the advantage is that you get
greater soundstage and better positional
audio which is great for both music
listening and ingame positional audio as
such open-back headphones are more
suited for studio listening and in a
quiet environment or as closed back
headphones like the cb1 are great for
less controlled environments however you
don't get quite the same sound and
positional audio now let's get the specs
out of the way the ob1 features 42
millimeter drivers with over ear open
back design and an impedance of 50 4
ohms frequency response of 15 Hertz to
30 kilohertz and a 3 meter straight
cable the cb1 has larger 50 millimeter
drivers with a closed back over year
design it has a lower 32 ohm impedance
frequency response of 15 Hertz to 30
kilohertz and dual removable cables with
a three meter straight cable as well as
a coiled build quality is the first
thing to look at and we'll start with
the better built OB one on the ear cups
you have this very tough plastic with a
metallic finish and it really feels
durable and premium connecting the ear
cups to the headband is more
high-quality rubberized plastic and
metal in the headband
the built-in the obi-wan is really
impressive at the price and competes and
beats not only headphones in its price
range like the 280 pro but also more
expensive headphones the build of the
cb1 isn't quite as impressive the
plastic feels cheaper and lighter and
the superb metal headband is missing
here replaced with a more flimsy plastic
the build isn't bad but it's just not at
the same level as its brother before we
get to the main claim in the sound will
look at usability and comfort the Obi
one unfortunately falls a little bit
flat here especially since open-back
headphones generally tend to be more
comfortable the soft air pad seemed good
on first impressions but they're just
not that cushiony and I found myself
longing for the Valu material on my k7x
axes in addition the clamping force was
just way too strong for my preference
although hopefully that will loosen with
time the headband is padded and feels
alright but it's nothing exceptional the
Obi ones are certainly usable and I
wouldn't say it's super uncomfortable
but I wouldn't want to be using them for
a long period of time in addition to
that the cable is not only non removable
but splits at the top and I can't say I
like that this makes it more prone to
damage and failure and because it's non
removable once the cable goes so do the
headphones in this department the cb1
steps up to the plate the ear pads are
very large and plush and while they're a
little odd with the oval shape it's
pretty comfortable overall clamping
force is still present but it's less
forceful than the OB one making for a
more comfortable design it's still not
great and I find other closed headphones
like the EM 50s or open-back headphones
like my K 7 X's much more comfortable
but it's good enough you also get a
removable cable here which is awesome to
see it means you can choose your cable
style and also get other cable lengths
as well as if any damage comes to your
cables the headphones will still work
all of this combined with the closed
design makes the CB ones the more
versatile of the two headphones but
enough with the teasing let's get into
the sound to put it simply these sound
good
really good in fact at the price I would
go out and say these are probably one of
the best in the price range starting out
with the CB ones I compared these to the
80 hm 50 X's my k7 x axis and the
Sennheiser HD 280 pros
considering all of these retail for a
higher price than the status audio set I
was really impressed with how it held up
these were way better than the 280 CROs
keeping better definition throughout the
range and just being all-around much
more enjoyable to listen to when I
compared them to the m50x it got a
little closer though they sounded a bit
more neutral and while the mids were a
little recessed they seemed quite flat
and pretty accurate where's the m50 axes
sound seemed a bit more pleasing
depending on the song I actually found
myself preferring the sound from the CV
ones at times with the high end being a
bit more defined and clearer with more
detail over the range however noise
isolation wasn't as good the m50x
blocked outside noise much more and
while these are close back you're still
going to hear a fair bit of the outside
environment so on public transport or in
loud situations these will struggle for
more electronic or bass focused music I
would pick the m50 s over these as
they're a little too neutral with the
bass being a bit lackluster the music
listening I found myself wishing for a
little bit more hit in the deeper bass
and it lacked that fullness to the sound
of times still if you're doing casual
mixing and music listening I think the
cbiit ones would make an awesome pair
and considering the EM 50s I'd never
double the price and the CB one is still
trading blows it's really impressive
moving on to the open ones and you still
have a very impressive sound this picks
up in some of the areas that the CB one
lacks with the bass being a bit more
present and having better extension into
some of the deeper bass range you also
get the added bonus of having that open
back design coming in which allows for a
much wider soundstage and I really do
love having that openness to the sound
highs are also very good like the CB
ones and over the range they sound
really great as always audio is fairly
subjective but I've been happy listening
to these over a variety of music and I
would say purely in terms of sound
I would prefer these over the CB ones
having that open back design is also
nice in game as you have better
positional audio which helps for
footsteps and other sounds so let's
conclude both of these headphones offer
some impressive value with the best
sound in this price range I think the
hardest thing about these headphones is
choosing which one to pick up
unfortunately each one has their own
unique compromises the CV ones have that
removable cable and better comfort but
you're going to have to deal with that
closed back design and still not that
great noise isolation as for the OB ones
you get that wider soundstage and better
build but you lose out on that removable
cable and comfort element is less
friendly we can't expect perfection at
this price but I'm happy to see a no
label headphone company challenging the
ranks and would say you'd be happy with
either pair as long as you know what
you're getting into so thank you for
