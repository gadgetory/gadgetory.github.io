true performance
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with
hard-rock UNIX and if you're in the
market for a right handed Mouse that
delivers the best experience for
tracking that I have experienced so far
then you have come to the right place
because they were taking a look at the
my onyx castor this is $69 mouse that
has perfected all of the elements when
it comes to just being functional now
I've been using the Nails 7000 as my
daily driver for over a year now and
when they onyx told me confidently that
I would be replacing the nails with the
castor I didn't know what to think about
that until I opened it up placed it on
my mat and put my hands on it
and that's when the line changed because
this is seriously one of the best mice
that are used to this so the first
impressions of the form and materials
used were completely satisfactory as the
likely rubberized coating feels non-slip
and cool plus I love the textured thumb
support which makes lifting the mouse
super easy without needing to readjust
the grip although I did notice that the
moisture might accumulate on the rubber
dimples from sweat or if your hands just
wet and it loosens the grip and just
become slippery so just keep that space
dry the form of the caster is phenomenal
being much smaller than the Neos and you
think that feel less supported for palm
or claw grip but the contours on the
right side let your ring and pinky
fingers just rest in place without any
sensitive pressure while the curvature
on the left side fits the thumb very
well right in the reach of the two
browser buttons above notice this is not
a symmetrical Mouse and thus all
emphasis has been placed to create the
most comfortable shape for right hand
use and I think my onyx achieves that
perfectly now let's talk buttons the
single DPI switch behind the scroll
wheel is easy to access and cycles
between three DPI settings although
unfortunately without any visual
indicator on screen or in the mouse
itself and you just have to feel the
sensitivity the scroll wheel is
fantastic with distinct scroll steps and
light enough press for actual use in
games the thumb buttons have a
satisfying click and primary left and
right clicks deliver a nice balance
between speed and pressure I've
zero issues inside pistol rounds where
speed and consistency of the left-click
is absolutely crucial the RGB lighting
on the mouse is welcome both the logo
and the back on the scroll wheel I
vibrantly lit obviously it's nice to
color match your peripherals but one
thing that I do appreciate is the fact
that they do not use the whole RGB
sixteen point seven million colors to
sell the mouse it is one of the
marketing points in the website is the
very bottom and also in this very tiny
font on the packaging as it's all about
craftsmanship and I appreciate that
shows confidence the 2 meter PDC cable
is light which is nice to not affect
your aim but I find it's hard to keep it
under control and it just curves around
my desk this would be just a visual
gripe is otherwise I think the cable is
perfectly fine now let's talk tracking I
immediately felt a smooth glide on my
aluminum Mouse map thanks to the massive
Mouse feet although a week later I could
feel the glide being not as good as when
I first received it which could be the
cause by the lunar surface so I might
switch to fabric mouse mat to preserve
the mouse feet the sensor inside the
caster is the pmw 3310 ir LED optical
sensor with I would say pointless dpi of
up to 10,000 but even when compared to
the nails 7000 with the exact same
settings the castor just felt so much
better for precise aim and really
reactive with zero negative or positive
hardware acceleration which made hours
of csgo matches so much more fun I don't
think I've ever been this accurate this
quick I wouldn't say my aim has improved
but it was easier quickly glancing back
to make sure no one was sneaking up on
me and those flex shots just land in
time at the time and rewatching some of
that footage while gaming you can see
that I don't move the mouse too much but
I do lift it occasionally to return it
to my comfortable on center spot which
is easy thanks to proper curves to cut
the mouse without any effort
and lastly the software is well laid out
all six buttons can be remapped to
something else polling rate selection of
up to 1000 hertz double click and crawl
speed adjustment and pointer
acceleration should actually be left
disabled under sensor performance you
have 3 DPI steps pointer speed and lift
distance is crucial and surface analyzer
could come in handy to verify the
surfaces being registered and there's
nothing wrong with a sensor the color
settings are straightforward with some
LED effects and color selection and
lastly macro settings could come in
handy if you decide to remap a button to
something more specific and personal and
so I think the my onyx cast there will
be a very popular gaming mouse for
first-person shooters I mean not only
but that would be I think the target
audience for this one because it
encompasses everything super well the
price point the ergonomics the switches
the driver customization and outstanding
tracking performance so you can aim well
and we're giving it harks damn go to
work so thank you so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed make sure to subscribe
and follow for more gaming content and
we'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
