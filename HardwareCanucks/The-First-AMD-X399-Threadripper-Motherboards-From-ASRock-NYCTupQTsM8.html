repair processors first since that's
likely something that you all want to
know about a bit more before I get too
far into these motherboards these
processors are made to go head-to-head
against Intel's upcoming skylake X CPUs
in the high-end desktop space
it's called thread River for a reason
since processors based around this
version of the engine architecture will
have up to 16 cores and 32 threads a
chip with those type of specs will take
a massive amount of space on any board
and that's why this socket is so massive
I mean look at it it's almost a quarter
of the size of an ITX board thread
Ripper targets the ultra premium desktop
market so it won't come cheap our coffee
tech strip is brought to you by fan tech
schoolmaster and MSI now the first board
here is the X 399 professional gaming
and it has a ton of features what we can
see is like Intel's x99 and upcoming X
299 platforms rising thread Ripper will
use quad-channel ddr4 memory and as Rock
has prepared their board for exactly
that there's also four 16x pcie 3.0
slots that support four-way SLI and
crossfire but we're not quite sure about
what format that will be but without a
doubt this board will be able to run in
dual 16x mode there are also three ultra
and two slots each of which have access
to four PCI lanes of course such a large
CPU requires a lot of power so as Rock
has even installed a second four pin
power header
next to the memory modules as for other
features there's a EULA two connector
for fast enterprise-class SSDs front
panel USB 3.1 gen2 it created some
Blaster audio system and a few more
interesting items that are being kept
under wraps for the time being moving on
to the X 399 Taichi and other than a few
slight heatsink changes it has the same
basic setup as the professional with a
few minor changes there's four PCI 3.0
16x slots 3 m dot two slots with nvme
compatibility and almost the same
secondary storage system startup as well
as au doctor character and eight SATA
ports right now both of these
motherboards are very much in their
preliminary stages as as rocks
X 3 9 and lineup will of course expand
before AMD launches thread Ripper in the
coming months we'll make sure to keep
you updated about that so that wraps up
our quick coverage of the ads around
explain nai motherboard here copy text
make sure you stay tuned for more videos
I mean we're with Harkin X thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
