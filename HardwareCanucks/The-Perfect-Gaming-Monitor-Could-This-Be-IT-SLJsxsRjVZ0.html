know that you that puts up guys I'm
Dimitri and we're going to our first
meeting of the day these last couple
days have been absolutely chill we're
taking it easy this time around with the
port the really strange part is that we
only have two meetings today and
normally we're like I have to sick bay
yeah somebody on Twitter said that like
this yes feels kind of eerie because
there are no lineups for vents no lines
from cabs it's true it's good the way
but it's also it feels odd and there's
nobody here nobody where all the people
but first huge thanks to our sponsors
Thermaltake Razer MSI Corsair and fantex
for making C as possible gigabyte
there's on the same level of jail as us
get some classical music in the
background as we get some beer oh I'm
gonna stop it so we don't get copyright
strikes for this music so the hilarious
part is that Hebrew has relocated all
the r-tx 2060s from gigabyte from you
know this name where they were so he
could for some reason arab this room and
not use it ever explain yourself I'm
gonna do that I'm gonna replace them
I'll put them back in their order after
this so the thing is we have lost Mike
to a briefing so enjoy this b-roll
sequence from gigabyte
so eBrush shooting this tiny little
thing and it is an RGB M de tu nvme SSD
what have we come to what like come on
I know so interesting fat guys this is
essentially I asked him ok so how are
you powering this and he said there's
little connector on the SSD that plugs
in and then it's not powered via it's
basically powered by N ba n daa' - you
know it's a heat saying for the SSD but
it also has RGB that's hilarious
it just needs Tory by the way what
happened is I was a full master I was
distracted by Dimitri almost said and I
placed my finger literally underneath
this portion and so I just tried to
unmount or unscrew this port and this
whole thing just slid down and I cut my
hand so
yeah all right people so inside this
room Oris has a really interesting
monitor what they're calling ad 27 QD
the specs on that thing are actually
pretty insane for the price points of
$5.99
we have HDR 400 basis specs so it's not
too bright but HDR with DCI p3 at 95%
Adobe RGB space which is impressive we
have 144 Hertz we have 27 inches at qHD
resolution really nice little
encompassing spec and free sync not
freezing to unfortunately just freezing
so it is IPS and this Oris tactical
display is not all about specs because
they're introducing a new software
driver level OSD customization so not
only you're gonna have to go in and
fiddle around with a joystick to change
all your settings for brightness and you
know different gaming profiles maybe
because all that is now built into the
software driver which is awesome so you
don't have to fiddle around there so
from the software directly you can add
your own crosshair you can actually draw
it yourself as well little customization
element you can add a timer if for
spells for example so if you're doing a
spell that resets in 90 seconds you can
hit a macro key and it will show you
that timer which is cool you can also
add a counter for example they give us
pub G if you see a drop in the distance
you can add that and know how many drops
have continued throughout the game you
can change everything about the color
the brightness the different gaming
profiles directly from the software
which is great so we have the brightness
slider no longer you have to go in there
and fiddle around with joystick which I
find you know really good and the entire
layout is pretty intuitive easy to
navigate and all the customization is
there now of course this would not be a
gaming monitor without some RGB goodness
so there are RGB illumination elements
in the back that you can customize but
you know more interesting kind of like
feature about this or as tactical
display is noise cancellation so it has
an IC built in so you can plug in your
headset directly into the monitor and
you have different noise cancellation
profiles for your microphone which is
interesting so most motherboards do that
already but if you're like the lower-end
motherboard that has no software for
your drivers and audio then this could
be a really good way to utilize noise
cancellation so that it will actually
cancel out all the keyboard strokes
if you have any music playing in the
background we've listened to it and
there is you know it is heavily
compressed but can you choose the
different profiles between high and low
compression so it's a cool feature built
in for a gaming panel that we have not
seen yet in the past all right so that
is the oars tactical gaming monitor let
us know what you think and then $5.99
it sounds like a pretty damn good deal
it sure is all right so this is an
interesting revelation that every time
we come to gigabyte at CES we normally
try to come at lunch
yes look at this I just want to get food
in his belly oh no ahh the classical
music we've been fed with more East and
watered watermelon water by the way yes
very very good all right guys let us
know what you think about the things
that you just saw with ORS and yeah
thanks for watching we'll see you next
video
it is by the way still completely empty
check this out there goes Eva that goes
now that was more eerie than the have a
Lone Ranger than living the way here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
