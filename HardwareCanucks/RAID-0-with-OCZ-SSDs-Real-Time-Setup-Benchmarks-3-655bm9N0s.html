great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri without
rockin arcs welcome to another video
now we recently built this beast of a
machine behind me the $3500 skylake
editing PC now the important thing to
notice about this machine is that we're
only using install estate drives for our
workflow so any of everything that's
inside will be extremely fast to access
and read by Adobe applications so we
don't have to wait for things to load
don't have to wait for things to render
out and it's a very very good thing
because if you know if you know anything
about workflow for editing video editing
fast storage is as important as your CPU
and the GPU perhaps not in the final
rendering output but it is very
important in the actual workflow so in
this video it will be my first time
setting up SSDs in raid 0 which team
seems to be the topic surrounding
enthusiast machines only and I'm happy
to say that this is finally happening
with me as well so I hope you enjoyed
this can be a fun one and you know it's
SSDs we're talking about raid 0 array
but don't you worry I have plenty of
satisfying bocal Isha's bureau for your
viewing pleasure so we teamed up with
OCC for this project and they've
provided us with three of their vector
180 SSDs that are targeted for
performance workloads and enthusiast
applications which for our use align
perfectly well as editing drives and our
new skylake editing PC
these are 480 gigabyte capacities which
are incredibly well priced by the way at
around $200 apiece so you're looking at
42 cents per gigabyte which is an
awesome value plus OCC offers a 5 year
warranty which is a testament to their
very much appreciated consideration for
the enthusiast community and just shows
the link every of these drives and in
this video we'll be seeing what a
performance we get with onedrive raid 0
array with two drives and just for fun
triple SSDs and raid zero and just to
clarify we are
rate zero because I'd like to achieve
the best read and write performance
possible as the drives will be used for
video editing plus choosing any other
rate configuration means sacrificing on
either speed or capacity all the OCC
drives will be used as secondary storage
which is separate from my main operating
system drive which is this Intel 750 SSD
the first thing I did after installing
the drives in my case I have two of them
on my back and one on the side of the
case is going to the BIOS to set proper
SATA mode which is under peripherals
strangely with our z170 XP sli
motherboard from gigabyte and there we
enter a SATA configuration and instead
of the ahci mode we're going to enable
rate so after reboot we press ctrl I we
enter into this window that shows over
our connected SATA drives and here we're
going to create a new raid volume going
to call it vector 180 x3 to indicate
three SSDs in this raid 0 array raid 0
is what we want for best speeds and make
sure to select all the disks to be used
in this array and select an appropriate
strip size for raid 0 capacity is left
at default and then we simply click
create volume after which all three SSDs
are part of the same array so now we
boot it into Windows and I did have
Windows 10 installed on my Intel 750 SSD
so none of my files and anything that I
work on is affected but here as you
notice we opened my PC the OCZ red array
is no longer found so it's no longer
here but you can actually you will have
to enable it so you're going to manage
and this is the exact same procedure on
any Windows machine so you're going to
right-click your PC manage your going to
Disk Management and you can see you will
actually have to initialize the disk
which has been created with your raid
array now what we do is we go in to
right-click on this portion new simple
volume yes next next I'll give it to D
sure volume I'm going to call this
vector 180
x3 so I know that this is three SSDs in
there for my rate array go to next and
finish and so it's going to quick format
it and bam so here we have vector the
raid array that I've created and renamed
show up inside here I can open it I can
interact with it 1.3 terabytes of SSD
incredibly fast storage now I want to do
something here and test if there's any
speed differences in creating a raid
array in BIOS versus creating one
through the software through sort of
windows manage and create your own
through strip volume so now we're back
to the main menu of our SATA drives
inside the BIOS I'm going to delete this
raid volume and create one through the
windows Disk Management to see if
there's any speed differences in raid 0
with the three drives
alright so after booting into Windows
some weird thing happens so you can see
a local disk F is visible I cannot
access it but ask me to format it so
deleting the previous raid array inside
the BIOS didn't do the full job for me
so what I'm gonna have to do is actually
format disk now you can see all my three
SSDs are in their prime States ready for
new stripped volume so strip volume this
is another way to create the raid array
through software so you don't have to
access bios and don't have to deal with
any of that stuff it's easily accessible
through Windows and we're going to be
testing out the speeds in which we get
through you know setting up raid array
through software versus setting up and
by us you choose the disks that you want
to add to your full raid and I'm going
to call it vector 180 X 3 so again
perform a quick format and we're going
to see what type of speeds we get so one
of the advantages of creating a raid
array through the windows ecosystem is
the fact that the UI is slightly better
you don't need any software you know you
can right-click and you can change what
you want you what type of raid you'd
like whereas with the BIOS setting it's
a little bit more complicated a little
more Columba some but it still does the
exact same thing and so now we have our
new
grade the rain created the right zero
with three drives 1.3 terabytes of
incredibly fast storage and let's see if
there's any speed differences in
creating one through windows versus one
through the bios well here are the speed
results with the raid 0 array using all
three drives comparing performance of an
array created inside the bios versus the
one created inside the windows disk
management and notice the much higher
sequential read performance in an array
created inside the bios which is a very
important observation for moving massive
files in the end i went back to the bios
to create a raid 0 array for only two
drives because I needed a separate drive
for Adobe media cache files and also
scratch disk so when the dhobi tries to
access those files it does not interfere
with the read or write performance on
the main separate project drive and as
far as speeds go for this raid 0 array
for two drives I'm getting over one
gigabyte per second in sequential read
and write performance which I'm very
happy about and compare that to the
performance of a single vector 180 SSD
so you can see the array performs twice
as fast
for my project disks versus the cache
drive now so the reason why I finalize
my configuration with a raid 0 array on
two SSDs and left one separate is
because I want to protect my data in
case anything happens with the raid
because in raid 0 if anything happens
with one of the drives you lose all
information and I don't want to do that
because my raid 0 array will be my
projects file so anytime that I need to
access this information through Adobe it
would be you know the read and write
speeds are double as fast versus the
single drives and that's why I have the
vector 180 cache SSD so it's a separate
this D the dedicated for backup files
and for all the cache information so I
hope you enjoyed this video I'm really
happy with the way things turned out you
know having a separate raid 0 array with
two drives and then the separate cache
drive just so that I have some backup
and you know it's actually very
beneficial for Adobe to access separate
Drive for your
cash versus your main workflow drive and
it's I'm happy with how the actual
speeds of raid zero has benefited using
the BIOS rate versus the windows rate
and it's a very strange thing how there
is that slight speed difference and
speed advantage and setting up things in
rate 0 through bios versus Windows I'm
going to go back to editing this exact
video on this machine right now now I've
noticed a massive improvement in loading
projects that are super large so on
average each single 4k video project
file that I work with for our hard work
max productions is about 60 gigabytes so
opening up a project with 60 gigabytes
of footage inside a premier timeline is
very demanding so that really requires a
lot of reads through in Premiere and so
having this raid 0 array for Adobe to
access all these files has been
incredibly beneficial whereas previously
all my footage was on hard disks so it
took forever to load things but now it's
literally just a click away
and everything is loaded super quick and
before I skedaddle make sure to check
out all the videos we've produced
regarding the insane sky like editing PC
behind me all the parts the build log
the performance and gaming if you're
interested
it will all be linked in the description
below I'm Dimitri with our Canucks
