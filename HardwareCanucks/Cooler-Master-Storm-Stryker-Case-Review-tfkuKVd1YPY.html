positive feedback on their portable full
tower the CM storm trooper so it was a
no-brainer trying to expand the line
with the white edition of the case which
nowadays seems to be very popular for
manufacturers and in addition of a large
windows side panel so you can admire
your hardware while it's scratching
through games and chewing through frames
so we get the striker so the new color
and side panel are going to add just the
tab to the price but this being a sub
$200 portable full tower it is still
quite appealing and this new exterior is
no longer coated with rubber resistant
surface like we saw on the trooper but
instead they've chosen to go with the
glossy white finish which actually is
quite popular so let's check out the new
color job and the windowed side panel
the top and the front panels are made
entirely of plastic with the rest of the
body made of steel so there is an
obvious color difference between the two
materials the plastic resembles more of
this arctic white while the steel panels
are a little bit more muted and have a
different shade of white you really have
to call a creep to notice the difference
but it is still worth mentioning and the
windowed side panel is very large
thankfully we don't have any fan
mounting options to ruin the aesthetics
but some might say it's a bit too low
and will show the power supply and all
the cabling so perhaps it's something to
rethink for coolermaster for future
designs and also we have some mesh on
the side to allow the hard drive cage
fan to pull in air and so for the front
panel we have a single 2.5 inch hot swap
drive a very welcoming feature that we
hope manufacturers would implement then
we have 9 54 inch drive base easily
removable from the front and very
importantly have built-in dust filters
and at the bottom of the CM storm
signature toolbox which includes the 3.5
inch mounting bracket along with some
accessories and an inked and extension
and moving back to the top this is where
all the panel connections are located
with your activity lights audio ports
USB ports two of which are USB 3 ready
and a recent button now the case also
has an integrated fan controller with
the large power button in the
along with the LED on and off switch and
speed adjustments the power button has a
bright red CM storm logo going through
it and the LEDs underneath determined
the speed of the fans and we have two
fans included for the front they are
white and have white LEDs to keep a
consistent color scheme and they can
also be switched on or off and the fan
controller supports up to six fans now
the case features a durable handle at
the top for easy transport which would
make it ideal for land events and an
occasional workout session and there's a
supporting handle at the back so you can
easily carry this thing with two hands
and handles are attached to the metal
frame and will hold anything up to 43
kilograms
looking in the back we have our usual
scene with water cooling holes exhaust
fan IO area 9 PCI slots plus an
additional storm guard security bracket
and the bottom mounted power supply now
the storm guard security bracket is this
anti-theft feature that lets you secure
your peripherals to the case for LAN
events and on-the-go gaming the other
side panel has additional venting to
allow the exhaust for the hard drive
cage fans and notice the side panel is
designed with cable management in mind
with additional space provided and every
user wants to keep his Hardware dust
free and the striker keeps us happy in
that department with dust filters on
every intake on the top at the back and
in the front and taking a look inside we
have an identical interior as with the
trooper we have two fans cooling your
drives and this is a module design so
you can rotate either one or both of the
cages to deliver airflow for the rest of
the internals now this type of airflow
is limiting if you have fan exhausting
through the side panel there is no
incoming airflow for the motherboard
area unless you have bottom intake fans
installed if you rotate the cage facing
inside then you'll have to deal with all
the additional cabling coming from your
drives so choose the compromise that
suits you best we also have an
additional driver rack for up to four
2.5 inch drives this is a very good way
to utilize the space but might be
difficult to wire the bottom drive and
if it's not something that you need it
is removable and allows dual one
20 male fans to be installed at the
bottom and with that a bottom 240 rod is
also supported and cable management
should come at ease with all these
rubber grommets and I really like the
oversized one at the bottom which makes
the initial process of wiring super easy
and looking in the back we get a bunch
of cable tie notches scattered all
around and an additional cut out at the
top which would come in handy for wiring
the top fans the drive brackets are also
standard nothing new here just simple
tools design snaps right in place and
allows two point five inch drives to be
installed in the center and the case
comes equipped with the top 200
millimeter fan for exhaust and supports
dual 120 or 140 millimeter fans as well
so you can install the second 240 rod at
the top for a sweet water cooling setup
unfortunately we can't have it also
notice the fans are practically touching
the motherboard standoffs so only the
standard 15 millimeter radiators are
supported and nothing thicker and since
you cannot install fans outside of the
frame push and pull configurations are
out of the window and when it comes to
GPU support we have about 13 inches to
work with so no need to worry in that
department and checking out the system
assembled the interior is spacious and
definitely allows for multi radiator
water cooling setup and master graphics
cards to be installed I've had no issues
doing any of the wiring and everything
cleans up pretty well the integrated fan
controller is welcomed especially if you
are going to water cool the side window
also allows a glance for the internals
and the carrying handle is a bonus and
might come in handy even if you don't
frequently travel with your PC however
there are some drawbacks to the striker
one starting with the color many will
notice the difference between the steel
and the plastic and those wanting to opt
out to the black version will miss out
on the windows side panel unless you
purchase that separately and secondly
having a hard drive cage fans facing the
backside panel will drastically limit
your airflow for the internals unless
you install bottomed fans and this being
a full tower I was expecting push and
pull support at the top which
unfortunately is not available but
having said that the CM storm striker is
very appealing if you require a portable
enthusiast enclosure if you don't mind
the white color and can work around
limiting airflow this may be a good
choice for you and we're giving you the
hardware canucks damn good a word and
that concludes our review for the CM
storm striker thanks guys for watching
and we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
