insanely innovative fantex our trusted
memory partner Corsair and NCIX
the original cyber wrapped Mouse from
Mad Catz won various awards over the
past five years for its modularity
elements and the unique aesthetics Auto
the looks are definitely polarizing you
either love it or hate it and over the
past five years we were told that Mad
Catz has been listening and quietly
planning developing patterns and waiting
for the right moment to strike and this
time at CES they have officially
released the second generation wrapped
the pro-x winning the CES 15 Innovation
Award there's a lot of game-changing
innovations here but the primary ones is
this mouse is inherently future proof
they have patented the ability to remove
and swap out the sensor therefore
ensuring that if there is a different
and a better sensor you can easily
upgrade that and you make that change
the rat Pro X also lives within the same
wheelhouse of the original meaning it's
insanely customizable where you can swap
out the parts replace with different
textures and shapes and etc to fit to
your hand better
there's even option for a lip over the
pinky to make it easier to lift the
mouse if that's how you like to use it
you can adjust the resistance of the
scroll wheel for example and even the
texture of the scroll wheel itself you
can swap out the teflon feet for a
ceramic the scroll wheel is also analog
so the slightest movements out left and
right can be registered could be used to
lean around the corners and game for
example visually the rat pro-x looks
like a sports car and the designers have
made it that way on purpose
it does who ever need some sort of color
change or perhaps different color
options included personal tastes will
defer and a lot of gamers want options
to match to other hardware and not
really stand out like a souped-up Honda
Civic now that being said looks are only
a part of the package and we look
forward to testing out the new rat Pro X
to its full extent so stay tuned for
more CES coverage and upcoming review of
this disruptive rat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
