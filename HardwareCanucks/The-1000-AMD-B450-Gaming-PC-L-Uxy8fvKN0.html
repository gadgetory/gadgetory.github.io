Hardwick in X and M Assad challenged us
to build a budget themed km EPC around
the be 450 platform essentially this
build should be able to game at 1080p
without a problem you should also be
able to do general productivity tasks as
well as a little bit of streaming so
it's really geared towards a you know an
all-in-one type of system that can do
pretty much everything that you divided
nothing to intensive something that's in
the middle ground when it comes to
productivity gaming and of course a
little bit of streaming as well so we
agree to that and as you can see I do
have it set up right behind me so let's
check it out right after this so you're
saying this is the most colorful way to
cool I'm telling you the master liquid
ml 360 our RGB is the way to go
cooler masters new 360 millimeter all in
one liquid cooler is all about
performance in style with the custom low
resistance radiator and dual chamber
pump wood sleeve tubing for that premium
look while being totally flexible the
fan strike your balance for air pressure
and airflow with transparent blades to
perfectly match the colorful combination
of the pump then you can sync via its
own controller or through various
addressable and 12-volt RGB connectors
alright perhaps you should check it out
in the scripture Milla all right so our
CPU of choice was the Rison 520 600 X
priced at $230 it's about 30 dollars
more than the 2600 but since it has a
TDP of 95 Watts versus 65 watts for the
2600 overclocking Headroom will be a
little bit better this is because things
like xf r2 and precision boost to will
take advantage of the additional power
Headroom the six core 12th fret design
may be a little bit overkill for games
but at the same time the intent for this
build is an all-around PC for work
streaming and gaming moving on to the
real foundation of this build meet the
MSI P 450 tomahawk and you can pick this
up for as low as $100 now I know that
pairing up a hundred dollar motherboard
with a $230 processor may sound a bit
crazy but hear me out for a second
because I think DB 450 lineup is
actually a lot better for these types of
rising to Bill's than the more expensive
x4 70 platform first and foremost the B
450 chipset only supports a single
GPU but at the same time in this price
range who is really going to be using
crossfire or SLI anyways past that AMD
has equipted with pretty much all the
same technology STX 470 just with a
little bit less connectivity all around
now this point in time you're probably
wondering why you should buy a B 450
motherboard over a B through 50 since
both technically support divides into
processors first and foremost is the new
chipsets compatibility with AMD's store
mi technology store mi allows you to
combine an SSD hard drive and part of
the system memory as local cache for a
very fast very efficient storage setup
think of it as obtained on steroids and
I'll be covering a head-to-head
comparison between Andy storm on
technology and until octane so
definitely stay tuned for that video
very soon now instead of simply updating
their B through 50 board msi took the be
450 tomahawk to a very different route
and that's why i ended up choosing it
for this build
other than the cool overall design which
looks absolutely amazing for $100 it
features a more extended pwm heatsink
design there's also finally a BIOS
flashback option which actually works
without a CPU or memory installed also
if things go wrong during the BIOS
update process it will simply allow you
to revert to an older version without
any issues probably the best thing about
B 450 is its ability to overclock reisen
processors now that might not sound like
news but remember the competing Intel H
370 which costs about the same amount of
money doesn't allow for any overclocking
at all which is disappointing the amount
of features you get for the price you
pay is pretty amazing as well for
example msi added USB 3.1 gen2 type A
and type C connectors on the rear i/o
there's an nvme m2 slot with access to
four PCI lanes for ultra fast storage
speeds and six fan headers placed at
pretty logical locations of course msyn
also added some onboard RGB lining and
compatibility with their mystic light
sync speaking of lighting if you want to
add some flair to your PC and by that I
meant by just adding some subtle RGB
lighting the NR max TBR TV fans are an
excellent addition they feature these
unique halo arc illuminations around the
frame that I'm personally a huge fan of
plus they can easily be saved to be an
msi so mystic lighting software which is
nice and remember this is just an option
so if you're willing to expand your
budget for this build
investing in some great RGB fence like
the NMX TB is something to consider for
memory I went with Corsairs 16 gigabyte
ddr4 vengence lpx modules rated at 2400
megahertz
now these guys go for around $150 and
it's refreshing to go with something a
non RGB and low profile it also matches
the B 450 tomahawk board really well
because I do want to mention the speed
of this memory module because it is at
24 hour megahertz and while it can be
overclocked to a more respectable 2666
megahertz Rison does perform a little
bit better with faster memory saving
some money and going with a 24 hundred
megahertz kit and then overclocking a
bit might be a good option alright so
for storage I chose the Toshiba RC 100
240 gigabyte and vme SSD this little guy
cost less than $80 and sports read
speeds well about 1.6 gigabytes per
second and writes over a gigabyte per
second again for $80 and that's
incredible considering that there are
SATA base SSDs in the market for that
price now for story my game library I
threw in a one terabyte Western Digital
caviar hard drive which should do the
trick
but I did find a 2 terabyte 5400 rpm
hard drive on Amazon for around $60
which is about the same price as the one
terabyte drive now onto the graphics
card which is the most exciting part and
I went with MSI's RX 580 mech a gigabyte
OC now this thing is designed for better
cooling over the reference based models
the OC mode allows you to achieve core
clock speeds as far as 13 90 megahertz
with memory clock speeds over 8000
megahertz it features dual Torx 2.0 fans
for effectively cooling the six
millimeter copper heat pipes located
underneath a large heatsink the fans
stop spinning completely when the GPU
temps are below 60 C giving users the
flexibility when it comes to acoustic
performance you also get a solid brushed
aluminum backplane with some aggressive
design elements and the led logo on the
side is RGB so you can control that
through MSI's gaming app powering the
whole system is Corsairs CX 515
non-modular PSU with an 80 plus bronze
certification for $50 this should be
more than enough to power the 2600 X and
the RX 5 80 plus it does have a little
bit of room
upgradability down the road now given
that this is a non modular unit you're
pretty much stuck with the cables that
come with it so if you're looking to go
a bit beyond the budget we have over
here to maybe add some visual elements
to your build cable montz basic mod flex
extension kits will be an excellent
addition as it's simply an extension
rather than a full kit for the psu plus
around $35 it comes in a variety of
color options so that's pretty awesome
the case of choice for this build is the
fantex p300 mid tower ATX enclosure for
$60 I think it's an awesome buy because
it comes with a tempered glass side
panel a separate power supply shoutout
RGB lighting integrations clean interior
designed to work with and personally
speaking I really like its relatively
compact form factor I went with the
black and white Berrien which is priced
a little bit higher than the standard
edition but you're really not losing
anything in terms of features aside from
the color options so that's nice well
now that we've taken a look at the parts
list here's a little montage of me
putting together the entire PC
and here is the final build in all its
glory I'm actually really happy with the
way how this turned out working the fan
tech speed 300 case is an absolute
breeze you're really not gonna have any
issues with cable management because I
certainly didn't experience any of them
whatsoever routing them to inside the
main chamber they do have separate
cutouts so that's great the wine
interior does a really good job
showcasing debe 450 tomahawk motherboard
from hem si what's really cool about
this wine interior that's inside the PT
around a case is that it diffuses the
ambient lighting on the motherboard
really well so I really like that also
shout-out to fantex for including a
subtle RGB element right between the
tempered glass panel and the separate
power supply shroud it just completes
the whole built in my opinion and looks
fantastic I mean you can just literally
take a look at it behind me it looks
great I absolutely love the way how this
looks so having looked at this PC we
obviously have to talk about performance
so why don't we get into that now
initially I decided to go with the stock
cooler that came with the Rison 2600 X
but for my previous reviews in the past
I did mention that if you want to
squeeze a little bit of performance by
overclocking the chip or if you do
intend to plan some overclocking for the
2600 X you're actually much better off
investing in an aftermarket cooling
solution so I decided to swap the stock
cooler with thermal takes flow ring to
40 millimeter a i/o cooler and not only
does it come with a high performance
waterblock sleeve tubing's
but it also has RGB lighting so if you
do want to add lighting to your system
without investing in LED strips or under
goal lighting this is a good way to save
cost on that end but it also squeezes a
little bit of performance out of the
2600 X the to 120 millimeter high static
pressure fans come with this beautiful
frame elimination that looks very subtle
and sleek and interestingly this kit
also works with Amazon Alexa talk about
controlling fan speeds
their voice that's pretty cool anyways
back to performance and I managed to
overclock the 2600 X to four point one
two five gigahertz at one point four to
five volts using rising master software
the memory speed also was set to twenty
four hundred megahertz given that this
is an inexpensive rise incompatible kid
I ran a few synthetic tests comparing
stock versus overclock settings to see
if there is a difference and I shouldn't
be expecting but let's take a look
kicking things off with Cinebench r15 at
stock settings we got a score of 1300
and with chip or clocked at four point
one two five gigahertz we got us a bump
on that score by seventy six points
which isn't too bad but I'll take that
any time of the day next up with blender
rendering the BMW seen at stock settings
the system took 6 minutes and 12 seconds
to complete it compared to 5 minutes and
39 seconds with the overclock moving on
to some productivity and I mean I did
really push this chip really hard with
4k editing so I rendered a 12 minute 4k
project with GS 5 footage and its stock
saying so system took 24 minutes and 51
seconds compared to 23 minutes and 50
seconds with the overclocked so you're
really gonna be saving only a minute
which isn't too much but at least did
something and now on to some gaming
performance starting off with 3d mark
firestrike the system scored 12,000 8:04
with stock settings compared to 12,000
8:44 with the overclock again very
similar performance
moving on to battlefield 1 at 1080p set
to ultra settings we pretty much saw
similar results while being I did
experience a little bit of a frame drop
with the overclock and then we have
overwatch at 1080p set 2 epic settings
again same results here with both
settings averaging well over a hundred
and ten frames per second our last test
here is doom at 1080p set to ultra using
the Vulcan API and as you can see once
again we're seeing similar results with
both of stock and overclocked settings
averaging well over 145 frames per
second CP temperatures were respectable
at stock sinks with the stock cooler the
2600 ex ran at 34 C idle and 75 C under
load but with the overclock using the
Thermaltake float lee iacocca 2600 ex
ran around 74 degrees celsius under load
and 46 degree Celsius during idle now we
want to add some peripherals to complete
this setup and we chose MSI's GK 40
vigor gaming combo set and this comes
with a basic RGB membrane
keyboard and of course the basic Mouse
it gets a job done and for $65 we've we
thought that there was a perfect fit for
this build and when you put together the
parts list on Amazon at the time of
making this video including an operating
system and of course the msi a
peripheral scent you're looking at
around just a tad about thousand dollars
which is actually a really good system
or i guess a good setup for the price do
note that this is excluding the thermal
take a iook cooler when you add that
factor in you're looking at just a
little bit over $1300 for our canadian
audience memory express is a place to go
for home business and gaming electronics
you can try before you buy especially
great for peripherals by visiting one of
their stores in winnipeg Calgary or
Greater Vancouver and more they do
custom pcs and will beat any Canadian
price guarantee and that about wraps up
this bill video hope you guys enjoyed
let me know what you guys think about
the components have chosen for this
particular PC also what do you guys
think about the way how it looks are you
a fan of it are you not a fan of it love
