great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Harbor
Canucks and inside my workstation
machine I am running this this is the
Kraken x61 from NZXT this is an
all-in-one liquid cooler this is a 280
millimeter radiator now this cooler is
bundled up with a cam software from NZXT
that allows you to change the hue on the
pump here allows you to to develop
different fan profiles with curves for
the fan speeds depending on the
temperature of the CPU the damper
depending on the temperature of the
liquid but also gives you some
monitoring abilities of your components
and your hardware but n60 is rolling out
with the cam 2.0 a new version software
that brings when you boost a bunch of
excellent monitoring abilities that we
did not see with the previous cam
version and in this video we'll be
taking a look at that so first let's
outline what the previous over the
original cam software is like and then
we want to camp 2.0 to see exactly what
other improvements we got all right so
here's the original cam software this is
the version 1.2 point for the main gripe
I have with this is that you cannot
resize the window so you cannot make it
bigger because all these modules are
pretty small you can collapse these
modules as you can see but that's kind
of pointless like the specifications
window you know you have to scroll down
to see everything and go into the
Advanced Mode for some reason you lose
out on RAM and storage stuff so you have
to go back to the basic mode to see that
here you can see the temperature of the
CPU and the GPU you can cycle between
those easily with color-coded
temperatures and you can go into
Fahrenheit and the load usage shows the
top five load intensive applications and
the cam software happens to be one of
the most Ram heavy tasks within my
application when things are an idle so
it's actually consuming about 160
megabytes of RAM that is pretty high for
not doing anything and the graphs that
you see beside there are pretty
pointless because well first of all
they're tiny you can't really compare or
use that information for competitive
says you can cycle between the temporal
scales the mins are hours days weeks and
months I'm not sure why months is there
and that's a little bit too much I think
but it gives you a little bit
information on what's happening within
your Hardware within your machine these
are not logged so you cannot take this
information out you know put it into
Excel and make your own graphs and
compare this information if you're doing
some review on something so this is
strictly for visual aesthetics you know
it is kind of pointless in that regard
and heading them to the Krakken control
panel the most important thing here are
the custom fan curves you have the
preloaded silent and performance mode
the custom mode where a fan speed can be
changed in five percent increments and
the manual mode with constant fan speed
here you can also select LED color with
breathing blinking mode and
unfortunately user color selection does
not accurately translate to desired hue
on the pump and so aside from just
creating my custom fan curves and just
monitoring the temperature I guess
because it is right there visually I did
not utilize any of the other features
built in like the graphs never really
look at them because they are pointless
to me in the forms of comparative
analysis and they're quite tiny and the
same thing with the specifications and
the notifications as well that don't
really say anything or help me change my
workflow or how I use my machine all
right
booting up cam 2.0 let's see what we
have so it's a loading pretty quickly
unfortunately for some reason it is no
longer displayed in the notification
menu so here it is they've done a
complete redesign overhaul on the UI and
it looks slightly better I think
but they've still stuck around with that
sort of limiting window but check this
out expandable window oh yeah so in the
explained window you can go into the
advanced sort of expand that
unfortunately this is this is as big is
going to get you cannot expand it
vertically nor horizontally
you can't collapse it further but that
fine
pointless it would be nice if you could
make this in your entire window or at
least explain this window vertically so
you can see all these graphs but we'll
get that in a second so first of all GPU
CPU temperatures and load very useful
you can go and change the mode on the
crack and cooler right away with a
little drop-down menu so good silent
mode save and it shows you the liquid
temperature fan speed rpm of the pump
and the fans very nice down here you can
collapse this advanced window which
shows your CPU GPU motherboard RAM HDD
and net and you can also pop this window
out for a little bit of extra
information on the stats for the CPU the
GPU and that's one thing NZXT really
wanted to dive down into giving users a
bit more flexibility and lots of
flexibility but information on their
entire system
I guess it's somewhat useful where you
have the minimum and maximum and the
current which is kind of nice
unfortunately no averages which would be
really nice to see as well and that's
one thing that n60 wants to do is they
want to hear your input on the software
so if you have any suggestions on what
should be included or what should be
taken out out of this latest came 2.0
release please leave it in the comments
below
coming back to the whole issue on what
the original software was kind of
lagging is the whole logging information
I want to be able to start logging and
have everything input into a notepad
file and then I could later that import
that into Excel to make my own graphs
why can't they do that NZXT please give
us this option and I say this because
these graphs are again very pointless
sure you can click on them to reveal the
little bit extra so the graphs is
slightly enlarged you can go back and
kind of cool is shows through the top
applications for that time period which
is nice so it's all obvious for a for
right now as I'm recording with OBS you
still have the temporal scales of
minutes hours and days finally or thank
you for removing the weeks
months I think that was kind of
pointless but here you can see minimum
and maximum very nice as well
CPU statistics CPU load CPU load I think
the little pointless shows you the five
top load intensive tasks at the moment I
don't like the whole idea of scrolling
here I would like to have this graph
window as a standalone window on its own
that I can resize that would be give me
a little bit more flexibility knowing
what information I want to receive out
of these graphs and not be locked down
to this tiny window that I have to
actually scroll in I'm not super happy
about that you go onto the GPU same idea
shows you the GPU temperatures and load
and most I guess intensive applications
for that time period
motherboard temperatures voltages and
the fan rpm Ram that's kind of cool I
guess
it would be cool to see how much RAM is
being utilized if I am rendering a video
for example and give you the load but
like I said again is long you cannot
blog it it's kind of useless hard drive
activity so because I have I believe
seven drives installed inside the system
I have to cycle between these arrows in
order to get to my preferred drive
activity and I don't want to do that I
want to be able to open that as a
standalone window and monitor each
single hard drive based on whatever I'm
doing if I'm doing any testing on seeing
what type of load is being processed or
being handled by certain drive because I
have certain drives as cache drives and
going back to the net well they go again
giving you download upload speeds on
into Perl basis one thing NZXT really
want to bring out is more detailed
specifications and you can see that with
this pop-up window and the advanced
dashboard where it's giving you all the
information on the CPU on the GPU let's
scroll down here
maxie DP is zero watts well I guess it
hasn't really updated the information on
the tight necks yet motherboard Ram
as giving you timings on the rain now
which is something that was not
available in the previous version hard
drive activity so HDD so I have seven
yep so all them and is giving you free
space a new space again kind of
pointless as a static statistic see what
I did there however it would be cool if
you could log it or have an actual
graphical representation of that space
and whatever and top apps CPU and RAM
top apps and one thing that also cam 160
wanted to do with cam is reduce its load
intensity on Ram and looks like they've
done that exactly that actually let's
see what's being what is it it's
occupying right now so we are on cam
software which is here so it is still
utilizing about 140 megabytes of RAM
which is still quite a bit but I am
running this software I'm not really
doing anything with it so it's pretty
much on idle and well it is open but
still 100 then closed 150 megabytes of
RAM it's still quite a lot ok so going
through specifications here we have my
my image that I've inputted earlier
because I have an account online and it
kind of sinks that information here we
have the advanced again going back to
the specification kind of showing you
what you saw on this window going to
Krakens this is what where things are
nice and important however one major
gripe I have with this well first of all
you still have the performance mode in
the silent mode you have the manual mode
which adjusts the faint speed and this
in the linear format but if you go into
custom profile you can only adjust the
fans well you still you can still adjust
them in five percent increments but you
can only adjust them up to 55 degrees
Celsius on the temperature so you cannot
manually adjust the CPU for the fan
speed if your CPU is above 55 degrees
which i think is limiting because about
55 degrees it automatically boosts the
fans to 100%
and my CPU right now is hovering around
50 degrees Celsius on idle so whenever
I'm rendering something and my CPU goes
over 60 degrees Celsius
my fans automatically start to ramp up
to 100% that's not okay I want to have
the flexibility to have to adjust my fan
speed all the way up to 100% for that
extra because it's a custom profile let
me do my custom profile in zxd so I just
kind of leave it in silent mode which
looks like here it goes up to about C
that's one thing you don't have the
precise measurements within percentages
and that's kind of annoying but it goes
up to I think this would be 70% faint
speed whatever
yeah 70% fan speed and liquid
temperature so it looks like the sound
profile gives you a little bit more of a
curve to accommodate for high
temperatures while reducing the fan
speed then you can save the changes here
here you can change the color of the hue
no longer do you get that nice gradient
customization but you can go here and
choose the different color and actually
found out that the color accuracy based
on what you select in the software and
based on what pops up on the actual pump
is very accurate so the color that you
see on the screen now is the exactly the
same color that is being right now
showcased on the pump you can go into
alternating which will cycle between the
standard and the alternating color and
within the interval that is being
specified up to ten seconds you can set
blinking LED blinking LED is really kind
of useless it just goes back and forth
there's no gradient and you can also
turn it off and the last thing is the
settings so you can manage your account
online because everything is synced up
you now have an Android app where you
can view all these specifications or
through your smart phone going to the
cam software you can actually change the
image of the UI so everything that you
see here right now can be changed to
give you recommended dimensions for that
image and maximum file size whatever
change of English changing language in
the interface accent color so I have it
on tour
because I think that complements the
blue very well but you can see if I
change it to green and I Save Changes
you can see exactly what aspects of the
UI are changed and change of color and I
think that's very nice you can all start
cam and start minimized in notifications
this is where you can have a cam notify
you with a pop-up whenever things hit
the certain temperature you can disable
notifications I think this is useful
especially because you have the
flexibility and adjusting the dials for
those temperatures and overlay this is
cool because now you get overlay through
cam that you can disable and enable at
the same time with the FPS average FPS
resolution memory CPU GPU and effects
effects as vsync and msaa
things like that that can be enabled so
they're visually on the visible on the
on the screen you can change the color
of the text I kept a yellow because it's
the most visible right now you can
change the font type you can change the
font even and then scale font with
resolution which is very nice and change
the position of that overlay so going
back into the dashboard I think what
they've done here is an improvement over
what was available before it is a
complete UI overhaul and I like the
direction they've gone now no longer
though you can select for a Fahrenheit
temperature something that you were able
to change within the previous version of
cam you can still access all the fan
profiles and fan curves and especially
in the custom profile I don't like how
you are only able to change anything up
to 55 degrees Celsius on the temperature
I want to have full flexibility of that
but it is what it is for now and this is
cam 2.0 and NZXT really relies on
feedback from the community
based on all the things that are being
provided and one thing that I don't know
if they've addressed is multiple Krakens
in your system because that would be a
very big thing to fix if you have
multiple Krakens on your system having a
visual representation of whether or not
you're modifying the fan curves for the
u1u Krakens versus another crack and
that would be great but for now this has
been Kim 2.0 overview and it just
launched today so if you if you own a
crack and compatible or if you want to
crack and cooler and download the
software play around with it let us know
what you think and leave a comment down
below of what you should like to see
changed or modified so thank you so much
for watching this brief overview or not
brief but more of a detailed overview of
the software if you'd like to see more
videos like this leave in the comment
below thanks so much for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
