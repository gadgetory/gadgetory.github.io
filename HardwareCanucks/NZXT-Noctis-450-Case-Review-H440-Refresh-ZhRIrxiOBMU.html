great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
higher canucks and if you have been on
the edge waiting to see a new release
from NZXT like I have since CES then you
are in luck because today NZXT launched
the noctis 450 released at $139 they are
competing directly with the end Dulux
from fantex
in this price range and since the frame
is identical to the h4 40 that is $20
cheaper the noctus 450 may find itself
in a tough spot but let's see what makes
this case so special
all right so I had to do that because
the n450 reminds me of a Batmobile with
its dynamic angular front and top panels
the stealthy matte black paint job
covering the entire case and the
interior as well with excellent uniform
coating and the combination of these
floating panels and mesh to really give
off this armored feel to the case and
knowing NZXT this is exactly up there
Valley in terms of structure although I
am confused a little bit as to why not
just release this under the Phantom line
as it shares a very similar exterior
design language these floating panels
allow for better airflow without
sacrificing on the design as they are
spaced out from the mesh and just to
iterate once again the inside of the
case is identical to the h4 40 so we
won't be seeing any surprises but they
have added an under glow soft LED system
that is red on the black version and
blue on the white and it looks awesome
especially in the dark the NZXT text on
the power supply shroud is also backlit
in red to tie in with this whole color
scheme and the rear i/o area at the
motherboard along with PCI slots have
blue illumination that I wish was red
that can be turned on and off
along with cycling between enabling the
bottom lighting and the NZXT text as
well up top we have four USB ports audio
jacks notice there is no reset button
the power button however has this red
illumination and the same coating as the
rest of the exterior which is awesome to
see for the case to truly stay in
character removing the front panel we
have a proper magnetic dust filter
spending the three 120 mil intake fans
it's nice to see that these are included
with dual 140 member fan options
available as well to allow users to
install radiators up to 360 millimeters
removing the top panel we can install
triple 120mm fans here or dual 140
millimeters an identical setup to the
front and because of the added height of
the top panel only the two rear fans can
be installed above the frame and it
would actually be great for NZXT to
modify the curve on the top panel to
allow that third fan at
runt to fit above the frame as well the
side panel window reveals a lot of the
interior although I kinda wish it was
the standard rectangular shape as we
found on the age of 40 but to also be
careful with it it scratches easily
coming to the back and removal power
supply dust filter is included there are
seven PCI slots and the 140 mm fan
included for exhaust with flexible
mounting strips so giving you a total of
four fans inside the N 450 so you'll be
fine and dandy with default cooling
configuration I love that all the
removable pieces have stationary thumb
screws that allows convenient
reinstallation of both side panels the
power supply bracket at the back with
seamless installation from the rear and
each of the five metal drive caddies
have the thumb screws to that when
installed they're adequately spaced out
between each other they'll allow airflow
to enter while being cooled at the same
time internally on top of the power
supply shroud are two extra dedicated
SSD brackets that allow you to showcase
your fast drives and cable routing comes
with no problem at all even though the
interior is pretty compact and it feels
that way because of the built-in drive
cage frame all the cutouts around the
motherboard allow for clean cable
management and I do appreciate the extra
cutout for micro ATX motherboards but
NZXT you're charging us $140 for a case
and we would love to see rubber grommets
on all the cutouts please of course
considering this price point now I
consider cable management inside this
frame noob friendly it's a great setup
for cable tie hoops although not much
space is left between the side panel and
the rear of the motherboard but you have
all this room in front of the power
supply to just stash away all that mess
and right above is a PWM fan hub with
eight ports and I love how everything
can be just controlled directly from the
motherboard and I'd love to see these
hubs roll out on as many cases in the
future the noise dampening foam has been
removed from the backside panel as was
found on h4 40 allowing it to close
without needing to apply your whole body
weight to squish all those cables I find
that a positive and so to me the Noctis
450 represents a push for NZXT to really
target more of a gaming centric
out with its award-winning frame from
the H 440 and the ability to charge that
premium based on the new exterior panels
and lighting that I so wish was RGB for
proper build customization but I
honestly think that the price point
should have been in line with the H 440
because unless you see the value and the
under glow LED the H 440 is still an
outstanding option giving you an almost
identical system potential so what do
you guys think of the Noctis 450 that is
the new frame design suit your
preference and would you consider the
premium worth it over the H 440 let us
know in the comments below as always
