Hardware Canucks but also another show
called boot sequence you guys should
should check it out yeah you're gonna
link it rank will be right over there or
link will be right over there as well
snows has been an iOS user lifetime user
for the better part of 11 years yep and
so in this video we're gonna be going
through his experience switching to an
Android phone for the last you know
month and a half we're almost two months
mm-hm and so we're gonna talk about that
stuff but what's really interesting is
we handed him a one +62 kind of you know
see what the experience is going to look
like and coincidentally that phone right
now costs about the same as the iPhone 7
plus which he was rocking right before
the 60 the 7 plus is about 789 dollars
or something like that for a 32 gigabyte
Varian whereas the 60 is about the same
price but you get 256 gigs of storage so
let's listen to snows experience
switching to Android gonna go over some
of the positives and negatives but first
a quick message from our sponsor the new
Razer Blade still defines portability
without compromising on performance
featuring Intel's latest agency PU and
NVIDIA MX 150 GPU up to 16 gigabytes of
memory and up to 13 hours of battery
life experience some of the most popular
games wherever you are learn more about
the blade stealth down below all right
so before we let's nose get him play
positive and negative experience
switching to the Android operating
system why don't we let him set the
stage as to what his old smartphone
history has been since day 1 so I
already owned an Android phone ok - in
fact for about 5 days combined I started
with the HTC magic which my brother took
back after 2 days and then I decided to
get my own smartphone which was a
samsung I forgot what the name of it was
but it didn't have it had a touch screen
that was pressure sensitive it wasn't
like touch sensitive like all these
smart phones these days so I returned it
- and I got my first iPhone which was
the 3G that point it was just
snowballing from there 3GS four 4s 5 5 s
6 6 s and now the 7 plus so that way you
guys sort of have an idea of snow has
been basically on the iOS bandwagon for
the better part of 11 years alright so
how was the transfer
to Android honestly it was quite easy it
was it was really quick using Google
Drive all I had to do was you know check
calendars check the the contacts and
boom all the information about me not
all the information to contacts and the
photos were automatically syncing on my
oneplus device now talk about the
storage space situation on iOS and
Google yeah so actually with iOS iCloud
only grants you 5 gigabytes of storage
whereas on Google Drive you get 15 right
away which I thought was really
interesting you also have a better tier
system I don't understand why Apple goes
from 5 gigabytes to 50 to 200 oh ok it's
like if I have 128 gigabyte phone I'm
probably gonna need somewhere around 100
gigabytes of storage of iCloud storage
whereas goggle offers 15 100 and 200
which is more reasonable in my opinion
so you said that the transfer process
was fairly simple but there are some
there were some issues which we'll
definitely get to later on the video but
what has the whole UI looked like I mean
getting to getting access to certain
apps or getting you know to the settings
menu like walk me through it was great I
mean now that I'm used to it it's
amazing but it's honestly super fluid
it's great like it there's not that big
of a difference between this and iOS but
you can still very easily find
everything that you need for example the
settings it's a little more confusing
but there's such a degree of
customization it's incredible like if
you go into the battery tab you don't
have just like show percentages and
turnoff percentages right have like all
of those things that you can do like
optimize your battery life optimize the
yeah that's pretty much it but but tell
me what you did for the first three days
on the sick like when you were using the
60 yeah so I'm now proud of that because
you guys need to listen to this yeah so
when I got that one plus 60 I was like
wow this is so customizable and I knew
that Android was like super customizable
so I thought wouldn't it be a great idea
if I just took Android and turned it
into iOS and trust me this was the worst
thing I've ever
done in my whole life yeah so he tried
everything from icon packs to themes to
basically replicate what you know an iOS
device would look like on the 6e and you
even used an iOS fiend Kaiba a keyboard
what's called cheater keyboards cause
the keyboard we hearts or something if
you go through that like you got as
you're seeing it just is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my
life
not only that but it has ads which is
just I mean come on the keyboard has ads
yep that makes no sense to me I mean it
is what it is but thankfully Eber showed
me how to properly use G board yeah
because now you can actually set borders
the more style if you want to have that
as an option
Eber set me up with a nice hello cutie
keyboard which is just great I mean you
happen to love it too so customization
is certainly present on an indeed so
what other things did you like about the
switch well one of the things that I
really liked was the gesture controls
and there's a few of them and I don't
know if it's specific to one plus so one
of them is for example when your phone
is completely off on a table well not
off but asleep on the table you can
double tap and it will automatically
wake up the screen another thing is the
gesture controls where you can draw
something on your screen and it will
automatically do something for example I
could turn on my flashlight by drawing
envy and other things like that that
that is a one plus specific feature so
that's pretty cool you know one of the
interesting things that I caught just
looking at snows homescreen was the fact
that it looks completely different from
the way how I use my device like as you
guys are looking at this shot right here
looks totally different you can say it
okay you can say it yours is all
minimalist well Pro and mine is a mess
but I respect it because if you value
getting access like if you want to get
access to the apps as fast as you can
and if you want it right there it's
right there and sure it's a pretty full
homescreen but I I like I like the
cleaner side of things so clean see you
know what I'm dirty
no no this Ottoman it's just it's just
Anna again it's all subjective thing I
mean you guys probably have a different
setup than both of us so again it's a
subjective thing but I certainly found
that too
be quite interesting okay so now let's
move on to the negative aspects of
switching to Android let's start with
with the things that you lost
let's yeah let's stop with that so the
transfer was super quick and easy okay
but I lost my messages I lost all of my
apps all my purchases which is to be
expected but it's still something that
you have to leave behind yeah so so for
instance on the messages side of things
you now have no well you can't really
access what you were used to on the
iMessage up within iOS
yeah because that's its own entity
exactly whereas with well for instance
on whatsapp at the same story - you can
retrieve your backup messages on Android
mm-hmm so that sucks so you lose all of
that which means you have to start from
scratch or if you need to refer back you
- off - you have to boot up your iOS
device and go through that again so that
is kind of unfortunate I'm still gonna
say that there is a way to transfer the
messages but it's just way too
complicated and not something that I
want to get into so Eber there's another
thing that I told you that I didn't like
but you absolutely love is that right
yep
so the notifications I know don't don't
don't get riled up okay
notifications are pretty similar between
the two between iOS and Android
they both group okay that's right but
iOS puts the most the newest messages or
the newest notifications at the top
Android doesn't does not why I don't
like it it doesn't make any sense to me
if I receive a text message I want to
see it right on the top with all of the
ignored messages under it I'm not saying
it's terrible I mean I can find much of
my way into it it's just that you know
it's the convenience you swipe down and
you want to see the newest thing right
in front of you and I don't so there's
another thing that I don't quite like
which is the Google assistant it is
superior right mm-hmm Eber uses it but
he doesn't use it the way I do and
there's things that I can do with iOS
that I can't with Android especially
related to when the phone is locked when
the phone is locked
I can ask my iPhone to do a lot of
things like play my podcasts play my
music and all these kinds of things and
it will do it but on Android as soon as
I ask
hey can you play the podcast it's gonna
say yeah no problem and then it's gonna
ask you to unlock your phone I don't
deploy the reason why I'm asking you to
do it is because I don't want to unlock
my phone so that was one thing that was
definitely frustrating so one thing that
I noticed when I was making the
transition between iPhone and Android
was that I had my iPhone still right it
was still with me and my notifications
were coming in on the iPhone about 1 to
10 minutes faster than on Android and at
the start I was really perplexed as as
to what was happening and it turns out
that there's actually it's actually
because of the battery optimization I
had to UM eyes all of my apps that this
is what it is lame most of your
frequently used apps okay I use dating
apps okay yes I date so so so frequently
used apps and that way he would receive
notifications as fastly can and it can
get back to them so so you know it is a
good point okay so you talked about some
of the positives and negatives for
switching to an Android operating system
and that's normal because switching
platforms isn't easy it certainly gets
some time getting used to I'm sorry
about the fact that you had to lose your
messages and all that stuff but I didn't
lose my matches okay
I decide that but regardless now let's
talk about the hardware because he's
been rocking the oneplus 64 you know
almost two months and it's a great phone
I would still recommend this any time of
the day so let's talk about your
positive and negative experience of the
hardware by itself as my first Android
phone I can truly say that it's amazing
I mean you get a huge screen with a
small tear drop notch which I have
deactivated you have a beautiful like
the cameras are really nice and I'm at a
point where I personally think that all
phone cameras kind of look the same it's
just small differences here and there
the alert slider is definitely welcome
the screen once again AMOLED it's
beautiful gorgeous and everything
speakers oh it's super loud it which is
a good thing I mean the fidelity it's a
phone speaker right but it's super loud
I cannot sleep through an alarm which is
brand new to me something else that I
absolutely love is the battery life I
mean this thing will last me two days is
that was that because he
before me yeah why is it I can
completely validated it because I've got
the same battery usage as well the
iPhone I could not last longer than 24
hours and 24 hours was pretty much
pushing it sure I've had it for three
years but it still says that the battery
is performing well enough on the oneplus
man two days and I just plug it in for
like 30 minutes clip-clop and that's it
yeah thanks too fast George but there
are also other things that I don't quite
like about the hardware and you know one
of them and you've actually went to a
store tried to pay by using in
fingerprint scanner on a bun and it's
been work and it was the same experience
for me I really thought it was just even
maybe he had some weird finger but no it
takes a long time to recognize my finger
and sometimes it just doesn't and I have
to use the cold unlock which I mean
we're in 2018 this shouldn't exist in
have you tried face unlock though yes I
have it's way too fast I don't even have
to look at the phone the phone could be
on its way to in front of my face and it
would unlock instantly so it's
definitely not a secure method it's just
that if you have a girlfriend don't buy
this 60 also didn't you mention
something about the camera shutter lag
yeah so iPhones are notorious for being
super quick on the trigger when you
press the shutter button boom you have
the photo but it's a lot slower on the
oneplus 60 and what I mean a lot it's
not an actual lot it's like a few frames
but it does make a difference we don't
try and take a picture here's the
ultimate question would you go back to
an iPhone of course not
Oh actually I absolutely loved my time
with Android and I would not go back to
our phones for two very specific reason
the first one is Android it seems to be
where all the innovation is you have you
know pop-up cameras you have Swing Out
cameras you have whole phones that sort
of slide you have folding phones phones
with screens in the front and the back
all these things that you'll never see
on an iPhone or at least it's gonna take
years before you see them and I would
like my whole experience to be sort of
based around Android so I never have to
worry about making the switch again the
second reason is the price iPhones are
getting way to expand
like we said these two phones are
exactly the same price
except that even there this one is three
years old okay it's 789 and you're
getting 32 gigabytes of memory I have
128 but you're getting 32 gigabytes of
memory for 800 bucks and this you're
getting what 256 there's a storage 256
gigabytes of storage what is it 6 8 6 8
gigabytes of RAM yeah something like
that it's just an insanely powerful
phone for the price and prices by the
way are Canadian so that's definitely
something to consider obviously it's
more expensive for the Canadians I'm
gonna be like $3 u.s. yeah that's that's
basically it's just a bit but it is an
interesting point because if you look at
the android market in general there's a
phone for everyone out there at a
specific price point whereas if you
switch over to the iOS side it's just
one or probably the base line is the
iPhone ten-hour that's which is still
expensive if you're in Canada it's
$1,000 well welcome to Team Android well
thank you very much hello everyone
Android people also the Apple people I
worked there for four years I know I
appreciate the Brad I appreciate the
phones but you know for a fact that the
Apple fanboys are gonna go all downloads
videos yeah but you know what like it's
it's an expensive phone it's the only
drawback that I see well I hope you guys
enjoyed this video definitely let us
know what you think in the comments down
below stay tuned for more content
