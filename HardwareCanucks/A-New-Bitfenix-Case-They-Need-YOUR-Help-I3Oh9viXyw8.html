Phoenix boobs actually we haven't
checked out anything from beat Phoenix
in a while but this one should be
interesting I hope you guys enjoy this
one but first huge thanks to Thermaltake
color master and fantex for making this
trip possible alright so what we are
showing here today is the new answer
case so if you guys recall the original
and so I had this completely sort of
like blocked off front panel so it's it
was quite popular because of the looks
it was $79 it was $79 that's right so
$79 enclosure with tempered glass and
was quite beautiful because of all this
RGB but of course they got some flak man
cuz look at this it just don't go in
alright so they were like obviously we
got to do something about it and they
were like hey and so much so this one is
the new one it is only five dollars more
expensive which is obviously it's
totally acceptable it's not a totally
new tooling they just had to redesign
the front mesh a little bit because
before we had the two dust filters for
the bottom two fans the top fan was just
left alone but now we have the entire
dust filter so they were like ah that is
the way to go my friends
so here the mesh is actually quite nice
from this side it doesn't look like mesh
because it has the it's quite dense so
actually almost feels like it's a solid
piece but then you've come to the front
and then boo surprise RGB LEDs shining
right through of course only if you have
the RGB fans installed as usual as the
original it comes with two fans and
they're unsure yet where to put the RGB
fan that I think will be addressable
because they just announced new fans but
yeah this is the answer mesh just fixing
the front panel so that the airflow is
of course better in my interview or what
I don't know what are you doing I'm
gonna talk about the case alright I'll
be out of my way then peace out
k-town
ah what do we do alright so this is
going to be the feedback piece alright
so just get out that keyboard warrior
soul out of you and hammer on those keys
because we need your feedback all right
this is the new case it's called the
Fujian fusion fusion alright from
BitFenix so basically they want to know
what you guys want to see a new case and
so they they kind of compiled all the
all outdated frame design things in here
and basically want to know what they
should they should keep alright so the
main focus for this fusion case they're
telling us would be airflow so they want
to put the mesh on the front and they
want to hear what type of design for the
mesh that you would like guys like to
see so either completely exposed so you
can see everything internally if let's
say you have an RGB fan you can see that
all the way or they can have this like
middle section piece that covers up that
RGB and it's not like really in your
face they do have an addressable RGB LED
at the top over here but there you can
count the LED so it's not exactly
ambient I hope they will fix it so that
the the lighting illumination is better
they have included a new TG panel so
it's a simple thing where it kind clips
on them in the front and removes from
the back via thumb screws so that's
awesome now on the interior this is the
something that I want your guys opinion
about because I've told them what I
think and I want you to do the same all
right so the main idea what the fujian
case is that like I said airflow so
front mesh design they're still gonna
figure out how to make that's the whole
thing happen but it will be a lower
price point at $79 versus the end so
mesh so it kind of like almost competing
with each other and if this case doesn't
offer anything totally unique versus the
end so why would you go with something
like this so potentially they're
thinking of a lower price point and this
is something I told them you know why
does the case have to be so long
especially when the motherboard is owned
the ATX support EA TX is not supported
the motherboard grommets are not wide
enough to accommodate ehe X because that
motherboard will totally cover that
section and
example even if you had the ATX
motherboard in here supported what they
gonna do with this whole space you know
air flow it doesn't you're not you don't
get improved air flow by having a longer
case you actually get better air flow if
the case was slightly shorter so that
the fans are closer to the components at
least that's what I think but if you are
delivering us a long case like it then
you should probably utilize that space
for something else like hard drive cages
potentially longer motherboards or have
a little protrusion on that section so
you can populate and hold all the cables
behind it so a $79 fusion that offers
nothing unique and actually you know
buying the Enzo at $79 and potentially
modifying the front panel for better
airflow would be a better bet so given
all that given what you've seen here
with the fusion or the power supply
shroud that has no no cut outs it has no
storage capacity what would you do and
what would you change and what would you
tell to beat Phenix to change because
that's that's the whole point you know
we we've discussed what we don't like
about it this to me feels like a three
year old case so what would make you
know what would turn this from a three
year old case into something that would
be launched in 2018 alright so coming to
the back here what is new here nothing
is new they're just reusing the same
tooling for the beat phoenix pandora
which had a lot of issues you know we
have a very flat motherboard tray
nothing on here and whenever you have
these discs it kind of the cable mess
that is sure there's enough spacing here
for the side panel to close but we as
builders expect a lot more from a 20-18
enclosure especially when it comes to
you know this is a very simple build I
know we have what how many six fans in
here and look at this cable mess you
need cable covers seed a little
motherboard protrusions you need a fan
controller potentially maybe not for
that price point but you know we need
potentially maybe something at the
bottom below them below the motherboard
tray in front the power supply for
storage something that makes your
assembly process easy and I feel like
there really hasn't been any innovation
with this type of layout for three years
so why are we seeing something like this
in 2018 now sure we have these two SSD
brackets
but you cannot relocate them to a more
you know desirable position you know
where's the modularity where's the
flexibility I wouldn't want to work in
this with you all right guys so that is
the beat Phoenix fusion I cannot say I'm
impressed but that's how the feedback
loop works there in the current stage
where they can actually take that
feedback our feedback your comments
compile that all into you know a file
that they can review before the final
tooling goes into production so I would
say to reduce the length of the case
because right now it's way too large and
if they go the large route to have EA TX
support motherboards to have potentially
utilizing the space that is there
because why why else have that space why
go the really large case route if you
are not being able to use anything so
yeah let me know what you guys think and
what type of feedback you'd love to give
to beat Phoenix I'm Dimitri thanks much
for watching and we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
