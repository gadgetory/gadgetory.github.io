Canucks it's Sunday I just finished
filming the case review with the ASG 13
from silverstone tomorrow I'm going to
New York for a little briefing within
the video something secretive I'm
excited about it this whole blog is all
about that and I'm thinking with me on
the road well you can't do it see it
well let me show you I'm gonna try to
keep this one very light because as much
as I want to capture good b-roll I don't
want to be traveling with all of my
equipment but this is actually all my
equipment that I shoot on regular basis
anyway my regular tripod i have my
smaller tripod for the sony rx100 mark 3
so in case i need to film more behind
scenes and want to actually set up the
shop i'm going to be using that in
situations like these the little handy
tripod comes in handy my mobile devices
obviously the shield i read on this
thing a lot the 1+2 recently got this
the main horses gh4 18 to 35 millimeter
lens LED light i'm charging the
batteries currently just so that in case
i want to get a unique shot and this
little hot shoe mount for the zoom h4n
and for audio i'm currently testing the
Hydra from razor i think that's what
they're called their bluetooth and their
wireless and that's what I'm trying to
go with minimize all the cables
everything will fit it inside the
backpack well this is actually it not
much equipment today but I can assure
you I'll be good content tell don't you
worry all right let's go
alright i right to Central Park I'm a
bit early my meeting doesn't start in
about until another hour so I thought to
take time to get some cool time-lapse
shots and slow motion things within the
area of where I'm right now so you can
see it through the lens enjoy
so in just under an hour i got all my
video footage which includes time lapses
slow motion stuff of people walking some
building stuff my name is around about
two hours after which i have more time
in New York City so for the first half
day I utilized that get more shots in
the park on people while it's light out
with all the greenery and then after the
time I want to take the time to get
different angles of the city like New
York during the evening maybe some cool
lighting maybe come back to the park to
see how life has changed here hopefully
to get some Sun sets lighting maybe
orange lighting but we'll see so for now
come out heading to the meeting
all right i am back in the office it was
quite a cool trip to new york city
unfortunately I cannot tell you what I
saw with a video just because the NDA is
not yet lifted by the time this video
goes live at least I don't take it well
but what I could tell you is I was
trying to get the most out of my my time
there it was just quick and NL type of
trip but without me showing you much of
the things that I was filming with
nvidia i decided to just get bunch of
b-roll for what I was experiencing at
the time inside the park inside the city
between the buildings and everything and
that's when I was trying to capture with
this behind the scenes as uh basically
kind of giving you an idea of what it
would be like to be on my place if you
were to be there and so I hopefully I
captured that timing place very well for
you to experience new york is just as
well as i did so i hope you enjoyed this
behind the scenes more to come there's
quite a bit in the in the scheduling
