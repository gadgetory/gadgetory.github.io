Hardware canucks review where they can
look at the new micro ATX seashell from
Lee Anne Lee this is the Kauri pcu 6
2011 special edition now if this case
looks familiar back in 2005 really
proved they're capable of designing
something unique in terms of aesthetic
looks without sacrificing the
functionality of the Interior and it
seems Lee Anne Lee has done it again but
with a more compact design obviously
this isn't targeted towards enthusiasts
gamers but for those who prefer unique
looking case to be used as a home
theater PC however is you will soon find
out it does have a potential for an
adequate gaming setup for those willing
to spend 350 dollars on a chassis now
before making our mind about this
extraordinary enclosure based on its
price let's take a look at what it has
to offer first off leonie's excellent
aluminum craftsmanship stands out and
while the case does have a lot of
plastic parts the overall construction
is fairly solid the front features 15 in
the quarter inch driveway cover which
has to be removed and placed back into
its spot once you install your optical
drive then we have quality aluminum
power and reset buttons and plenty of
venting holes and located on the feet
the Cauvery are our front panel
connectors featuring eSATA USB 3 ports
and your audio the side panel design is
definitely an important factor in
delivering a visually appealing chassis
but it also takes into account the air
flow of this little shell and the spiral
mesh due to the limited airflow options
the all-around ventilated approach helps
to keep the temperatures low the rear of
the chassis has an air filter which can
be moved up slightly to cover the
optional 80 millimeter exhaust fan we
also have a fan controller knob for up
to 4 fans I oh area and four ventilated
PCI slots and they bottom mounted power
supply under which leonie's usual dust
filter is located for accessible
maintenance okay so let's get inside the
shell and see what this micro ATX case
has to offer once the side panel is
removed dual 120mm fan bracket is
located to deliver cool air which spans
both the CPU and the GPU and the bracket
must be removed before dealing with n
hardware installation and it is held
securely by thumb screw and sits on
rubber grommets for extra silence both
fans are covered with dust filters which
can be removed by on tightening the
screws on the four corners inside there
is another dust filter for the front
which also can be easily removed and
cleaned moving on this case supports
mini-itx and micro ATX motherboards and
the monthly size CPU backplate opening
support for dual 2.5 inch drives along
with 3 3.5 inch drives with their
conventional mounting system using
screws and rubber grommets drives just
fit into place also the locking
mechanism uses a similar design as on
its previous cases to prevent dries from
sliding out 1comment can be made about
the rubber grommets beside the
motherboard tray is they don't seem to
suit the overall quality of the chassis
as they easily fall out on passing
cables through them and this price point
we expect only the best quality and this
disappointing to see a leonie drop the
ball on this minor detail so how does
carrie prepare for cable management in
the back well only one plastic cable
clamp and half an inch for the rest of
your cables again disappointing to see
no cable tie mountings to aid during
installation especially for such limited
space so with expectations for an uneasy
assembly let's see how this seashell
stacks up in practice first to insert
the power supply the PSU bracket had to
be removed which mounts onto the unit
and the power supply slides into place
notice how a little room there is left
between all the cables and the curved
front panel and for those with long and
modular power supplies we do recommend
installing all the cables first as it
would be very difficult plugging in
additional cables after the power supply
is inside the case since the case is USB
three ready and has an internal 20 pin
connector leonie includes USB 2 adapter
for those who did not have compatible
motherboards they also include
motherboard thumb screws which come in
handy during assembly and a red LED
strip that could be attached to the
bottom of the case and illuminate all
the internal components now even due to
its relatively small interior the case
can handle GPUs of up to 310 million
meters or 12 point 2 inches now
considering the sizing current myth in
high-end graphics cards this chassis can
handle pretty much all of them
installing our monster triple slot 11 a
half inches long gtx 570 you can see how
much room there is left while it is
packed and credit ight advantages to
keep up with the latest in computer
hardware now it is a different story
behind the motherboard as cable
management isn't made easy and requires
a bit of creative work if you want the
side panel to close properly now just to
clarify this isn't the problem of extra
cables making this huge mess as we are
working with a fully modular power
supply and using only the needed cables
for the hardware and even then the cable
work may look intimidating just a quick
tip on how we got to hide all the cables
as there is extra room in from the power
supply and space available on top of the
drives to tuck in any unused cables
fully assembled the calorie shows what
it's capable of besides looking awesome
it can handle modern setups with no
problem just a little hiccup with cable
management the car is a true original
chassis that stands out from the rest of
the square boxes and that then self is a
piece of art for display no matter of
the hardware inside with leonie's
quality construction with brushed
aluminum but in terms of functionality
is in the closure it does have support
for long graphics cards SSDs and USB 3
compatible and with all around open
design allows for passive ventilation
keep the temps down and an integrated
fan controller is a useful addition to
monitor those noise levels on a downside
more emphasis should have been put on
the cable management as one cable clamp
at the back is not enough we need to see
cable tie mountains to secure those
leftover cables and the rubber grommets
feel like an afterthought because they
like the quality feel and constantly
fall out when passing the cables through
them and for the overall package it may
be a bit steep to drop three hundred
fifty dollars on a micro ATX chassis
that doesn't fully satisfied and as
nearly markets the case its unique
design is for unique people thank you
guys for watching and we'll see you next
