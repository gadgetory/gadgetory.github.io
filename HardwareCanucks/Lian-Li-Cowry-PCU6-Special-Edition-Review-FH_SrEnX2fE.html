hardware canucks review we're taking a
look at the new micro ATX c-shell from
Lian Li this is the Kauri PC u 6 2011
special edition now if this case looks
familiar
back in 2005 léa léa proved they're
capable of designing something unique in
terms of aesthetic looks with that with
sacrificing the functionality of the
interior and it seems Leanne Lee has
done it again but with a more compact
design obviously this isn't targeted
towards enthusiast gamers but for those
who prefer unique looking case to be
used as a home theater PC however is you
will soon find out it does have a
potential for an adequate gaming setup
for those who willing to spend $350 on
this chassis now before making our mind
about this extraordinary enclosure based
on its price let's take a look at what
it has to offer
first off leonie's excellent aluminum
craftsmanship stands out and while the
case does have a lot of plastic parts
the overall construction is fairly solid
the front features one five and a
quarter inch drive bay cover which has
to be removed and placed back into its
spot once you install your optical drive
then we have quality aluminum power and
reset buttons and plenty of venting
holes and located on the feet the Kauri
are our front panel connectors featuring
eSATA USB 3 ports and your audio the
side panel design is definitely an
important factor in delivering a
visually appealing chassis but it also
takes into account the airflow of this
little shell and the spiral mesh due to
the limited airflow options the
all-around ventilated approach helps to
keep the temperatures low the rear of
the chassis has an air filter which can
be moved up slightly to cover the
optional 80 millimeter exhaust fan we
also have a fan control knob for up to 4
fans IO area and for ventilated PCI
slots and they bottom mount the power
supply under which Linley's the usual
dust filter is located for accessible
maintenance ok so let's get inside the
shell and see what this micro ATX case
has to offer
once the side panel is removed dual
120mm fan bracket is located to deliver
cool air which spans both the CPU and
the GPU and the bracket must be removed
before dealing with
a hardware installation and it is held
securely by thumb screw and sits on
rubber grommets for extra silence both
fans are covered with dust filters which
can be removed by cohn tightening the
screws on the four corners inside there
is another dust filter for the front
which also can be easily removed and
cleaned moving on this case supports
mini ITX and micro ATX motherboards and
the monthly sized CPU backplate opening
support for dual 2.5 inch drives along
with three 3.5 inch drives with their
conventional mounting system using
screws and rubber grommets the drives
just fit into place
also the locking mechanism uses a
similar design as on its previous cases
to prevent it drys from sliding out one
comment can be made about the rubber
grommets beside the motherboard tray is
they don't seem to suit the overall
quality of the chassis as they easily
fall out on passing cables through them
and at this price point we expect only
the best quality and this is
disappointing to see a leonie drop the
ball on this minor detail so how does
carey prepare for cable management in
the back well only one plastic cable
clamp and half an inch for the rest of
your cables again disappointing to see
no cable tie mountings to aid during
installation especially for such limited
space so with expectations for an uneasy
assembly let's see how this seashell
stacks up in practice first to insert
the power supply the PSU bracket has to
be removed which mounts onto the unit
and the power supply slides into place
notice how little room there is left
between all the cables and the curved
front panel and for those with long and
modular power supplies we do recommend
installing all the cables first as it
would be very difficult plugging in
additional cables after the power supply
is inside the case since the case is USB
3 ready and has an internal 20 thinkin
Ector liyan lis includes USB 2 adapter
for those who did not have compatible
motherboards
they also include motherboard thumb
screws which come in handy during
assembly and a red LED strip that could
be attached to the bottom of the case
and illuminate all the internal
components now even due to its
relatively small interior the case can
handle GPUs of up to 310 mm
or 12.2 inches now considering the
sizing current myth in high-end graphics
cards this chassis can handle pretty
much all of them installing our monster
triple slot 11 1/2 inches long gtx 570
you can see how much room there is left
while it is packed in pretty tight it
manages to keep up with the latest in
computer hardware now it is a different
story behind the motherboard as cable
management isn't made easy and requires
a bit of creative work if you want the
side panel to close properly now just to
clarify this isn't the problem of extra
cables making this huge mess is we are
working with a fully modular power
supply and using only the needed cables
for the hardware and even then the cable
work may look intimidating just a quick
tip on how we got to hide all the cables
as there is extra room in from the power
supply and space available on top of the
drives to tuck in any unused cables
fully assembled the carry shows what
it's capable of besides looking awesome
it can handle modern setup with no
problem just a little hiccup with cable
management the khari is a true original
chassis that stands out from the rest of
the square boxes and that themself is a
piece of art for display
no matter of the hardware inside with
leondis quality construction with
brushed aluminum but in terms of
functionality is in the closure it does
have support for long graphics cards
SSDs and USB 3 compatible and with
all-around open design allow for passive
ventilation to keep the temps down and
an integrated fan controller is a useful
addition to monitor those noise levels
on a downside more emphasis should've
been put on the cable management as one
cable clamp at the back is not enough we
need to see cable tie mountains to
secure those leftover cables and the
rubber grommets feel like an
afterthought because they like the
quality feel and constantly fall out
when passing the cables through them and
for the overall package it may be a bit
steep to drop $350 on a micro ATX
chassis that doesn't fully satisfy and
as nearly markets the case its unique
design is for unique people thank you
guys for watching and we'll see you next
