to you by fantex coolermaster and msi hi
guys I'm three tier higher conducts and
how interesting can keyboards get you
may be asking yourself after watching
some 20-plus videos that we made on
keywords alone but here Tesoro
we're visiting and we are revisiting the
keyboard of the future which is what I
labeled it last CES when we're looking
at this Graham lineup of mechanical
keyboard that is low profile and I just
unplug the cable which is removable by
the way so that kind of fits in with the
conversation let me plug that in back so
it is part of the Graham lineup and it's
low profile its mechanical and they done
few adjustment to it based on from what
we saw last time
so they increase the height of the body
a little bit so it's not as low profile
as before which has given the actual
switch travel distance a little bit more
height and the switch itself and the key
the low profile key cap is now slightly
higher so it looks a little bit like a
you know notebook type of design
keyboard but following a very basic
structure very corners and just the
straight lines I like the design nature
especially coming from the soros
previous keyboards that were all over
the place now this is very focused much
on design simplicity but as a switch
itself it is kind of based on the
tactile blue mechanism and also be
offered in white what I'm going to say
is there be offered in both red and blue
actuations
and black and white body just like the
rest of the gram keyboard lineup so in
terms of the features that it would be
very basic right now we just have simple
function keys on the top with different
profiles there are no USB pastors the
cable is removable there are no case out
feed pull-up outfit yet it's just little
dimples here that allow the keyboard to
be raised a little bit and angled but
disorders asking for feedback on what
you guys want to see I would love to see
this iteration in a wireless model that
allows it to be very low profile I would
like this to be in the white body that
they're delivering so that's good but
the Wireless iteration on the switch may
be possible and I would love to see that
moving forward and price-wise it's
around 169 it's not confirmed yet but
that seems a little bit too high but
because it's low profile nature
the switch is mechanical and it's kind
of a new thing that they're trying to
develop here so I'm guessing this look
the kind of the additional cost of this
being delivered to the market but
another thing is here is the Graham s II
spectrum we've actually taken look at
the Graham spectrum the white model that
is beside me here you can check out the
review of on the channel but this new se
spectrum comes with optical switches so
the source optical switch that has a few
benefits like it's a little bit faster a
little bit faster it's twice reduction
in latency of a switch registration and
so that's that's a benefit it has spill
proof resistance so that's good and you
can actually pop out these switches and
replace them on the keyboard depending
on what type of switch you like so
they'll be delivered in both blue and
red so that's something to keep in mind
do i main difference here between the
original spectrum is the key caps are no
longer low-profile and the font check it
out the font has not changed from
something that was a little bit you know
kind of off-putting to something that is
more simplified and cleaner looking and
that's exactly what people asking and
I'm glad the store is listening and so
this is the SE spectrum RGB lighting
perky illumination the software I'm
hoping will be upgraded yeah I'm getting
the thumbs up this keyboard will be
available to or $219 so it's a pretty
good jump into the market especially
with the obstacle switch that has those
benefits make sure to check out our
video on obstacle switches yeah this is
all from this or thanks so much for
watching I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
