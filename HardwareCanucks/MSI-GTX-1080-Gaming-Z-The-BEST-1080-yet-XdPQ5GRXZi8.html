going to be good what's up guys Eber
here with hurricane axe and so far we've
looked at three gtx 1080s the founders
edition the super competition from EVGA
and the g1 gaming from gigabyte the
custom cards performed a lot better than
the founders edition and they were
cheaper too but today we'll be taking a
look at a flagship card from MSI yeah
cable mod configurator allows you to
select only the cables you need with
your choice of mod flex leaving that is
very flexible or mod mesh that is more
vibrant then you choose your length and
color combination custom cables just got
more custom with the cable mod
configurator to be specific MSI has
multiple tiers of the GTX 1080 the
gaming edgy gaming axe and the gaming Z
that offers different clocks plus some
extras this is MSI flagship card the
gaming Z priced at 750 dollars what
you're looking at is a GPU that sports
one of the fastest frequencies we've
come across on a GTX 1080 with a base
clock of 1771 megahertz and a boost of
1911 megahertz eight gigabytes of gddr5
X memory and a memory speed of 10.1
gigahertz versus 10 not sure if this is
going to help with performance but we'll
see the moment I picked up this card I
just felt one thing premium everything
from the familiar red and black shroud
to the gorgeous looking backplate to
make things even better this card
shouldn't have any problems fitting into
most compact cases since it's only 11
inches in length but the wear of the
width which is about 5 inches
MSI's Twin Frozr 6 has made its way into
the gaming series and it's incredible
unlike the competition MSI decided to
skip the direct contact heat pipes and
instead use a high efficiency solid
nickel plated copper base plate this was
done since the GP 104 core is quite
small and the HD T style bass would make
proper contact with it the base plate is
topped off by six squared off eight
millimeter heat pipes which run upwards
and are eventually spread at strategic
locations throughout the heatsink this
was engineered to optimize air flow
through the addition of minute air
deflectors which not only accelerates
air movement but also allows for more
in cooling hence why the GPU looks
thinner the Turks fans feature double
ball bearings for increased lifespan
utilizing a patented mix of traditional
blades and new dispersion blades what
this does is allow the maximum amount of
air to enter without requiring higher
rpm levels and like the competition the
gaming Z has the ability to shut off its
two fans when in idle or low load
situations for power this card requires
six plus a pin power input which
theoretically should provide an
additional 75 watts of overclocking
Headroom this is a great feature since
we don't have to worry about limiting
voltages and the chips usable power the
backplate looks classic it doesn't
provide any additional cooling to the
core since it doesn't make any direct
contact to it there's an led-backlit
logo embedded into it and physically
that's the only way to differentiate the
gaming Z with the rest of the lineup the
i/o hasn't changed that much you get the
standard single DVI 3 DisplayPort 1.4
connectors and an HDMI 2.0 output there
are three LED zones on the gaming z GPU
this includes the grills around the rear
fan the MSI logo on the side and as
mentioned before the huge back plate
logo these are RGB lit except for the
grills if you want to take advantage of
different lighting effects MSI's gaming
app has you covered you're greeted with
a very straightforward interface with a
number of icons that indicate onboard
features a basic clock speed indicator
different performance mode selections
and at the bottom you'll find MSI
specific gaming peripherals you have
installed the icons right up top have
some interesting features starting with
the IRS this opens a separate window and
it will allow you to control your
monitors color palette with just a click
of a button as you can see there's even
a custom mode where you can adjust the
gamma brightness and contrast next up is
LED control it's very simple and easy to
understand you either sink all the zone
with one led effect and style or set
them individually
switching to OSD here is where you can
choose what you would like to see while
gaming unfortunately it won't show up in
dx12 games just yet but MSI is working
on that as we speak you will also need
an MSI motherboard for CPU related
information given such an awesome
heating design on this card the
temperature results whereas
really good whether that's overclocked
gaming and silent attempts Howard around
70 degrees Celsius fan speeds over time
were incredible in fact they were lower
than gigabytes g1 gaming card that was a
lot louder when tested the gaming Z was
quieter despite its higher frequencies
and considerably higher heat output
frequencies were strong to the gaming Z
is the definition of clock speed
stability when you enable silent mode it
lowers the fan speeds while adjusting
clock speeds there's approximately 40
megahertz gap between the gaming and OC
modes overall frame rates were superior
ly consistent across the board why don't
we take a look at some and yeah paying
an extra hundred dollars over gigabytes
g1 or EVGA superclocked ad does give you
a significant boost in performance
pretty much all of our 1440p tests were
dominated by the gaming Z and it did not
let any of the other cards touch below
its tail the same story applies for 4k
and while doing this the card was
drinking a lot of power we have a new
kid on the block taking the spot as the
quietest running cars we've tested so
far
even when overclocked the gaming Z was
noticeably quieter than EVGA
superclocked an 80 and of course the g1
is nowhere even close to it we expected
this from the beginning and were happy
by the results well not really
you see paying $750 for GT X 1080 that
boasts one of the best coolers in the
market and a six plus eight pin power
input should technically give you great
overclocking results not in this case
though or sad to report the maximum
achievable overclock we were able to
pull was just a little over 2 gigahertz
and this is disappointing because Nvidia
should give board partners a free hand
to design their own custom cards that
enthusiasts would love to tweak around
with and this card had the potential but
unfortunately due to the power limit on
the core
it just completely silenced the ruling
line within it but I want to leave you
guys on a positive note
this is the best GTX tennety that you
can buy right now in fact the
performance should be on par with in
competing flagship offerings from a soos
EVGA ZOTAC etc and you get a whole lot
of features like RGB lighting great
acoustic performance and a very simple
complimentary app so would you consider
paying $750 for the MSI GTX 1080 gaming
Z keyboard warriors let the races begin
and I'm looking forward to your response
I meter with hurricane axe thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
