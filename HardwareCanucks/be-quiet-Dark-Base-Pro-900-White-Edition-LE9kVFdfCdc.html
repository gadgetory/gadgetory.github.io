fan tech school master intimacy
what's up guys Dimitri how are connect
here would be quiet taking a look at the
enclosure of the case of the year that
we aboard for 2016
come take a look so this is the dark
Bass Pro 900 wide edition looks actually
quite unique it's basically the same
thing now with the white paint job that
looks fantastic and this is the slightly
modded version so we have a build the
optical drive has been relocated so that
we only see the premium created quarters
right there unfortunately nothing much
has changed in the frame design aside
from the white color and from what I see
so far I do like the uniformity of the
white of these from know from this
lighting it looks good
but we still don't have a power supply
shroud and the mechanism for the glass
is still the same this is in limited
edition so 2,000 units worldwide so for
the like for the states for example only
500 units will be sold there and we are
told obviously if being a limited
edition it makes sense for you to get a
unique number plaque on what number of
hundreds of thousand cases that you have
so you feel a little bit special and so
just to recap the dark based Pro 900
wide Edition still has the module
motherboard tray the power supply
brackets can be rotated to accommodate
four different power supply lengths and
depending on how your motherboard is
rotated and yeah this would be the
perfect case to do like a white winter
bill and because of the white nature
whatever lighting that you have inside
will really highlight the interior
because black interior with LEDs gets
lost white interior gives the best
ambient lighting that you can get that
for sure plus an LED strip is included
anyway
dr. Bates Pro 900 wide edition speaking
of the power supply route as we're
roaming around the Steamies mod we
stumble upon this moment here for my
Taiwanese water which is actually here
so this is perhaps something required to
take note of but if you have a little
bit closer look at this look at this is
a rare little thing that required
perhaps is not aware of a power supply
shroud actually looks a very good one
where we get a lot of cable cutouts
opening maybe this is like you know
maybe say a little painting hinting here
but perhaps on the next enclosure that
is coming out sometimes you know I don't
know when but maybe we'll see a power
supply a housefly shroud that actually
is integrated into the frame and with
all the cables and I'm thinking that
they will have enough time to do
something unique but it's good to see
one in the dark Bass Pro so aside from
the white editions are great for 900
there are no new cases here so we're
going to take a look some of the mods
and I found this particular one very
interesting because it's the the pure
bass 600 tempered glass editions $99
enclosure but what they've done here is
actually used two of them to water cool
a system so basically move the radiator
in the reservoir on the system on the
left which looks really incredible with
the tubing sort of passing by on the
back to the side of the case but here as
you can see because all the radiator and
the reservoirs that has been shifted to
this side it gives us very kind of plain
looking almost like where did the
hardware and water cooling go but
interestingly it's been moved to another
case and so utilizing two pure base 600
cases to create this very unique mod
it's quite cool and if we come around to
the other side let's go see the cabling
so as you can see the tubing comes from
one case to the other and these
connections are quite cool they kinda
remind me of that thing that you've seen
the matrix thing on the back of the
guy's head because if you look over here
you can see both SSDs being revealed on
the tempered glass panels alongside this
cutout that shows
beautiful LED some acrylic that is
illuminated and Ebor if you can raise
the camera raise the camera to go and
show the top look at it that one the one
of the coolest slope top place that
we've seen be quiet
illuminated little cutouts to the
airport can pass through where it did
this might be done and this my friends
is another dark place 900 that's been
this times in this Walkman bond this is
actually winner from a German Case
Competition so come take a look it's
actually highlight the very unique
aspect of the dark Bass Pro Series
because inside the motherboard has been
rotated and so it has the case so that's
why it doesn't look anything like the
case on the right here but the
motherboard has been rotated inside we
have guardians of the galaxy we know we
get comments about you know Chris Pratt
and there's a little bit of relations
neat little character inside there
pretty cool and actually the power
button is this big or interesting on the
top that's correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
