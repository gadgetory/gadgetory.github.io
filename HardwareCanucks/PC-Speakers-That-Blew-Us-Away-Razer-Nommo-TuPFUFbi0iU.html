years those were years PC speakers
really suffered other than a few
interesting sound bars like the Sound
Blaster katana and some nice speaker
sense there really wasn't all that much
launch that would appeal to gamers or
audiophiles to many people the cliff's
pro media thx 2.0 and logitech's older Z
series still led the pack even though
they're more than 10 years old now but
Razer has been hard at work developing
their own new speakers called a Nomo and
their sound quality is unbelievable
yeah I know guys talking about a speaker
system might not seem all that cool but
after years of poor quality Bluetooth
systems appearing everywhere the Nomo is
a breath of fresh air I mean wow they
aren't impressive but the look and sound
they produce had us wanting more and it
will be available at three different
price points our 2018 CES coverage is
brought to you by fan tax Corsair and
Coolermaster let's start things off with
the more affordable $100 standard normal
set up this is a pretty basic 2.0
speaker system without a subwoofer but
it will be able to fill the room with a
well-balanced soundstage it features two
3-inch glass fiber drivers rear firing
bass ports and an integrated 3.5
millimeter jack for easy hookup and a
headphone output two there are even
individual built in volume and bass
controls stepping up a bit to $150 and
there's the razor in normal chroma and
yeah your thoughts were right it has
integrated chroma RGB LEDs set up but
before you go and start making fun of
our jeebies adding $50 to the standard
systems price they're actually more
being offered here this version has the
exact same speaker setup as the regular
Nomo but it also has a built-in DAC and
connectivity via USB or a 3.5 millimeter
jack the final and highest end edition
of the Nomo lineup is the Nomo Pro and
hold on to your hats before this one is
expensive it costs $500 but for that
price you're getting pretty much
everything and also one of the best
sounding stereo systems we've ever heard
while the other Nomo systems are simple
2.0 setups li pro adds a downwards
firing six inch subwoofer and a heavily
upgraded stereo speakers these have
point-eight silk dome dedicated tweeters
three inch full range drivers coated in
Kevlar and a THX certification Razer has
even added Dolby virtual speaker
technology
for an added layer of immersion with
simulated 5.1 surround sound and a
simple but well-designed control pod for
easy access to the pro features we
weren't too crazy about the virtual
store on stage but in standard 2.1 mode
we couldn't find any critique as for
connectivity I'm pretty sure you can
imagine the Nomo pretty much has it all
USB a dedicated audio deck optical
connection bluetooth and a 3.5
millimeter jack are all here while the
equalizer settings can be modified with
Razer synapse 3 software like many other
connected devices Razer will also have a
no more Pro mobile app for Android and
Apple devices that will connect to
Spotify and other music apps via
bluetooth there's no word on
compatibility with a Spotify connect
bluetooth apt X codec or Apple airplay
but I'm expecting those to be rolled out
over time it looks like the number will
be available right now on the Razer
store and late in January at retailers
worldwide unfortunately there isn't a
release date for the normal Pro but
expected to be rolling out a bit later
this year honestly guys the normal
series is exciting for us because it's
been a long time since a company like
Razer pushed out new high quality
developments in the speaker market but
what about you are you willing to stick
with a simple Bluetooth setup or
headphones only or do dedicated speakers
still have a place in your setup let us
know in the comments down below and stay
tuned for more content from CES 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
