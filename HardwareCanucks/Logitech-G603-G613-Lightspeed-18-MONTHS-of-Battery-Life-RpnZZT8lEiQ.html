their new wireless peripherals will last
the G 603 wireless mouse and the G 613 a
wireless mechanical keyboard man 18
months for real all right I guess it's
time to pack away my wide peripherals
but I will miss you mechanical keyboard
but guess what
but the G 613 is also mechanical
keyboard featuring the roamer G switches
which are found on the G pro although
this one feels to me like it's a bit
heavier versus what I'm used to on my
tkl but look at this no wires and I was
wondering why it took them so long to
release a wireless mechanical keyboard
and Larson just told me it was about
time that this is finally on the market
and I'm thinking it's just a combination
and them wanting to release a proper
gaming mouse as well that last just as
long as this does so let's check out
both the g6 13 and the g6 or three grand
- this wondering how to fix a boring fan
check out halos RGB they are super slim
fan frames that light up your blades of
any shade come on 120 and 140 member
sizes to fit any fan and a control
through your motherboard or your fan
text case available in beautiful
aluminum or simple plastic it's time to
halos your build outline what matters
now the thing is despite all the
Wireless - that I try I always go back
to my wired mice like the rival 310 the
fantastic Mouse or the G Pro from large
to themselves is that a mouse Bungie is
kind of like part of my setup so without
this thing you know the monitor kind of
feels awkward but hey look at this large
stick doesn't include this smartphone
stand with the keyboard so you can place
your smartphone there and you know I
don't know why this is included as part
of the keyboard but hey it's it's
actually not a bad thing so with regards
to the mouse they've done a good job
keeping the same familiar shape that is
found on the g4 three and they have some
really cool features on this one but
first the price
at $69 is super appealing for wireless
market especially since the g43 Wireless
is more expensive the shape as far as I
can tell to the g43 is identical but of
course because of these added batteries
it is heavier too and despite having
this magnetic top section that comes off
easily the seams are nicely refined and
don't interfere with your grip but the
side portions are no longer rubberized
like we saw in the g4 3 so the mouse
feels a little bit too plasticky the
buttons are all fine with good dpi and
browser locations the scroll wheel is a
bit softer on the scroll steps but
overall good comfort and button
functions the keyboard is mechanical
it's wireless but why did they have to
go with this Gigantor of a you know form
factor with the built-in armrest G keys
on the side you know it's a full sized
keyboard layout with media keys over
there I wish that they've released a TTL
version first but you know what plotter
stock is not making peripherals just for
Dmitry am i right and look I have a
27-inch monitor and the keyboard is just
way too big for my space in I have this
giant desk over here with a lot of room
but still it feels like it's it's too
big I don't know let me know what you
think are you kidding me it's been less
than a day anyways so yeah after eight
hours of plugging this keyboard in and
using it I start to glitch out on me in
the pub G match where my movement was
not registering so most likely they
provide me with some faulty double-a
batteries so replacing them we're back
to normal but here's my issue with the
battery status indicator in the software
on all their previous G gaming products
we had a percentage but here both on the
keyboard and the mouse we have a 4 bar
battery status so and then it will give
you like a low battery when it hits 15%
but here is an interesting fact the
keyboard has no backlighting and this of
course is to preserve the battery life
because if lighting was added the
keyboard would last a maximum of 18
hours so the compromise had to be made
which I'm fine with the white font is
bold and clearly visible plus the G keys
on the side are colored in vibrant blue
but upon closer inspection you can see
the printing is misaligned
on many keys and that does not reflect a
very nice for the price it is $149
afterall so the built quality feels or
with a steel backplate but I wish the
wrist rest had some texture to it as
otherwise it feels too plasticky and why
are the media buttons so out of shape
with two sized circles and one square so
design language is not uniform the power
button is on the right and when turned
on we have a battery status check plus a
short illumination to indicate your
wireless mode so either Bluetooth or
light speed Wireless with the USB dongle
that can be stored inside the battery
compartment and so there's dual
connectivity on the keyboard is
brilliant because I can be typing an
email on my computer with wireless with
the dongle plugged in but then and now
realize why the smartphone stand is
included boom Bluetooth so now I can
type an email on my phone and I can
switch seamlessly we have maybe another
device that is connected bluetooth on
your same desk and you can use one
single keyboard for two devices
excellent as for the mouse we also have
a Bluetooth or light speed wireless mode
with two performance modes so high gets
you one millisecond report rate for
gaming and low at 8 milliseconds for
more casual desktop use with their
respective battery life implications but
still at 500 hours of runtime at one
millisecond response rate this is a
fantastic result for two double-a
batteries I do appreciate the magnetic
top that can simply pop off so you can
access to the batteries and also the
receiver that can be stashed away here
and the mouse can work on a single
battery you just get half of the total
charged that you will otherwise get well
done so the sensor here is new it's
called a hero sensor its equivalent in
performance to Pixar 3366
so that's one of the best sensors in the
world but the hero is eight to ten times
more power efficient so it can actually
turn itself off between the one
millisecond response time to save power
that's insane
really good job so the new hero sensor
can be mounted anywhere on the PCB and
that's an advantage because engineering
a light mouse is no longer as
challenging as it was on the G 900 so
what's gaming like on this combo with
the keyboard after replacing the
batteries it's pretty much flawless
registration of my actuations is you
know just fine really no complaints here
aside from the larger size but I'm
really starting to like the G keys for
editing I
programmed some them to let's say open
up my color tools or going back to my
timeline or some other frequently use
shortcuts as for the mouse I actually
removed one battery to make it lighter
and because of the weight it's not ideal
for competitive shooters but at 144
Hertz I really could not feel the
difference between it and the g43 wired
so we have fantastic performance great
lift off distance no acceleration at my
500 and 800 dpi profiles and then
all-around good and a necessary release
on the G 603 always stay charged with
linky power up power banks Houston
gorgeous aluminum enclosure with dual
USB and type C port with support for a
quick charge 3.0 to get two devices
recharged fast available up to twenty
thousand one hundred million power
capacities check them out in the
description below and so for conclusion
I want to say that I'm impressed with
what Logitech has delivered here both on
the keyboard and the my side the
keyboard I don't agree with the size but
of course they have to really something
large first so they can cut it down with
multiple revisions later on that makes
sense as for the mouse really happy that
the new sensor here is so efficient that
allows us to have so much battery life
and this whole integration of in the
removable top and replaceable batteries
and everything that makes this it really
sort of a very clever design for a
wireless gaming mouse and the only other
thing that I disagree with is the
battery status inside the software I
wish that we actually got a full
percentage readout instead of just
having 4 bars just so that you know it's
a gaming product and I want to know
exactly how much battery I have left
I think the mouse is priced very well to
be competitive on the market it's going
to be a very popular thing not just for
gaming but for desktop because of that
high and low sort of switch so you can
sort of maneuver around the battery life
and get extensions based on your usage
and as for the keyboard at 150 bucks it
is expensive so you are paying for that
Wireless premium and I wish that the
refinement around the materials used and
the printing on the actual key caps was
better because you know it doesn't give
me that premium feeling even though it's
got the steel backplate and everything
like that so guys let me know what you
think about the g6 or 3 &amp;amp; 6 13 the
