today we'll be taking a look at g-sync
you
so essentially what g-sync does is it
solves for the a synchronous nature of
how our hardware operates of how GPU
communicates with your monitor you
monitor it refreshes the frame in hertz
so it is a cycle it will refresh itself
and the specified number of hertz so
common is sixty Hertz it will refresh
itself sixty times a second you also
have the faster panels of 120 and 144
Hertz gaming panels now the graphics
card will pump out a frame as soon as
that's ready
so whenever the two don't align whenever
the graphics card is ready to pump out a
frame in the middle of the refresh rate
we get tearing and that's a nasty
artifact that we've so gotten accustomed
to for especially for gaming and that's
very common on 60 Hertz panels
especially if you go above the 60 FPS
limit as the graphics card was able to
pump out more frames than the monitor
can essentially accept and that's very
common there are several ways to
actually fix tearing and that's enabling
vsync what this thing does is it locks
the frame rate locks the ceiling frame
rate to your maximum refresh rate of
your monitor so for 60 Hertz panels to
vsync on you'll see the frame rate cap
at 60 fps now what happens when your
your frame rate drops below 60 is we get
stuttering when frames are repeated and
that's also nasty now there is also
adaptive vsync which Nvidia released
last year it will turn on vsync as soon
as you hit that refresh rate cap and it
will turn off vsync when you go below
that it works in most cases there's some
issues can come with compatibility with
gaming in some cases it doesn't turn on
vsync so you do is still an encounter
stutter and encounter tearing and that's
what Jason comes in as a GC she said
because G sync is a hardware solution so
it replaces the scaler board on your
monitor with the G sync board in the G
sink module and it essentially syncs the
frame output from your graphics card to
the refresh rate of your monitor so it's
a variable refresh rate that is
controlled by what is being pumped out
from your graphics card so we don't get
tearing and we don't get stuttering
which is which is really cool now g-sync
does have a frame ceiling and the frame
floor the ceiling is determined by the
Hertz the refresh rate of your monitor
for 60 panels will be 60 fps for 129 144
Hertz panels it will be that
respectively and for the freight at the
frame floor it is 30 fps below 30 fps if
you encounter that in game you will
encounter stutters so there's some
limitation but there's a really sweet
spot for g-sync between 40 and 60 FPS
for 60 Hertz panels that it looks
buttery smooth there's absolutely no
stuttering and the visually it actually
feels like you're playing at 60fps well
in fact you're playing something
slightly below as I mentioned before
gisun is a hardware solution it does
require a specific g-sync module to be
installed inside the monitor but there's
also a couple other criteria that you
have to meet in order for g-sync to work
first you need a GTX 650 Ti boost or
higher kepler GTX graphics cards from
Nvidia you need DisplayPort 1.2
currently this is the only display input
and output that is supported with g-sync
but there's no reason why DVI or HDMI
won't work it will work but currently
DisplayPort is the is the only port that
they've adopted with g-sync there is no
resolution cap so g-sync
is aside from what we've seen up to do
they will work with 4k panels 8k panels
down the road eventually so there's no
resolution cap there's no restrictions
on the panel type either so it will work
VA IPS TN panels and all the others so
it's not unrealistic to say that we
won't see 4k IPS 60 Hertz panels we just
would g-sync it's not likely but what
we're seeing and what we've seen at CES
is a lot of monitor companies are
jumping on board because juicing is
definitely an innovative and exciting
and very useful technology for smoothing
out your gameplay and where it will
really shine as we've seen at CES a lot
of companies are releasing 1440p and 16
P monitors that are higher resolution at
60 Hertz there's still TN panels on the
front unfortunately but there's no
reason why we won't see
the IPS panels being rolled out as soon
as the consumer is ready for g-sync and
the reason why I say that is because
throughout my testing with this Asus
monitor this is a hundred forty four
Hertz gaming panel but I'm coming from a
background of 60 Hertz IPS monitor
that's what I have at home that's what I
aim with so I first tested out g-sync on
vsync on and everything off just
plain-old sort of regular without any
type of assistance and what I've noticed
the jumping in the SAS since elite four
is a lot of tearing at 60 Hertz running
around there's a lot of tearing inside
the game turning on vsync does not help
because I wasn't always above the 60 FPS
mark so I didn't counter stutter turning
on g-sync it it was mind blowing because
now you have this ability to have
extremely smooth gameplay and while
you're still hitting that below 60 fps
mark you're not encountering in
stuttered was a lot smoother than what
you would encounter with vsync on and
without leasing either which was very
impressive now jumping into Metro last
slide there was the same idea
lots of stuttering with vsync on quite a
bit of tearing depending on how fast
you're moving without anything without
any assistance and turning on g-sync
again brings out that very fluid and
smooth gameplay at frame rates below
60fps based on this experience I think
that what we're likely to see with
g-sync
is high resolution panels that you can
use for gaming and you can bump up the
settings so that you're not necessarily
hitting a 60 FPS gap but if you're
staying between 40 to 50 to 60 frames
you can still experience the fluid
motion with cranked up settings without
experiencing any stutter and so that I
think that's where g-sync will truly
shine now tearing is very common if your
frame rate is above your refresh rate so
for a lot of FPS titles if you're play
gaming on the 60 Hertz panel and your
frame rate is above 60 so like 70 Plus
then you're most likely encountering
tearing that's because the the graphics
card pumping out frames that the monitor
cannot accept and therefore the frames
are drawn in the middle
fresh straight and that's tearing is
also also part of the game engine design
and how the API handles frames and how
it handles us resource management and so
when I jumped into battlefield 4 playing
at 60 Hertz without any assistance we
sink off g-sync off I was playing at 90
frames a second and I was getting no
tearing at all so it does bring out the
fact that it does solve for tearing but
then there's also good ain't good a game
engine design that also comes into play
when it comes to resolving this type of
artifact this is 144 Hertz panel so
obviously I turned that on to just
experience how that would work and first
of all playing without vsync and without
g-sync in Assassin's Creed 4 exactly
doing the exactly same sequence and one
thing I noticed there was no tearing the
refresh rate of the monitor is so fast
that the frames that are being pumped
out from the graphics card is the
chances of hitting the frame in the
middle of the refresh rate are a lot
lower and so I encountered almost no
stuttering whatsoever and not at least
not as noticeable and I was very pleased
and the same thing with about it for and
Metro last light where 144 Hertz panels
and gaming in that that refresh rate it
did solve for tearing but tearing also
can occur with variable frame rates it
can occur if your frame rate is below or
frustrate it can occur if you're above
the first rate so having the 144 its
panel helps but it's not the solution
so while turning on g-sync with 104
hertz panel playing Assassin's Creed 4
it was absolutely smooth like like what
we've seen what I've experienced on 60
Hertz but the difference between g-sync
on and gsync
off at 144 words panels at faster
refresh rate wasn't as significant as
was with state 60 Hertz 60 Hertz
gameplay and that's why I think that
again I'm coming back to this idea that
60 Hertz 4G sync with IPS panels great
color accuracy is going to be key and
utilizing this technology for aside from
gaming experience but also a multimedia
experience so not just having
a single DNA monitor but having a gaming
monitor or a monitor that can game and
do all the other things aside from
gaming with g-sync is very beneficial
based on what we've seen at sea as a lot
of the monitor manufacturers are
releasing g-sync ready monitors with
DisplayPort only connectivity and while
I would say it's a slight limitation I
would love to see manufacturers
implement more display connectivity so
you can connect to something else
perhaps if you don't want to use g-sync
but that's something that we'll see
where it goes down the road in 2014 of
course price is also a big one
the current premium on top of a regular
monitor would be $100 plus if you want
to buy a g-sync rady monitor but NVIDIA
is also selling g-sync DIY kits that are
$1.99 and you have to ask yourself
whether or not this price premium is
worth it for an already sort of an
expensive panel like 104 for its panels
that are go around 300 to $500 range so
adding that extra premium is not for
everybody so if you're a gamer if you're
serious gamer you sort of have to juggle
around to see whether or not you can
live with tearing or you want to try out
gsync now based on my experience with
g-sync the wonderful few weeks I've had
with it my gaming experience have
improved significantly because I no
longer have to worry about stutter I no
longer have to worry about tearing and
for especially for 60 Hertz high
resolution IPS panels that I would love
to see with g-sync that's going to be
the selling point for myself but what do
you guys think do you think this is a
technology that will move forward and
will sort of take over the gaming world
another gaming world but it's going to
be very popular thing for gamers to
utilize I think so especially for sixty
Hertz like I'm saying high resolution
and good quality panels that's where it
will shine and so far what we've seen
from g-sync we're very impressed so guys
thanks for watching this video don't
forget to subscribe and we'll see you in
next
dates teasing yeah I think that's the
winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
