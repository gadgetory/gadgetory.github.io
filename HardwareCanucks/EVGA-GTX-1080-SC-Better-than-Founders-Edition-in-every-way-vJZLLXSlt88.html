cables yes you do custom braided cables
just got more custom with the ko mod
configurator first select either the
full power supply cables or custom
extensions your choice of cables leaving
either mod flex or mod mesh with the
latter one using nylon sleeving which is
more vibrant in color but a little bit
more stiff with mod flex being very
flexible but less vibrancy cable mod
supports eight power supply brands then
you find your model then add all the
cables you'd need for your build with
custom links as well and I decided to
stick with the basics and here's the
best part
configure the color per cable so your
color scheme is on point
link in the description to create your
own cable mod custom cables goodbye all
cable hello new cable what's up guys
ibrahim with hardware connects and our
quest to find the best gtx tennety has
begun it's only been a few weeks since
the launch of Nvidia's GTX 1080 founders
edition GPU and while there was a little
bit of delay around this time custom
cards have finally arrived with better
cooler designs higher frequencies and
custom component selections and these
are more likely the cards that you will
end up choosing or picking over the more
expensive founders edition GPU yes you
heard that right
many of these board partner cards are
going to be performing a lot better
offer cooler temperatures and
potentially overclock higher than the
reference card today we'll be taking a
look at the EVGA gtx 1080 super clonk a
CX 3.0 this card is priced at 650
dollars which is a good $50 less than
the founders edition it's categorized as
a mid tier card with an EVGA own GT X
1080 line up below it are the cards
without higher out of the box clock
speeds while above it lies the for the
win or FTW and classified versions both
of those cards cost more both higher
frequencies and includes fully
controllable LEDs and also come with
upgraded power components however the
super clock will likely be more spot
and glancing in the specs the
superclocked nad comes the base Kaka
17:08 megahertz and a boost clock of
1847 megahertz the rest of the specs
like memory clocks mirror the founders
Edition and while I don't expect the
other modifications to make much of a
real world gameplay impact it's better
than nothing the design of this card has
received some criticism as well as
praised it is more steampunk than
streamlined and some may not like that
when compared it to a CX coolers of
years past but let us know what you guys
think about this honeycomb accents as
well as the color scheme in the comments
down below
despite the inclusion of two large fans
and an extensive internal heatsink the
card measures 10.5 inches long which is
relatively compact so the AC x3 point of
cooler hasn't added to the reference
cards length and speaking of the AC X
3.0 cooler it's pretty straightforward
but there are a number of improvements
over its predecessor there's a fully
integrated LED lighting that's not RGB a
pair of double ball bearing fans
upgraded heat pipes and a new heatsink
design for the best heat dissipation
EVGA decided to avoid a direct contact
heat by base and instead utilize a
full-coverage copper layout this may
have been an excellent move since the GP
104 core is extremely compact which
could lead to direct contact pipes
actually missing key areas that require
adequate cooling right below the upper
heatsink there's also a secondary
cooling plate that makes direct contact
with the gddr5 X memory and MOSFETs here
the heat is transferred through simple
heat pads tax aside this cooler feels
extremely well built there are some
pieces of plastic but the use of
predominantly metal components leads to
a feeling of extreme rigidity and
quality if you recall EVGA doesn't brand
their cards in a generic fashion the
only way to tell it's an EBT card is
typically by their cooler design and
subtle branding here and there around
the shroud well this time mej decided to
display logos everywhere I mean
everywhere from the sides to the back to
the edges there is an se mark right
below the a pin connector that lights up
to differentiate this particular card
from the other cards with an e Vijay's
lineup I don't mind this implementation
as the car
is most likely going to sit inside my
case that's underneath my desk but hey
it's a good step towards allowing this
particular GTX 1080 to stand out from
the competition the LED zones on this
card are large white and extremely
bright they exhibit a cool bluish light
that unfortunately can't have its color
changed but can be turned off through
Nvidia's GeForce experience software
oddly enough EVGA is own precision tool
which controls the LEDs color only for
the win and classified cards can't be
used with this one to simply turn off
the lighting it's weird
and while simple white light is quite
limiting if you are looking towards a
more neutral build around the black and
white components this could be a perfect
solution the back plate is clean and
beautiful the brushed aluminum finish is
definitely one of my favorite looks and
on top of that it helps cool the rear
mounted gddr5 X modules and I also
wanted to point out that this card uses
invidious reference PCB and components
which means none of them have been
upgraded this is good news for some
people since this card will be
compatible with standard water cooling
add-ons the i/o consists of three
display ports and a single HDMI and DVI
connectors EVGA has slightly modified
this area with a large grille to
facilitate air movement in and around
the AC X 3.0 heatsink but don't expect
all that much hot air to be exhausted
directly through this area and speaking
of heat the AC x3 point no does a really
good job with temperatures it was able
to maintain about 75 degrees Celsius and
won't portal in any way despite the
super clocks increased clock speeds
that's significantly better than the
reference card the cooler is able to
idle its fans during low load situations
which makes this card completely silent
but when temperature rises above 70
degrees Celsius the fans kick in and
gradually increase their speeds to keep
ahead of the cores heat production as
you might expect frequencies remain very
consistent regardless of the amount of
load or the duration of a gaming session
now comes the best part
gaming performance and let's see how
well this bad boy performs
and as you can see the superclocked 1080
performs extremely well compared to the
founders edition realistically speaking
it performs six to ten percent faster
due to a combination of higher speeds
and avoiding the throttling we found on
the founders edition that's incredible
considering the lower price
switching to 4k and this card still
stays on top
the card is also quite extremely quiet
at idle the fans turn themselves off and
even when under load they're barely
audible while the founders edition was
already quiet EVG s card takes near
silence to the next level
power consumption here is pretty much in
line with the cooler running yet
a slightly faster gtx 980 remember even
though it's overclocked the ACX 3.0
cooler allows for better thermal
dissipation which leads to higher
overall efficiency
now on to overclocking and i wasn't able
to get this card running any faster than
our founders edition sample even though
it's cooler wasn't struggling at all
rather the power limit ended up capping
frequencies long before voltage or heat
could step into the equation that's a
bit disappointing but EVGA does promise
their FTW and classified cards will
feature more power overhead so in
conclusion the GTX 1080 super clock a CX
3.0 is an awesome card especially for
the price and the performance you get
out of the box it isn't inexpensive
though it's value koushin is
substantially higher than the more
expensive founders in addition one of
our main critiques about the founders
edition GPU was its performance over
time while frame rates and paralleling
frequencies start up extremely high
after a few minutes of gaming both
elements end up leveling out at lower
points on the other hand the super
clocked a CX 3.0 performed much better
with consistent frame rates without
experiencing any throttling the
temperatures were amazing - it's one
silent card with extremely well
performance metrics and for that we're
giving it the harvick an axe damn good
award the quest to find the best gtx 980
dozen and here we have a lot more custom
GT X 1080 reviews on the way so stay
tuned for that content i'm eva retiree
connects thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
