it I think I hear him coming guys don't
worry he promised to keep us all
together I think he knows about our led
bromance that's it if we aren't together
I'm sure guys too loud you're spinning
out of control look how good we look
together FTW is right there is no way
he's gonna wall oh my god what just
happened guys guys it's time the dark
base nine-hundred may be the most
innovative case of the year with a
built-in Qi charger interior lighting
tempered glass that can be installed on
either side and a fully modular interior
that can be inverted if you so desire be
quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below
alright guys so welcome to the finale on
my six core workstation PC build if you
haven't yet already checked out our
previous video on the gigabyte x99
designate and it's combination with the
6800 k cpu make sure to check it out the
videos in the description i've also
compared the six core shell versus my
6700 k and see how those two stack up
the results are very interesting but in
this video I really want to finalize the
build make it powerful make it practical
make it simple and yet
color-coordinated but not going over the
two crazies first let's start the GPU so
this is the EVGA gtx 1080 FTW or for the
win edition and this is where the
aluminum shroud on this card elegantly
matches similar accents on the
motherboard and the case itself and so
the gtx 980 is very well utilized by
adobe CC suite after the latest update
which is why I still haven't explored
the Quadra route but the ACX 3.0 cooler
here is very efficient at idle which
makes the card totally silent the fans
aren't spinning and maxing out at 75
degrees Celsius at load which is
fantastic to see with this card boosting
up to 1936 megahertz and staying there
as well the card being for the win
also features RGB lighting on a fan side
of the shroud which looks awesome and
can be configured to suit your other
components but I'm leaving everything in
this bluish area although be warned the
card cannot recreate pure white which is
unfortunate so the next deal business is
RAM which is course there's new
vengeance LED initially I was going to
use the g.skill 64 gigabyte writing Z
but since that's only a four-team kit it
was perfectly housed inside my first
editing PC with the 67 100k and in the
past I have used LED Ram that looks kind
of cool and it's very interesting to see
when the ram is being used since that's
when the LEDs light up and we also have
the white LED variant here while red
with the vengeance LED is also an option
so a few things to be aware of here is
the white LED shifts slightly towards
the blue for example it's more
bluish compared to course there's new
magnetic levitation fans that also have
white LEDs so the problem here is
inconsistency between components
especially from the same brand which is
unfortunate I have to 32 gigabyte kits
for a total of 64 gigabytes at 3200
megahertz which I was able to achieve no
problem with an XMP profile and while it
is a unique look to have this fading
memory modules on the top you cannot
turn off the LEDs nor can you control
them so if you want just static LEDs
this isn't for you
my next comment would be on the fans
which are part of Corsairs mlpro series
or magnetic levitation the LEDs here are
centered and if you want consistent
brightness regardless of the RPM you
need to connect the fans to a four pin
pwm headers and have pwm settings
enabled otherwise the brightness will
vary with speed and voltage something
that I discovered when my BIOS did not
save those changes but the really cool
thing about the fans is a new magnet
bearing which lifts the blades so
there's no friction making rotation
totally silent and so the only audible
noise is air displacement at higher rpms
but I can leave them spinning at a
pretty fast 1,200 rpm for my 140 other
fans which are inaudible with a closed
panel let's take a listen the pcs on
this is add quiet
let's go full-speed
and so what you're here now is all air
displacement by the fan blades let's go
back to quiet now some of you may
question the placement of the radiator
why I didn't put it at the top and
mainly I put it at the front so that I
have better visual of the motherboard
area and I might actually rotate the
front fans to pull air out of the case
for negative pressure since the GPU
exhausts a lot of hot air into the case
itself but the cooler is the h100 iv2
it keeps my CPU at 63 degrees Celsius at
100% load without throttling and this is
it for gigahertz and really this is it
additionally I have a one terabyte SSD
for files and a 250 gigabyte system SSD
for playing but powerful second
workstation file sharing is done through
hours Knology nas and I just need to
rearrange the office to accommodate for
dual editing pcs and that is it my
friends thank you so much for joining us
on this adventure building something
like this I'm quite happy with how the
six core machine turned out what do you
think what you would have done something
differently let us know in the comments
down below I'm Dimitri with Huracan Aqsa
we'll see you next video guys guys we
made it I wasn't worried well we were
worried about the first boot there it
was here pretty happy in this new house
my shroud matches the frame guys he's
coming
hmm probably nothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
