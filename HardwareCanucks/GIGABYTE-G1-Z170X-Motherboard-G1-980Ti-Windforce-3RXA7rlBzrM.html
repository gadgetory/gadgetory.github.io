possible without the innovative fantex
world-leading nvidia graphics memory
partner corsair and the retail partner
NCIX
along with silverstone and in win with
intel skylake chipsets right around the
corner gigabyte has announced their new
flagship z170 g1 ATX gaming motherboard
as expected this month board is designed
with quality components for confident
extreme overclocking capabilities and
4-way GPU support the LGA 1151 socket
will support dual channel ddr3 3 SATA
Express connectors for up to 16 Giga
bits per second data transfer rates
right in between the PCI Express slots
there are two x PCIe gen3 X 4m two
connectors with an insane 32 gigabits
per second transfer speeds and support
for raid Wow as for i/o you get six USB
3.0 ports a single USB 3.1 type-a port
HDMI 2.0 for 4k at 60 Hertz 7.1 channel
audio dual Gigabit Ethernet and a USB
type-c port with support for power
delivery 2.0 up to 36 watts gigabyte has
also included a built-in creative
soundblaster for a better sound
experience and with the onboard audio
like that you won't be needing a desktop
DAC there is an LED trace paths through
the gaming g1 branding on the
motherboard with seven color choices so
we are seeing RGB implementation into
motherboards now and if you're into
water cooling there are built in G 1/4
thread fittings on the heatsink we are
noticing motherboard manufacturers
reinforcing the PCI lanes with metal
housing we are told for improved
durability of the lanes and release some
of the long-term tension to prevent GPU
sag the g1 gaming motherboard is
gigabytes top-of-the-line fully decked
out and ready to go skylight motherboard
and I like the white and red accents
that should suit many bills especially
if you're paired with great-looking Ram
gigabyte also showed off their new g1
980ti
with different looking wind force cooler
now with silver and aluminum accents on
the front instead of having the
traditional all-black the triple fan
design isn't anything new for gigabyte
but with exuse new direct co3 cooler
that also has two events we are excited
to test the thermal performance of each
of these GPUs but one thing they share
is silent mode where the fans don't kick
in if GPU temperatures remain below 55 C
clock speeds are still unknown but we're
hoping at least a 50% boost on the base
clocks for these cards one thing we have
to say is gigabyte produces some of the
best-looking back lights and the g1 is
no exception with an aluminum back laid
that's design like the part of the card
with these angular cutouts to fit the
rest of the design and now with wind
force logo on top of the card is
illuminated with many color options RGB
is now everywhere the heatsink is pretty
large with five copper heat pipes that
should cool the GPU well under control
and one difference on this card is an
extra DVI port while the rest of the i/o
remains the same as the reference 980ti
so what do you guys think about the new
g1 gaming introductions from gigabyte
are you ready to jump onto the z170
platform and between all other 980ti
releases do you like the approach on the
gigabyte card let us know in the comment
down below thanks for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
