then closer from Zalman do you guys
remember Zalman they produce these very
unique circular aluminum and copper CPU
tower coolers this is the first time
we're checking out is almond enclosure
so it's not very easy to impress us when
it comes to cases considering how many
fantastic releases we've seen in the
past six months or so but the z9 neo
looks actually quite promising now the
scale of one to ten how excited am I to
build inside this case well like a seven
I think that's a very good score for a
budget enclosure like this considering
it's like a hybrid it borrows all these
very good elements from like the age of
40 to define our 5 and the N through
series and combines them all into such a
budget enclosure this thing is $69 us
which means there's usually some
compromises along the way but in the
bigger picture this might actually be
one of the best budget cases that we
they can look at in the past six months
now when it comes to budget stuff there
are three things that I look out for
feature set building experience because
sometimes that can be a total
frustration
despite the other elements being proper
and then the third one is build quality
I feel like my the building experience
will be here top-notch considering the
feature set and like it's fairly large
there isn't anything that's sort of
standing out on my way just yet the
feature set like I said it's boring a
lot of these features that are awesome
and the build quality that might be the
one of the only compromises here
especially considering we have the white
version the black version I think would
be a little bit more uniform in terms of
color but with white it's very difficult
or it's maybe a more pricey to get the
white on the steel and plastic to match
so the steel the steel white here is a
little bit off it's more cooler versus
the white on the plastic slightly warmer
so there's a bit of a color discrepancy
here
equality of the panel itself the metal
is thin pop over for such a large window
I'm very impressed with the rigidity of
the panel itself I think that's because
of the the plastic here is protruding a
little bit so that's reinforcing a panel
for the back panel it doesn't have any
window and it's actually a lot more
flexible than the window panel weird the
top and front plastic pieces are okay we
have a glassy piece here that opens up
we have some noise dampening material
here intake port no dust filter that is
visible here which is we'll get to in a
bit but all the air intake is coming
from the sides why do we have a glossy
front panel but a matte white surface at
the top I find that a little bit strange
to see but in order to access the front
filter the front panel is removable very
nice and easy however as you can see all
the front panel connections are attached
to the panel this is one of those things
that it's like why can't they make a
little module that sits on the frame
itself so that when you do have to
remove the panel you don't have to
potentially risk ripping any of these
wires or something
another cost-cutting solution that
Zalman has gone ahead with here is this
lovely dust filter that I absolutely
hate and not only because it's kind of
difficult to remove but you know it's
it's okay to access it and you can clean
it but I don't like these filters at all
I prefer something a bit with more mesh
the i/o here is also quite diverse with
four USB ports audio jacks that Chrome
so they're not weirdly colored reset
button and a giant power button so
that's very nice at the top and I do
appreciate that these panels just pop
off with a little bit of force they're
not sitting on any like hinges that you
have to sort of going with your fingers
and then plot pry open so the panel
itself is very it's just plastic there's
this little piece here that is removable
that allows for a little extra air to
exit I do like this cover because it
prevents dust from falling onto this
open area I guess if you need more
airflow you can remove it so that the
exhaust is actually coming right out now
one of the impressive things on the
interior about the z9 eel is the fact
that we have five fans included we have
two blue LED fans at the top and so
they're all 120 mils one at the back and
two of the Front's for intake so usually
we see one or two intake fans for budget
enclosure like this but we have five
which
is pretty impressive and on the interior
itself it has everything we like a nice
power supply shroud with an opening at
the front so that if you do populate a
radiator there we have two removable
five in the quarter inch drive base
which is awesome if you do want to
populate the radiator here you can
remove the bottom five the quarter inch
drive bay in order to populate anything
on that spot there and check out that
hole clearance here just because we
don't have a standard hard drive cage it
allows us to populate longer graphics
cards just to make the intake a bit more
open and non restrictive and also rubber
grommets what rubber grommets on a
$69.00 enclosure five fans everything
that's so far that's coming about the z9
eel is impressive we have two SSD slots
here and on the back we have little
velcro straps for cables which is
normally not seen on on this case and we
usually never even see rubber grommets
which is awesome a power supply area
that's long enough
and a removable hard drive cage for two
drives with these weird shaped drive
caddies now looking at the bottom here
we do have a dust filter that is
removable underneath the power supply
and fairly large case feet with these
rubber pieces to prevent vibrations and
stuff but I'm noticing it's leaving a
bunch of marks on my white table so just
be worried of that so the last thing to
do is build a system into it I do not
foresee any issues with assembly but
well let's find out
ladies and gentlemen z9 Neal the system
is now complete first of all the system
looks really nice and clean I love power
supply brackets because they hide all
the cable mess that is coming out of the
power supply
I appreciate the cutouts everywhere
where possible and there's also if you
are going for the micro ATX layout there
are two rubber grommets underneath the
micro ATX board where the micro to
export would go however for a standard
ATX you use the cutouts on the power
supply bracket now do notice the blue
ambient LED coming from the two above
fans which gives off nice ambient glow
illumination for the interior it would
be cool to have two more in the front so
you can have this uniform illumination
however one thing that I really dislike
about the z9 eel as the fact that both
the top and the front fans use molex
connection for power so there is no
three pin and there's no a four pin you
know you cannot connect them to your
motherboard you cannot connect them to
your fan controller it sucks that you
cannot control the fans one other major
disappointment for me was the
installation of these SSDs it's awesome
that we have dedicated this as these
spots and usually we see like a little
SSD caddy that you can install the SSD
on it and attach the catechol case which
is very standard now here we only have
just a simple wall that you screw in the
SSDs to it's an okay system but one
major bite you have these two cutouts
which are on the right side of the SSD
so if you want the SS need to be
positioned the right way so it's not
upside down you have to use these
cutouts on the right side which means
it's very difficult to wire stuff in and
also because the fan is right in front
of that this is the versus the spot it's
very difficult to access so what you
have to do is rotate the SSD so it's
facing towards the motherboard area so
you can wire all the stuff appropriately
and these rubber grommets right on the
side there so cable management becomes
so much easier
however the SSD is now flipped quick
little shirt change in bar back at it I
love pretty much everything about the z9
neo except two things molex connections
for the fans what is that about give us
standard three-pin fan headers so we
connect the fans to the mother
bored and be done with it don't like the
small X approach the second thing is SSD
mounts I would love some type of caddy
installation so that you can remove them
without having to worry about having to
deal with all types of screws and also
cable management is a little bit off but
everything else about the z9 neo screams
good job with a nice window nice
internal layout with a power supply
shroud all the appropriate spots for
cable routing rubber grommets LED fans
are a little bit so and so you know we
don't have RGB so but please does add a
little bit ambience on here and cable
measurement at the back is all fine and
dandy and it was so close and rewarding
this case the damn good value a word
simply because we have so much in it but
if it wasn't for those molex fans it
gotten so close so close but guys that
is it for our review of the Zalman z-9
neo let us know if you agree with our
decision of not awarding this case a
damn good value or words simply because
of the Moloch's connections for the fans
is that justifiable in my eyes yes but
we'd love to hear your opinion I'm a
