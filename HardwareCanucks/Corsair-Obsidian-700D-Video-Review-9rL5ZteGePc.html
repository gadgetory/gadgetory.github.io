fall 2009 it revolutionized the high-end
computer chassis market it paired a
relatively simple but sleek look with an
interior design that catered directly to
the computer enthusiasts the case we're
looking at now the obsidian 700d is
virtually identical in almost every
aspect but it attempts to reduce cost by
doing away with a few of the novelty
editions we saw with the original the
700d became available as of spring 2010
and at the time of release it sits at
around 249 dollars
so with Corsair reducing the price of
the case we have to ask the question
have they compromised on quality well
let's take a look the construction is
the exact same as the 800 d with a solid
metal frame and body and classy brushed
aluminum front panel there is no change
in the weight or dimensions it still
tops the scale at a little over 35
pounds at the front you'll notice a lack
of the hot swappable drive bay door and
then five external drive bays front
connections are hidden behind a plastic
panel and include reset firewire for USB
and audio connections along with power
and activity LEDs along the top we have
this perfect space for ventilation with
room for 320 millimeter fans making it
the ideal place to put a water cooling
radiator and for those who aren't fans
of the side window the 700d has just a
plain black side but that's alright
because the paint job throughout the
case is absolutely exceptional rotating
to the back we have the panel quick
release tubing holes 140 millimeter
exhaust fan motherboard i o arian 7 PCI
slots along with some bottom venting and
then an area at the bottom for the power
supply
the case sits raised about an inch off
the ground and the bottom holes are
protected from dust by this very easy to
remove dust filter the quick tool list
design means no screws to open it up
just push the button and lift in our
bottom compartment the power supply sits
on raised rails there's additional space
for air flow and there is space at the
front for two additional hard drives
that can now be accessed without taking
off the front panel the most prominent
change that has been made is the ousting
of the hot swappable drive trick this
eliminates the access door on the front
leaving a smooth face and they've moved
in to use a screw --less caddy system
for the hard drives the trays are now
positioned perpendicular to the case
with the top four line vertically so
that they won't cause problems with air
flow they've also slipped this 140
millimeter fan underneath the top drives
so it works with the compartmentalized
air flow designed the top half of the
case is divided by a metal barrier which
has tubing holes for water cooling and a
hundred and forty millimeter intake fan
at the back while there is only seven
PCI slots they have included an exhaust
point underneath this is in case you
want to put a video card in your bottom
motherboard expansion slot we also have
the 140 millimeter exhaust fan the
motherboard tray supports all typical
sizes including EA TX and the back plate
opening works for all of them now you'll
also notice a large amount of space
between the top of the motherboard and
the case this makes it perfect amount in
internal radiator with fans without
having to do any sort of modifications
and at the front B screw list five and a
quarter inch drive base here's what
really sets this case apart it's what
Corsair has done for wiring they've cut
out openings all around the edges of
where a typical motherboard would sit
and installed rubber grommets this
allows your wires to run up the back and
cleanly out to the front in order to
minimize as much clutter as possible
they've designed it with plenty of room
in the back so you can have a clean
system really without a lot of effort
our smaller the normal motherboard does
look a little lost in the giant case but
check it out when we wire it all up
aside from a little color you barely
notice the wires are there the stalling
drives is very simple no screws just
clip it in on the sides and it's secure
slide it in and it's locked into place
now the great thing about having a case
so big is that larger Hardware will
never be a problem
our footlong HD 5970 fits in with a ton
of room to spare as we've touched on a
few times unless your water cooling the
700d isn't going to feel completely at
home this is one of the very features
Corsair has designed for you have the
ability to install larger interior or
exterior radiators you can hide other
things like pumps or reservoirs in the
bottom chamber and the space inside
where everything else is fantastic for
this purpose alone it is one of the best
cases on the market and that wraps up
our look at the Corsair obsidian 700d
our summary is much the same as it was
with the 800 deep Corsair has produced
an exceptional computer case they have a
well researched design that builds on
exactly what consumers and enthusiasts
are looking for the cable management is
by far the best and will work for
virtually any size or difficulty of
system you want to throw in it and to
top it off it has the renowned coarse
air quality and support as far as the
specific changes with the 700d go it's
more matter of personal preference and
this is where the only sort of criticism
comes in with the difference in cost
being only around $30 saving money
doesn't seem like it's going to be a
make-or-break decision for this case so
we have to ask was there a need to
produce a whole new case many
manufacturers produce simply a windowed
or non windowed version of the same part
number or they just have the opposite
side panel available separately and
given that getting rid of the hot swap
bays only saved us the price of a couple
lunches did people really not like the
original case that much because of them
now don't get me wrong I love the 700d
and the fact that Corsair has given
consumers more choices to get exactly
what they want so it receives the
hardware connects damn good award so
until next time this has been a hardware
connect sporadic showcase thanks for
