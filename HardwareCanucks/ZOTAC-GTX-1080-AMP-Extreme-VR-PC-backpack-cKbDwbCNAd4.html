ducks right now we're at ZOTAC booth the
GTX 280s came out so they have two cards
and one of the coolest experiences with
an actual VR backpack so let's talk
about that now
if you love what you see from the show
Nvidia fantex NCIX and ms I made this
computational so ZOTAC will have two gtx
280s the amp and the amp extreme it
still features its signature look
gunmetal gray color metal shroud which
wraps around the PCB which is custom and
it's huge around 12 inches it has dual 8
pin power 10+2 power phase dual 100
millimeter fans a5 copper heat pipes two
of which are eight millimeters and three
are six millimeters we have spectral
lighting which is a dual tax fancy
wording for well everybody's come up
trying to come up with some fancy way to
describe lighting this is not RGB is
going to be preset of seven colors
moving on to the gtx 980m extreme this
one has an eco fan which is their dual
blade fan design so it has more airflow
so the second blades allowed to keep the
air down where the heatsink is also
features spectral lighting with more
spots on the shroud and also now on the
backplate with that amp extreme in there
it has six heat pipes four of which are
eight millimeters and two of which are
six dual eight pins just like on the amp
ten plus two power phase it has power
boost just like the amp Edition as well
which is a special capacitor to
stabilize the power when you overclock
and a wraparound backplate it is a two
and a half inch slot card so it's
gigantic definitely to accommodate for
case clearance and we hope that those
gtx 980 chips will be over-the-top bins
and as usual no information on clocks
but it will feature the same i/o same a
gigabytes haven't seen anything
different but new custom cooler from
ZOTAC but a really cool awesome thing we
saw today also is the VR backpack so the
VR backpack is actually pretty cool
because it is wireless you have to trip
over the wires and everything is
contained within a very light unit so
unlike the MSI we saw earlier this one
is fabric it has two fans on one side
there blower style fans and one more on
the different side so it's got a 16
thousand milliamp hour battery with up
to two hours of battery life with a VR
time with a game and we're told that the
batteries are swappable so perhaps if
you're walking around
very sighs you can simply easily just
pop it out of course those batteries are
giant so it's not gonna be an accessible
thing but the fact that we don't have
need wires hanging out anywhere is
awesome the specs for the backpack are
directly taken from their smallest VR
ready PC that is also water-cooled nine
eighty by five a gigabytes of RAM m dot
two slot and a pretty nice little
package for all the VR goodness so that
concludes our coverage here is ZOTAC
that VR backpack man that's so awesome
not having any cables and just I didn't
feel like that I was wearing a computer
on my back which is awesome I hope you
guys enjoyed it and we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
