guys it's finally time RX Vega is
finally here I've said finally like
three times what's up guys Eber here
with hurricane ex and I'm here in Los
Angeles California covering AMD's rising
tech day event it has been pretty
exciting time for me this is my first
tech day event so I'm a little bit I'm
getting used to the city it's my first
time I really have explode that much but
regardless of that AMD has finally
unveiled specs for the rx of a GPU and
as well we've got more info on AMD's
wise and thread Ripper CPUs that will be
a topic for another video we still have
a lot more coverage for thread Ripper
coming very soon so this videos going to
be focused on vacant GPUs and so here's
what you need to know now every biggity
view is based off the Vega 10
architecture which consists of twelve
point five billion transistors on a 14
nanometer manufacturing process when you
compare this to HBM one that's two times
the memory bandwidth per pin 8 times
capacity per stack and it's supposedly
3.5 times more power efficient than
gddr5 the first GP that was showcase was
the Radeon rx Vegas 64
it comes with 64 next-gen compute units
4096 stream processors base clock of 12
47 megahertz and a boost of 1546 with 8
gigabytes of HBM 2 high bandwidth cache
memory from a physical standpoint this
is probably one of the best-looking
Radeon cards that have come across a
long time and I'm actually really diggin
the metal shroud along with the bagel
logo it looks pretty cool in my opinion
but I'd like to hear your thoughts about
the design in the description down below
now there are three variants of the
Ark's Vegas 64 GPU that you should be
aware of starting with the standard
model that sports a similar reference
design from the arts 480 so you're
getting the same plastic shroud in the
blower style fan then we move on to the
limited edition GPU that essentially
sports the same specs as the reference
model but now you're getting a metal
shroud that's built really well it comes
with the wake of branding so if you're
into that then this would be it the
black ship model is the RX Vega 64
liquid cool GPU which features slightly
higher specs compared to the air-cooled
model and we'll get to that in a moment
lastly AMD did announce a slightly
cut-down version of the Vega 64 GPU so
say hello to
the RX Vega 56 specs wise this GPU
sports 3584 stream processors a slightly
lower base clock up 11 56 megahertz vs.
12 47 on the Vega 64 GPU
there are also less next-gen compute
units lower teraflops of compute
performance and a slightly lower memory
bandwidth now when you take a look at
the specs of the liquid-cooled the vega
64 GPU things start to get a little
interesting the base clock is roughly
200 megahertz higher than the air-cooled
model but the boost clock gets as far as
1677 megahertz which is pretty
interesting to see on an AMD GPU
performance wise AMD to showcase a few
charts at 1440p and 4k comparing the
vega 64 GPU to the gtx 1080 now I'm not
100% sure as to which GPU is used to run
those benchmarks so I'm not aware of
whether it was the air-cool GPU or the
liquid-cooled GPU again if you look at
the spec difference between both goes
both cards they are quite significant so
again I can't give you guys my full
verdict on performance so you guys have
to stay tuned for our full performance
review which will be coming up very
shortly and the last thing that I wanted
to cover is pricing for these new GPS
because I'm aware that a lot of you guys
are excited for RX Vega and pricing
strategies so let's kick things off with
Vega 56
it's priced at $400 the Vega 64 GPU is
priced at $500 and that's going to get
you the standard reference designs so
not the limited edition design ok so
here's where things get a little
interesting aim d-did in Vail of these
exclusive Radeon packs specifically
designed for the RX Vega of 64
liquid-cooled GPU the rx Vega of
sixty-four limited edition GPU and the
RX Vega 56 GPU there are primarily three
tax the baseline pack is the red pack
then we move on to the black pack and
then the final top of the line pack is
the aqua pack so let's kick things off
with the right pack it costs $500 so
it's $100 more than what you'd actually
pay for the RX 56 Vega GPU by itself but
$100 more you'd be getting a voucher
discount for certain components so in
this case you get $200 off a fleecing
monitor $100 off a rising seven CPU
paired with an X 370 based motherboard
and two free games
stepping things up to the black pack it
costs $600 and it comes with the limited
edition GPU so early adopters who are
you know right on board when pre-order
hits would end up getting the limited
edition GPU but once they run out of
stock for that particular model then
when people who buy the people who get
the black pack would end up getting the
reference cooler for the RX Vega 64 GPU
the voucher program still remains the
same so you have $200 of the monitor
$100 up you rise and some CPU paired
with the x3 70 motherboard and 240 games
the top-of-the-line Radeon pack aka the
aqua pack is priced around $700 and it
comes with the Vegas 64 liquid-cooled
GPU and the voucher program that I
mentioned earlier now I have mixed
feelings about this deal like this deal
with Radeon packs because I'm not super
excited about it while I'm also not
disappointed about it because I know
people who are looking to build a system
based off a rising platform might end up
leaning towards this you know this packs
because you do get certain discounts
with other boards and monitors so it can
be considered a positive but for people
who are already walking you know
fleecing monitors with license systems
might have to pay the additional cost up
front to get the liquid glue GPU or even
the limited edition GPU so I'm not
really sure why MD decided to do it this
way because you know it's really
confusing they could have just given a
standalone
liquid-cooled GPUs and limited edition
GPUs for just the cost of those GPS and
not include that extra hundred ala
premium for just a voucher program it
just doesn't make any sense
to me personally but some of you guys
might you know be excited about it again
let me know what you guys think about
this whole way down facts in the
comments down below well that concludes
my coverage of the way down Rx of Vega
GPUs I want to hear your thoughts about
these new video cards are you excited
about it are you excited about the specs
of these new cards let us know in the
comments down below and I want to leave
you guys on one note if you go back to
the spec sheet comparing the Vega 56 to
60 for limited edition and the 64
liquid-cooled Edition take a look at the
power draw line and let me know what you
guys think about that in the comments
down below because
I'm really excited to test that out
again I'm evil retard Connex thank you
