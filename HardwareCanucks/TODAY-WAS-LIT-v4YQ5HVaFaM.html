7:00 a.m. that's how we usually start
over here we got Michael out for our
usual breakfast run Hugh example way too
early like 6:00 a.m. and well look who's
back
breakfast boys breakfast is here
Bieber's not even put 100 it's a
Cinnabon yeah but with like in Taiwanese
Flair mm-hmm you can't say anything
about us no trying you know
thank goodness I'm kidding
I'm gonna split up again with these boys
gotta miss you I'm gonna miss you too
Oh like what about you look like you're
about to kiss
vertigo yes yes you know it's always
awesome to be running into people
especially literally he stepped on me so
a few interesting things here at EVGA a
new 1000 watt power supply which is the
world's smallest so think that
Silverstone it's all because the new
transformer has been minimized compared
to the old ones these are slightly
bigger so this one is more power
efficient and runs cooler which is why
they're able to achieve such a tiny form
factor for 1,000 watts oh man check out
this view Taipei 101 and they also have
a new BIOS so here one cool thing about
this one is you can stress test the CPU
directly from the BIOS so you don't have
to restart going to your benchmark and
this is a prime 95 equivalent so we get
our CPU temperature voltage CPU
frequency and a last time a little graph
over here for that visual presentation
and yeah you can benchmark and overclock
directly from the BIOS they've also
improved on the auto overclocking
ability so now it's called the overclock
robot or the OC robot it cycles between
different CPU frequency and voltages
also gives us a temperature readout it's
improved and if you guys are interested
to see our order overclocking
motherboards ideo check it out right
over here you know it's always fun to
come to a booth and experience some csgo
obviously the gaming stations are set up
it became a bad thing to not experience
them right so you're gonna show them how
I spell the news oh my god this mouse is
way too high DPI who is playing here
get killed so here we are trying to do
some Bureau of these drives and real
scouting locations and eibar man this
guy's so creative check this out you
just lost it Wow yeah this is what
you're shooting the drive on top of the
case but look at this texture it's
brilliant well done man
and now Eber found the most interesting
place to put a micro SD card inside a
keyboard b-roll does not get any better
than this
our first time at Taipei 101 we're going
up to the 36th floor to see gigabyte and
the view from there is actually pretty
incredible okay now you can
Eva what are you laughing about no tell
me tell me what so nobody can steal your
components at a LAN party see the
temperature difference between inside
and outside is so significant that the
since we walk out the lens fogs up so
you guys have mentioned that we haven't
gone to any local cuisine restaurants so
we are going to attempt an yaki
restaurant now are you guys excited for
teppanyaki yeah I need food I just need
I'm Oh soon that's where we're going
Eve are you playing this no not latest
or probably I am
okay that's pretty cool nice I like this
place already
maybe I am happy I wore pants yes okay
