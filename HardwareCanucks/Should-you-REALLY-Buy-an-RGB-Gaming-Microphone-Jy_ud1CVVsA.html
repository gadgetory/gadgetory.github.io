streamers is not such an outrageous idea
given the massive growth in that
streaming sector but it is becoming
evidently clear that gaming companies go
too far to create a product that caters
to their target audience with an
overload of features that to me sabotage
the product itself and so today we're
talking about the Asus Magnus streamers
microphone it's also a sound card it's
also USB hub and it's also this RGB
illumination thingy and also depending
on your humor level insert your
deodorant stick joke here although the
Magnus looks so out of place anywhere
but your gaming station because of the
edgy looks but to me this rog design
direction is awful it's different but
it's awful so then how does this 200
plus dollar microphone fit within our
vocal needs let's find out right after
this so it was kind of a love at first
sight you know there's really nothing
like this exterior I love the metallic
color the tinted glass panel the RGB
fans at the front it's basically a
see-through case and who doesn't love
that your graphics card can go vertical
the top is ready at a friendly and the
right side is so unique when exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
aged 500 p weight Coolermaster check it
out inscription below okay so first of
all the metallic shell and the leather
like material in between is a bit
misleading visually because it looks so
premium and like aluminium and leather
but it is all plastic the microphone has
no weight to it and the shape is awkward
for on desk use despite issues claims
this to be 50% smaller than the
competition I still find the blue Yeti
and the audio technica at2020 and the
razer microphones to be more desk
friendly because the Magnus is a USB
microphone with a truly terrible side
cable exit that is junkie with that
angle or plastic tip and the braided
cable is not long enough at only 1.5
meters so if you have your PC little bit
further away no luck it is also super
thick it kinks easily and because the
mic is so light it's actually difficult
to find a good position for it on your
desk
because of that cable drag one walk
around of course is to mount it on the
mic
understand but that only highlights the
terrible USB port location and that
whole cable exit the RGB elements are
all for the show of course the air
control 3d or a software nice and simple
but there is also a physical lighting
switch on the actual body that I find
pointless and it cycles between static
breathing and the RGB cycle oh and
there's also a bottom firing LED that is
not visible when it's on a flat surface
but it does illuminate whatever is
underneath it if you're mounting it on
the stand
and so this lighting side is supposed to
face the camera when you're streaming
for that AC recognition and this part
facing you because that's how the mic
capsules are installed here we get a
headphone jack with a volume wheel for
this headphone port and mic mute button
that goes red when active on the other
side there is an auxilary import for
connecting instruments or other media
and the dial for microphone sensitivity
or gain and there are three stages on
that dial but I would prefer numbers so
it'd be easier to dial in your perfect
sensitivity every time and we also have
a USB 2.0 pass through port on the side
for peripherals or USB sticks and I find
that completely hilarious but hey it's a
gaming product so I might as well
connect something to it right and
finally there are three recording modes
cardioid which is what you'll be
listening to now there's a stereo mode
and also noise cancelling and what
you've been hearing so far has been
recorded with the Magnus in the cardioid
pattern
I think the signal is super clean there
is no digital noise even if I boost the
game through the dial the only thing is
because the microphone is quite
sensitive you have to reduce the gain
and move it closer to you the way I have
it set up right now can like underneath
your mouth in front of your keyboard so
that not too much of the ambient sound
is picked up then switching over to the
stereo mode it's only good when it's
flat on your desk because check this out
so the left and right channels are
switched in my ear but because you're
looking this at a flipped image like you
would on a stream this is a clever
integration from a soos to also switch
those left and right channels so that
what you're hearing is correct to the
visuals and so if you have the
microphone upside down then the left and
right channels would be messed up and if
you had this on a boom arm on the side
then your left and right would be up in
there
and would totally mess up the whole
stereo mode so it's only good when it's
placed right in front of you on the flat
surface pretty good and finally the
third profile works really good to mute
the background noises so the microphone
is not picking up my very loud heater
that is heating up the space you can
still hear my voice clearly but that hum
in the background is no longer audible
but now let's switch to the cardioid and
of course you can hear that stuff in the
background clearly alright so how does
the Magnus stand compared to other
microphones and what you listen to now
is the son Heiser game one by far my
favorite gaming headset because of a
quality boom microphone it's rich its
detailed it's close by it's not like
ambient distant sound this is the mod
like five I love this one because it's
modular so I can attach it to any pair
of headphones so my HD 6 X X plus my HD
800 both have the little magnetic thing
so I can interchange them and you know
just attach the mod mic there what
you're hearing now is the Sun Howser MD
46 it has fantastic background
compression
it's a cardioid microphone as well just
like this one and but it requires an XLR
interface to be recorded into something
and so let me switch back to the magnets
now so you guys can hear a little bit of
a difference in terms of how these two
microphones pick up my voice differently
and what you listen to now is my
favorite condenser microphone the AEG c3
one for it's a fantastic one I do all my
voiceovers with this one it's got this
really nice rich backup it's good for my
voice and let's go back to the Magnus so
you guys can compare to see which one
you like the best I think this one's a
bit more ambient to pick up clearer as
well but this one has a bit more
compression from the vocals of course
it's XLR based as well but I would say
for more you know serious streamers they
would have some sort of audio interface
that they can plug in multiple devices
and have those manual controls in terms
of levels and adjustments and stuff on
that so this whole USB direction I would
say is simplified and while it is
catering to that streamers audience
perhaps it's not catering to the really
professional streamers audience I don't
know let me know if you agree all right
so I'm gonna conclude by saying that the
microphone quality is really good and
you guys be the judge of that
the cardioid pattern is
for clarity detail and just regular
ambient pick up the headphone output
port is awesome so it's like a sound
card slash microphone built into one but
I think Asus kind of overcomplicated
this product for a few reasons one the
extra USB port is absolutely unnecessary
I will never plug anything in here and
you know if you have a USB stick or
something from data like it looks
ridiculous especially because on the
other side we have the giant angular
cable coming out so design aspect of it
are not ideal especially because they
also added the lighting button that is
unnecessary since everything is
controlled through the software anyway
and lastly because no stand is included
I think that's a big mistake because the
microphone is otherwise not properly
grounded on your desk and can easily be
moved and just like flipped over on your
desk
simply because of that thick cable so
I'm gonna include some microphone
options down in the description below
that you can check out for streaming or
just regular recording that are more
convenient than this guy but of course
if you love our GB if you love ROG and
want to go with the whole gaming
direction then yeah the Magnus may be
for you so let me know what you think of
the quality of this microphone and would
you buy one if you're building yourself
a streaming setup or something like that
why or why not leave them in the
