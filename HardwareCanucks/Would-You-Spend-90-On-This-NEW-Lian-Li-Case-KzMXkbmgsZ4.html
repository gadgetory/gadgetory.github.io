check out what they have for the new
cases the new PC over hair and the
standing said this but first huge thanks
to fantex Thermaltake and Coolermaster
for making our Computex trip possible
what's up guys I'm Dimitri our Canucks
and we are here at Lee and Lee so we
first saw this case back at CES they
were showing off this front panel design
a little prototype get your feedback to
see if it was any good and yeah now we
have the final product this is the land
cool one
so land cool used to be a separate brand
now it's partly and Lee which is why
you'll see a lien Lee logo on the power
supply shroud we first initially thought
what the hell land land cool is like a
separate thing but no it is now just the
land cool series part of me and Lee
so here going very minimalist design
focus on air flow because of this like
really open front section ventilation on
both sides and the it's kind of just
minimalist approach they're trying to
enter that whole standardized case
market and I think they have some really
good features that work well for this
price point so there'll be two models
available the $89 and the $99 the more
expensive one you get a type C port and
addressable RGB for the front whereas
with the standards $89 model there is no
type C and the standard RGB at the front
so I am spending a lot of time on the
front panel because that's kind of the
highlight of the case it's got an
aluminum facade we have RGB lighting
built-in that looks beautiful it's
ambient it's not harsh there's this very
large diffusion element interior so it
kind of spills in the middle it lights
up the fans I love this approach built
in case lighting you can change the LEDs
color and mode with a little button on
the i/o which by the way there are also
two USB 3 ports and your audio jacks for
89 bucks we get a tempered glass side
panel it has captive thumb screws the
panel slides back out so it's got the
similar approach as with the ulema
dynamic but has little clips inside the
panel so they slide into the frame so
the panel is not going anywhere I do
appreciate the mounting mechanism on the
rear side panel that allows you to
compress the cables which is awesome so
you don't have to fiddle around with
sliding the panel in that is awesome
the top panel is removable it
kind of like a coarse dust filter the
actual fan mounting location is pretty
diverse you can do three 120 member fans
but not really recommended for 360 rad
up here up to 280 maximum for radiator
the front however can support the 360
rad no problem we have a removable power
supply shroud piece of the front so you
can fit all your additional fans there
so coming inside your a few things
you'll notice it's very minimal we have
a ATX motherboard support so it will
reach exactly where the rubber grommet
stops so that's awesome you don't need
additional like you know cutouts for
that we have two SSD caddies on top of
the power supply shroud so you can stall
extra drives there or you can simply
remove those brackets and we have this
additional area for fans so you can do
two 120 millimeter fans that will
deliver fresh air for the GPU a little
extra cooling something we haven't seen
from any other case manufacturer here we
have two fans per case two vertical GPU
brackets kinda stand there deal you know
power supply shroud is non removable and
here in the back we have the little
controller into which you plug in the
LED switch so you can actually cycle
between colors the default cable
management is already pre routed but I
would suggest for them to install a
second row of these velcro straps so you
can route that on a separate layer and
route all your thick or thicker cables
where the cable Rawat's are located
finally the hard drive cage is removable
it has two slots no caddies here you
simply insert your hard drive in there
and it has a little bit the flexibility
on maneuverability so you can move it
away from the front panel for that
additional clearance so there is a power
supply that's filter top dust filter
front desk filter everything is filtered
good stuff so the LAN cool one is an
exciting product from Lee and Lee
they're you know entering the like the
mass market with these type of
enclosures not exactly their aluminum
strive as we've come to know them but of
course we have a little bit of that
aluminum facade at the front the
addressable or standard RGB is awesome
very basic interior I don't see any like
glaring flaws and but obviously you get
to know the case once you build in it so
make sure to subscribe to see my review
when this thing gets to make
ah good people so this is the Liam Lee
PCO 11 err so I personally have the
dynamic you guys can check out the
review here I absolutely love that case
and we finally get to see the finished
version of the air so this is the price
points are very attractive $129 it's
just as much as the dynamic but here it
is obviously airflow focused will come
with two 120mm fans at the front for
that 1:29 version but the slightly
higher version at 149 will come with
five fans in total three RGB and two
standards at the front the three RGB
fans are like you know stand alone so
you can populate them anywhere you want
and you can check out our video about
the 9th fan installation to get an idea
of where to install the fans but the
cool thing about this one airflow
focused all those dust filtration I
really like this kind of like stealth
design and clean lines it kinda reminds
me something of like I know like a
Batman case because the top has that
slight angle the front also comes out
there and the only difference between
this one is the rear because now we can
install two or eighty millimeter fans in
the back to help with that additional
frontal airflow but obviously you
probably won't need it if you populate
all other fan slots yeah
so the Liam Lee TCO 11 air is going to
be out when is out so it's going to be
out end of June so make sure to stay
tuned for our full review so people this
is the Razer Edition Liam Lee TCO 11
dynamic it's been modified so there is
an actual LED RGB strip over here but
because of the glass this is it turns
RGB glass it turns glass into large
what that's just crazy all right people
so this is Liam Lee's standing desk
computer build so you can put your
components inside yeah so this is
actually quite popular and what they've
done here is try to make it a little bit
more accessible and I'm raising this so
you guys can see how high this thing can
go I think it's over four feet so it's a
perfect sit-stand desk plus you can put
your computer inside so the thing with
this one it's going to be a lot more
affordable than the previous dk4 desk so
this is $1,000 while it may seem quite
expensive
the dk4 is 1,500 so definitely that $500
shaved is a definitely good deal try to
get more market share within this type
of product so here we have this gigantic
glass panel it can accommodate an e ATX
system the motherboard tray is removable
you can install up to a 420 known the
radiator and a 240 rad as well plenty of
space in the power supply area so
obviously you're not going to be
utilizing most of it but you can
potentially I can remove the glass like
stash little things in there you know
customize it make it your own
and obviously have this like full visual
presentation of your Hardware of your
hard work for water cooling and it's
obviously mechanized so it's kind of a
really good all-in-one deal if you are
potentially looking for sit-stand desk
into which you can populate your PC now
the thing is the glass it's not attached
to anything it just simply sits on top
of this and like these are rubber pieces
on top and Wow the i/o is actually kind
of cool it's right beside your
controller so all your access will be in
one spot and for the final revision on
the i/o they will add a Type C
connection that will be gen 2 because it
is within the reachable distance to the
motherboard to meet that length spec
also it is Canadian winter approved
because of the radiator fans that sit
right on the side there and if you set
the fans to exhaust they'll be coming
right into your body
the total weight supported on this one
is 80 kilograms so it's not an issue
populating like an extreme system in
there plus your monitor and all your
peripherals and potentially even
speakers so this little tiny desk will
accomodates you know whatever setup that
you might pursue so this is the new desk
from Manley a thousand bucks no name yet
but will be available in q4 alright guys
so that is it for Lee and Lee let us
know what you think of the 610 desk and
super excited to get my hands on that PC
or air so that we can do some careful
testing and see exactly how much you
know better cooling we can get so make
sure the subscribe check out this other
Robin content and we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
