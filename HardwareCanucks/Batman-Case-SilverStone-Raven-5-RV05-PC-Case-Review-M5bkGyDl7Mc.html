great technology selections and service
hello everyone we get another Raven
chassis from Silverstone that looks the
part of the Raven with those accentuated
angles and that armored feel that the
series has always carried so this is the
Raven 5 priced at $115 omits our
companion that Silverstone is really
proud of with much reduced volume
compared to the first Raven yet with the
same rotated monitor design to
complement the cooling and I'm going to
say this up front the Ravens 5 is not
meant to do everything well and it sure
doesn't but instead it's a chassis
that's not afraid to be unique and those
who can keep the limitations in mind are
bound to avoid disappointment and
actually encounter satisfying results
now the exterior plastics are just plain
plastics nothing rubberized here and it
brings the cheap feeling to the case the
side window is one of the things they
have always misplaced as it reveals
unnecessary internals and the window on
our sample wasn't fully secured and
rattled with slight knock or vibration
on the case at the rear we get
ventilation for your power supply notice
missing filter but no worries is
actually included in the accessory pouch
and is magnetic so just simply attach to
the case and remove for cleaning is
needed the raven 5 is well elevated with
rubberized case feet and notice the
large dust filter spanning the entire
floor that's conveniently removed from
the front behind which we get the stars
of the show these are dual 180
millimeter air penetrators with
outstanding CFM and directional airflow
although they are a little bit loud and
since hot air rises the Raven series has
always utilized this one directional
airflow tunnel for outstanding thermals
and take at the bottom and exhaust at
the top very simple there are mounting
holes for triple 120 member fans in case
you'd want to install a water cooler but
we would advise against as the sole
reasoning behind this impressive cooling
are those air penetrators coming to the
top we find a removable cover with large
ventilation but no dust filter here
pyaare buttons at the front plus behind
this rubber cover are a pair of USB
ports and audio jacks there are two fan
control switches up top for low and high
speed auto placement of these is
uncomfortable exterior location would
make more sense this is an ATX mid tower
with only seven PCI slots and an exhaust
fan mount Alto with internal mounting
only as the frame restricts clearance
anything above it given the rotated
motherboard design over the cable will
exit through the top and route it behind
the chassis and while this design allows
outstanding cooling bear in mind the
uncomfortable nature of needing to take
off the top cover every time you need to
access your rear i/o slot or the top I
use locks and this space also adds about
two and a half inches to the height of
the chassis making it taller but also
notice these handles for really simple
transportation each side panel removes
up with this release mechanism and then
you just pull upwards but the side
panels are really stiff inside the
housing so simple pull will not get the
job done at least on our sample I had to
take off the rear panel off-camera with
the case on the floor so I really would
prefer simple thumb screws for the job
and so this is the layout where sort of
used to with front intake fans and
silverstone has gone ahead and rotated
the motherboard 90 degrees to take
advantage of rising hot air the
internals are low cramped considering
it's only 61 liters in volume and also
notice how the rear slightly elevated
for this angled lock I actually like
that now there are a few compromises
here like the power supply must not
exceed 170 millimeters in length if you
still want to utilize the three and a
half inch drive gauge that is right
below it the cage does support two
drives and I'm surprised this wasn't
made to us as there are mounting holes
up top and below the cage to secure your
drive which is very inconvenient the
cage is removable that would allow
longer power supplies but this gets rid
of any three and a half inch storage
potential so choose appropriate power
supply for your build in order to avoid
this sort of compromise as for GPU
clearance there is just over 12 inches
available and that would say blower
style GPUs are just slightly more ideal
to compliment airflow
direction and the refined to SSD mounts
with enough spacing for connectivity an
optical drive mount is the Raven five
actually has a stealth opening in the
front so those still using discs are not
forgotten and checking out the build
with appropriate hardware the Ravens
five was actually pretty straight
forward to working with our 160
millimeter power supply cabling exits
through the large opening right beside
it plus there's another cutout for the
large 24 pin cable and I use this space
also for the PCI Express cables and
that's one thing to keep in mind route
your graphics cables away from the GPU
cooler side and also make sure they
don't obstruct air flow for the CPU
cooler either I didn't have to pre route
the a pin CPU cable right behind the
motherboard before installation but
that's not really a big deal and while
it's not the easiest cable management
round you'll be fine with some patience
CPU towers up to 160 millimeters in
height are supported and going with some
Noctua heat sinks is probably the ideal
configuration here to take advantage of
this excellent air tunnel and it's when
we come around to the back things get a
little more hectic as there is nowhere
to really tuck your cables and this is
where silverstone needs to get back to
the drawing board as you can see the
cables are a little bit out of control
and I had trouble closing the side panel
now coming back to that window as you
can see it could be less revealing at
the bottom and move slightly up for a
better presentation of your hardware and
what we have here with the Raven 5 is an
absolute cooling powerhouse with just
two fans thanks to the rotating
motherboard design I found working with
in limited space surprisingly without
too much hassle and I appreciate easy
removal dust filters at the rear and the
bottom now I've mentioned it earlier the
Raven isn't designed to do it all but I
feel like the drive cage could have been
different to allow longer power supplies
to be installed regardless as that is
the compromise you have to face the
exterior plastics I wish for coated with
something that presents a more quality
feel and the fan controllers are
internal so not as accessible as they
could have been and I would like to see
top dust filter as the dust settles in
when the machine is powered off and this
Raven is not entirely unique as it is a
fifth iteration within the series but it
invite minimalistic air-cooled builds
where thermals are priority and it's
only when considering the multitude of
cases in this price bracket the raven
flies away into the abyss with too many
compromises and limitations for the
price but what do you guys think of this
latest Raven does it excite you because
this form and internal layout or it's
just old news and just another Raven let
us know by commenting below we'd love to
hear what you think don't forget to

you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
