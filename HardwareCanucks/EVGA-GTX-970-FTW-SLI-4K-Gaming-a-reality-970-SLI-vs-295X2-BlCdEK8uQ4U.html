only a few months away from the one-year
anniversary of the year of 4k
proclamation back at CES 2014 that was
the year where display manufacturers
were promising that we would have this
world full of beautiful and compact
pixels and so far they have delivered as
a plethora of T and 4k goodness but it
was on the backs of GPU manufacturers to
keep up with the ever rising demand for
pixels and I think it's safe to say that
there is now a cost-effective answer
Mount Vesuvius the volcano of heat aka
the AMD r9 295x2 was the first
mainstream affordable card quote-unquote
that was capable of pushing 4k while in
vidya 7 70s and 7 80s in sli could
barely keep up with it so it was the
king of GPUs for a while and only the
real option if you wanted to game in all
that beautiful 4k goodness priced at
over $1000 at release however this
affordable option wasn't really all that
affordable to the mainstream prices have
lowered closer to one thousand point
after Nvidia launched in 1980 and the
970 GPUs that changed everything
the 970 is able to push borderline
playable frame rates minimum of 30 FPS
at Ultra settings in most games at
around $350 each of these GPUs performs
extremely well and are insanely
efficient you can see our review of
these here
however EVGA has really stepped up to
push the adoption of 4k and 1440p gamers
prices are significantly less than 295x2
the question is are two of these GPUs in
sli capable of keeping pace with the
current power leader
well first looking at EVGA s new GPU the
GTX 970 FTW or for the win Edition we
see that they have completely redesigned
their ACX cooler the heatsink follows
that 970 s architectural lead by
becoming even more efficient than their
predecessors it's made offense 36%
quieter 26% cooler
with an insane 400% longer lifespan off
the fans by using swept fan blades
double ball bearings and an extremely
low power motor these fans are capable
delivering even more airflow with less
power
overall this means that EVGA can take
the power savings and throw it back into
the GPU or clocking the core to 12 16
megahertz base clock and 1367 boost
clock with vrm at 7 gigahertz affected
clock speeds paired with the added
features the Nvidia supports like
dynamic super resolution which is
basically an enhancement by rendering in
4k but down sampling to the native
resolution of your monitor these GPUs
are pure monsters and throwing two of
these in our test rig and we can finally
see how they handle 4k resolutions in
some of the newest games so eibar take
it away all right so this is the fun
part
starting with Assassin's Creed Black
Flag we are running at a resolution of
3840 by 2160 everything maxed out and
where the results are playable but most
importantly look at how it just stacks
up against the 295x2 next is battlefield
4 on ultra settings again running at
that 4k resolution
hitting over 40 frames per second and
again we see impressive results against
the 295x2 Far Cry 3 is a lot of fun and
handling highest settings no problem and
hitting much better scores with the 970
in SLI than that peasley tune in ffx-2
showing some real potential for 4k
gaming assassin's creed unity was the
only real exception at the time of
testing Ubisoft was in the process of
correcting some major gameplay issues
it's not every day when you see people
disappear into a graded path and
suddenly fall into the abyss of
nothingness the frame rates were also
grossly affected by issues however the
Nvidia enabled features like the
lighting and textures are breathtaking
overall the sli pair ebj 970 a CX 2.0
cards are a force to be reckoned with at
around $750 for a pair or 375 each these
cards are beasts in our limited
benchmarks a pair of 970 s managed to
beat the 295x2 in two games but
lower average in Far Cry 3 so what does
this mean for the state of 4k outside of
limited TN panels 4k gaming is becoming
real and not a luxury
coupled with dynamic super resolution
for delivering 4k quality graphics to
your sub 4k panel we are starting to see
everything come into place it may almost
be December but we might be finally
seeing the year of 4k come to reality as
