and let me tell you it sure is what the
wait
MV wizened processors are finally here
what's up guys
ibrahim our connects and today we are
finally taking a look at AMD's a most
anticipated processor revival with the
rising 7 Series launch now I know a lot
of you guys are still pumped with the
benchmarks but before we proceed to that
segment understanding the key basics of
this microarchitecture is important
we'll only be showcasing and
benchmarking the r7 1800 X which is the
current rise and slash of CPU and I'll
eventually push that to its paces
against Intel's latest and most
expensive offerings plus as soon as we
get our hands on the 1700 and the 1700 X
CPUs a follow-up video will be posted
but before we get into this a quick
message from our sponsor you can only
rely on the pros to do the job with
every keystroke satisfying like the
millions before
quality killed every key regardless of
your faith
hula master master keys bro they could
listen make it real let's start off with
some incredible achievements with the
news and architecture MD wanted to
increase the instructions per clock over
the excavator cores by 40% but the end
result is a staggering 52 percent IPC
increase bringing MD into direct
competition against Intel's Broadwell
counterparts expect strong single and
multi threaded performance from the r7
series of CPUs and that single thread
uplift will be key since it was an area
and his previous architecture struggled
in spec wise aim D is poised to launch
an entire lineup right away at the top
of the stack is the 1800 X which is an 8
core processor with 16 threads these
rising processors are actually Indies
first to use a form of simultaneous
multi-threading technology which allows
each core to produce two concurrent
processing threads the horizon 7 1800
exa has a base clock of 3.6 gigahertz it
can boost up to 4 gigahertz or 4.1 given
thermals are under control and there's a
total combined cache of 20 megabytes
those are pretty impressive numbers
given it has claimed TDP of just 95
watts compared to 140 watts on the 6900
K from Intel I also have to mention in
these incredibly competitive price of
$500 making the r7 1800 X the most
powerful and affordable 16 thread
processor ever made it also happens to
be literally half the price of intel's
closest competitor the i7 6900 K
meanwhile the 1700 X uses basically the
same eight cores sixteen thread design
but it runs at a slightly lower
frequency and it has a lower price of
$400 I personally think this will end up
being the sweet spot for the 5:07 lineup
finally there's the very similar Rison 7
1700 with it's a very sweet price of 329
USD but it's clock speeds may present a
challenge for anyone looking for a
gaming sieve you remember many games
require high frequencies for optimal
performance but this processor could be
great for larger parallel workloads one
of the most interesting stories behind
Rison is in
these sent mi which includes
technologies like precision boost pure
power and extended frequency range
precision boosts basically allows the
processor clock speeds to responded
extremely quick intervals to changes in
loads or internal temperatures pure
power meanwhile ensures that the cores
enter a low-power state when they are
needed which lowers overall power
consumption
speaking of temperatures if the
processor senses that it has additional
thermal Headroom it will extend
frequencies between 100 megahertz and 50
megahertz above maximum precision to
speed in single flight scenarios this
XFR or extended frequency range benefits
from low temperatures which means it is
extremely important to keep your
processor cool now you may have noticed
that some of these processors have an ex
attached to their name while others
don't that X indicates how far a rise in
seven processors xfr extends CPUs
without the X can go 50 meters above
their position to speed while the 1800 X
and the 1700 X can hit 100 mega faster
it's also important to note that aim G's
rise in CPUs are built around the new m4
platform with a new 1331 socket and ddr4
support aim for is not backwards
compatible with older generation CPUs
but AMD has made sure to build their new
platform with future proofing in mind to
support upcoming some generation AP use
or the Ravens rich AP use based on the
Zen architecture so expect this platform
to last through 2020 this gives
motherboard manufacturer is an
opportunity to create different
solutions starting with the entry-level
a 320 or a /b 302 mid-range B 352
premium X 370 or X 300 boards these
motherboards feature the latest IO
including nvme pcie 3.0 X 4 SATA SATA
Express dual-channel ddr2 View SB 3.1
gen2 and more I'll be going over the
differences between other boards in
another video so stay tuned for that but
let's just check out this Asus crosshair
6 hero
it has everything an enthusiast could
possibly want from a motherboard one
thing I do have to mention is that the
Rison processor only provides 16 lanes
of PCI equivalent support that means
just like internal z 270 platform
cards will be operating a double by
eight-speed this is certainly
interesting since AMD made a big deal
about their support for triple and quad
card crossfire setups but the enthusiast
platform awooo natively support those
however motherboard vendors could
possibly add plx Lane multipliers for
added functionality on their premium
boards also take note that if you
already have a cooler that have a
dedicated backplate which supports the
older and three socket aim force hole
offsets are slightly different
many cooler manufacturers like Noctua
and Corsair are offering their clients
upgrade kits free of charge meanwhile if
you're cooler uses the simple clip-on
method it should be compatible from a
high-level standpoint the Zen
architecture uses a simple modular
building block called the CPU complex or
CCX
each of these CC axes contain four cores
which uses simultaneous multi-threaded
technology to process up to eight
threads in parallel and they can be used
individually as a simple high efficiency
fork or a thread part or combine to make
larger more capable processors for
higher-end markets meanwhile individual
cores within each CCX can be
individually disabled as well without
impacting overall performance metrics
for example Rison seven has two of these
modules while risings five make use of
to CCX modules but disables a pair of
course to create a six core 1220 PU the
possibilities really are endless now
before I get into the benchmarks you
need to listen up about risings memory
limitations because there are a bit
confusing right now if you want a full
explainer then click on the link that
just popped up to head to our website
basically you'll want to buy a memory
with a speed-up 2667 megahertz or lower
or 2400 megahertz or lower if it's a
dual channel dual rank 32 gigabyte kit
luckily many memory manufacturers will
be launching license specific kits in
the coming days so with all that done
let's see how rising seven performs but
let's first start with the test system
specifications as you can see we are
using an identical memory configuration
across all platforms while a Titan X is
being used to ensure we eliminate
graphics bottlenecks kicking off our
rising benchmarks with the Photoworks
test is perfect since it highlights one
of
challenges against Intel's competing
architecture while this test may be
multi-core aware like many image
processing tasks it is lightly threaded
this leads to architectures with higher
IPC waves providing awesome results a
good example of this is how well the
cable eight processors do relative to
those expensive broad well eat chips
moving on to parallel processing
workloads and Rison is able to truly
shine meanwhile it's evident that AMD
has big some very serious cryptography
and hashing optimizations into them
likely as a result of its ultra quick
caching as a result the Rison r7 1800 X
is able to blow Intel's most expensive
enthusiast level chips straight out of
the water in the AES 256 and CPU hash
benchmarks finally the floating-point
unit VP a and singulair tests once again
highlights just how far AMD has come
between bulldozer and Xen in both cases
performance is nothing short of
astounding for a 500-dollar processor
it's awesome as the tests move into a
little more relatable territory we have
a bit of a yin and yang situation rising
obviously excels in center benches and W
Prime's multi-threaded workloads but it
tends to struggle against intel's kb
lake architecture in the predominantly
lightly threaded environment pc mark
utilizes on the other hand the 1800 x
competes very well against and even beat
the nearly three-year-old Broadwell
design
moving on to real-world tasks highlights
just how effective Rison can be from a
price to performance standpoint
particularly in Adobe Premiere Pro media
encoder remember this is a $500
processor that's keeping up blow to blow
against competitors that cost twice or
even three times as much with that being
said even with a tight next chugging
along with the background acceleration
there's still some ball necking going
around behind the scenes so the
differentiation between these processors
is relatively minimal in many rendering
tests the Rison 7 1800 X doesn't win
against the i7 69 under K but its
performance is so close to intel's
$1,000 processor that they're
essentially tied once again we're seeing
rise and struggle in a lightly press
photo manipulation tasks in
but it doesn't have exclusivity on those
performance challenges the broad will
eat chips which don't pack in a very
specific IPC increases from Intel's
skylake and Kubelik architectures also
push lower than expected results
honestly if you're pushing filter heavy
photography workloads in GIMP Photoshop
or any other similar program the KB like
chips represent money well-spent can
break on the other hand place to rise in
strengths in a big way and much like
Adobe Premiere Pro the 1,800 ex-post
some extremely respectable video
conversion times rounding out our
real-world benchmarks are two very
different programs on one hand pov-ray
represents a very typical rendering
environment as we've seen over the last
few pages the rising 7 1,800 X provides
an awesome platform upon which you can
build a rendering station however in a
program like WinRAR that fluctuates
between light CP workloads and heavily
furred situations performance relative
to intel's competitors slips a bit given
the fact that this is a $500 processor
there's absolutely nothing to be
embarrassed about here though and now
what you've been waiting for some gaming
starting with Tweety mark when using DX
lemon rising suffers which is likely due
to this benchmarks focus on duel - quad
red workloads an area where Angie's new
architecture seems to have some trouble
keeping up with Intel switching things
to DX 12 and it's multi-threaded
environment sees the 1800 X climbed back
into contention but oddly enough the CPU
focused side on the time supply
benchmark shows a no log for AMD its
result is within 10 percent of Intel i7
6900 K but that's a fair bit off from
the 5 to 15% bins were seen here in some
previous tests will this hold out into
our end game testing let's see
with a mighty Titan X beating at the
heart of the test system I was hoping to
eliminate any GP bottlenecks but
obviously that didn't happen in some
cases when there wasn't any GP bottle
next rising did fall behind its
immediate competition though with its
latest patch battlefield ones the actual
API path seems to be perfectly tailored
for high frequency quad-core
architectures like KB Lake and as a
result risin ends up mid pack trailing
every one of the Intel
infinite warfare on the other hand has a
frame rate cap at 125 frames per second
and none of these new processors had
much of a problem reaching that level
the Deus Ex result came in a bit of a
shock to me since I expected AMD to have
in place optimizations for the horizon
architecture there were very close
development partners with Square Enix on
this title once again however rising
sell behind even the 7600 K as for dooms
the Vulcan implementation well what's
there to say 200 films per second is
more than enough and we're smashing
right into the games engines framerate
cap obviously more testing will need to
take place at high resolutions but in
those situations the GPU will influence
the results much more than the processor
neither GTA 5 or overwatch allow rising
to catch much of a break but they do
highlight why I repeated time and again
that Intel i5 series processors are
absolutely gangbusters in the gaming
price to performance category they may
not have all those fancy cores but their
lack of hyper threading leads to
substantially better resource allocation
in many games perhaps dx12 will change
the situation in some way but right now
buying an a thread or higher processor
exclusively for gaming is a phenomenal
waste of money now on to power
consumption the testing here is what
they consistently high load from AI to
64 alongside idle conditions at idle
Rises enhanced P States kicks in and
it's able to sit down an impressive low
amount of juice kicking things up a
notch our low results measuring 900
separate log data points to determine a
to average power consumption for the
system here the risin 7 1800 X provided
respectable results but nothing that
aligns with the 45 watt TDP difference
between it and the i7 69 hundred K and E
is obviously measuring their TDP values
quite differently from Intel unlike
Amy's official TDP values would have you
believe the winner in a raw performance
per watt dogfight between the thousand
seven 1800 X and the 69 hundred K will
depend upon the application from what we
saw both consume about the same amount
of power when under full load one other
thing I wanted to point out is just how
far in DCPS architecture has matured
since piledrivers based FX series from a
performance per watt state
point Rison is in a completely different
league so there you have it
aim D's Zen architecture and flagship
bison processor have arrived and I can't
help but be impressed with what's been
accomplished even with this small single
CPU glance into what can be accomplished
it's hard not to be excited about what
else can be accomplished with this
processor design as amateurs for
professionals or prosumers Rison not
only leads the charge on the performance
fund but also in pricing the 1800 x was
able to easily blow with it's much more
expensive i 769 hundred k in almost
every application from premier pro to
blender and 3dsmax
in many cases its performance per dollar
ratio is just standing simply because
Intel's pricing is just so darn high and
make no mistake about it
at $500 the risin 7 1800 X certainly
isn't inexpensive just like higher end
Intel processors like me 6800 K 6900 K
and even the insanely expensive 69 50x
the rising 7 is a relatively poor choice
for a pure gaming rig yeah if you want
to use it for gaming alongside secondary
tasks like streaming or professional
work there's some great value there
however even today's leading-edge Vulcan
and DX well games benefit from high
speed 4 or a thread processors rather
than slower 1620 views in some cases
you'll actually get better
in-game performance from an Intel 7600 k
then you will from a risin 7 or
Broadwell e look any of these wisent
isn't perfect but what it does do is
provide a great counterpart to Intel's
pricing strategy without sacrificing any
performance if anything the 1800 X has
been super excited to see what else is
coming from the lineup since a higher
clocked quad-core or six Courtship could
make for a perfect all-around offering
as a matter of fact we're going to give
the Weizmann 7 1800 X are damn good and
damn innovative Awards
for a job well done while I've come to
end this review this doesn't end our
coverage for Rison we already have our
hands on with the r7 1700 X
1,700 and we're planning a few bills
featuring decent processors then there's
risin 5 and rising three launches coming
up very shortly so the next few months
are going to be really exciting and I'm
really looking forward to getting my
hands on with these new AMD processors
but let us know your thoughts about AMD
Rison and its performance compared to
Intel's offerings i'm Ueberroth
hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
