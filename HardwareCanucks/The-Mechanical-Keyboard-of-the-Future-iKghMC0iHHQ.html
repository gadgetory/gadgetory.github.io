Nvidia gigabyte fantex and NCI X what's
up guys this is Dimitri and one of my
dreams as a keyboard hoarder might
finally be turned into reality thanks to
the sorrow what they're showing as a
work in progress is actually quite cool
for many applications they're designing
a low profile mechanical switch for a
low profile keyboard that will mimic
blue switches and perhaps other variants
as well so not only will this type of
switch be awesome for a notebook space
perhaps a replacement for scissor style
switches while maintaining the same
format but many gaming notebooks today
are starting to incorporate mechanical
switches and this may be a perfect segue
into a low profile market that still
love that mechanical actuation in
addition the keyboard will be wireless
giving users more options for mechanical
feeling keyboards without that cord and
that sounds like a perfect feature set
with you know minimal low profile
keyboards expect the release date is
around q3 which is still far far away
but at least more mechanical keyboards
are going wireless furthermore we get to
see their Graham se spectrum optical
with the Sora's new optical switch that
is made by Gator on the Soraa we'll have
a one-year exclusive on this much like
Corsair gets with new cherry switches
the actuation point is at two
millimeters with total travel distance
of four millimeters the body of the
switch will still have a mechanical
variant and feel like blues but instead
of using two metal points to register
the actuation we have two infrared LEDs
firing off at the bottom of the switch
and so this optical variant is twice as
fast as standard mechanical switch which
makes no difference at all however with
the optical switches we have improved
durability especially good for humid
environments the keyboard because of the
switch is also spill resistant and will
ship with a completely revised software
package that is needed for all that RGB
and macro customization and at $140 it
is in that premium category but I'm
really excited to see how the optical
switch is compared to standard
mechanical ones but still spill
resistance and better longevity are two
nice features to have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
