great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Harbor Canucks and today we're taking a
look at the sensei wireless from
SteelSeries they've gone ahead with a
wireless revision of the very popular
since a gaming mouse and the thing
that's fitting as the original sensei
was simple and functional Gaming Mouse
that many gamers have gravitated towards
the sensei Wireless adds a hefty premium
to the price going around $160 making
this quite expensive considering
competing mice like the G 700 s from
Logitech and even the razer mamba are
significantly cheaper however there are
a few appealing aspects of the sensei
wireless one of them revolving around
the aluminum base that looks and feels
exceptional it acts both as the receiver
once plugged in via a microUSB cable
that is removable if you want to use the
mouse in Wired mode the cable is locked
with a push to release mechanism on the
mouse to avoid this connection during
use the base station will also charge
the mouse and the surrounding LED strip
satisfies both the a gaming appeal with
its multiple color options and the
practicality as it can be configured to
showcase the battery status with green
yellow and the red I found this battery
indicator very useful that made it
easier to know when the mouse needed
charging now the platform itself isn't
what you'd call compact you gain the
wireless convenience for the mouse
itself but will require space for the
base station somewhere on your desk it
is also unfortunate the base doesn't
really complement other wireless gaming
products from steel series like the base
station from their H wireless headset
and perhaps that's something that there
should be taken into account for their
next design cycle the mouse is 128 grams
a bit on the heavy side
there is no weight customization however
and actually none of SteelSeries mice
have that feature again something
perhaps they should consider the body is
symmetrical so good news for both right
and left-handed users I am accustomed to
more ergonomic mice with slanted body
and thumb support to accommodate for
palm time grip
so doesn't say Wireless favors claw grip
users a little bit more the rubberized
top and sides prevent from slippage and
from a few weeks to have constant use
the coating didn't show any signs of
wear that is a good thing the two
browser buttons on each side continue to
travel even after they're registered
with a smooth roll off so they don't
disturb navigation or you grip the
scroll wheel is also rubberized and
illuminated but the tactile feedback
when scrolling feels kind of muddy and
not is defined as I'd like also the
scroll wheel click is very heavy
something I would never use during
gameplay as I just couldn't press it
fast enough the left and right clicks
are also a bit on the heavy side
requiring more force than I'm used to in
order for the switches to register but
it does get rid of the possibility of
accidental clicking if the switches are
too light the CPI change button behind
is pretty low profile with two settings
and the illuminated SteelSeries logo at
the back candy color Justin and this
series includes a Power Save mode that
will turn off the LED when using the
mouse that I think is pretty innovative
and will prolong the battery life at the
bottom there are a few contacts
corresponding with the charging station
and we have an on/off switch and the
connect button
when pressed communicates with the
receiver to wake the mouse out from
standby mode the laser used here is at
the a DNS 9800 from picsArt with the
maximum 8200 CPI or counts per inch and
through software it can be bumped to
over 16,000 DCPI sensitivity Auto not
sure if anyone will ever need this type
of sensitivity previous known
acceleration issues with this particular
sensor have been addressed by a firmware
update and while we don't have any
specific equipment to test for
acceleration in my non-scientific Glide
tests I couldn't really feel any
acceleration or at least for my usual
CPI levels of 800 and 1600 now that
leads me to my gaming experience that
overall was pretty satisfactory I think
we're at the point where Wireless can
coexist within the game
in Rome and my aiming and targeting
ability was just as good as in the wired
mode I also got a few days of serious
use on battery after which the lights
went yellow reminding me to place it
onto the charging dog and in reality I
don't think battery life will ever be an
issue as you can easily get into habit
with overnight charging I think the
SteelSeries Engine 3 software is
definitely one of the best in the market
as it acts as help for all of their
gaming peripherals with the usual button
mapping and macros there's the color
adjustments for all the three zones the
two sensitivity modes battery saving
features with sleep timer sensor sleep
mode and that auto elimination that
turns off the LED when the mouse is in
use acceleration and deceleration
adjustments are included along with the
liftoff distance that's very helpful
depending on how you handle your mouse
navigation and we also have angle
snapping and polling rate different
profiles are associated with executables
and we'll order launched with that
specific application meaning no need for
manual profile switching so that's a
huge props to still series for such
intuitive UI and I'm going to conclude
by stating and the sensei Wireless hits
the market with the large list of
positives such as a functional aluminum
base station excellent sensor tracking
with great build quality we have the
three customizable color zones
integrated battery saving features and
unnoticeable performance difference in
Wireless mode that is good news and of
course the sensei can be used in Wired
mode as well and still series engine 3
driver software is definitely one of the
best on the market
I do however have a few gripes with the
mouse such as the lack of a small
receiver like the ones from Logitech for
perhaps mobile use and while I really
enjoyed the wireless freedom
economically it's not the most
comfortable Mouse for Palm type grip
also priced at $160 it is expensive this
is a $100 premium over there sensei raw
and I think that still series was
definitely right on point with this
sensei as the candidate for a wireless
revision it performs very well
ergonomically favorable within the
gaming community although I personally
need something with more support
at such a high price this insane
wireless is definitely a luxurious buy
that many gamers will gravitate against
unless you are in serious need of a semi
cordless solution and I say the same in
cordless since you still have to connect
the base to something that will occupy
real estate on your desk
