show you so here here here but today I
mostly care about this guy the street on
TV for beautiful aluminum cube now you
might recall me doing this whole
abstract thing of filming this case
inside a park wow that was actually
pretty fun except for a very close call
with a bicyclist who almost knocked out
my camera but the point of this video is
this the lh6 but the point of this video
is the lh6 cooling upgrade kit so I have
extra heat pipes in here so we can
connect the CPU to two walls instead of
one let's get started every day treat

description below yeah pretty cute see
this box I can hide easily but what do I
do with this
so we get extra key pipes extra mounting
brackets looks like we have extra
aluminum bases and hopefully this
amounts of thermal paste old enough and
so the whole premise of the TV for let
me remind you is for it to be a
completely famous profile so there are
no fans in this system and so therefore
we're actually utilizing the case itself
as he thinks so in the original we
connected our 4690k to one side panel so
that's the default configuration but
this would with this lh6 kit I'm allowed
to route those heat pipes onto two side
panels allow me to you know give me BB
the heating capacity so that I can
actually overclock that chip come on
gang inside here isn't easy now my
initial idea with this upgrade video was
to put an SFX power supply and GPU so I
could turn this into a proper gaming
station but because there's zero airflow
the GPU would get really hot I decided
to just stick with a CPU we're going to
overclock it and see just how good the
side panels can cool it now for the CPU
I'm using a 4690k which is an i-5 it's
like quite a cold CPU but still it's
very capable and the reason why I'm
using it is because it's an 88 watt CPU
or TDP where it's one of these side
panels is rated 65 watts so with this
upgraded lh6 kit
I'm able to increase the cooling
capacity of this case to 105 Watts so
I'm still within the limits of the CPU
CDP and hopefully give me a little bit
of overclocking Henry so this is the
original heatsink design so you can see
the CPU block there are four copper heat
pipes connected directly to this another
aluminium block that connects the side
panel but so we will be restructuring
this to add two more heat pipes in total
to make 6 so that we can cover two side
panels
trying to arrange all the systems in the
correct order but also having to deal
with thermal paste and I think my
motherboard does not have the proper CPU
socket orientation it is a very messy
process and you can see and just as I
thought the CPU socket on this
motherboard actually does not align with
the lh6 upgrade kit because these heat
pipes are supposed to sort of exit and
go below the motherboard like so but
they're not long enough on this so if
the CPU socket was closer to the top
area that that's that would have been
optimal but I'm gonna have to see I can
rotate the heat pipes to come out from
this and luckily I can just simply take
out the heat pipes without needing to
remove the entire block wow I did not
expect them to be this soft like I can
seriously look at this okay so there we
go this is how it's supposed to melt now
I just have to make sure that the
distance from the motherboard to the
side panel is correct and then it's not
I can sort of insert them a little bit
further into the CPU block so that I can
have everything mounted but in this case
we are blocking that PTI plot and the
moment of truth good thing the
motherboard tray is removable simply
slides in there without any problems
damn alright so the model goes in
now what I have to worry about is the
distance from this from these aluminum
blocks to the side panel and from what
it looks like it seemed like it was yeah
actually touch so we're good this is one
of my least favorite motherboards to
work with because the i/o connections
are not labeled so you have to always
look in the manual on where everything
goes and just such an awkward layout man
so this is quite frustrating and we'll
be honest because these heat pipes are
so soft and I guess when I was placing
them inside the block the bent and so
these these parts that have to enter
this aluminum block are not exactly
straight so I cannot cool
the aluminium block beyond a certain
point unless I really sort of you know
push is really hard and in the process
it straightens out these heat pipes and
you've really got to be in the right
state of mind trying to work with these
little brackets and everything being so
tight inside but the SSDs installed I
just have to apply thermal pads and put
some more thermal paste on this panel
close them up and hopefully let's begin
overclocking and my only concern here is
the power delivery because the power
supply only has a four pin for the
motherboard which usually accepts an
eight pin so I'm hoping that will not be
a problem when we tried to push the CPU
and because of this particular layout on
the motherboard with the cables coming
out at this end this is where the lh6
get upgrade supposed exit not possible
we have to rotate it to the GPU area you
know beside the PCI slots and stuff and
so therefore there's no way I can
install a GPU here now because yeah the
smaller board doesn't allow it so we
have two of these heat pads or thermal
pads the one advantage with these
thermal pads they don't cause any mess
but with this place they do recommend
using a thermal paste as you can see
it's a little messy but that with the
thermal paste we get a much better
cooling dissipation wait no wrong side
there see one advantage of using thermal
pads BAM thermal paste first BAM alright
so now the system is finished let's set
it up
all right so let's turn this system on
it is so weird not hearing any fan noise
nothing spinning up no beeps absolutely
quiet would be bb4 so we're and you can
see temperatures of idle are pretty good
we're hovering you're like around 35
with lower 30s this is a 3.9 3.9
gigahertz so pretty good I want to
stress that this now and now let's see
how far we can push it when you
overclock all right so now we're
starting to stress test and temperature
is a little bit toasty as you can see
we're reaching almost a hundred degrees
on one the cores but the other cores are
relatively cool in the mid 80s to the
touch all heat pipes are warm so that's
that's very good both aluminum plates
here and they are really hot along with
the main plate right here that's also
really hot but I'm assuming that the
actual socket plate on the CPU isn't
aligned properly because you know the
the discrepancy or the variation between
the CPU temperatures between these cores
it's quite significant so I might have
to remount it just to make sure that
that CPU block is on the CPU entirely
all right so I did wiggle the CPU block
down a little bit so hopefully that
covers more of the CPU or potentially
you know have a bit more consistency
across the entire block let's put the
memory back in and retest
all right yet so after doing more stress
testing CPU temperatures remain pretty
much exactly where they were around a
hundred degrees on the hottest core and
I'm running W prime right now so my
theory behind this hotness is well this
panel you know the main key pipes are
attached here and they're connected via
thermal paste versus thermal pads on
this side and this panel is
significantly harder to the touch versus
that one however both or all heat pipes
inside are very very hard to touch so my
thinking is that the heat dissipation
from the heat
knives from the aluminum plate doesn't
translate very well to here right so I'm
going to do is I'm going to put thermal
paste instead of the thermal pads and
we'll see if that does anything now the
one really interesting thing I've
discovered with these side panels is
that heal yourself with ice cold chains
can dissipate some of the heat this is
accumulating on this side panel so after
washing my hands on the ice cold water
I applied both of them onto the side
panel and I noticed a slight decrease in
temperatures in real temp on all course
so that's pretty interesting of course
once my hands got really warm
temperatures went back up again where
they were hovering around like high 90s
but it was still quite interesting to
see things a drop by two degrees or
simply by touching the case all right so
let's peel these off no problem with
thermal passes you know they how they
store them after you use them good thing
in there don't leave much of a mess so
now the thermal paste is in there
interestingly we did drop a few temper a
few degrees on the seat on the course
not sure if that's because the top is
open or the thermal paste is actually
you know acting up but the main thing to
feel here would be the side panel after
is some load to see how warm it gets
because it wasn't getting really warm
not as much as this panel and even after
applying a thermal paste while it looks
like we're reaching a hundred degrees
and you know what that's understandable
because the CPU is quite hot plus the
side panel can only hold so much heat
and there's nothing removing that heat
away from the actual side panel so you
know astrodome has done a fantastic job
of removing the heat away from the CPU
but how do you handle cooling of the
actual chassis so yeah all right I came
in I installed a fan in my family system
it is on the exterior and it's running
very quietly at 500 rpm and just a tiny
bit of airflow delivered from the
exterior dropped my low temperatures by
10 degrees so we go from high 90s to
hovering just under 80 degrees Celsius
which is actually so amazing and proves
my theory of having this really
excellent you know
delivery to the side panels but if there
is nothing to dissipate that heat away
from the side panels themselves then
you're stuck with a hot CPU especially
be constantly running an app load so
it's pretty interesting to discover this
tiny bit of airflow and how much heat
dissipation and how much extra cooling
you get with just one additional fan on
the exterior and finally we can all talk
a little bit CPU ratio at 42 voltage is
1.2 hopefully that's not too hot for the
system especially now with your fame at
it let's see how how it handles so right
now at the four point two with the 1.2
volts and yeah already reaching a
hundred degrees very quickly so the
overclock is not it's not going to this
this case cannot handle such high
temperatures so you can see we're
throttling already maybe 1.2 volts is
too much and so now I lower the voltage
to one point one two hopefully that has
its stable so far no crashes I mean
they're still rising to 90s but let's
see if it reaches the 100 well it seems
like we're approaching back to the 100
degrees mark so regardless of the
voltages I think that you know this this
case have a lot of potential for lower
water to CPUs maybe I threes and the
more efficient Skylink stuff and maybe
Kb like - but it's really really an
interesting ride trying to find what's
the optimal thing to do with this case
and having a single fan to cool the
exterior husband has proven to be very
useful I'm very happy with that but this
case is really not meant to be for
enthusiasts overclockers anyway so but
i'm glad that i went ahead and tried to
figure out with what this case is really
you know squeeze out all the potential
so I hope you guys enjoy this video make
