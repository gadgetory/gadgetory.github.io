great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with Jairo
canucks and it's been a while since
we've seen a truly unique chassis both
in design form and the specific
functionality that form helps to achieve
so today we're taking a look at this
this is the corsair 380 t it's bold it's
portable and it's yellow
priced at $140 you are most certainly
obliged to find other uses for this mini
ITX case for example in this scenario as
a boombox with the fully filtered side
panels that allow sound to escape
seamlessly but don't worry you can store
your lunch in there too with easy pop
out side panels to access your veggies
because who doesn't want such an awesome
lunchbox plus we've got a soda can in
there to get your refreshment and a
convenient spot to put it in in the cpu
cutout once you're done with it but on a
serious note the 380 t is one of a kind
species with one-of-a-kind purpose to be
transported easily with a sturdy and a
rubberized top handle although it's not
afraid to be large and bulky for a mini
ITX enclosure it's much wider than my
age for 40min Tower and it's pretty much
the same size as the air to 40 that is a
micro ATX chassis and so starting with
the color I personally love the yellow
it's all something we encounter often in
the case market unless you color it
yourself but it's vibrant
and it's super fun the plain boring
white and black options are of course
available but let us know how you feel
about the bumblebee approach with the
comment below the front panel is
removable that has a built-in dust
filter behind which a 140 milliner fan
is included with few other options
available for front intake such as dual
120 s or a single 200 Milner fan all the
connections are located up top that are
easily accessible and very simple to
route internally with 2 USB 3 ports
power and reset buttons and a fan
controller for three fans that are
Sattar powered and the entire panel
illuminates with nice white accents
around the fan controller button and
also the rest
plus matching illumination at the top
and the front intake fan for this to be
not just your yellow themed case but
with built-in lighting to really show it
off coming to the back we get the 140
millimeter exhaust fan and support for
mini ITX boards with two PCI brackets
that use a clamp down approach to secure
the GPU with an option to fully secure
it with a screw as well the K stands on
large and wide rubberized feet plus the
removal power supply dust filter is
included that is also color coded yellow
both side panels are partially filtered
mesh to allow optimal airflow with
acrylic pieces up top to reveal the
internal hardware they are removable
with a simple hinge system that keeps
them mass secured quite well and these
have to be the most sturdy side panels
we've seen from coarser in the wild with
almost no flex and finally the quality
you'd expect at such a high price point
so internally we find an open concept
with chamber separation and slight
modularity
for example the drive cage and in front
the power supply has to drive caddies
that are nothing special with SSD mounts
this cage can be removed with a single
thumb screw if you require that
additional room for a longer power
supply but we get a total of 180
millimeters of clearance so stick to 160
millimeter units to avoid any cabling
issues there is dual SSD cage on the
side that is totally toolless with
extremely simple mounting and optional
cutouts to properly secure your SSDs but
this side makes no sense for wiring
especially since the drives in the front
cage are facing the bag and it's too bad
you cannot relocate this SSD cage to the
other side all the case cables are black
and we do get several cable type points
in the main chamber GPU is up to 12
inches are supported and there's nothing
on the way for those 2 PCI brackets so
enthusiast cards will be supported out
of the box no problem on the other side
we get a 240 millimeter radiator bracket
that is removable for easier
installation and we've seen this
approach before with the Obsidian 250 d
that in this compact package allows the
utilization of an all-in-one liquid
cooller nothing can be installed up top
but there is a light switch for internal
illumination that is easily accessible
and provides that extra Flair although a
multicolor options would have been more
appealing for different builds and also
at this price point it's something of an
expectation so getting on with the
installation the power supply is
installed from the back with a bracket
and connecting those SSDs is a bit
awkward as you do have to route SATA
cables on both sides of the chassis I've
installed a 120 millimeter all-in-one
cooler on the bracket and thickness wise
there's no more room so you cannot do
push-pull in the 380 t just a set of
fans and the standard radiator however
if you are thinking of a CPU tower
anything taller than 150 millimeters
will not fit now there is quite a bit of
room on the side of the mountain board
that is left underutilized it's just
plain space that could have housed an
additional SSD or even potentially be
removed for a front radiator
installation but that is unfortunately
not an option I was able to properly
route the cables from the power supply
and just simply tucking them to the side
does the trick and there are many spaces
to route the cables like underneath the
drive cage or from the openings in the
motherboard tray so that portion is done
very well and thanks to the white frame
closing the side panel is not an issue
at all even with leaving the cables to
their own devices basically and with the
GPU in place the 380 T feels complete
and ready to go on the road without
issues of filtration
thanks to this open mesh design and
intake delivery from the front and while
I like the simple and fans free design
up top that allows a slight speak into
your hardware a few extra fan spots
would have made this a total cooling
powerhouse so in short the 380 T is one
of the few portable cases that's bounty
a tourist at a LAN party given its
out-there frame design and practical
door hinges although without any
anti-theft locking mechanism the
lighting feature is nice and the case
can handle a beefy mini ITX system
however the form itself is not compact
regardless of the inclusion of the
portable handle it's wide it's tall and
internally out is far from efficient
plus at this price point they are really
trying to go against the value current
and it's clear that coursers goal wasn't
compact and functional but rather
portable and large enough for a
comfortable system and I think for many
builders that would be fine however it
will be nice to see the focus shift
towards space efficiency and minimizing
the internal frame while allowing all
the same features as these bigger cases
so how do you feel about the 380 T not
just from the portability factor but as
a mini ITX offering in general and it
would be interesting to see how the
market reacts towards these types of
ball designs so leave your thoughts in
the comments below as always thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
