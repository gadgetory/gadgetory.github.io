simplistic Scandinavian appeal with easy
to work in internals great air flow and
storage potential and comes in both the
windows or plain side panels for your
preference hey guys Eva here with
hurricane axe showcasing my desk setup
that I used to edit videos for our
eggnogs so to start off with my monitors
I have the del u 24 12 and 24 inch - 100
P I P s monitor that has outstanding
viewing angles and great intermediate
color work beside that I have the Bank
you 1200 D IPS monitor and helps with
the extra virtual real estate which is a
huge plus when working with both
premiere and After Effects for my
peripherals I have the Corsair can defy
mechanical keyboard its cherry MX red
switches which suits my typing and
gaming experience it's also backlit
which helps spice up the ambient
lighting during the night for the mouse
I'm using G my onyx kV or 7000 I love
this mess because of its ergonomics and
the lighting customization since it
stands out in the dark we also have the
review of this Mouse posted so you can
check that out so now on to my audio
setup I have the focusrite scarlett 2i2
USB audio interface that essentially
gives me that high quality music
listening experience and gives me a
precise audio monitoring when recording
my voice overs the speakers that are
hooked up to the scarlett are the
Edifier s 330d these are by far the best
set of 2.1 channel desktop speakers that
you can buy and since i have a compact
set up they don't really occupy a lot of
space and the extremely powerful sub
really complements the full range sound
for audio monitoring and listening to
music i have the audio technica ath m50
professional studio monitor headphones
absolutely love these pair they produce
a nice and balanced sound they are also
comfortable and durable and
a criteria that is missing from the
majority of the consumer audio products
for my microphone I have the audio
technica at2020 microphone the same mic
dimitri uses so the voice-over quality
is consistent I absolutely love this mic
just because of the clarity it produces
over my zoom h1 which is still not going
anywhere
above my Scarlett sets the Kingston USB
3.0 media card reader it's really fast
when transferring data from my sd card
to the computer so now on to my video
production equipments I film all my
review videos on the Canon 5d Mark 3
with the 24 to 105 f/4 lens with image
stabilization it is an absolute beast of
a camera and I am planning on investing
into a Cinna lens in the near future I
also have them in photo mvh 502 eh fluid
head that helps me get those nice and
smooth pan shots one key feature I like
about this fluid head is the way how you
can change the resistance of the fluid
both horizontally and vertically for my
tripod I have them in frodo 0 v 5 x
pearl tripod it is made out of high
quality aluminum which can hold a slider
with the camera mounted on the fluid
head and I love the stability of this
tripod considering how much it can hold
moving on to my last piece of video gear
I have the canova k5 80 centimeter
slider which insert' me well for those
nice lighting shots on the review videos
the base plate comes with this nice
resistance lock which is something I
like the most about this slider so now
on to the best part is this super
project we built recently so go ahead
and check out our build log at outlining
the parts but here it is below the desk
nicely cuddled in with the blue lighting
effects that remained quiet and it is an
absolute power machine for After Effects
and Premiere I choose through render
times I hope you enjoyed the setup tour
make sure to check out Dmitry's tour we
posted recently if you haven't seen that
yet and let us know what you thought of
my setup if there is any room for
improvement feedback is always
