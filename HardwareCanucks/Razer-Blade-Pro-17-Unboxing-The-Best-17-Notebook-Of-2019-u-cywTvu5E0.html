something you've really got to stop
drinking you respawn man oh no this is
something else all right this better be
good all right you ready you had some
respawn didn't you okay watch this how
did you do that
have I had too much fries I have no idea
I have an idea it's already open
well hello there
where'd you come from it don't matter
it's a back where I'm going well I don't
really need a new Mouse right now sure
we'll see everybody loves a 4-way hidden
d-pad and a cool OLED display plus I'm
quiet sensitive at 24,000 dpi plus RGB
you got a try what was I thinking saying
no to you the MM 830 by cool master the
mouse you didn't see coming we'll check
it out below Wow so it is finally here
I'm really excited to actually be using
the Razer Blade Pro 17 you can get up
to speed with an awesome preview Eber
did right over here but I'm trying to
get into the mindset of somebody who
might actually use this on a daily basis
because I've considered switching to a
notebook as my main many many times
away from my desktop as for my Razer
blade 15 this has been my main
production machine on the go
it has treated me really well in terms
of the specs but to be honest gaming on
this thing is super uncomfortable at
this form factor it's not something that
I enjoy doing it constantly needs to be
plugged into the wall to get the best
performance you cannot rely on battery
power as you can with my macbook for
example like right now if I would close
it while it's sleeping the next day it
would die and also unless it's
completely idle the shell itself the
aluminum shell is either warm or hot and
the fans are spinning and are audible
now the Razer blade 17 is just a
super-sized version of the 50 model but
with much better cooling better speakers
better i/o better Razer software and
slightly different configuration and
pricing and so we were talking with Mike
and Eber about what is this machine want
to be is it the gaming station giving
the full HD resolution display which is
easy to run given this hardware but also
144 Hertz is a fantastic experience or
is it a workstation given the screen
comes factory calibrated which is nice
but it's only a 300 NIT brightness so
it's not exactly suitable for outdoors
or is it kind of like a perfect hybrid
but that is where the challenge comes in
because there is currently no 4k option
as that
is being saved for the studio edition of
the pro 17 and that will come with 4k
OLED and RTX Quadro plus the whole
thing with studio Edition versus Pro
Edition is kind of confusing because the
studio Edition is like for creatives
only giving the RTX Quadro graphics but
then what is the pro demographic is it
gamers or is it creators meanwhile the
Blake 15 has more configuration options
with 4k OLED already available at 240
Hertz option in there too with 9 gen
CPUs with the price Delta is decreasing
as we move up the r-tx chain and so the
pro 17 looks to be slightly competitive
versus the blades 15 price wise in the
RTX 2070 and the RTX 2080 models but
what's up with the 512 gigabyte of SSD
storage on all pro 17 models not even
the terabyte for the pro market and
especially at this price point come on I
will say there is an open MDOT 2 slot
inside the pro 17 so it is user
upgradeable you can expand your storage
but still not giving us a terabyte is
highly disappointing now physically it
is quite impressive that we get so much
extra screen with only a slightly
thicker body but with pretty slim bezels
and a super clean interior format
however this thing does not fit in any
of my backpacks and it's also 31 percent
heavier versus my blade 15 making it
less portable the other concern for me
would be the massive surface area that
is black aluminum on the lid and around
the keyboard that immediately gets
covered with finger marks which is why I
install the skin on my blade 15 which
looks awesome which is going to be a
must for the pro 17 as well and so the
main difference between the blade 15
include a new hinge system that is
incredibly smooth and is now more open
to accommodate the extra ventilation
design the new vapor chamber cooling
here is excellent delivers much better
performance versus the blade 15 with
exactly the same hardware
so the CPU clocks higher and the same
thing with the GPU that are not
throttling and maintain nice consistent
clocks throughout and my full
performance analysis between the pro 17
and the blade 15 will come a bit later
they've also added more France to the
front of the chassis for intake to
channel all that air flow through the
vapor chamber which is great
but that also means that there's less
room for the battery and the battery
capacity inside the Pro 17 is actually
smaller than the blade 15 so it looks
like they prioritized on performance and
cooling on the pro 17 versus battery
life and I'm totally ok with that if you
plan on taking this thing on the road
and actually working on this on your lap
then you were doing it wrong and a
battery bank is the same 230 what hours
has my blade 15 so nice and compact you
just have to worry about fitting that
machine into some bag and not so much
about the power brick as for port
selection everything meets the pro
criteria there's a 2.5 gigabit ethernet
port all of the USB ports are gen 2
there's a USB C and Thunderbolt 3 ports
plus a UHS 3 USB card reader that is
definitely appreciated for all who use
that media I know some people were
hoping for a numpad given the much
larger interior surface area but I'm
really content with the keyboard layout
outside from the really awkward arrow up
key as for the actual keyboard that
feels identical to my blade 15 nice
crispy keys beautiful RGB illumination
however the trackpad feels slightly
worse they're still using Windows
precision drivers and the actual surface
feels amazing but the actual navigation
feels like there's a slightly delay or
like latency versus on my place 15
everything is snappy and feels like
one-to-one but unfortunately that is not
the case with my pro 17 and so from my
initial impressions with this machine
I'm happy the direction they've taken in
terms of redesigning it to look like the
blade 15 that's smarter and it's
beautiful it's compact yet the
performance seems to be there so make
sure to stay tuned for my full
performance analysis between the two
machines and I'm kind of leaning towards
this to be my mobile workstation now
because the larger screen feels great
although again the whole idea of north
having a 4k option on the pro model is
so confusing to me I know it's coming
with a studio edition but like the UI
and the 17 inch form factor you'd expect
to be slightly sharper with like low
things in the creative apps and that is
one major drawback and so perhaps the
whole throw distinction is like a pro
or something like that because I can't
think of why Razer would not include a
4k display option on this thing just yet
I guess they're saving it for the studio
edition and don't want to jeopardize the
hype surrounding that machine alright
guys so those are my first impressions
with the Pro 17 if you've been on the
market for a notebook on the bigger side
why why do you need something like it
let me know in the comments I'd love to
get into the mindset of those exact
people so that I can deliver a full out
review on something that you might
potentially want now Dimitri thanks so
much for watching
and this thunder will not stop going
huge rain outside thanks for watching
I'll talk to you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
