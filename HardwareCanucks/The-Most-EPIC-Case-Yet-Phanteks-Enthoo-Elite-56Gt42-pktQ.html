transition my system from a mid tower
into a super tower as I want to get into
the mindset of what it feels like owning
something that has so much potential for
custom builds this is the fantex elite
the most expensive case we've ever
worked with at eight hundred and ninety
nine dollars now to be honest I'm
actually quite surprised fantex decide
to take this pricing route because it's
a massive leap from their previous most
premium case the an supremo at 299 so in
this video let's talk about the elite
it's priced and it's placed on the
market its feature set and its ease of
use right after this sponsor spot
creativity is fueled by the best
instruments it doesn't always come easy
and in the process you often realize how
important quality is the Rd 400 bio CC
gives you quality and speed with MDOT to
interface the Shiban and flash and a PCI
bracket making it possible to focus on
what matters unless we storage that
makes a difference with a five-year
advance warranty but first let's begin
with the box as receiving it sure feels
completely different it arrives in a
slight case a protective box mainly used
for music equipment and large fragile
items this requires two people to carry
because the whole thing weighs close to
50 kilograms and here's me next to it
for scale now the good thing is the case
is reusable scores and fantex choose
this packaging material over traditional
cardboard to avoid damage on arrival now
interestingly these cases cost up to
$500 but with fantex
own manufacturing the price of the
flight case has been reduced below 200
so it's not a significant portion of the
total price you pay the way you remove
the elite is to lay the flight case down
using the soft foam piece as the base
and lesbian closure if you have the
strap highly recommend you do this with
two people to avoid back injuries and
then straighten the case so you can put
away the flight case and still further
use just be mindful just how large that
box is so ample of storage space is
required now I want to talk about the
price a little bit more because it is so
uniquely
hi I mean you could build a full system
for that much money and fantex has some
strong competition already established
with K Slav being more affordable for
the high-end water-cooling market now
sure there are a lot of difficult theses
in here like the giant tempered glass
side panel that swivels to open that
mechanism is not easy to implement but
it has that ventilation built in and for
the bottom chamber and there's a lot of
complex machines formulator aluminum on
the exterior you know that complement
that's high-end status of the elite
including this giant rear side panel
that is curved at the bottom
creating this beautiful character for
display that is also carpet friendly as
the premium aluminum piece at the bottom
spent the entire length of the case and
the tall feeds help with air flow intake
and so when you take in the elite it's
like a long-term commitment and I love
what fantex has done to balance
functionality with luxury so if you use
them in towers like I am be prepared to
be blown away at the size of the super
Tower it is incredibly tall it's thicker
than my evolved ATX and if I was to
substitute the space on my side it looks
a little bit out of place and perhaps
needs to be placed on a small pedestal
instead for accessories we have two
boxes one inside the bottom chamber and
the other inside the flight case itself
don't forget about that one includes two
SSD caddies six normal Drive caddies the
power splitter plate a five and a
quarter inch drive gauge with two slots
and the same color accents at the front
as on the case and this is meant to be
installed facing the glass window like
so allowing users to install you know
touch interfaces or obstacle drives then
we have a vertical GPU bracket that's
included that we'll cover later a handy
tool boxes here for your screws
organization and 1/8 inch cpu extension
furthermore we'll get these extra panels
including an ITX tray a side radiator
bracket plus a top panel cover if you
want to close the top of the case for a
more silent system but be mindful the
color of the panel will match the color
of the exterior the front facade is
pretty plain aside from what looks like
a five and a quarter inch drive bay but
it's a door with all the i/o behind this
including four USB 3.0 HDMI pass-through
a type-c ports dual
audio jacks for dual systems plus a
wheel to control the integrated case
lighting that lets the cycle between a
bunch of colors adjust the brightness
select the breathing mode or a rainbow
mode and I've always been a fan of
fantasy approach to lighting with soft
accent strips running along the side and
the top that's beautiful and absolutely
stunning to look at but you can add more
and route them on the inside which is on
the easiest RGB lighting solution you
can find on the case now about that type
T connector the first batch of the elite
will ship with the USB 3.0 19 pin
connector but a new USB 3.1 gen2 20 pin
connector is coming later that will be a
free upgrade for the elite owners and
since there are two sets of the i/o the
power button at the top has also dual
press to start each system individually
so let's get inside and talk about the
interior layout and all those cooling
options but first I love the swivel
glass panel that's feel secure and
strong on those hinges despite being
quite heavy I would definitely recommend
you remove it to make the case lighter
during installation majority of the
frame is held in with screws and aside
from the chunky aluminum exterior panels
the main frame is powder coated steel
the case internals are divided into
three main chambers at the bottom
accommodating an extra power supply plus
the six drive caddies at the front it is
a modular system but the compromise here
is that storage limitation for example
this space could easily fit more drives
but the elite is a water-cooling monster
first before anything else it does so to
spend at the bottom of the case it is
magnetic and easily accessible but the
bottom fan bracket on this chamber is
also removable with support for up to a
full 80-million radiator so this chamber
is multi-purpose for either water
cooling storage or an additional power
supplies or a combination of all three
as for the main chamber a lot is
happening here a total of five or 140
member fans are included three in the
front and two of the rear for exhaust
one of the most interesting design
choices for the interior was to include
these aluminum covers on the side wall
that match the exterior color and what
they hide are all these extra mounting
locations for the drive caddies five
them can be installed here and you can
also install
the caddies instead of the aluminum
plate but they cannot be installed at
the same time as those large drive
caddies
so this entire wall is used to hide
incoming cables to the main interior
which is why it has that side side
movement and adjusted with the some
screws at the back but I do prefer
standard rubber grommets as there are no
particular ways to channel your cables
with this open area there is a bit of a
compromise on having this flexible
storage / mounting location but with
more difficult cable management this
area can also be swapped for a side
radiator bracket that supports a 360 ml
rod it's a definitely unique way to
experiment with air flow and your water
going configuration and you can install
long tube reservoirs on the side and
going this route would require the
removal of the size plate at the back so
there is actual air flow coming out it
tells them with one thumb screw and
comes with a dust filter - more Drive
caddies can be installed beneath the
motherboard area this way you're
blocking the ITX spot but they are
listed high enough to fit a set of fans
underneath so if you're using this
middle portion for cooling by default
the chambers are isolated with more
aluminum plates that match the exterior
color the front plate can be removed if
you're passing a radiator into the
bottom compartment with the rubber
grommets available in the sub ones
awkward middle position being too far
from all the hardware the larger plate
can also be removed and this space
occupied either with a radiator or that
second ITX system the top panel has a
dust filter with these gorgeous
ventilation openings on each side those
are also filtered on both the top and
the front panels that are easily
removable and like I mentioned earlier
you can mount a solid panel for that
extra silence but here you have a fully
flexible mounting configuration for up
to a quad 120mm fans setup or triple 140
millimeters with their respective
radiator sizes and this fan bracket is
also removable it mounts conveniently
from the top to make installation easier
and this bracket is pretty much centered
which for a case of this wide and this
size should not be a concern
it's just centered for the symmetrical
appeal removing the front panel we find
another giant area for fans where if you
remove the middle
plate you can fit a five 60 ml radiator
at the front and the case is wide on
purpose to support multiple large
radiators inside at the same time and so
here is a blown out view of all the
supported radiator locations inside the
elite so fantex is clearly targeting
only the high end users that would take
full advantage of all the available
space taking off the back panel it is
incredibly heavy and large be careful
with it
but with captive thumb screws so that's
a positive we have a very spacious rear
chamber here you install your main power
supply which is out of sight and on its
side with many velcro straps around the
main channel cables but I'm a little
surprised this area was not utilized for
more storage capacity there are only two
SSD caddies and clearly the focus has
been on water cooling as two palm
brackets are included so you could use
soft tubing for rounding into the main
chamber or relocate the palm brackets as
they do install on any 120mm in a fan
mount and finally two PWM fan hubs are
included with support for six fans each
something that will likely come in handy
you know for all the water clearing
stuff I just wish we have fan cable
extensions that were included with the
case and starting with the build
I recommend removing all exterior panels
that makes handling the case easier it
makes the case much lighter so you can
move it around a bit more and it's meant
to be standing for assembly thanks to
the extended motherboard standoff then
hold the board before the screws are
used which is awesome and I decide to
take the dual system approach without a
custom loop and as you can see the elite
desperately needs at least a couple of
360 ml radiators to fill all that space
and first I want to cover the vertical
GPU bracket because it's not exactly
what I thought it would be for one only
the left side of the i/o on a GPU has
clearance for your i/o as the right side
is blocked by the mounting screws you do
have that second internal PCI slot on
the bracket but that would move the GPU
very close to the motherboard second the
bracket occupies seven PCI slots
blocking any other PCI device on its
path luckily my nvme SSD
top of the motherboard slots without
interfering with the GPU so while this
vertical GPU showcase looks fantastic
and has potential
I feel the clearance compromised somehow
needs to be reduced I also installed an
ITX system right below that is an
interesting experiment but cable
management is challenging I was able to
route all the cables through the drive
cut out and otherwise there are no clean
ways to route the cables off to the
sides of the motherboard from that
bottom chamber where the power supply
sits and I wish more emphasis was put
for cable routing from that bottom
chamber into this ITX section for
example if the aluminum middle plates
somehow covered the open area that would
be good or if you're installing fans or
radiators in this section for the ITX
system it would hide that bottom chamber
what was really be nice though is to
have a power supply shroud because
otherwise it's quite exposed and might
detract from using two power supplies so
maybe using a power supply splitter that
fantex
also sells for that second system might
be an excellent idea if you are using a
second GPU for the ITX side it looks a
little strange having different cards
and also keep in mind the proximity of
the bottom to be use to the side panel
that might get chokes for air although
in my test the GPU temperatures were not
a concern
cable management for the main system
however is a lot more familiar with
grommet underneath the board and that
fully open side entrance you know it's
fine
just as long as you clean out that
visible exit take a look at the back
don't be alarmed by that huge cable mess
I intentionally used red cables to show
the dispersion but the side panel closed
without any force
I feel the dry storage at the front is a
little bit too far maybe a more compact
the drive gauge would have satisfied my
SS the only system but I am generally
surprised at the lack of appropriate
channels for the cables from here into
that main compartment I'm used to having
grommets for my 24 pin and PCIe cables
but here you need to work creatively to
solve this cable mess also a few SSD
mounts to the backside of this bracket
would have been perfect to utilize this
area for extra storage as otherwise
these 4s as these occupy a more
larger than expected area and the bottom
chamber at the front and so the fantex
elite is a unique case in many regards
it achieves flexible water cooling
options perfectly but only targeting the
higher tier showcase builder while
merging all Authentics excellent ideas
on what defines a functional interior
with this luxurious status having the
option for a second system presents
interesting opportunities on how and
when that system will be utilized not
forgetting a second set of peripherals
is required for the whole thing to be
operational my favorite part of the
super tower concept is to maximize the
potential or sign the full potential on
what's possible inside the elite the
executions here is almost perfect with
primary emphasis on water cooling but I
would like to see its expanded to cover
more storage options with compact SSD
cages
perhaps the simpler of vertical GPU
bracket and more options to cover up
that midsection plus a power supply
shroud for the bottom chamber but
regardless of how many things the elite
does right the astronomical price point
will only be in the reach of the lucky
few who have that large interior to fill
this is a water cooling luxurious heaven
with a very fitting title of the elite
that deserves our dam innovative award
so yes it's been a very long one but let
us know what you think of this enclosure
in its entirety let's have a
conversation
if fanfics is going crazy to release
some eight $99 case and how do you think
they delivered I'm Dimitri with harken
our apologies for my voice I'm getting
better promise you and we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
