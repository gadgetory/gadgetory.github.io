get that itch I've wanted to change
something about your system so that is
what this video is about primarily me
switching out the mesh fic case which
has housed my Rison system and I've been
actually pretty happy with the case the
front mesh as you can see it's quite
dusty my fault for not cleaning it but
you guys can see how much dust it has
accumulated over the eight months now
the thing is one of the USB ports the
front i/o is not working anymore when
the pins just got like bent and I cannot
insert anything else inside and so yeah
we're gonna be saying goodbye to the
massif IC for the new cooler master h
500 p mesh so i'm excited for this case
because it will fit into my space a
little bit better because of the white
color scheme and i have white furniture
and a little black contrast in there for
sure and I'm also adding a little bit of
this RGB flare not going overly crazy
with these front fans and also routing
an RGB strip you know something I've
done in the past but kind of stayed away
from because of like my space I wanted
to be clean and stuff but now with this
case I feel like it will actually add a
little bit swear to myself and once I
swap out the systems by the way I'm
super excited to do cable management in
here and just like really tweak the
cables make sure everything is super
clean because I don't plan to actually
have a side panel on the other side so I
have those cables and paneling exposed
but I'll also be creating a new ad spot
for color master with this case that is
coming up later in the video so make
sure to stay tuned to see how that whole
thing is produced
wow so this is turning out to be quite
nice already it's no longer a black box
that sucks up all the light now we have
a bit more character in here and the
glass is more see-through so I'll have
to be more careful with my cable
management that's damn I like this space
already so let the key swap begin mesh
if I see don't feel bad
ha kind of wish I had a Dyson for all
the dust you know too soon I'll let
myself out
man my system was dirty and now with the
white case I'll just have to monitor it
more and clean it more as well
motherboard install Wow look at that
full black system inside a white case
this is going to look epic
well pretty damn good that might say
let's fire this thing up and we have
built oh alright people so the key swap
went without hassle I'm really liking
how this turned out ok oh man with the
spine I'm gonna play around with
lighting some more but now I gotta make
that new ad spot and I hope it's gonna
blow you away alright just published a
new video back to work
alright so my idea for this new
coolermaster spot is pretty interesting
I would hope so you guys like it but
cool masters always open for ideas and
so my idea here is to demonstrate the
air flow potential of this case not
through like temperature testing and
seeing it stuff but through visual
representation of what could happen in
an airflow not inside the case but
inside the broom and then use that as
the symbolism for the air flow on how
the components are cooled inside the
case I hope that makes sense let me show
you but first the camera swap because I
should need to use the gh 5 to film the
spot the G seven never disappoints let's
go so I got this whole dual character
thing going on which is why I'm wearing
a hoodie so that's gonna be one
character and the second the second is
wearing this nice red shirt so you can
visually this thing between the two
otherwise if I was wearing like a darker
shirt but no hoodie you might actually
not notice that
okay so the dominant color for this a
spot will be purple that is of course
cooler master's colors so we got RGB LED
inside the lamp and inside the case as
well for the front fan so it looks
really cool but yeah let's begin the ad
spot I don't really have a script I just
kind of have this idea in my head as to
what I want the characters and how they
want to be interacting with other the
whole idea is to introduce them as like
least not scientists but whoever is
going to be testing something and
they're both kind of nervous and both
excited about the experiment that you're
about to witness all right first thing
people first thing free focus yeah
always got to do the clap for that audio
sync you know
okay so the initial interaction of the
two people meeting is shot I think it's
fine for like you know three seconds as
like the introduction and then I'll be
using the case lighting to indicate that
the case has been turned on and then
that's where we input all the symbolic
air flow things that I discussed earlier
the remote so what I'm trying to do now
is create those elements that emphasize
the impact of the air flow so I have a
cup of water then I'm gonna drop from a
little bit of a distance so that you
don't see my hand in the shot but I'm
worried because it's right behind the
case where is the power supply so I'm
gonna have to angle the case because the
whole idea is for the water to spill and
then I reversed that shot so it looks
like the water just kind of spurs out
from the top and the glass also has
motion so I'm hoping that's gonna turn
out well and as always I'm going to be
trying to be very safe I'm gonna turn
the case around so that there is no
access for the water to go into the
power supply area so hopefully there are
no issues in this in this configuration
so the idea is for me to actually show
the logo of the case and have the glass
in the shot so I don't wanna be showing
off any other branding inside the case
oh my goodness that was a terrible idea
the case panel is all wet let me show
you okay so that's build real nice all
over the case in the panel and the table
look at that it's a good thing I
positioned the case the way was because
the back is completely dry so no issues
here but gives me an opportunity to wipe
the side panel I guess I've never
actually washed the floor in the studio
so this gives me a chance to do so I
vacuum it all the time I really hope the
shot turned out well because otherwise
this was a heavy a fantastic waste of
time I hope it holds down quite there
you know oh oh my god you can see my
hand so that does not work and fortune
because I'll be reversing the shot so
when the glass lands I was hoping that
it would stay stationary and then from
there you would like splash everything
all right so the footage is all on
timeline I think it did a pretty good
job in terms of the visual side of
things but now it's all about sound
design and letting you experience those
powerful air wishes and all that air
movement and how I interact with it in
the spot so hopefully it turns out well
so you visualize the powerfulness of
that air power the power the power the
power but first check this out it looks
beautiful in the space I really like the
load change in here and I can see more
of the inside now so I could potentially
populate it with little figurines or
something like that you know as little
props actually inside the enclosure
which is really cool so yeah let's get
back to editing
also the weirdest thing happened
yesterday remember those yellow glasses
that I was wearing in the red shirt for
the preparation for all the airflow well
somehow in the middle of the chute I
lost them and the house has been upside
down of me trying to find them I still
have no idea where they are which is why
there is the lack of continuity because
in one shots when I'm getting sucked
into the case I'm not wearing the
glasses so hopefully have many people
notice that and unless of course you
watch this video alright so this is what
the sound design for the spot looks like
a little bit more work than usual but
the whole thing is in your audio in this
particular ad spot is half the
experience or not just experiencing the
powerful visuals but hearing those
powerful punches of air as well alright
good people so I hope you enjoyed this
piece of content definitely the key swap
was something that I've been meaning to
do and you know just been waiting for
the right case to swap out for the mesh
if I see that is also airflow focus and
that looks a little bit more interesting
for for me right now but also the
production side of things you know
always love to deliver something like
that where you talk about my thought
process behind how I wanted to look and
then you guys seeing it and then piecing
all that thing together so hopefully you
enjoy the ad spot for this new age 500p
mesh so let me know what you think of
the ad it's gonna play now and yeah I'll
see you in the next video are you ready
okay watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P managed by
Coolermaster check it out in the
