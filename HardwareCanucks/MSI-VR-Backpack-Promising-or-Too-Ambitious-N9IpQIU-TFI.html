foothold in the gaming industry and
companies are now trying to branch out
into doing something really cool and
innovative and I can't wait to see some
final products come to the market huge
thanks to our Computex sponsors for
sending us out here
shout out to Nvidia fantex NCIX and msi
behind me is the msi backpack pc IV
already backpack enclosure that is full
metal it's red keeping up with msi theme
the specifications are at 9 GTX 980 and
i7 processor at 28 cell battery to give
us 1.5 hours of playtime with VR the
weird thing is though the GTX 1080 just
came out I'm sure
that's like 2x time performance over 980
in VR applications so I'm sure that when
we see almost like a final close to
production process gtx 980 will be
installed now the cool thing about this
whole idea of wearing a backpack PC on
your on your back everything connected
into it is having no wires on your feet
so you can move around you can be free
you can set up a larger area and that's
really cool the whole idea is expanding
our VR freedom is awesome especially
since all the cables are slightly
shorter in the back so you don't have to
worry about sort of when you move around
it's not going to be tangling anywhere
and I find that that's pretty awesome
the backpack itself very comfortable
surprising that you know doesn't feel
like I'm wearing a PC on my back it is
metal toe so perhaps the the actual
aluminum casing is part of the heatsink
to cool the whole thing unfortunately
we're not able to see what's inside of
it like but I'm sure it's going to be
some engineering that goes behind it to
perhaps make it even more compact but it
is very light already and I'm excited
design-wise it's typical ms I've read
some ventilation holes everywhere on the
sides we have little pockets for the HTC
5 controllers which is nice we haven't
seen that on other VR backpacks that
feature dedicated pockets for all the
things like that and availability is
still unknown it's a very
proof-of-concept to see how the public
will react and I don't know and so in
conclusion this whole VR mobile VR
hardware and wearables sort of merging
together is very exciting but you have
to consider that VR applications and
just VR experiences that the proper are
quite expensive you add in something
like this that is most likely going to
be proprietary what proprietary hardware
that you perhaps will not be able to
move around and can't install your
system your own system inside a backpack
like that is quite limiting but it's
very interesting in the for all you who
have a VR headset would you consider
doing a backpack mobile PC for of your
VR applications let us know definitely
interested to hear the input from people
that are definitely you know into that
types of gaming segment I'm to meet you
hi Rick max thank so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
