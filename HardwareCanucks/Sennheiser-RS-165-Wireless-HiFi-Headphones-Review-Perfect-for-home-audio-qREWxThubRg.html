great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Jara
Canucks and you guys know that Sun
hyzers product portfolio is unit Spain's
pretty much everything from gaming
headsets to travel headphones to
high-end travel headphones like the
momentum Wireless that we reviewed in
the past but their home audio and TV
audio systems are just as vast something
we haven't fully covered on this channel
and today we've got to change that as we
put one of the latest wireless headphone
solutions for your home to the test so
this is the Rs 165 that promises to
combine rich sound with a long-term
comfort and I sure hope so
considering the price point so let's
start with the base this tower is a
multi-purpose transmitter that can
support two headphones in parallel it's
got the piano gloss finish in some areas
with an overall attractive and modern
look to the entire system that looks
like it's part of a unit there's a
battery indicator right below the
sanitiser logo at the front with red LED
to indicate charging and green when the
headphones are fully charged now this is
important because the contacts on the
headphone and the dock are not magnetic
and so it's possible to misalign the
contacts and the battery LED at the
front would indicate to just that
there's a bass boost button right below
with a center LED to indicate when on
the same can be found on the headset
itself but I wish the base button was
moved to the top of the dock where it's
easier to press as otherwise the
structure is pretty light and can tip
over unless you fold it autosum rubber
pads at the bottom help to stabilize it
from slipping all over the place at the
very bottom is a power LED that turns
green where the headphones are on and
once placed on a dock they enter a
standby mode to begin charging and every
time you have to take off the headphone
off the dog you have to manually power
them on with a button on the right ear
cup that also acts as your mute switch
with a single clip now the setup is
pretty simple the dock needs AC power
and
son Heiser is accommodating enough with
region-specific adapters that you can
slide onto the AC brick and plugging in
the back of the tower and this is also
where an analog three-and-a-half
millimeter input jack is located with a
two meter cable included so you can plug
this into your TV your audio system your
smartphone your notebook your desktop
computer whatever and it's unfortunate
to not see an RCA or a quarter of an
inch adapter to be not included within
the accessories and moving on to the
headphones they carry a similar design
language as the dock itself or the piano
gloss and matte black and silver accents
on the sides with three large and easy
to distinguish and reach buttons for
bass boost and plus a minus for volume
adjust now at first impressions the
headphones feel a little plasticky
especially since the plastic is not
coated with anything and most of the
time some sort of rubberized or textured
surface helps to convey that premium
feel unfortunately that's not the case
with the RS 165 now the joints a metal
but you still don't get that sense of
solid build now having said that my
first pair the San Heiser HD 5
five-eighths feel very similar in the
build quality department compared to the
RS 165 but they have lasted me so far
without any issues whatsoever the ear
cushions are plenty deep and soft enough
to shape around the ear and not sure if
you like this type of material but I've
noticed the heap concentration and thus
prefer either leather or velour earpads
with a twist they come off and reveal
the battery compartment on each side and
it's really good for some hyzer to
include proper rechargeable triple-a
batteries as well alright so the comfort
level I would say is a solid 9 the ear
cushions are deep enough so there's my
ears do not make contact with the
internal drivers there is no squishing
going on because the ear cups are large
enough to encompass the entire ear
without having a specific pressure point
on the ear itself but as you can see
they're rectangular design is not super
attractive and I prefer some Heiser's
other pairs in terms of design but you
can see they're pretty wide and kind of
bulky looking I wish there were slightly
slimmer profile for this
alliteration now some of you may see the
dual pockets on top of the headband and
ask what that feels like and I say it
helps to distribute whatever tension
that might accumulate on the headband
while you're wearing the headphone and
over my continuous single five-hour
listening session I had to take them off
once in a while for about a two minute
break to ease out that tension that has
accumulated on the headband however I
have to take them more often because of
the heat accumulation inside the ear cup
and on the surface of the ear cushion
itself something that you would have to
do more often to let your ears breathe
then have to take them off because of
any discomfort you might experience with
the headband and something you also keep
in mind while the are a closed back
headphone they do leak quite a bit of
sound something that I was not expecting
considering the isolate super well but
on the outside people definitely might
hear what you're listening to now as far
as sound quality mansun Heiser does not
disappoint considering this is a
wireless headphone now they are using
their proprietary wireless link over a
2.4 gigahertz band that's something that
helps to differentiate the sound quality
over something like this versus using a
Bluetooth connection with other wireless
headphones so the base region at the
fall setting is very nice it's pretty
flat but still giving us detailed hits
without muddying in the mid-range and
the bass boost button I'm so happy that
they've actually included that because
if you ever need that extra boom extra
punch within your within your tracks you
have that option it really boosts the
upper bass regions and listening to a
very TIA from deadmau5 that last drop
really gave me goosebumps with that bass
on however bass boost is not for
everything vocals become muddy um
become very Bumi as well so not a very
good base hit for all the genres however
it's good for trance where there's not
too much vocals and if you want to just
experience extra Rumble and headphone
because that's almost what it gives you
now because the mid-range is not
disturbed at the default profile it's
very clean vocals are clear but not
harsh and help to position you within
the audio setting with a slightly semi
open like soundstage which is a
huge benefit now travel to the most part
is smooth I have encountered a few harsh
portions where I had to turn down the
volume as speech was to Lipsy and it was
only when I get up from my chair it kept
reminding me that this is a wireless
headphone because the audio quality is
spectacular for sort of the wireless
iteration there is no crackling that you
usually get with Bluetooth devices when
you boost up the volume on the headphone
itself and the source as well the
background becomes very clean and you do
realize how excellent the link is
between the headphones and the
transmitter because the background and
even at higher volumes is super clean
without any harsh interference or any
interference whatsoever and this leads
me to the wireless range the advertised
430 meters for the line-of-sight however
in my apartment signal strength turned
out to be really weak although this was
with a few walls in between where
headphones would cut out at about 6
meters with two walls in between where
my Wi-Fi signal at 2.4 gigahertz the
same frequency that the headphones
operate would be at about 80% strength
now one cool thing I discovered is once
you come back within the range of the
dog it will fade the audio in instead of
hitting you at 100% volume so the RS 165
from an audio perspective is impressive
considering it is Wireless that I wish
had come with extra accessories like RCA
adapters and different ear cushions to
sweeten the deal and I personally would
prefer the styling of the headphones to
be in line with the HD 500 or 600 series
headphones but I also understand they
need to have space for the wireless
transmitters on there somewhere and if
you are in the market for a wireless
solution I would actually recommend you
check out the Rs line from Sennheiser
because they've actually made a proper
wireless solution with excellent audio
so guys this concludes this review of
the RS 165 give us a like if you found
