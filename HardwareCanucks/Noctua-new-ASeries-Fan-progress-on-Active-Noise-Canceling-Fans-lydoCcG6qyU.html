you by fantex nvidia corsair and CI x
silverstone and in win make sure to
support them for helping us bring this
great content to you
I was very happy to have a chance to
stop by Noctua at Computex talked to the
guys and see what's in store for their
future fans and coolers and the actually
working on their next generation a
series 120 member and 140 men are fans
that on the surface might not look at
all different because the core formula
of every knock toward a fan is pretty
much already there like rubber corners
to prevent vibrations the small curved
incisions on the blades for best
possible airflow dynamics and the
spacing between the fan blades and the
frame is now ultra tight at 0.5
millimeters that we are told introduced
a lot of manufacturing challenges and
Noctua has been really hard at work
making sure that each single fan is up
to their standards and most important
element of this new fan is its
positioning between the NFF 12 and the
NFS 12 fans so instead of being either
optimized for high airflow or high
static pressure this new generation a
series fan is more like a hybrid where
it will shine in all types of scenarios
either for a radiator or a CPU heatsink
or even just using it as an airflow case
fan here they showed us the performance
graphs so the RPM is bit higher at 1,800
versus 1500 so you get still less noise
output and delivering to degree Delta
and I think all the work that they're
doing to improve when all the elements
of a fan are necessary on display they
also had the next generation you type
coolers based off the Nhu 12s and Nhu
14s the 120 millimeter model has the
seen increased thin surface area of
extra fifty percent they've added an
additional heat pipe totaling to six
instead of five for the 140 millimeter
model the thin surface area has now been
increased by 30% and the heatsink is non
symmetrical which allows a better
compatibility for PCI lanes Ram
compatibility is still at 100% from both
the heat sinks with a single fan
installed the rollout for these new
coolers is expected soon along with
their next generation a series fans of
both 120 and 140 Milner
models as soon as they launch so we
should expect temperature and noise
output to drop when both of these are
combined to work together furthermore we
get to see their progress on creating an
active noise-cancelling fan it's not
totally new you've probably heard about
this in the past as it began with this
control board that would do all the
necessary computations for the fan to
operate as active noise-cancelling as
over time this controller board has
shrunk in size so to now actually fit
behind the motor and this is what the
fully integrated controller looks like
the other parts of the equation are the
blades in particular these magnets on
the edges of the blades and this coil
that is installed inside the frame the
coil is said to pull the magnets inward
very quickly thus creating this pulsing
of the blades that in effect suppresses
the noise and this was first demoed some
three years ago and it is the
manufacturing challenges that keeps
pushing active noise-cancelling fans
from hitting the consumer shelves it's
really cool regardless knocked away is
always improving and perhaps we will see
a more ready active noise-cancelling fan
sometime next year at Computex or at
least we can hope
