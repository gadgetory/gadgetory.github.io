happen which is the annual GPU
technology conference in San Jose they
hold many and very interesting and very
advanced seminars on how GPUs are
applied within all types of sectors so
space exploration medicine mobile sector
the automotive sector and many many more
so it really is a developer's playground
to see the direction of GPUs and how
they shape this sat technology world so
there were a couple of highlights from
the show that will go over in this video
so the first one is of course in the
video announcing the Titans e or times e
however you want to call it depending on
where you are in the world so Titans
that incorporates do gk110 unlocked
course so basically to titan blocks
combined into one single card with 5760
cuda cores 12 gigabytes of vram so six
gigabyte per GPU and they're also tuned
to operate at the same frequency to
avoid bottlenecks it's a two and a half
inch slot card so it's slightly thicker
I don't think it was very clear when
Jensen was holding it and it will
require three PCI slots and it is priced
at the whopping wait for it at the
whopping three thousand dollars now in
the world way you can get to tighten
blacks or could potentially get
depending on availability for two
thousand dollars you can imagine there
was a lot of outcry from the community
asking about the three thousand dollar
price perhaps it has been sprinkled with
something very expensive on top of that
and videos placing the Titans that
within their geforce line which is the
gaming line so i would consider this to
be more of a computational supercomputer
or micro super supercomputer for your
needs but they're still placing within
the gaming line and you have to ask
yourself with 4k still hovering around
us to still country trying to break into
the consumer market in the video is
already pushing towards 5k gaming with
it tightens n nvidia also announced
their next-generation graphics
architecture which is pascal its
coordinate pascal incorporates so many
cool features like unified memory so
it's a shared memory pool between the
CPU and the GPU they'll also incorporate
3d memory so it's a married that's
stacked on top of each other that allows
higher bandwidth much improved energy
efficiency and allows for much more
capacity to be installed on the GPU
board so Pascal we're going to see the
actual graphics cards to be smaller
perhaps the most smaller form factor but
the most interesting thing about Pascal
is what Nvidia calls and the link so
envy link is the new interface for
communication between the CPU and the
GPU that will complement pci express bus
it will not replace it but allow for
five to 12 times bandwidth increase
allowing for much faster data share now
this of course is very exciting for
developers and high-performance crowd
who really care about compute as the
Nvidia really sort of teases us with
what supercomputers are to become in
2016 when Pascal finally rolls out but
this doesn't mean that envy link and
Pascal are not totally out of the
consumer world as envie link as a
concept would be ideal and really
perfect for SLI configurations as you
think about it it will reduce bandwidth
and will allow a more seamless
communication between the CPU and GPU
potentially allowing that Unleashed
performance for gaming in sli systems
oculus to also made an appearance at gtc
this year where they showcasing DK to
the development kit to and from I can
tell you it is a much needed improvement
over dk1 you now have a higher
resolution display so pixels are still
visible but you can really focus on the
graphics of the game rather than
checking out the grid lines between
pixels the new motion sensor has been
added to the actual headset allowing you
actual 3d positioning on your head which
side to side up and down and really
makes it so much more fun and immersive
and the fact that DK 2 is here this is
very exciting this means that we are so
much closer to consumer lease almost two
years after the Kickstarter project
another awesome thing we saw a GDC on
the floor was Lenore's entrance within
the North American market with Lenovo
s9 smart TV now Lenovo is not very
popular with the North American market
when it comes to TVs but they're huge in
Asia so they're really storming the
market the North American market with
this awesome smart TV incorporating
Tegra so this integration of nvidia's
tegra k1 SOC comes in the form of a
smart card or a module that you plug
into the television at the back and
since it's an actual system built into
the smart card that features android 4.4
and it has the power to play all of your
android games right from your couch
lenovo will include a controller plus
there's a wireless remote for navigation
within the smart menu and the fact that
everyone is being integrated into smart
TVs is great so giving us the extra
power to drive android gaming off your
couch of course there are also many cars
on the show floor featuring tk1
integration within the automotive
industry for self navigation smart
assist and many more applications so out
of all these announcements which ones
did you find most interesting or gulp
indulging because I know the Titans that
price tag as it was announced on Twitter
it was exploding so let us know how you
feel about that don't forget to
subscribe for more similar content and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
