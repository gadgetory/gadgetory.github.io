great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dimitri with
heartbroken ox Andrade max just
announced a new chassis the vampire this
is winter fall edition this full tower
will set you back $120 and seems to have
things in order with this aggressive
exterior shell that might be just the
look you're looking for we have the
white version here which is the winter
fall although it's also available in
black the plastic is rubberized with the
metallic gray accents seen throughout
the front mesh pieces and these teeth
like plastics on the sides in a way it
does resemble a vampire so I guess the
name is fitting the large window on the
side is tinted it looks great regardless
of how much at exposes of the internals
but rate max decided to place to 120
millimeter intake sloths that really
kill it for me first there are no dust
filters on the side and second are these
square fan mounting cutouts where you
might actually need to use washers to
properly secure your fans at the front
we have five optical slots pull dust
proof and easily removable from the
front and behind the panel is an
incredibly restrictive frame that only
supports a 200 millimeter fan so thanks
for the lack of flexibility the included
fan is this thin type that will
definitely have difficult time
delivering any air intake due to the
frame restrictions on the front and the
wall of the drive cage behind at the
back we are a few water cooling holes a
140 millimeter exhaust fan 10 PCI slots
so EA T X motherboard support is welcome
the vampire stands on quality cage speak
with removable power supply dust filter
and a second filter for the optional
intake but that's on the inside and it's
also screwed in so it can only be
utilized with the same size 140 mm air
fan coming to the top will get PR but
those four USB ports two of which are
USB 3 Auto jacks and the hot swappable
two and a half inch drive slot on the
side that supports both thin and thick
SSDs I personally don't mind this side
placement but be aware it does protrude
on the left side on the other side we
get a fan controller with low and high
settings and an X speed that's supposed
to be the maximum speed of the fan
controller we also have an on and off
switch it does support up to three fans
and is powered through a molex connector
and taking off the top panel it has a
built in dust filter surprisingly as the
front panel doesn't I was hoping for a
better frame design but here we get 200
millimeter fan support dual 120
millimeters or a single 140 millimeter
and you can actually see the partial set
of mounting holes for that second 140 mm
gun fan but for some reason they don't
include all of the four mounting holes
for that second 140 Milner fan also
there isn't enough room to install fans
above the frame but the thickness of the
top cover should allow for a set of fans
to be installed there so the vampire is
turning out to be a total disappointment
in the cooling department for the price
as it's also massive a few more things
that stood out to me that doesn't scream
quality are the plastic glue mesh pieces
inside the front panel followed by dirty
spots inside plastic luckily didn't find
any more inside the case there is a
noticeable color difference between the
plastic white and the steel white that
I'm not a fan of the thread on all the
standoffs on the motherboard tray were
all covered in paint making it extremely
difficult to screw in the standoffs and
also the little tool was not included
luckily I had one lying around and
lastly one of the drive gauge walls was
bent so the nearest Caddy's fell through
and this must have happened during
production as there's no way this could
have happened during shipment so getting
all that out of the way let's take a
look and the internal features and the
white paint job looks great with black
rubber grommets inside the spacious
interior it is unfortunate the drive
gauge is non-removable as its riveted
and it's also non modular you cannot
install any additional fans on
side-facing the motherboard so coming
back to that front intake limitation and
thoughts no radiator support in the
front and this just does not feel like a
2014 release instead a fancy shell
placed on a completely outdated frame
design even the drive caddies are non
tooless requiring screws for both
mechanical and this is these but they
can look at the back there are lines for
convenient connection unlike what we've
seen from antic lately behind the
motherboard it looks great with many
Kabletown outs and ample of room but
again no additional features like SSD
brackets something that's almost
becoming a mainstream thing and one part
of this frame design that I really
dislike is the support for the panel
that doesn't like you tuck any cables on
this side and there's just a complete
waste of space on the inside where you
can't use it for any of the cable
management raid max does include a few
different sized velcro straps that are
useful for cable management but that's
as far as it goes in the features list
and looking in the finished pill the
spacious interior is really nothing
without the support for water cooling or
just appropriate airflow it will support
GPUs up to 13 inches but with limited
room up top with only two and a half
inches so I don't think much thought was
given with regards to water cooling also
the 8 pin CPU cut out is offset from the
corner where it should have been so my
cable almost didn't have enough reach
because the vampire supports large room
on the board so it's taller with a
standard ATX build like this one it's
not as clean as it could have been as
there are no cutouts right underneath
the motherboard but the system is
cleanly regardless thanks to all this
room and cable management at the back is
fine as well but it is disappointing for
all this lost potential with the vampire
now this Wraith max enclosure has a few
positive features like the hot swappable
slot and that I would love to see in
more cases spacious internals and that's
about it they've managed to miss a lot
of features like proper flexibility for
front and top fan mounts the lack of
modularity in the drive gauge
compartment poor water cooling spacing
for the top for such a large full Tower
there's also that lack of quality
control with bent drive gauge dirty
spots inside the front panel and the
poor thread on
motherboard standoffs this is totally
overpriced for the lack of features and
many cases in the same price range from
the likes of Coulomb ass to fractal
design and fantex make the raid Max
vampire totally uncompetitive and would
love to see more focus on user
flexibility for internal functions and
less money and efforts spent on
cover-ups so that concludes our review
let's provide rate max some critical
feedback which I hope they can take
seriously so we don't see such poor
frame designs on the market down the
road so thanks for watching let us know
how you feel about this case and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
