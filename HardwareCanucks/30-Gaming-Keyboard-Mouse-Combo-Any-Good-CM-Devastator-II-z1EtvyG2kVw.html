great technology selection and service
mechanical keyboards have their place in
the market offering great feel and
reliability but they come at a cost
which is simply unaffordable for many
consumers the same goes for gaming mice
though there are some notable exceptions
as we saw in our $25 an under roundup
call the Masters Devastator mouse and
keyboard combo has been popular due to
its low price point and solid value
although it's membrane switches have
always been one of the downsides still
at $30 for a mouse and keyboard with
gaming oriented features many first-time
PC gamers choose to buy it the
Devastator 2 is the refresh to this
popular line and replaces its
predecessor while keeping the super
affordable $30 price point it also
introduces cooler masters mem Kanaka
switches so let's check it out
you
the Devastator turkey board is where
coolermaster is focusing their attention
since the mouse didn't get all not much
of an upgrade from the previous version
so take a look at that first it's a full
sized board with a plastic build
weighing in at around 950 grams for
those who are familiar with the original
Devastator line this keyboard really
hasn't changed too much with the same
textured plastic and etched angular
lines it looks distinctive while the
reflective plastic accents give it a bit
of character call the master took thee
if it's not broken don't fix it approach
with this board and while I appreciate
that I still have some issues with the
overall design the reflective plastic is
a fingerprint magnet and having it below
the space bar means that your fingers
hit it frequently and it dirties quickly
I would have preferred a material that
dirty is less in this position but it's
a minor gripe at the price point
remember at half of this $30 combo it
costs just fifteen dollars the build
quality sure is an exceptional either
and the keyboard does have some flex but
again it's quite decent at the price
Coolermaster is asking we can't expect
miracles here on the board we have media
controls with play pours and volume
control and these physical buttons
actually feel quite good and work well
on the bottom of the board we have to
flip out feet and four rubber pads for
grip and that brings us to the keys the
Devastator has only single color
backlighting in your choice of blue red
or green depending on the model but for
single brightness backlighting it looks
pretty good
while the LEDs aren't that bright their
illumination comes across as clear
thanks to the white undercoat CM is used
similar to the Corsair strafe RGB this
allows for more even and vibrant under
glow and paired with the transparent
switches means that the backlight looks
pretty good my one critique is the
Devastator doesn't have any built in
memory meaning you have to re-enable the
backlight every time your PC is turned
on or rebooted well this backlighting is
great unfortunately the UV coach key
caps aren't fantastic when the backlight
is turned off because the keys are
transparent and not etched white like
most keyboards it's hard to see the
character markings so for those who rely
on looking at the board for typing or
during gaming this might be frustrating
however this is where one of the big
advantages of color masters mem Kanaka
switches comes as these are cherry MX
compatible this means you can simply put
on your own key caps
awesome
is likely that keycaps will cost more
than the Devastator itself so what are
these switches Coolermaster says that
while they use a rubber dome the plunger
allows for a more mechanical feel with
the 12 million click lifecycle that's a
pretty incredible claim for a keyboard
of this price an extended lifespan for
an affordable product is great to see
the keys have four millimeters of travel
and coolermaster has a graph that shows
the force required to actuate the switch
now the switches on the Devastator are
not as good as mechanical switches to be
frank they don't have quite the same
satisfying actuation even if they do
keep the same four millimeters of travel
distance as the cherry switches it's
hard to convey but the switches just
don't feel as satisfying and clicky it
as even mxr eggs and they have more of a
mushy feeling in many way these are an
everyman switch one that will appeal to
a wide audience since they're relatively
quiet and quite accurate and don't
require extensive knowledge of key caps
before buying like various cherry amick
switches do if we compare these
mechanical switches to the Krueger 450k
switches which are a similar design then
there's still a noticeable difference
the 450k switches have a much more
clicker profile losing that Machinist
that is present in the Devastator these
mem Kanaka switches that the Cougar is
opted for do feel much more satisfying
than cool and masters offerings now
here's a sound sample to get an idea of
the volume of these switches
however it twice the price of the Kouga
keyboard alone the Devastator offers
much of that feel at a lower price and
the last important comparison is to
membrane switches as that's what the
Devastator is really competing against
this is where the Devastator shows up
with a better travel distance more
satisfying actuation and overall better
switch experience compared to the
membrane switches on my Logitech G 15
the membrane switches feel far moisture
again and the Devastator feels much
better overall the switches aren't
mechanical for sure and you'll be able
to tell however they're much better than
typical membrane switches and they make
for a nice middle ground and for those
who aren't as picky they could make a
good alternative to mechanical switches
over all the switches in the board of
her great value at $30 for the bundle
but of course we can't simply look at
the keyboard as it is a two in one
package here we have cooler masters
Devastator Mouse which is also
incredibly inexpensive now we just
finished our budget mice under $25
roundup which you can check out here so
I've got some solid comparison and
testing for this mouse first up is the
building design materials here are
certainly not premium but a well-chosen
the plastic isn't as nice as a soft
touch finish but it's well executed I'm
not a huge fan of the sharp angles but
they haven't been uncomfortable and the
soft rubber on the sides is nice the
sensor is some rattle but it's nothing
too major either if we look at the
primary clicks this mouse is using
cooler masters in house switch which
makes it fairly good but nothing great
and the side browser buttons are a bit
mushy scrolling has defined scroll steps
but the mouse wheel has some squeak
which could get annoying over time on
the top yard three illuminated areas
with this really nice scroll wheel
illumination dpi toggle and line motif
the blue lighting looks good and matches
the keyboard but unfortunately there
isn't a way to toggle it on or off like
the keyboard now let's take a look at
the sensor it's using an optical sensor
with 1000 1600 and 2000 dpi levels I'm
not a big fan of this as I'd like to
have seen a 400 or 500 dpi mode for
those who use low sensitivities in game
but optical there's a nice touch over a
simple laser based design first up is
the straight line test and it shows a
fair bit of prediction which is
something to keep in mind and the mouse
doesn't have any added acceleration
coolermaster advertises low lift off
distance which is great and overall
sensor performance has been pretty good
in testing it has some slight issues
with extremely fast movements but for
95% of use the Devastator Mouse holds up
well and I can flick away in csgo with
it registering for everything but the
most extreme of turns this actually
beats out many mice in the 25 to 30
dollar category the Devastator 2 Mouse
isn't as exceptional as the keyboard but
it performs well and makes a solid
bundle for the keyboard overall this
combo seems to offer some exceptional
value with a very competitive keyboard
with unique and overall satisfying
switches great lighting and custom key
cap compatibility and a solid
accompanying Mouse without any major
flaws for the $30 price point the
devestated combo is a solid refresh to
an already popular lineup and it's well
deserving of the hardware canucks damn
good value award so thank you for
