great technology selections and service
the very first air series case from
Corsair was a popular hit combining the
dual chamber design with excellent
direct airflow and enthusiast rating
internals that was the air 540 and since
then this cube concept has really picked
up with many other entries like the note
804 from practical design and some other
leonie offerings to feel the desire for
something different and today we're
taking a look at the second chassis in
the air series this is the air 240
released in both black and white
versions for eighty nine and ninety nine
dollars respectively it still carries
the distinct looked as we saw with the
original 540 but in a smaller form
factor as this would be for micro ATX
and mini ITX builds here's a better view
of really how compact this case is next
to my h4 40min tower and given the
addition of that second chamber it is
obviously wider then the cool thing with
this case is the flexibility for
orientation either standing with the
window on the side sort of your default
method or turn it for top window display
that would allow internal showcase in
some situation so that's pretty cool and
plus you see this Corsair logo square in
the middle well that can be changed as
well depending on the orientation so
that's considerate now one thing to keep
in mind because of this user-defined
orientation is to be careful with
placement as the panels are plastic and
can be scratched easily and we would
recommend applying the included adhesive
rubber case feet right away to avoid any
possible damage there are no optical
base here at the front just a front mesh
for the main chamber with PR buttons
audio jacks and dual USB 3 ports on the
side behind the panel the dust filter is
built-in and here we get dual 120
millimeter intake fans for direct
airflow delivery and on the right side
there is an easily removable magnetic
dust filter for your power supply and
the optional fan mount to help with
cooling in this passive chamber the side
window is large and revealing would stay
on thumb screws that I would love to see
get standardized
however both side panels are almost
paper thin and extremely flimsy
something Corsair really needs to
improve on at the rear we can see that
clear dual chamber separation with power
supply in one along with the rear
accessing storage compartment with this
removable door that also has a stay on
thumb screw very nice to see that behind
it are three caddies and actually this
exterior removal works very well with
the design given the compact nature of
the case but of course it could be
inconvenient in some instances as you do
have to have rear access to those drives
following into the main chamber we have
dual eighty millimeter mounts with four
PCI slots and coming to the top the
panel continues with an identical mesh
to keep the design uniform removing it
reveals a single exhaust fan with
flexible mounting strips and with
optional second fan placement and here's
another exterior access point for SSDs
they actually utilize tools caddies and
this installation from the outside makes
perfect sense to simplify the internal
cabling work the bottom of the case or
the GPU side of the case is also
filtered with an additional fan mounting
points that could potentially help with
GPU cooling but I noticed there was not
enough clearance for a fan with our
micro ATX board installed so you'll only
be able to utilize those fan slots at
the bottom for mini ITX motherboards
coming into the main chamber there are
many rubber grommets accommodating for
both motherboard sizes this direct
airflow design is outstanding to keep
your components cool as there's nothing
abstracting the air channel 13 inch GPUs
are supported meaning there's enough
clearance to install a radiator at the
front if you wish and PCI brackets are
secured with a toolless clamp type
system that doesn't fully secure the GPU
in place and I would prefer a more
conventional method of just using you
only standard thumb screws coming around
to the back both three and a half inch
and two and a half inch drive cages are
removable that are held in with the
thumb screws that also stay with the
cage awesome and I love these small
considerations to really simplify re
installation by removing the larger
drive ke
and the power supply you get convenient
full access to the large CPU cutout for
cooler swap nice now each cage is also
quite open to avoid heat buildup and
that's an important thing to consider
given these items are not actively
cooled and with the optional fan mount
on the side you can still make sure the
rear chamber is well ventilated the
power supply mounts on its side and
given how much room there is the heir to
40 would have no problem accommodating
really long units and here's the
finished build the heir to 40 is
designed to accommodate all in one
liquid coolers at the front only and you
could actually experiment with those
fans for either intake or exhaust
depending on you temperatures and
depending on the cooler of your graphics
card the top slot can only accommodate a
set of fans as there is no additional
clearance for radiators cable management
in the main chamber is cleaned up with
minimal effort thanks to all these
rubber grommets but I wish there were
some additional smaller cutouts right
underneath the motherboard for even
clean and routing now you could spend
some time cleaning up the cables at the
back but since they're not on the way it
doesn't really matter unless you plan on
populating that side fan on the panel
and given how close the drive cages are
together I had no problems connecting
all three drives we had installed with a
single SATA extension from the power
supply now I want to say that while
courser has its issues with quality
control and cheapening out on some parts
like the flimsy side panels they have
sure nailed that nomas perfect
user-friendly design with the air 240
partially because of the dual chamber
design but also the right execution for
all the small details that makes you
preserve your nerves during installation
and aside from that we also get
excellent airflow and full dust proof
design with flexible orientation and the
well utilized and efficient internal
layout now on the other hand the
completely flimsy side panels and not
totally secure tooless PCI clamp that
left our GPU to wobble doesn't reflect
well on the asking price of $99 for the
white version and because of that it
just missed the damn good award
as we keep seeing these quality issues
from Corsair that we hope might soon be
addressed or these see some type of
pricing reductions but what do you guys
think of the heir to 40 from poor sir I
certainly feel it's a much better design
than the original 540 and that shows
that they're listening and it will be
interesting to see what type of changes
they make on the next heir series design
