all right so guys we are here with
fantex at CES 2014 I was really excited
to finally come here and check out what
they have in store because as you know
fantex
enter promo as you can see here deserve
our top number one case of 2013 and
that's a should you know giving them a
lot of praise because this was their
first case ever as well and it shows
that their engineering is behind some
some really functional interior so we're
hoping we were hoping for a smaller
version of the anthro primal and that's
exactly what we'll be seeing here but
before we get to that enter primal you
know it's it's amazing chassis for water
cooling enthusiasts and they know that
Soph antics actually releasing multiple
versions of Android primers so here we
have a full black exterior with a couple
of cool features so we have a white
interior here they'll also be releasing
it in red as well and they also have a
orange version on this side over here
now the original anthro primer had the
sort of brushed aluminum on the
exteriors but what you can see here is
that it's still an aluminum panel but
it's been sort of ascend the sprayed
with more aluminum so as you can see it
has a little bit of a glowy slightly
sparkly feel to exterior shell and it
actually looks really nice so I'm really
happy that they're sort of not sticking
to the conventional brushed aluminum but
they're going to something different and
moving out to here this is their white
version of the N throw primer so once
you come around here and check out this
awesome white LED strip not sure if you
guys can see that but this is a really
cool addition this white case looks
really cool something like you know out
of Star Star Wars but the internals will
be also white so it's like a white on
black chassis and the white is slightly
glossy so it's a piano gloss and there
isn't much color differentiation between
the white which is good to see and
that's it so one awesome feature about
these new additions to the anthem primal
is that the price of the original was
249 and they're so they're telling us
that you know the paint job on these new
Sassy's is a bit more expensive but the
price is maintained at 249 so that's an
awesome feature to see that they're
sticking to the price the consumers want
and they're really storming the
enthusiast market because at 2:49 for
these sort of extreme options with
different color options and different
really awesome functionality is really
excellent to see from fantex so now
let's go ahead and check out their mid
tower or not their mid tower de but they
are smaller version of the n2 lineup</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
