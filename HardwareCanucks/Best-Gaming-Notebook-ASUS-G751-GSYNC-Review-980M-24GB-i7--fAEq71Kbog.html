when I do the finance baby room for
activities modularity strip it down all
you want yeah no problem with the heat
either know what I mean
looking for an intimate moment define s
is something sexy hello everyone I'm
Dimitri with Hardware Canucks and we
hope you enjoyed that pre-roll give us a
like if you did then let us know if you
want to see more similar things down the
pipeline in the future but let's get on
with the review because this is one
kick-ass gaming machine incorporating
some amazing hardware to play your games
this is the first notebook that we
review incorporating a g-sync panel I'm
very excited to share my experience with
gaming on g-sync
on mobile and has some very unique
physical character like all the Aces not
notebooks do so without any further ado
let's Sahlins get into it this is gonna
be a good one
so you're looking at the asus g7 51 our
model shipped with an i7 4720 HQ with
turbo up to 3.6 gigahertz 24 gigabytes
of ram a gtx 980m with 4 gigabytes of
vram and 256 q by PCIe SSD and the one
terabyte 7200 rpm Drive so this thing is
fully decked out for gaming but I you
the type of person who is either willing
or able to spend $2,500 or $3,000 on
laptop and that would be the main
deciding factor if the g7 51 sells or
not
it features top-of-the-line Maxwell M
GPU and without a g-sync
so you can finally play without tearing
lag or stutter on a notebook the display
is 17.3 inches with 1920 by 1080 p
resolution that looks fantastic and I
initially thought it was a higher res
display just because of how crisp
everything looked but why not a 3k
display for this size and price it isn't
IPS panel toe without standing colours
wide viewing angles and because of
g-sync it is a 75 Hertz panel instead of
the normal 60 Hertz that we get on non
g-sync notebooks the slight refresh
upgrade sounds minor but is definitely
noticeable with extra response times for
games it is one of those things that
once you try it'll be difficult to go
back because tearing and games is now
eliminated and things just feel so much
smoother when you let the display
refresh match the GPU frame output and
so the Asus g7 51 is a desktop
replacement no doubt about that
the combination of rubberized matte
surface and brushed aluminum adds a
certain gaming visual element but
without going over the top and I still
think the machine looks gorgeous with
the red illuminated logo on the lid the
red accented vents on the back and the
beautiful red backlight on the keyboard
the sheer size and weight of this thing
would make any gamer on the go really
unhappy with themselves of carrying 8.4
pounds on their back and in size
comparison to this eurocom m5 pro you
can see just how thick that
7:51 is but I'm not saying it's a bad
thing in fact the opposite I'm tired of
seeing terrible cooling and extremely
loud operation with really thin
notebooks so a soos takes this to the
next level of giving us the best
notebook cooling on the market that is
also the quietest which is possible with
the added thickness of the chassis aside
from the ventilation and the ROG logo at
the back all the ports are located on
the sides on the left side we find the
King's interlock two USB 3.0 a blu-ray
drive which I am surprised to see but
there is no reason why it shouldn't be
included and finally an SD card reader
on the other side we find the power
input VGA out Gigabit Ethernet HDMI 2.0
and Thunderbolt port so you can daisy
chain a bunch of things drives monitors
whatever you decide and then there are
two more USB 3 ports and finally the
audio jacks opening the lid
notifications and activity LEDs are
right in front of the trackpad visible
when necessary but nicely discreet with
caps lock LED on the actual key very
much appreciated and the keyboard is one
of the best notebook keyboards that I've
typed and gained on the smooth
rubberized surface is pleasant it hides
the handling marks pretty well and
seriously the added thickness of the
chassis leaves room for proper travel
distance for the keys with satisfying
smooth and light actuations with
immediate rebounds the elevated rear
portion of the notebook sets a
comfortable angle so there are no
irritating edges and I also like the
addition of illumination for the lost
keys so they stand out a bit and the
space bar on the left side is extended
giving your thumb larger surface area to
press I was surprised to not see any
media keys
aside from changing the volume just
because Asus could have incorporated
these into the numpad however there are
a few unique keys in the top left corner
starting with three macro keys that you
can assign to do whatever you want
there's a dedicated steam key shows that
this is a truly a gaming machine and
then there's a dedicated streaming key
that launches xsplit
and if you Stream you'd be happy to know
that an unlimited recording license is
included with an old book which is
usually a $10 monthly subscription so
you can utilize the 1.2 megapixel webcam
while gaming the trackpad is well placed
it's got a large tracking surface with
excellent individual left and right
clicks that are light enough to press
without needing to readjust your hand
and the surface is smooth for
comfortable navigation nothing negative
to say here although I wish it was glass
for the price of this machine I was
pleasantly satisfied with the speakers
on the g7 51 this wall excellent base
response and overall full sound
reproduction let's take a listen
when it comes down to the upgrade
potential removing the plate underneath
reveals the two and a half inch drive
and the PCIe SSD right beside it where a
second tuna 1/2 inch drive can be
installed but only if the PCIe SSD is
removed because they sort of overlap
each other and lastly our RAM slots a
total of four to a which are on the
other side of the motherboard and are
inaccessible from this location but with
twenty four gigabytes installed you
should be okay and I love that this
cover is removable with just a single
screw to help upgrading your drives or
the RAM if it comes down to it much
easier and finally let's talk
performance we compared the Asus g7 51
to the eurocom m5 Pro that has a 970 m
to the gigabyte p35 kv-3 with a 965 m
and the new razor blade pro that has a
960 m and we have all individual reviews
of those notebooks as well so make sure
to check that out but man the gtx 980m
just eats through demanding games with
very impressive averages for enjoyable
gaming and really high minimums too
compared to the 970 m the 965 m and the
960 m and for mobile GPU this is an
absolute powerhouse and so this is what
the machine sounds like after four hours
of gaming and literally just sat down
started playing for four hours and then
you can hear the fans start to spin up a
little bit from the wholly silent
operation but check this out
it sounds almost absolutely silent the
birds outside my window are louder than
this machine at load which means the
cooling system on this machine is very
good with comfortable noise levels even
that load if you put your ear to the
back of the machine you can hear the
fans and you can feel the hot air coming
out but from the very front absolutely
silent so let me move the microphone
around so you can hear what the exhaust
sounds like very quiet indeed very quiet
which brings us to temperatures and not
only are the idle temps impressive
considering the CPU on all these
notebooks the same but the load
temperatures on both the CPU and the GPU
remain below a DC with such a quiet fan
noise I was also impressed at the
battery life with its 88 watt our 8 cell
battery lasting me 2 hours and 43
minutes in our standardized browser
usage scenario and so here is the bottom
line for the asus g7 51 it's heavy and
bulky for reason to allow the cooling
system to do its job without sounding
like a jet engine and yes you do
sacrifice the portability factor but
this being a desktop replacement you
wouldn't want it any other way and this
truly feels like a republic of gamers
product designed to deliver the
performance we would expect for today's
games and now with added g-sync 75 Hertz
display to eliminate tearing and
stuttering and from now on it will be
difficult for me to game on a non g-sync
mobile machine just because g-sync
smooth is out your gameplay and things
in their mid 40s feel like they're in
their 60s and that's it's a good thing
to experience things are more fluid but
what does this machine and who is it for
if you have the means and the funds to
afford twenty five hundred to three
thousand dollars depending on the model
then yes however of course you can make
the argument that with that much money
you could allocate that funds to
building yourself a kick-ass gaming
machine as well however keep in mind
that nothing would be
to match the portability factor and the
ole inclusiveness factor of this because
this is of course a g-sync monitor sort
of built into a notebook excellent
keyboard trackpad and so it encompasses
the entire sphere all the elements are
done right and therefore you are buying
into that totally inclusive experience
not just for gaming but as a desktop
replacement in general and that's why
we're giving it the Harbour Canucks
damn good award so this concludes this
review we wanted to be thorough
so give us a like if you want to see
more g-sync notebook reviews in the
future and make sure to subscribe me
home because we have a lot of cool
things coming very soon and we'll see
you in the next one
hello my friends this is FPS Tasha wait
a second wrong video wrong video
not a fake accent oh not a pig I said
hello my friends this is Dmitry with
Harbour Canucks and this is one kick-ass
game machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
