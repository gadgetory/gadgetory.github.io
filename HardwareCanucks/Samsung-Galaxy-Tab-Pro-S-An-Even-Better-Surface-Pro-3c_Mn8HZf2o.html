Samsung announced their new two-in-one
Windows machine called the Galaxy Tab
pearl s it sports a 12 inch Super AMOLED
display with a resolution of 2160 by
1400 an Intel Core M 2.2 gigahertz
dual-core CPU paired with 4 gigabytes of
RAM and 128 gigabyte SSD if you're the
type of person who loves taking pictures
on a tablet well you have a 5 megapixel
front facing and rear facing camera and
note that it won't be able to record 4k
video but the screen and the CPU are
well optimized for playback some other
key features include a USB 3.1 type C
port and a 50 to 100 milli amp hour
battery that will last you about 10
hours according to Samsung but we'll
test to see how well it lasts in our
full review from our first impressions
we were satisfied with the build quality
of the pearl s the metal frame adds the
rigidity to the whole unit and it was
also very thin to hold the keyboard is
included so you don't have to worry
about getting it as an accessory which
is nice and I'm looking at you Microsoft
the unit is attached to the display via
the magnetic connection and there's
something that looks like a kickstand to
hold the display in place with two ways
to angle the tablet one being the
standard laptop like layout and the
other a more flat orientation it isn't
the most flexible system but with docks
like that you got to compromise
somewhere dimitri had a lot of fun
typing on the keyboard the tactile
response was great and the trackpad was
very smooth to navigate around with
extremely snappy and responsive gestures
with things like zoom and side scrolling
this is our first time experiencing a
Windows tablet with a Super AMOLED
display sure the colors are a little
saturated in Samsung fashion but the
blacks are so deep and sharp the touch
screen is accurate and overall we think
it's a pretty decent package from
Samsung so let us know if you'd like us
to take a close look at the samsung
galaxy tabpro s in the comment section
down below stay tuned for more CES
coverage I'm a bar with harbor connects
and we'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
