it's such an odd name so I'm gonna refer
to this as a g7 but it's the successor
to the very popular g6 that was launched
last year and I had a lot of good things
to talk about the device and of course a
few concerns as well but here we are in
2018 with LG's response to the samsung
galaxy s 9 the 1 plus 6 the iPhone 10
and a few recent ones so having used
this device for the past few weeks I'm
here to share 7 things that you really
need to know before buying the LG G 7 so
let's dive in but first a quick message
from our sponsor evolved with the times
consider nvme storage today the new RC
100 brings affordable nvme storage into
your hands with various capacities in
this super compact form factor that
points directly into you motherboard
it's extremely powerful and utilizes the
Sheba's advance through the flash memory
for awesome speeds so you can be a happy
user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme
Drive to consider check it out below
alright so the first thing that caught
my attention right away after booting
the g7 was the display it's definitely
one of the best panels that have taken a
look at this year apart from the galaxy
s 9 it spans six point one inches and
I'll talk about the size a little bit
later on and it features qhd+ resolution
so the content looks very sharp and
clear especially when watching content
that supports our resolution it's
perfect for YouTube videos and Netflix
the panel technology used here is IPS
instead of amyloid and have nothing to
complain about that the color
reproduction is natural not too
saturated like Samsung's
and the viewing angles are on point so
great stuff LG interestingly enough LG
has implemented a different color matrix
within the display in this case it's RGB
W instead of the standard RGB that means
there's a separate white channel for the
backlit to pass through resulting in
consistent color uniformity as well as
incredible brightness this thing has a
boosted mode within the settings tab
that increases the luminosity of the
panel making it comfortable to view
content in direct sunlight
seriously it's pretty awesome we're
talking a thousand nits in technical
terms then there is the notch
sadly it's a new trend this year ever
since the launch of the essential phone
and the iPhone 10 and what's even
saddening is that there is no other way
to distinguish this device from the
competition but it has grown on me and
quite frankly I'm actually loving it
so you do have little things like your
time your notification pop-ups your
battery status that sort of tuck away in
that area really well and it gives you
more real estate when it comes to
viewing the content you also do have the
option to hide the knotch
within the settings so it's great that
we have those options and I think I'm
okay with that
next up is the rear facing wide-angle
lens now I don't mean to praise the
quality of the image coming out of that
lens and I'll get to that portion a bit
later in this video but it's
specifically the wide-angle aspect you
see we're so used to the dual lens
setups on most modern smartphones and
the majority of them are standard lens
and a telephoto lens whereas with LG
smartphones the wide-angle lens is a
unique addition that lets you compose
some great shots giving you a different
perspective capturing a lot more
subjects in the frame and you can see
that with these images now one could
argue that there are lens add-ons
available in the market that you can
just simply add on or simply clip on top
of the standard lens on most smartphones
and you can achieve that wide aspect or
that wide perspective but it's an add-on
that you're supposed to carry around and
I'm gonna chime in Dimitri here to talk
about that a little bit now my keeper
said this whole wide angle perspective
is awesome on the smartphone because
you're able to capture so much
information from your particular place
or setting and it's a lot more immersive
than having to zoom in on a particular
pixel with a telephoto lens and I wish
more Android phones had that wide angle
perspective and so this is where the
clip-on lenses are quite important they
can be attached to any smartphone they
vary in focal lengths so if you want a
fisheye wide-angle a super zoom and
macro so it's awesome because they can
be adapted to your environment now the
thing is optically they're not perfect
especially this really cheap kit that I
picked up for like $25 that you know
there's a lot of flair there's a lot of
distortion and optically they're not as
clear as if you would just take a
picture with a normal camera but they
give you that additional perspective
allowing you to capture a lot more
information and I really love the macro
capabilities especially because you can
get really close to subject
and just capture things you would
normally be able to do with your
standard camera and I feel like the g7
has done that super wide angle
perspective right there's no distortion
you know the lines are exactly straight
but if you are eager for that additional
wide angle perspective then clip-on
lenses are for you look them up in
description below different price points
and different brands different qualities
but they are an option to expand that
field of view Eber
back to you my next favorite feature of
the g7 is the inclusion of the 32-bit
hi-5 Quantic now this might not be a
huge deal for some of you out there but
it's certainly something to appreciate
especially when you pair it up with some
high-end headphones this guy can easily
drive my Achy g/km nexus as well as my
HD 5 9x without breaking a sweat
the sound is richer more detailed and
refined it's way more superior to the
pixel 2 which by the way uses an
external DAC through the USBC dongle the
cheery on top of the stack is that the
user has the option to manually go into
the settings and play around with
different presets and eq's defined tune
you're comfortable setting awesome stuff
LG okay let's talk about the design and
to be honest I'm a bit on the fence
about this one
first up it's the form factor this phone
is huge I mean for one hand operation
it's really not that feasible especially
when you're trying to reach the top
spots so that's something to consider
next up is the glass back it can get
super greasy over time and it could
potentially cause drops as well because
once the surface gets slippery then it's
just a matter of when you accidentally
dropped the smartphone so I'd be extra
careful when it comes to handling
especially if you like to use your
smartphone as is without any case or
skin something else that can be improved
is the frame and by that I mean the
finish now if you recall the g7 actually
featured an aluminum frame which was a
lot more solid and sturdier to hold my
hand because the matte finish was
actually it just helped a little bit
with the grip when it comes to holding
the smartphone whereas with the
stainless steel body or the stainless
between construction the phone can you
can easily just slip it it's easily a
slippery surface and can pick up
scratches faster as well so that's
something to consider also remember that
the glass back and stainless steel edges
are continuing problem with many modern
smartphones and they aren't exclusive to
LG this is why many of us choose to buy
a case or wrap them in a skin
so my commentary here is about the
smartphone market in general without
pointing a finger directly at LG I think
it's time to look at smartphone finishes
in a whole new way next up are the
speakers and it's not that great
especially when it comes to viewing
content in landscape mode you can easily
mute that which can get a little
annoying at times I would have wished if
they created sort of a dual or stereo
imaging by using or biking taking
advantage of the fun facing speaker on
the left side of the display now LG has
implemented a pretty cool feature called
the boombox speaker and it essentially
resonates the sound coming out of the
drivers into the chassis creating this
room filling experience a few places on
top of the desk or any sort of surface
it gives you a much richer sound quality
compared to the Sounders that's just
coming out of this one speaker whereas
you've got this whole chassis that's
emitting that sound and it sort of fills
the room really well it is something
it's a pretty cool feature in my opinion
but I really didn't see myself taking
advantage of that because I typically
watch content with with the phone on my
hands so it really doesn't make much of
a difference the second last thing that
I have to talk about is the software
experience you see I feel like LG is
really not taking any feedback from
previous reviews from the g6 or the g5
because it really is the exact same
experience from those smartphones I mean
the whole phone is loaded with a lot of
bloatware apps and it's got the LG's
skin on top of Android so it really
slows down the experience as well
because interestingly enough I did a
quick speed comparison launching apps on
the g7 and the pixel one by one and the
pixel was actually a lot faster than the
g7 and it really proves that software
optimization is still not present even
though the g7 has the 845 processor
compared to the 835 on the pixels so it
all comes down to optimization LG still
hasn't learned from their mistakes the
other thing that really boggles me is
that this phone is still running Android
8.0 and that's just unacceptable because
we're almost near to the Android P
upgrade and they're still sticking with
something that's a year old or almost
that was out last year and it's just
unacceptable in my opinion LG has a
really bad history when it comes to
updating their software so ultimately I
just really can recommend this phone if
you're looking for something
software experience and the last thing
that I feel needs improvement here is
the camera performance you see I love
the inclusion of the wide-angle lens on
the smartphone because it helps you
compose some unique shots but the end
result is not that great as you can see
these samples don't retain a lot of the
details plus the highlights are blown
out in many cases I also noticed a
shadow like was a bit longer especially
when shooting HDR and in some cases I
was also able to notice some color shift
with some of the images resulting in a
weird green shift which wasn't
unpleasant now when it comes to taking
selfies LG is slower to catch up on this
front as I wouldn't describe the results
here as spectacular since there are
other smartphones on the market that can
do better in this price range now there
is a manual mode within the app that
lets you adjust the ISO shutter speed
white balance etc but again the software
processing just cripples the sensors
true potential perhaps an update could
make a day-and-night of a difference you
never know so those are these seven
things that you need to know before
buying the LG G 7 just to quickly recap
the things that I loved about this
device is displayed it's just super
bright and very color accurate in my
opinion the wide-angle lens is a great
implementation I loved including this
feature in the first place because it
lets you capture a lot of subjects not
necessarily a fan of the process or the
quality coming out of the sensor and the
last thing is of course inclusion on the
hi-fi
DAC because really when it comes to
listening to music when you pair it up
with a good pair of headphones it's just
amazing the things I didn't like about
this device are the design the speaker
implementation software experience and
of course the camera performance
it really does boggle down it really
takes away from using the device in the
first place because you're looking for a
smart phone especially within the six
hundred to a thousand dollar price range
you are expecting a pretty solid
experience for that price and I think LG
could tidy up a few things with a
software update you never know so that's
the g7 from LG what do you guys think
about it in fact if you're willing to
spend $750 in a smart phone where would
this be on that list would it be
somewhere between the 1 plus 6 and the
Galaxy S 9 or would it be somewhere else
