and today of the review table we're
taking a look at course there's new k95
RGB platinum mechanical gaming keyboard
this is their new successor to be very
popular vengeance k95 and Corsairs
gaming cane 95 RGB series which where
flagship models in their keyboard lineup
at being a flagship keyboard means the
new platinum doesn't come cheap priced
at $200 the kid 95 RGB platinum is one
of the most expensive gaming focused
keyboards on the market but is it worth
paying that premium price we'll find out
after a quick message from our sponsor
the new NZXT air RGB fans can be daisy
chained together for awesome lighting
cohesion in your build with vibrant and
accurate color illumination all easily
controlled through the hue plus via camp
software full details in the description
below now before I get too far into this
video a mention has to be made about the
pricing of this particular keyboard
since I know a lot of you will be
critical about it while it may be
completely outside many of your budget
you can't remember the core set already
offers many other alternatives at lower
price points on the other hand if you
want all the bells and whistles then the
K 95 RGB platinum could be a good fit my
first mechanical keyboard was in fact
the original Vengeance k95 it's for an
18 dedicated macro buttons but I never
took advantage of them for some reason
revisiting this keyboard brings back so
many memories because I love the
detachable wear stress dedicated media
playback buttons the rock solid build
quality and the excellent Cherry MX when
switches the white backlighting on the
keyboard looked amazing at the time and
it still does it works great and I have
passed down to my siblings and they
enjoyed - although not as nerdy as I am
now coming back to the K 95 RGB platinum
Corsair has made some significant
changes from their previous models to
better suit their entire keyboard lineup
including the k70 RGB strafe RGB and DK
65 RGB first and foremost you won't find
those 18 dedicated macro buttons on the
left side of the keyboard but rather you
are left with six of them with texture
key caps so welcoming change over the
previous key 95 because it reduces the
footprint a little bit but if you
desperately need 18 programmable macros
you may need to look at external
solution
or even Corsairs on scimitar Gaming
Mouse the font on the key caps have also
been revised with a wider shape compared
to the previous model it's definitely
not my cup of tea because I love the
simple thought on my first k95 but it
does make sense that course is trying to
share their design language throughout
their keyboard lineup on the positive
side the build quality is still amazing
the anodized brushed aluminum frame is
one of my personal favorites and while
it's a little bit on the heavier side
this should last you a really long time
and that previous k95 is a testament to
that
this keyboard comes in two finishes one
is the stealth black model that I have
here with two switch options Cherry MX
speed and MX brown the other one comes
in a gunmetal finish which is only
paired up with MX speed switches so be
mindful of that the included wrist rest
mounts easily onto the keyboard but
Corsten has done something interesting
with this part the soft touch rubber
surface is magnetized to the frame and
it's dual sided with different textures
so if you prefer a slightly better grip
for your wrist the layer with the
crisscross design works out really well
but I ended up using the softer side and
it was very satisfying they also include
an extra set of walls and mobile key
caps that are textured for better grip
and a key cap for my such flipping over
the keyboard Corsair has implemented
appropriate rubber feet to eliminate
movement and adjustable ways to angle
the keyboard to your convenience
they've also added a cross section cable
management route for your peripherals
ideally you'd be writing your headphone
cable or something else that you might
take advantage of but personally I like
my cables to be separated on my desk
speaking of cables Corsair still needs
improvement here this one is super thick
and quite challenging to rock cleanly on
your setup since its meshes very dense
and hard to menu play it's my least
there part about this keyboard because I
prefer cables that are made of more
bendable mesh and are thinner some of
the extra core thickness is due to the
extra wiring needed for the single USB
path report at the keyboards back
I would have preferred another two of
these ports especially since when a
keyboard is dis expensive there's an
expectation for extra features alright
let's talk about those cherry MX speed
switches getting into the technical
aspects this is a light and linear
switch that activates at one point two
millimeters compared to two millimeters
on an average MX switch
does a few things one it doesn't require
a lot of force to actuate and two they
are super fast coming from my white fox
which features MX blue switches
I took a solid week to get used to the
larger layout of the keyboard and these
switches typing scripts became a lot
faster gaming on it was an unbelievable
experience especially in FPS titles
responsiveness in games like Battlefield
one felt really nice and my fingers
weren't too tired after a few hours of
gameplay which I normally do experience
with my MX blue switches I do have to
mention that these are regular hallmarks
of MX speed switches so it's not like
anything new is going on here from a
feedback perspective here's a quick
sound comparison the lighting on the
platinum shares a lot of similarities
with the k70 RGB which we took a look at
last year Corsair calls it the dynamic
multicolor backlighting which basically
means that you can customize the LEDs
with a variety of color options through
the revised q software that we'll get to
in a moment a few noticeable changes are
an LED light strip at the very top of
the keyboard that consists of 19
individual zones that can be customized
through the driver software this
includes the illuminated Corsair logo
and I've gotta say it's stunning to look
at the level of lighting customizability
is endless with 13 different effects
that you can take advantage of or if
you'd like to create your own effect you
can do that through the driver and the
last thing to cover is the drivers
software the Corsair has revamped the q
software and it works alongside the k95
RGB Platinum's eight megabytes of
on-board storage so you can easily
modify settings and have them saved
directly to the keyboard this is perfect
for gamers on the go who may not have
the advantage of bringing their own
personal computer with them everywhere
for some reason this software comes
pre-installed with a demo version of
lighting controls for their scimitar
Mouse void wireless gaming headset and
their RGB Polaris mousepad
it's a bit weird because I haven't
connected any of these peripherals to my
computer in the first place so there's
no point of having them there Corsair
I'm sure you can fix that with a driver
update on the positive side I fairly
enjoyed playing around with the lighting
and the macros on the Platinum gaming
keyboard as you can see you're greeted
with a physical layout of the keyboard
towards left under the actions tab you
can create customized and assign macros
to any button moving on to the lighting
effects tab you can cycle through
different lighting effects that I talked
about earlier as well as create them the
performance tab lets you adjust the
windows lock key settings and finally
Corsair has implemented onboard profile
storage options that can be accessed
without eq software oh hey there ncx
comm is Canada's leading a tailor for
anything your mind desires just keep
within those categories which are plenty
and be attempted by the weekly deals
visit ncx dot-com for all them sweet
deals so is the k95 RGB worth it's $200
price tag this is a great keyboard that
comes with a ton of features and I
really enjoyed using it everything from
low quality to the cue software and its
layout we're very well done the only
criticism I have is that thick cord but
since your keyboard isn't meant to move
that much it can easily be forgiven with
that being said the Platinum will likely
be outside most people's budget if you
desperately need six dedicated macro
buttons onboard profile storage options
the cable management feature hidden at
the bottom the light strip with the
Corsair logo on the top then perhaps
this could be worth taking a look but
those features aside this keyboard is
basically a k70 RGB which is about 60
dollars less another option is the
regular K 95 which will save you about
$40 if you really want to try out the
new MX speed switches which by the way
is my new favorite switch I would save a
lot of cash picking up the k70 RGB
rapid-fire or the K 65 RGB rapid-fire
it's a game changer especially if you
want to try something different from
your typical Cherry MX which I will
admit it does take time getting used to
this new switch but you're going to love
it after that what do you guys think of
the K 95 RGB platinum would you spend
$200 on this flash or gaming keyboard or
are there any new alternatives that you
might be interested in let us know in
