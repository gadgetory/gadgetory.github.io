great technology selection and service
hello everyone i'm dmitri with hara
Canucks and up to this point fantex had
always impressed us with their case
designs not only have they been priced
well against the market trends but their
focus on future proofing the chassis and
building an extremely functional
interior are just some of the things
that strengthened their reputation the
evolved series started out with this
part aluminum ATX tower and its unique
design that fantex is carrying over into
a budget ITX iteration and i think
that's an excellent strategy as gamers
are now moving towards ITX builds and to
be honest once you see the build we did
with this it's also extremely rewarding
now fantex has cut down on the premium
materials used now with more plastic
integration but without making the
chassis feel weak and both the front and
top panels have a sheet of metal with
this a slightly reflective texture for a
bit of extra character the front i/o
includes dual USB three chrome audio
jacks a reset button with a power button
right above it on an almost completely
solid top panel aside from these side
ventilation openings now the top panel
has a bit of height to it to allow air
to exit through the back and the sides
and not just balance off the top surface
the front panel is also pretty solid but
it's spaced out from the interior frame
and also has these side entrances to
deliver the airflow behind the front
panel that easily pops out is a large
dust filter that's also removable for
cleaning is a massive 200 millimeter
intake fan now these are $20 apiece and
seeing this quality fan included is how
fan --tx likes to operate with dual 120
and 140 moment or fan holes available at
the front as well now aside from the
familiar evolved exterior shape we also
find this LED strip that we were
actually able to interchange on the
original evolve for different colors but
on the ITX unfortunately it's just blue
with very faint and brightness it's
almost unnoticeable and at this point
kind of pointless to the side panel is
revealing shows off the power supply
section the entire main portion to and
you can't forget about the subtle fantex
logo really nothing negative to say
about it and it actually survived my
nail scratch test yes now looking in the
back the two PCI brackets are white it's
a bit strange the rear exhaust supports
120 and 140 ml fans with mounting strips
as well perfect and the bottom power
supply has plenty of room to breathe
given the chassis is elevated with
rubber feet and removable dust filter in
there as well and getting inside the
first thing that I want to mention is
this clever mounting system for your top
fans the entire bracket is modular it's
on rails held in with silver color-coded
screws for easier distinction and slides
out so you can install fans or a
radiator outside of the case it's a
super convenient system with dual 120
and 140 member fan options again on
these rails for the most flexibility
internally the floor is well ventilated
to allow the GPU to breathe and you can
see the advantage of this massive 200
number of fan that will channel airflow
directly into the main chamber Plus
let's some into the bottom chamber a
little bit too and here is only a
partial build and I am utilizing the GTX
980 hybrid from EVGA with a rear mounted
rod as my idea for this build is to have
a fully water-cooled system with
all-in-one coolers of course and the
GPUs are up to 13 inches are compatible
now all the main mid section cutouts are
covered with rubber grommets and a lot
of spaces for cable routing up top - I
love what they did with this extra Drive
bracket that is removable and sits above
the rear portion of the GPU it supports
either an SSD or three and a half inch
drive using these rubber mounting screws
as one SSD bracket is included so it's
as simple as a line and slide and
actually have to rotate the bracket so
my SATA cables had enough reach but here
you can see the appeal of having the
extra storage potential an optional
three and a half inch drive bracket can
be purchased that would align and slide
into that spot just as well plus a pump
bracket can be bought that is rubberized
to prevent vibrations and would install
on top like you see here now fantex
unfortunately has taken a step back when
it comes to accessories and the
standard baggie is included which is a
bit of a letdown
as the accessory toolbox has made an
appearance on all of their cases in the
past unfortunately not with the evolved
ITX coming around to the back there's a
ton of room to work with you can stash
the majority of your cables in this gap
on the side of the power supply
it's brilliant the side panels closes
just fine includes a large CPU cutout
fantex staple velcro cable management
straps a spot for an SSD or an HDD
bracket if you don't want it inside and
the bottom chamber houses a standard ATX
power supply up to 180 millimeters and
the drive cage for two mechanical drives
or SSDs now one cool thing is you can
totally remove the drive cage at the
bottom and the bracket above the GPU to
install a 240 millimeter radiator at the
front that would leave you with just tho
one storage spot in the corner here now
alright it's time to put my radiator
inside with the help of this removable
bracket that I now realize is so
convenient as otherwise the installation
would be a lot more tedious after
hooking up the fans and powering the
system on this is an impressive all
water-cooled mini ITX gaming rig sure
it's not a super small case but water
cooling is what the evolved ITX was
designed for everything fit although I
had to make sure to mount the GPU rad in
the lowest possible spot to allow
clearance with the 240 ml rad at the top
and one thing I want to point out is how
perfect the 980 hybrid suits this case
allowing the majority of heat to exit
through the rad and the same goes for
our coarser cooler and letting the 200
number fan do the rest with fresh
intake if I was to replace the GPU I
don't have to take out the entire drive
bracket I just need to open the flap to
gain the access to the GPU and swap can
be made possible and closing that side
panel reveals all the important hardware
and all that's missing is interior
lighting that would make this build even
better so in the end the Evolve ITX is
an extremely rewarding chassis to
working with plenty of water cooling
potential as I've shown here it's not
exactly a small chassis for an ITX form
factor
but there are no compromises for
enthusiasts hardware and we're giving it
the Harwick nugs dam grant award and now
let's wait around for a truly compact
chassis from fantex but given their
entire portfolio is super water cooling
friendly it might be a challenge that I
hope will be as impressive so guys thank
you so much for watching our review of
the evolve I TX I had fun filming it and
I had really a good time building inside
of it as well but what are some of the
things that you look into when building
or considering to build inside in the
ITX case what are some of the things
that you have to have for your for you
to consider the build successful leave
your comments down below now we will
have the GTX 980 hybrid GPU review
coming out very soon so make sure to
subscribe to not miss that and as always
thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
