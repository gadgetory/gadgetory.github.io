Hardware Canucks and a little change of
locations I'm here at Mike's place hey
Mike hey how's it going well so today
we're gonna be taking a look at AMD's
game streaming service and for those of
you who don't really know that it was
rolled out as a feature in the Adrenaline
2019 update which was rolled out last
year so I actually did an entire video
covering that software so if you're
interested in learning more link will be
right over there I'm excited about this
I have to because we've been working on
this actually and behind the scenes
since around Christmas so that's about
four and a bit months now yeah
we originally started we had a bunch of
issues with it we let aim the iron out
the kinks yeah and we decided to go a
little bit of a longer term video on
this especially since you guys asked us
for it in that video that Eber did yeah
so uh let's check it out right after a
message from our sponsor which is not
AMD exactly excuse me please explain is
easy to systems fully powered by a
single power supply just like me and you
two bodies powered by a single mind just
imagine the good we can do they revolt X
by Phanteks a high-performance unit for
multi CPU GPU and dual system
configurations with 80-plus platinum
efficiency with entirely silent fan mode
and twelve year warranty and clean cable
management explore the opportunities
with the revolt XPS you buy fantex links
below all right so let's actually talk
about what AMD gamestream is it's
essentially a service provided by AMD
that lets you stream your PC games from
your PC to any device so it just
requires a GC and base GPU so anywhere
after an R9 to ATX and onwards and then
you'll be good to go so the GPU will
process the image and then it'll send
that to a wireless network to any device
and what they mean over any device is
any iOS or Android device that's not an
Apple TV or a Android TV yeah so
basically what is it's a little bit more
inclusive than steam link which requires
steam to actually process any of the
games or in videos game stream or
GeForce now which needs NVIDIA GPUs or
devices end-to-end so AMD says this is
really straightforward what we want to
do actually is we want to use
the shield tablet which is but what we
want to do is we want to use the shield
tablet from Nvidia it's a little bit of
an older device but at the same time
this should show if you can repurpose
slightly older Android devices for the
service okay so Mike I know that you
using game stream for the last four
months why don't we actually go through
the setup process yeah actually the
first thing that I needed to change and
set up for myself was a new TV I was
actually using one of Panasonic's
legendary plasma TVs the problem with
that is it's really high latency so I
ended up changing out to a Hisense h9
series and I got that because it was a
less expensive 65 inch TV
it's a 4k UHD HDR support through Dolby
vision it's super slim and it has a lot
faster response times than my older
plasma I did keep that over older plasma
because a its legendary and the picture
quality is absolutely ridiculous but
this high sense TV really came in at a
good time for us alright so drive our
installation and this is something you
really have to pay close attention to so
make sure that they're running the
updated drivers but also be aware that
if you plan on updating it later on
you'll have to go through the whole
process of setting up AMD link once
again so the first thing that you want
to do is turn on we live in game
settings and then head over to the
streaming tab and enable remote play now
without this AMD link will still work
with monitoring GPU stats to Whatman on
your phone but game streaming won't work
the next thing you want to do is install
the AMD link app on your Android or iOS
device and then enable AMD link server
on the home page of Radeon settings now
with an AMD link there's a lot of
different sections including monitoring
and setting up screen captures things
like that but what we really wanted to
focus on was of course the AMD game
streaming now as we went through the
setup process we realized that there's a
QR code that you can scan on your
Android device or your iOS device but no
matter what we tried we couldn't get it
to scan so from there you would have to
go to the your manual setup mode which
is a timed mode you have to find your IP
address and everything
and once we did that we ended up getting
it to work without a problem taking a
peek at the interface it's pretty
straightforward
so there's quick access to the desktop
by pressing the windows + D option the
ability to view stream metrics set your
desired resolution frame rates and the
option to choose the quality of the
video and audio bit rates we did notice
that the higher the bitrate the smoother
the gameplay experience provided you
have the proper wireless bandwidth
there's also the ability to switch
between hardware and software controller
options although to be honest we
preferred using an actual physical
controller than tapping on the display
so all of that being said there's a
couple things that we wanted to get out
there on the table right away that
you're gonna have to really be aware of
when you're going through the AMD game
stream service so the first thing that
you have to do is always make sure that
any sign-in services like epic game
store you play Steam you're already
signed in and they're opened up in the
background because if you try to
actually open a game within AMD
link and the game streaming service and
you're not signed in it will not work or
it'll crash the other thing that you
want to make sure of is that all of your
games are in your firewall exceptions
now that should all have already been
done but we need to re-enable that in a
couple of situations or you could turn
off your firewall but we really don't
recommend that also do keep in mind that
the aspect ratio off your device will be
used rather than your TV or a PC so in
this case with our shield TV the TV was
like only able to take the aspect ratio
from the tablet and not the actual PC so
another thing that I wanted to talk
about is the latency factor now there's
a couple things that we did to minimize
the impact of the wireless network and
the TV first of all I turned on game
mode on the TV to basically get rid of
as much processing as possible and the
router that I'm using is the rog GT 5300
which is quite the high-end router now
we also have to take into account that
there's going to be some latency between
the wireless controller and the tablet
as well as through the HDMI connection
obviously as Mike mentioned the latency
was just quite high even though that we
were just within 25 feet from a powerful
router and it was not really suitable
for competitive gaming as you can see by
this footage
as soon as I pulled the trigger on this
gunshot it takes quite some time for it
to actually show up on the display so
latency actually increases with frame
skipping so I would actually recommend
to avoid that setting but regardless of
what we did the one you know really
frustrating thing that we had to deal
with the AMD link was of course latency
with that being said there's still some
good things after trying out AMD link
yeah so I found that shadow of war it
looked really really good it's played
smoothly there was of course that delay
between the input and when that input is
registered on screen but it was less
noticeable than in of course competitive
games first person shooters things like
that assassin's creed Odyssey was also a
highlight it worked really well straight
up the second we tried to enable it it
booted no problems and we were into the
game that shows that a lot of these
third person games that are ported from
the consoles to the PC are going to
typically work really really well here
but personally what I was really looking
forward to is the slower paced games and
how those would react because I really
wanted to play my favorite strategy
games like Warhammer 2 battlefield
gothic 2 Civ on my big-screen TV it
would have looked amazing the problem is
that there seems to be some inherent
issues with keyboard and mouse support
between aim d-link or AMD game streaming
and the Android ecosystem we actually
saw in Warhammer 2 mice show up on the
screen and neither of them worked
properly so that was really frustrating
it was yeah and was kind of hilarious
too yeah there were some other real
issues as well that we encountered so
with hell-blade we noticed that the
colors were completely in burst so we
started seeing blue faces as in blue
characters which was really really odd
Far Cry 5 crashed reportedly in fact
we've had a couple of instances where I
would completely restart the system and
it just didn't really work at some point
and of course the other thing is that we
experienced green screen issues when
launching battlefield 5 and battlefield
1 I think it's more of an origin thing
rather than anything else but but then
again yeah yeah you play games like
Rainbow six siege didn't start
I didn't start Metro Exodus on the epic
game store even though we were signed in
and everything it looked like it was
gonna start it didn't happen so so
ultimately what we're trying to say is
support is very limited and if you're
planning on you know trying to set up
for yourself you got to make sure that
it actually works and the good thing is
it's it's not a subscription service so
you can always experiment with these
things but like I said from our
experience it it was really not that
great yeah I think one of the things
that we have to applaud AMD for is
putting this into their drivers yeah but
just having that checkbox there and not
having I don't know if it's if it's the
financial support that the team needs to
make sure that they make this more of a
holistic approach or something along
those lines it's it just seems like they
try to check off a box yes we support
game streaming but it's really not there
yet the latency I have to give it to
Nvidia and steam because both of their
services the latency is absolutely
nothing compared to what we've seen now
with indie game streaming if you guys
want to see a comparison between all
three of those services side to side
latency wise we can do that but it'll be
a landslide win for anything but AMD at
this point exactly so I think we're
happy that the streaming is there but
it's not to the point of maturity right
now but we're hoping that it gets there
in the near future so that's pretty much
it thank you so much for watching make
