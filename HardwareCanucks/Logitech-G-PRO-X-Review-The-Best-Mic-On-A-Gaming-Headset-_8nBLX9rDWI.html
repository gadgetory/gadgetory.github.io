like this so the new G Pro headset I'm
really happy to see a new Pro line of
products because the pro series is all
about design but collaboration eSports
players giving the feedback on like the
shape of the mouse and the weight
announce the clique enos the keyboard
switches and the same thing with the
headsets and this is the first product
from Logitech that incorporates
something from blue because Logitech
acquired Blue Microphones and I'm really
happy to to see something being
incorporated to improve the microphone I
feel like this might become the new
benchmark to beat for a gaming headset
under $100 let's take a look after this
the master pen series from Coolermaster
has now received a fresh new look with a
square frame designed to generate high
pressure air flow and silent operation
the fans feature this beautiful
addressable RGB illumination and you can
pick it up in 120 240 and 360 millimetre
variants learn more in the description
down below so first let's talk about the
price $99 for the standard headset and
$129 for the Pro X which includes the
USB dongle that has the built-in Blu
voice functionality to be honest I was
expecting hardware integration with Blue
Microphones into the Logitech headset
instead of it being software only in
terms of design they do remind me of the
HyperX cloud series similar type of
headband with stitching on the side the
stamping of the pro into the leatherette
the size extensions are quite similar
with the aluminum sort of hinges that
feel quite premium but there is no
rotation the United degree rotation like
we've seen on the previous G pro headset
I do like the coiled cable in each ear
cup that adds this retro design and the
overall frame here is pretty subdued
with matte black plastic which again is
found on a hyper X series a black
aluminum black leather and the silver
accents with the G logo in the middle
and if you remove the microphone you can
easily wear these outdoors they're not
ridiculous like the Chiefs piece 670 or
like the Sun Heiser series I would use
these for music no problem the left and
right distinction is inside the ear cup
so don't bother looking on the action
frame we have a separate velour earpads
set which is nice they don't accumulate
as much heat but based wrapping is much
better with the leather ear cups and as
usual logitech includes plenty of
accessories like a splitter cable your
mobile cable we have a pc cable that has
a volume wheel and we also have the USB
dongle on the pro-x headset and a nice
little carry pouch overall I feel like
they've improved on the build quality
you can stretch this thing you can
extend the size extensions to their
maximum and the headset still feels
quite solid which is not what I can say
about the original G Pro had said size
extensions and the whole frame just
feels kind of plasticky and kind of
cheap and fragile in comparison the new
pair is just a lot more comfortable much
better clamping force it's not too tight
but it's there so that you can create a
nice seal around the ears given the
software ear cushions and the drivers
here are the same 50 millimeter G Pro
drivers but they've been tuned
differently I can definitely hear the
difference versus the original they're
more detailed there's a lot more clarity
but everything is a bit closer verses on
the original G Pro the soundstage I felt
like was a bit quieter things felt a bit
more airy and a little bit more soft too
now compared comfort wise to my current
favorite $99 gaming headset the GSP 300
the pro and the Pro X have more clamping
force which means they create better
isolation which I would say is a good
thing but the overall ear cup design on
the GSP 300 is slightly better so the
ear cups are oval and they're taller and
the actual driver wall is slightly
deeper so that when they're on my head
and I press the actual ear cup my ear
still does not make contact with that
internal driver wall which is nice for
larger ears but not the same thing with
the Pro and the Pro X and for those who
wear glasses the clamping force is
pretty good I don't feel like there's
any additional pressure being
accumulated on the sides over here nice
although glasses I feel like I'm more
comfortable with the GSP 300 because the
ear cups are not as wide as on the Pro
and Pro X which means that there's less
contact area between the ear cup and the
actual glasses arm as for sound gaming
performance whatever they were doing
with the G Pro drivers they should be
doing more of it really happy with the
entire performance and this is something
that Logitech has been like really
drilling down saying that they don't
color the entire range
try to make sure that drivers do not
distort on the lower end so that the
bass you hear is actually the base
you should hear and not something that
is being boosted and I do appreciate
that they sound much better versus the
original G Pro which have the same
drivers but slightly different tuning on
the new pair better definition
throughout the entire range deeper bass
and the closer closed or closed they're
less open soundstage so things do sound
more detailed when they are closer and
that is one compromise I did enjoyed the
openness of the original G pro but I've
been thinking for a gaming headset
closed soundstage for a closed pair
makes sense but compared to my GSP 300 I
feel like this one has better audio
separation throughout the entire range
when a lot of things are going on
because they have a slightly wider
soundstage versus the Pro X is very
closed but both have really nice control
treble smooth not harsh no distortions
bass is like the deeper on the GSP 300
but with the Pro X you can actually add
a bit of bass in the EQ settings via the
dongle and that actually adds a nice
little oomph in the lower end without
distorting anything which is awesome
overall I feel like they've done a
really good job with tuning these
drivers to make them sound still really
fun but not flat or harsh on a high end
and the bass is still present and you
can play around with the EQ settings
without totally destroying the entire
spectrum and now ladies and gentlemen
the microphone test which seems to be a
really important part for Logitech and
it's integration with Blu voice but I do
want to remind you that this is only
available on the Pro X headset because
of the USB dongle and not on the pro
headset which doesn't have it so I'll
touch base on the main microphone
section over here first let me go into
the equalizer this is all the basic
things you can adjust different EQ
settings a bunch of presets are already
pre-loaded which is nice same thing with
different game genres one cool thing I
found is that you can create your EQ
profile and share it so you can download
your friends profiles and what you're
listening to or potentially a player
that you follow which I found really
cool in the acoustic tab here we have
our volume microphone input and side
tone and the sight on here is
appropriately loud so if I max it out I
can hear exactly what I'm saying so the
microphone is
sensitive if you want to really monitor
how loud you are speaking or if you can
lower it if you don't find that to be
useful to you here we also have noise
removal for the microphone and surround
sound but as I've said earlier surround
sound and here even with like different
settings surprisingly poor not as good
as we've seen or as I've heard with a g9
33 or the 600 series but really the star
of the show is the microphone tab and
they've done such a good job here
outlining all different parameters and
you can hover over a little question
marks to learn about which of these what
they do but if you're not into all the
little things you can also play around
with different presets either the pro
broadcaster presets from different
players or different blue voice presets
which I've found to be really good
starting points I'm like tweaking them a
little bit and what you're listening to
now is my custom preset that I've also
listened to and make sure that it's kind
of what I like to hear
and you can enable voice so this is
right now without any blue voice
software parameters interacting with the
recording and now it is with so nice
bass good broadcast quality nice
compression the really cool thing
they've done here is let you record the
little mic test and then play around
with different parameters in EQ settings
so you can hear how the microphone will
sound and only then apply the preset or
save that as a preset which I found
really cool my favorite out of the bunch
would be the broadcast to preset and
I've tweaked it they'll slightly
networks well for my voice and now let
me plug in a different headset like the
original G Pro so you can hear the
difference between this microphone and
the improved six millimeter capsule so
what you listen to now is that recorded
by the original G Pro headset going
through the same DAC so all my
parameters that I've applied for the Pro
X headset now goes into the original G
Pro and it sounds almost identical like
the difference with the preset applied
are almost noticeable in even if I
disable voice right now the actual
quality of the microphone sounds
identical even though it is a formula or
a capsule instead of six and now we got
the GSP 300 plugged into the same USB
DAC and listen to what happens to my
voice when I enable blue voice all right
so now we're listening to the same
personal sound
said through the GSP 300 there's just
something off about it even if I tweaked
my expander/gate set settings noise
reduction presets and stuff like that
they're just it doesn't sound as good as
it does on a G Pro X and the same can be
set with the GSP 500 right now Blu voice
is enabled everything's going and the
same DAC so I haven't changed anything
but the headset and there's just
something off about the vocal clarity
even with when the blue voice is enabled
when I disable it the microphone sounds
pretty good and that could be the reason
why larger stick is not selling the USB
hub separately because it might interact
with different microphones and might not
benefit some microphones over others I
was hoping to see more hardware
implementation with blue microphones
instead of it being really software
focused and it's kind of weird because I
always felt that proline was always
meant to be simplified it's just like
it's right there it works but here they
went like above and beyond in terms of
customizing your voice to make you sound
Pro and it's more like audio editing
software instead of being a feature and
sure we have multiple presets built-in
and you can go in and spend some time or
like customizing to see what each slider
does and how it affects your voice but
it's almost like going against or the
pro line is all about and when we asked
if they will sell the dongle separately
so that you can connect the different
headset to it and still utilize the blue
voice functionality they are kind of
hesitant on that and I understand it
because when testing my own headsets
plugging in different things they sound
different and therefore it could
compromise the whole blue voice feature
if you're plugging in the headset and it
sounds terrible right so on that front I
get it but again it had to be something
clarified because my initial impression
was like why don't you just sell this
dongle separately so that I could
utilize this voice functionality with
plenty of my other headsets but the old
you sound quite different versus this
one
alright good people so let me know your
thoughts about the microphone quality
and the whole blue voice functionality I
definitely think it adds value but being
the $30.00 dongle and surround sound
being kind of terrible that is the only
thing you're paying for but in terms of
its being competitive
the pro by itself $99 is pretty decent
but it is again competing with like
their cloud alpha or the cloud 2 and
they'll be interesting to see which
headset people will gravitate towards in
the long term because right now I feel
like that cloud is like the dominant
thing when it comes to designs like this
alright I'm Dimitri thanks so much for
watching I'll talk to you in the next
