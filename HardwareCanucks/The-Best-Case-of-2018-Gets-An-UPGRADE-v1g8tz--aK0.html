Canucks welcome to another CS video I've
just arrived - Liam Lee you know meeting
up with the people who have designed the
case of the year for 2018 so around on
applause here we have their Bauer in the
background it's really cool to get the
brief with the people but first huge
thanks to our sponsors Thermaltake fans
X course a razor and MSI for making this
trip possible alright so the first item
on the list is this desk the DK o4f so
the cool thing about this desk right now
is that they have a new liquid crystal
layer applied below the glass so that
you can go from foggy to crystal with a
press of a button hey who took the
remote where's the remote mint or is it
the oh it's right here
so right now we have this remote but the
eventual control will be sort of
integrated into this touch panel that
also has some fan control and LEDs that
you'll be able to connect from your main
system but check this out boom I hope
that worked yes now it reveals the
entire system below it so the desk
itself has not changed much but they did
have a new power supply that is sole
purpose is to trigger the crystal
rotation because that you know of the
press of button it turns the crystal 90
degrees which is why we can not see them
and see them again and because this
crystal layer the actual glass is a
little bit foggy by default so it's not
crystal clear but the foggy is the
unique element and that's the original
desk it is fully motorized so we have
the control box here we can set four
different presets and yeah that is the
d.ko for f1 take suite so we are of
course treated with some beverages here
at Leonie but Roman here what do you
have what type of saying they have in
Germany yeah we say that three beer are
also a schnitzel so I would agree all
right the Razr Edition is ready let's go
check it out so this is the case of the
year the Oh lemon dynamic razor edition
a few changes here are of course the LED
strips on the side spending that entire
glass
illuminating that middle Razer logo and
this corner edge which looks awesome
they of course have added the neon the
standard sort of reference style
illumination under glow for all Razer
edition cases obviously all that money
and research and development for the
Razer green USB ports have not gone
wasted that is also here and this new
sort of coating that is fully black so
if you're going for this whole matte
black design and some LED the Razer
Edition 11 dynamic may be your choice
and it looks like you know the old
leaven dynamic has been so popular among
the water cooling community that ek has
designed their own water block that goes
onto this entire front panel and their
multiple cool elements here is because
this whole thing is completely
transparent basically which is very
difficult to do we also have this
multiple distribution plate so you can
see how the liquid goes from one place
to another from your GPU to the CPU and
we also have a flow meter and a pump
built-in so a lot of cool things inside
this front water block from ek for a
particular for the 11 dynamic Lea and
these also going to be releasing an
all-in-one cooler so this one's
different because the pump has been
relocated from your traditional space
over here all the way up top where your
reservoir so the pump is stronger which
means that you know the flow rate of the
liquid will be higher and therefore
performance will be better but the you
know the concern right now is because of
this extension so if you populate fans
right here it will cover the whole thing
and there's also a bit of length
extension about 30 millimeters but this
is what looks like installed inside the
case so if you have the fans pushing air
through the radiator it's not really an
issue but what if you mount these fans
on the other side then this whole space
becomes a little bit you know awkward
but what do you guys think about this
design of course a stronger pump means
better performance so yeah we'll see you
when this thing launches and another
interesting aesthetic element is this
water block cover so it's magnetic just
attaches inside to reveal the ring of
illumination which looks really nice and
even and soft and removing it gives us a
little bit more of that if you're into
that and then the last two cases are
pretty impressive so
this is the tu 150 and the slightly
larger 11 ROG edition with a bunch of
other model names attached to it but
first let's check out tu 150 this really
nice compact
ITX enclosure that tries to go ahead
after the market who want a handle yet
still have this nice compact element
with full graphics card support SFX and
SFX
L power supply on the interior and 175
millimeters for CPU tower clearance
which is awesome so airflow is kind of
covered because we have either 120 or
140 millimeter fans at the front and
then the rear section as well so airflow
will be linear it is Chad you know kind
of targeting towards airflow users air
cooling users but you can still maybe do
a 140 120 all-in-one for the front the
GPU section we have three slots over
here so that's not really an issue and
because the SFX SFX L power supplies are
mounted above that's not really an issue
for clearance we also have this low
space beside the motherboard for cable
management and a to reveal an SSD which
is cool so there are some visual
elements in there and my favorite part
aside from the handle like if that's
into you you can remove the top panel
and that is where all your cable
management is sort of routed through so
that's a really unique way to hide the
cable so they're not behind the case
making it pretty slim and yet gives you
you know more channels than normal to
just basically hide everything that you
need from the power supply and then
finally we have the O 11 ROG certified
revision 2 so it's basically the OL 11
dynamic that's been sort of enlarged
both in height and width to support
let's say 120mm fans at the back so
that's awesome if you want to have a
little additional airflow over here or
installed radiators or fans there the
actual bottom section has been expanded
so you can mount a giant radiator in
push-pull situations and the really
clever band bracket that is installed
from the case on a little bit of an
angle so you don't need to fiddle around
with like trying to insert it from the
top that's appreciated in terms of the
rest of the specifications it simply
follows the same 11 dynamic Mattel
the motherboard trace like indented so
all the rubber grommets are on the sides
for Ezekiel management they have
installed new covers on the side mount
which means that you can either cover
them up or for a little SSD action or
open them up for that you know
traditional side exhaust the ventilation
design on the top has been changed to
kind of complement this whole RG
direction and in the front we now have
additional IO at the bottom so two
additional USB 3 ports alongside that's
you know original iOS facing over here
with type C and color combination
control for the RG Edition and they're
still kind of debating on where to
install the LEDs potentially either at
the bottom or on the side so let us know
what you might prefer this is going to
be a premium edition so of $1.99 versus
the 129 for the 11 dynamic which means
that the exterior paneling is all going
to be aluminum and like steel on the
previous versions and we're gonna have
this included vertical GPU brackets so
you can install multiple GPUs vertically
and it looks like a robust combination
so you can mount the the whole base to
the actual frame and you can even remove
the little piece of the back so that if
you do have the card that is closest to
the side panel it's not going to
interfere with whatever I oh you're
trying to plug into it so a nice clever
design alright guys so that is all from
Liam Lee has been great to meet with
Roman and look who shows up and gates
very nice that's how you randomly meet
here yes at CES all the time little
somewhere but yeah thanks so much for
watching
it's great to have these fellows in here
and I will see you guys in next video
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
