tech bytes we're gonna be taking a look
at a new series of gaming case from an
tech now it's been a while since the
company's come up with something new
with the nine hundred and twelve hundred
designs sort of being recycled over the
past few years anyways we had the DF 85
part of their new dark fleet series and
we're going to be taking a look at the
exterior giving you our expect
professions and impressions on the
exterior as well as taking a look at
some of the interior features and giving
you our feedback stay tuned
alright so this is by no means an
official hardware connection video
review on this case and unfortunately
don't think we'll actually be able to do
one however we're gonna take a quick
spin around the outside open it up look
at some of the features on the inside
the hopefully give you guys a little
better idea about what this case is all
about so just by looking at the front
here you can tell that an Tek went a
little bit wild yeah wild with the
design over the cd-rom drive bays here
we have these little latches now I can
see this being ridiculously annoying if
you're trying to eject your CDs and
stuff and having these over the top up
at the top we have a reset button there
are three USB ports as well as USB 3
we'll take a look at that connector in a
bit audio ports and then the the power
port now this is also cool up at the top
I'm just going to move the camera is we
have this which is a 2.5 inch adapter
now we saw something like this on the
6.92 from Coolermaster this is a little
bit different though it's fully enclosed
it's got plastic over top and you slide
the 2.5 inch drive in there and it is
going to be hot swappable and all that
fun stuff so setting stuff back down
moving down what you'll see here is
there is one two three front hundred and
twenty millimeter fans and you'll also
notice that all of them on the side here
have controls now I believe again we'll
see that when we open it up that this
front piece actually completely opens up
so you can install all of your hard
drives from the front alright really
quickly at the side we have a side
window as well as down below here a
hundred and twenty millimeter fan
intake port or external on the back what
you'll see is we have control for four
different fans you can go high medium or
low settings with the included antique
fans there are two rear hundred and
twenty millimeter fans the i/o area
there are seven PCI expansion slots we
have the tubing holes for water cooling
and then a bottom mounted power supply
and then we spin it around again to the
side just a blank side panel and we are
back at the interesting looking front
and then quickly before we take a look
inside there are two hundred and twenty
millimeter exhaust fans at the top
alright so we will just open it up from
the side here take a look at the
interior
so starting down at the bottom you'll
notice the power supply is raised on
these little rubber feet here and then
moving to the front you have this hot
swappable module here which watch you
see another one up in total for drive
bays you have one two three four five
six seven eight nine in terms of 3.5
inch drive base there's the second
hot-swap module there as well you have
the three five and a quarter inch drive
bays up at the top now a lot of people
debate about how many three are sorry
five and a quarters you need it's my
belief that four or five is usually a
good bet you have one for cd-rom one for
a blu-ray drive or something to that
effect you have one for a fan controller
and usually I like the budget one or two
for a fan controller and maybe one extra
so three maybe a little on the slim side
moving into the back you have the two
exhaust fans with these really cool red
fins and it's actually they are red LEDs
as well we have the seven PCI slots and
we're just gonna take a quick look I
know it may be a little hard to see see
if we can get a good light there but
actually in the back there are a whole
bunch of holes we have this for the CPU
backplate and we have openings all along
the motherboard tray for wires to run
and there's actually a fair bit of room
inside of them sitting about probably
about an inch in between the back panel
and the motherboard tray so you'll be
able to run a lot of stuff up there up
at the top here again more holes through
the motherboard tray in order to run
wires again we have the two the two top
120 millimeter fans and I'm just gonna
pull the cables here for the front panel
it's all your usual standard stuff this
though is the USB 3 connection right now
you're not gonna be able to find a USB 3
header on pretty much any motherboard so
this along with other cases that support
USB 3 you'll have to plug it into one of
the i/o things on the back of the
motherboard itself this is probably the
coolest thing on this case we have this
little latch here which when it's in the
open position we're gonna be able to
spin around to the front again to those
intake ports clip these off and there we
have access to the hard drive bays so we
can slide in a new hard drive or if you
want to change up the fan or check this
out
we can pull this little tab up and voila
dust filters take them out clean them
wash them off do what you want and then
slide them right back in well not like
that more like that slam right back in
there you go done so we have a bit of an
interesting case here with the df' 85 it
has things that you know and expect from
an tech they have a relatively minimal
use of plastic just on the front the
rest is a relatively solid construction
of all metal the other great thing is
the airflow there's three fans at the
front you have the four exhaust fans
with the two at the back and the two at
the top now the only thing that's kind
of questionable about this is probably
the look they've sort of gone with the
industrial look the cooler master
pioneered with their half series and
unfortunately I'd say that Coolermaster
probably does it best the other thing is
the price the DF 85 goes for between 175
and a hundred and ninety dollars so it's
in the high end of the chassis market
where it's really got a lot of
competition and that has been a harbor
connects tech bite on the antique dark
fleet DF 85 case we'll see you
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
