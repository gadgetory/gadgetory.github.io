recognized and in just six months we
filled up the four terabyte hard knocks
archive the my cloud mere by Western
Digital has fulfilled its destiny with
the raid 1 array keeping all of our data
safe in two separate hard drives and we
are big boys now so we have to step up
our storage game creativity is fueled by
the best instruments it doesn't always
come easy and in the process you often
realize how important quality is the Rd
400 bio CC gives you quality and speed
with M de tu interface the shivanand
flash and a PCI bracket making it
possible to focus on what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty so producing 4k videos is
incredibly taxing on storage to give you
points reference on average we consume
anywhere from between thirty to a
hundred gigabytes per project per
project and so the my cloud mirror
archive has over two thousand folders
and over twenty-two thousand files in
total most of which is raw footage the
final published videos and all the files
associated with that edit in case we
need to revisit that project later now
recently I realized that it's not a
completely sustainable way to approach
the archiving and what we backup so I
start to sort of slim down on what goes
into the archive so removing any b-roll
that isn't used in the final edit is one
approach and the second thing is I
remove all the on-camera portions for
myself because they usually take up
between 10 to 30 minutes depending on
how many mistakes I make and that's
quite those files are quite large and so
they go out of the window so let me
introduce our new NASA technology ds4 16
play
it's an ass that I've called the Harbour
Canucks saver that has come at the very
right time of need as our previous one
filled up completely it's a four bay
disc station in four home streaming and
actually perfect for creative
professionals in my opinion it's as
compact as it would get for a for bein
as with a functional design like the
tools bay panel that sits on these
rubber dimples for
easy access if only it wasn't so glossy
as it immediately picks up dust and
finger marks looks kind of gross I would
put a skin on it if that was an option
the LEDs on the front show power status
of each disk and status of the volume
itself and if you find them too
in-your-face not only can you adjust the
brightness but you can also schedule
brightness of the leds so just pretty
clever now the thing supports up to 40
terabytes of capacity but we have a
sizable 16 terabytes and on four drives
these are Seagate NAS drives and I like
the hot-swappable nature of the bay with
SSD supported on the bracket as well now
based on our usage history these will be
occupied in about 16 months since I'm
running these four drives in a Synology
hybrid raid so it gives me one disk
redundancy so in our total volume we
have 12 terabytes of redundant storage
meaning if one disk on this volume fails
the volume can repair itself as long as
the failed drive is replaced of course
you can go in and set the manual rate
but I like that Synology goes in and
applies all the automatic settings that
are appropriate for your disk
configuration which is not only helpful
for us to learn what's going on behind
the scenes but also is very new friendly
to start there are three USB 3 ports one
at the front and two at the back plus
dual Gigabit LAN ports and the
proprietary power input with a power
brick included along with two ethernet
cables so you can connect an ass to a
couple of routers or a couple of network
switches and plus it would give you a
failsafe in case one length fails the
USB ports can either be used for
additional USB storage or if you want
wireless access to the masts you just
have to plug in the Wi-Fi adapter or
even a Bluetooth adapter now neither of
the Wi-Fi sticks that I own have worked
but there is a compatibility list for
all the Wi-Fi dongles the fans of the
back are 80 millimeters and are
surprisingly quiet even at full speed
mode that you can change by the way it
doesn't give you a temperature readout
though just a simple visual thermal
status in terms of speed I am saturating
my Gigabit LAN and the speed test and
receiving totally
consistent transfer speeds back and
forth for the archive and so the way I
approach this whole nas is I simply
mapped my network folder which I can
access from my computer and then also
access that archive from the outside the
office so I'll give a burr and Aiden
access to their own folders with a
storage quota so we can share files more
securely and lastly I love the interface
for dsm or DiskStation manager it's much
better than my previous experience with
the my cloud stuff so we have several
widgets on the right that gives you an
overview of your Nass
status plus we have all the needed
controls for drive management network
setup user and group creation and I
really just barely skimmed the surface
of it's full functionality you can
assign automatic folder backups from
your PC you can sync files from many
cloud services like Google Drive and
Dropbox so they'll automatically appear
at your on your nas and all this comes
with an advanced yet simple interface so
you can search for files you can sort by
file type you can preview thumbnails you
can play videos autoplay back on my
original gh4 100 megabits per second 4k
clips was quite choppy but rendered 4k
videos played just fine this would be a
very good media server especially with
the 4k streaming capabilities and also
transcoding for mobile devices and one
really cool feature I found was the
built-in download station so torrents
are downloaded directly onto your nas
but remember legal file-sharing only
please and with that we have a new NASA
archive for the harbor connects videos
I'm hoping it will last for at least a
year since we have nice large volume
with redundancy which I appreciate and
me not being in totally networked good
this is my second time experiencing or
playing around with an ass let me know
if you have any tips that I should
continue on for this backup archive NAT
solution for our videos leave them in
the comments down below I would
appreciate that I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I'm Pete your power
connection we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
