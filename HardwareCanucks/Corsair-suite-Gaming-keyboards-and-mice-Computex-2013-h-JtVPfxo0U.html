booth at the Intel Core sir event i'm
here with jerry the product manager for
all their gaming peripherals so Jared
talk about a little about the Raptor
series how it started the history behind
it and sort of the future progression
with the series compared to the
Vengeance which has been so established
as your sort of main gaming line sure so
the rep for sures is pretty cool because
there's a couple of guys in Germany who
had really built from the ground up and
we actually acquired the company in
August of last year I've done a lot to
kind of build up the line and grow and
we're actually announcing here come
context the first three products that
are developed corsair raptor products
our side and so you you also have mice
and keyboards that are there coming out
this year we already we do we've got it
we've got a series of the products that
we've incorporated from the line that
they were already marketing because
they're very much made for gamers very
much mainstream pieces that would be
good products from that standpoint to
complement our vengeance line that's
really our high high-end stuff and this
gives us something that is a little bit
more directly competing to some of the
razr of a large deck right so you're
digging the raptor line basically
established he has not exactly below
vengeance but sort of competing with the
already established competition that you
have with vengeance we always do we we
more or less that the engineers going
nuts right right that's how you end up
with something like a fully metal
keyboard with your mechanical keyboards
some of the backlighting combinations
things that we do are what could we do
in an ideal and what would we do to try
to make it the very very best well we've
got on the other side is a lot of those
things in a court in a in a more
mainstream wine so we're announcing
actually to repre- one keyboard here the
idea being that really want to give that
kind of quality to two people and be
able to expand the light from that
standpoint right so we've got the two
mice by the two mice we have the young
30 and the m40 in 30 is a optical mouse
the mouse that's a $49 optical mouse
gives you all the performance that you'd
expect a 4000 DPI sense or a great feel
nice rubberized grip so it doesn't slip
out of your hand those kind of things
the m40 builds on that it has more of
kind of our the st. a similar idea to
what you've seen before on our m65 yes
but again in an optical engine that's a
4,000 DPI and removing things like the
sniper button to get to to give you a
lot of those features right it's yeah it
has the same ergonomic design as the m60
it is very comfortable personally but so
you're removing some of the features to
make it a little less to a little more
affordable let's say and to make to make
a kind of experience doing kind of mouse
experience available to more people
exactly they have to meet up that to
fill the gap on the entire market
basically right and this what it does is
essentially gives us a 49 59 69 second
need in the elements the price price
ranges is 10 to all the difference so
regardless opening or exactly what you
mean exactly are your needs and your
budget the ball so regardless of the
mice where are some new keyboards and so
we got a lot of stuff on that on the
keyboard front as well first what we do
have is the
k 50 which is our raft or keyboard and
verse that we're announcing and this is
a RGB backlit keyboard for ninety nine
dollars it's not mechanical but it's a
really really good gaming feel for a
rubba dubba keyboard so great on that
front it is fully fi goes to fully
anti-aliased comes with macro keys so a
lot of those kind of key gaming features
for ninety nine dollars and again 16
million 16.8 million of colors
adjustables where you can make the whole
keyboard any color to match your kick
your gaming rig or the magical so it
does have a metal metal frame but the
only difference between this and the
sort of the high-end line would be the
switches right so this lead two switches
I mean this is this as a metal header
they have completely metal tops on most
of the others but again it's the rubber
dome keys like you said which is the
switches right and we're doing a lot on
the switch front too so when we talk
about our vengeance keyboards we're
actually announcing three new vengeance
keyboards context as well one is
actually our k 65 k 65 is our tenkeyless
play basically it's to say as we go
impact yeah you know I'm not enough real
estate in the desk you can this is
definitely a great addition it
considering this is you know you have
additional features but is also very
large keyboard so you were covering up
that at right there and this what it is
by removing the ten key and we get our
typical kind of footprint on these you
get as much keyboard as you can into the
space it's still full key spacing
exactly the same key spacing is on the
k7 ease of the k 95's so you're not
compromising on that it's not going to
be uncomfortable but it's going easy to
take with you on the go or die's in
small spaces it does come with a
detachable cable it makes it really
really easy to you
pack it up drop it in the bag go to a
land Avenger given this as any wireless
options available in the future not
wireless yet something that we think
about but for now no wireless a nice
okay but the other two that we are
announcing also not wireless but good in
other ways is that we're expanding our
k70 so we announced the K 70s patents
back in March and K 70s are fully
mechanical backlit keyboard yeah what
we're doing is we're actually expanding
that new key switches so we did cherry
reds and you do cherry reds on most of
our stuff because cherry reds are one of
the fastest keys so if you're looking
for high performance gain a cherry red
is a great key for that but we recognize
that people have different opinions and
have different uses for the keyboard so
we're actually gonna be making one in
Cherry MX Browns and all someone in
cherry MX blue right let you go those
are those two they have tactile feedback
so you you know exactly when you're
pressing whereas the the cherry Reds are
slightly have less resistance than the
black and less resistance which when
you're gaming you want that kind of
speed but when you're typing to do you
want the other so this is a great play
because again if you're if you're using
for different things we want to make
sure that they have the option and have
tonight do they vary in price based on
the switches or not all the same so we
have the Silver Edition and the black
edition of the Cherry MX Reds don't have
gunmetal for both the brown slippers
this one is one that that's been been
out there for just a little bit it's
just starting to ship or a starting to
ship a couple of weeks ago and then
start k 95 right so we kind of have a
full line in the end of everything
99 to 1 $49 lots of different mechanical
options right yeah so great options here
from corsair great variety introducing
the raptor line obviously a little bit
more budget-friendly while still having
sort of course air quality to and behind
the look we're very committed to making
sure that it's a quality experience and
then it's you know really giving you a
tool that you can use gaming not just
something right yeah and it's also good
that you would you cover the entire
market you know you have a vengeance
series which is you know sort of a
high-end covering in the lower markets
is also great for for for anybody with
the budget so thanks jared and we'll
keep up with the diversity of stuff with
the corsair booth thanks thanks for
watching we'll see you guys next video
