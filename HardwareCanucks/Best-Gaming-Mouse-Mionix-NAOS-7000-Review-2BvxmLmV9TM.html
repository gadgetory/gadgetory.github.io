great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Haruka knucks and today we're taking a
look at another my onyx mouse if you
have not seen our AV or 7000 review go
check that out but this is the naio 7000
a gaming mouse with an optical sensor
and outstanding economic design priced
competitively at $79 now my onyx got
almost everything right with the nails
7000 starting with a shape that is
ergonomically pleasing with proper thumb
support and additional support frame on
the right for your pinky and ring
fingers this does make the mouse world
wide but your two right fingers are
appropriately spaced out which makes
using the mouse for long gaming sessions
an absolute joy the soft rubber coating
is also pleasing but I do prefer
textured sides for a sturdier grip next
up the switches the two thumb buttons
have a very satisfying tactile response
with smooth roll-off when fully pressed
so it doesn't disturb your grip or
navigation the scroll wheel is
rubberized and lit up for customization
it's a bit on the lighter side and the
scroll steps aren't as defined as I like
but actual middle press is very
responsive and the scroll wheel doesn't
wobble when pressed so that's something
I use quite often during game play also
notice how it doesn't protrude as much
from the frame meaning you can easily
press the middle click without
activating and you scroll steps so huge
thumbs up for my onyx for the subtle but
important design element left and right
clicks are also very responsive and
travel time is just right for quick
presses and finally the two buttons
behind the scroll wheel would be your
dpi change buttons of course they are
programmable and software but at default
there is no dpi change indicator on the
mouse nor on the screen so the only way
to tell you what dpi settings you're
using is really by feel or when
accessing the software the illuminated
logo up top is of course customisable
it's not flashy in any way so I do
appreciate that and it's also nice to
color match all your peripherals now
probably one of the design features that
might turn main
people off is the lack of whey
customization at only 103 grams the Nero
7000 is truly lightweight I'm personally
coming from the m60 that is my daily
driver and there was definitely an
adjustment period to get used to the
light weight of the nails also the
plastic construction gives off the cheap
and this non tough feel so perhaps some
metal frame integration would be ideal
on any future iterations the optical
sensor used here is a DNS 3310 that's
known for its accurate and acceleration
free tracking with maximum 7000 dpi and
setting up my usual sensitivity of 800
dpi
I was actually very impressed with
accuracy and performance for gaming
combine this with excellent ergonomics
and tactile switches and I could see
this becoming a very common peripheral
among gamers now the sensor does not
track on white surfaces nor on glass and
have had the best results using a hard
mouse mat also the Teflon feet at the
bottom do span a large area so smooth
glide was always consistent the USB port
gave me some trouble on my laptop that
disconnected with just a slight pull on
the cable a similar issue that we've
also experienced with the AVR 7000 but
the contact for both mice I was just
fine connected to my tower the software
is a little clunky but nevertheless
provides all the necessary controls for
button mapping and macro recordings
profile selections that are saved on the
mouse itself sensor sensitivity
adjustment with three settings scroll
speed double click speed and
acceleration adjustment one a very
important feature is surface analyzer
when used in conjunction with the
liftoff distance to really fine-tune how
the sensor reacts during liftoff events
color of course can be changed with
different nodes and throughout my gaming
experience I've really come to love the
naio 7000 and what it brings to the
table now this has to be the most
comfortable mouse I've used so far
thanks to excellent ergonomics and
amazing switches that feel just right
tracking with a 3310 optical sensor is
accurate and at $79 you are getting an
over
excellent gaming mouse the biggest
drawback here is the lack of whey
customization I prefer a heavier Mouse
and wouldn't have said no to a few extra
grams with the ability to add a few
extra grams plus the old plastic
construction feels kind of weak compared
to many gaming mice in the market that
incorporate some type of metal or
aluminum for the frame also I hope my
onyx addresses the unstable USB
connection the issue that was both
present on the Neos and AVR 7000 mice
however the name 7000 has really grown
on me for its well-designed form and
we're giving in the harbor Canucks damn
good award and really look forward to
more gaming peripherals from my onyx so
that concludes our review of the native
7000 as always thanks for watching make
