about the airflow or the cooling
potential inside the new PC Oh 11
dynamic from Langley the amount of
interest that we've received on there
our review video which you can check out
over here has been tremendous thank you
for all these suggestions on what type
of fan configuration I should test out
today so that is what I'm doing with
this video so let's continue right after
this hi I'm looking for a case well look
no further I got this beauty the H seven
hundred by NZXT with all steel premium
frame with a side of tempered glass -
beautifully showcase any cooling
adventure you might pursue and cable
management system that you wish you had
earlier all this lit up with integrated
RGB lighting and built-in fan control
the aged 700 I this one's for you I'll
take it and so a quick recap on this
enclosure it's pretty fantastic but is
it you'd see it has no front intake so
it's just glass and glass so the only
airflow sections are the side top and
the bottom so we're gonna populate all
those sections for exhaust and intake
and see which one gives us the best
result now normally I'm not the one to
go with RGB fans because they require
additional wiring and more hubs and etc
and like to keep my things as tidy and
clean as possible but for case like this
where I'm not doing a hard loop I have
to compensate somehow for the extra
bling which is where these ml 120 Pro
RGB fans come in
well that was an unintentional rhyme and
to alleviate the inconvenience of
powering all six fans I have the
commander throw so this thing is pretty
cool we have six PWM fan headers
additional USB ports and LED strips in
here so I can control the lighting and
fans directly from one hub from one
software so I can actually monitor my
fan rpm so that we can have like you
know a fair comparison on this intake
exhaust situation inside the Shalini
case
you see I hope I'm not making a giant
mistake with these fans be RGB I mean is
that too much like normally I would
populate an LED strip so I can give the
hardware some accent but now the fans
are RGB I wonder if it'll be too much I
hope not
all right so for connectivity I'm
actually super happy to say that it's
pretty straightforward so each fan goes
into this lighting controller hub that
has the four pin that communicates with
this different hub and that goes into
your motherboard so you can control the
lighting via the software but that is
exactly where the commander Pro comes in
because we eliminate these two pieces so
now all the fans can be connected via
the PWM connector and on the commander
Pro and then the lighting hub can goes
directly into the commander Pro so only
these little pieces are required to
control both the speed and the lighting
of all my six fans so not bad at all
but now let me populate all these fans
and we'll see what type of temperatures
we get now before we go any further
which of the configurations either for
top exhaust or intake where the bottom
exhaust or intake will deliver the best
results so leave your expectations in
the comments and then come back to it to
see if you are correct I think that
adding some intake at the bottom will
definitely improve the GPU temperatures
and because we're already exhausting so
much with the 360 from the side I want
to know what temperature's we get by
having a little bit of extra exhaust
from top so we eliminate that heat
around the motherboard area so let the
temperature testing begin so I'm trying
to be careful with my testing measuring
room temperature making sure that I
account for any deltas in ambient
temperatures making sure that we account
for what the temperature will be like
without any side panels then adding
those levels of fans and their
orientation to see how things change
I think this was one of the most
requested configurations to check out so
more intake at the bottom so I have
three fans in there giving fresh air for
the GPU and the side radiator so there's
a bit of that and I am running my
benchmark stress test for 25 minutes so
there there's enough time for the liquid
inside the old one to actually heat up
and we can see what the difference is
with that additional intake at the
bottom and while we wait it's the
perfect time for boot sequence snows
fill us in hey what's up Dmitri in the
audience i'm snow's your host for boot
sequence and did you know that AMD was
working on ddr5 memory did you know that
the latest Call of Duty might include a
battle royale mode well if you want the
latest and greatest in tech games and
perhaps fashion I'm just kidding do not
take any fashion advice from me but join
me on boot sequence linked in the
description below so yeah subscribe to
boot sequence all the social media is in
the description now let's get back to
our results I'm also apparently
collecting noise information because of
course temperatures is one thing but
having a super loud system would mean
you know you potentially don't want to
have a 6 or 9 fans in in there so I will
see which fan configuration actually is
like the best balance between acoustics
and temperatures alright so after five
hours of temperature testing here is the
mothership graph starting with an open
case this is your best case scenario for
the CPU temperatures with the side
exhaust where the GPU suffers next in
line is the radiator up top for exhaust
and all the other six fans set up to
intake air so both the GPU and maximum
temperatures are totally under control
the next best CPU scenario is for the
all in one side intake three bottom fans
for intake and three top for exhaust but
you can see the GPU suffers because of
that extra heat delivered from the
radiator next one is surprising with
both sides and top set up for exhaust
CPU temps and maximum time
our higher but the GPU gets that nice
fresh air then the last one with the
radiator side exhaust and only three
bottom intakes would be the hottest
scenario since the top is not really
utilized for that exhaust and if we have
no additional airflow at all so just the
all-in-one cooler for the side exhaust
CPU and GPU are at their worst and
highest temps surprisingly noise
variation between six or nine fans is
not that significant which is why at
random at 1000 rpm because it makes no
sense to run all nine fans at full speed
now of course these are is also very
especially if you are water cooling the
GPU because the GPU spits out a lot of
heat into the enclosure so there are two
trends that emerge through this test so
the first one is having some sort of
intake at the bottom for the GPU is a
must in order to deliver fresh air for
the GPU it definitely helps the second
thing is if your priorities for the CPU
cooling with a radiator then the side
intake is the best if you want to mount
the radiator on the side but it does
negatively impact the GPU so that's one
thing to keep in mind
whereas what I have configured now is
like your best-case scenario with the
radiator up top for exhaust and then
having three fans for intake both on the
side and the bottom delivers the best
fresh air both for the interior and the
GPU and so I think nine fans in the
system is kind of overkill but if you
populate let's say just one fan in the
bottom it will definitely help to
deliver some fresh air for the GPU but
then it wouldn't look that great because
it's just one fan and this whole thing
is very exposed so you also have to
potentially think about the visual
aspect alongside your temperatures but I
feel like having a water block on the
GPU would definitely help temperatures
because then all that heat will not be
circulating on the interior and then you
can have radiator for exhaust the top
radiator on the side for exhaust as well
maybe and then just having a few fans at
the bottom for intake to have like this
optimal cooling scenario all right so
what have I learned from this experience
well temperature testing is extremely
time-consuming especially when we're
dealing with multiple configurations of
fans and I even did stuff with running
the fans at full speed at multiple
configurations just to see how that
would
temperatures but that's not a really
realistic scenario and I'm gonna show
you some numbers right now and they are
better of course because the fans are
going to full blast but then the system
is incredibly loud and would be such
unrealistic and for number two I am so
happy I have to commend the pro because
I initially was thinking just using fan
splitters and connecting the fans to my
motherboard but having to commend the
pro and having that exact rpm control to
eliminate any variables in my testing is
so awesome plus lighting control baby
that looks absolutely gorgeous so let me
know what you think of this entire
experiment and come back to your
original comment to see what your
expectations were like in the beginning
versus what you know now in terms of
temperature testing and the reason why
I'm not doing anything with airflow in
terms of the CPU tower cooler is because
this case really is designed for
radiators and so the airflow version
will come out so we'll be doing more
things with the air coolers on that side
of things but for here it's really
radiator focused alright so that's it
for me make sure to subscribe check out
this other relevant content don't forget
to subscribe to boot sequence the new
channel for all that delicious tech news
and we'll see you in the next video who
alright good people who and see how
temperatures improve for the GPU I don't
know sir so yeah make sure the subscribe
told so make sure to subscribe to do a
channel for all we should be okay we
should be fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
