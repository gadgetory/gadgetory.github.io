CES 2017 we're in this video we're
covering hyper exes new products that
include an updated revolver headset and
some new gaming peripherals so let's get
started
big thanks to Nvidia gigabyte fan techs
and NCIX for our CES coverage you guys
may remember that a while ago we looked
at the HyperX alloy keyboard link in the
description and they're now in the
process of updating the entire alloy
lineup the first add-on is an RGB
edition that has a completely new design
with a milled thin alloy frame and RGB
LEDs that can be configured to almost 16
million different colors unlike some of
hyper X's other keyboards expect this
one to come with a full software suite
for changing the backlight colors and
implementing custom macros also unlike
the smaller allo keyboards this one will
have a full suite of features including
a palm rest dedicated media controls and
several gaming presets there are three
buttons along the top which control the
backlight allow you to switch between
profiles and enable the keyboards game
mode game mode actually turns off the
Windows key so you won't accidentally
press it while gaming pricing for this
keyboard will be about $150 for the
fully equipped version that you see in
this video while a more basic version
with simple red back late and no
dedicated software will retail for about
110 dollars the exact launch date hasn't
been determined yet but expect the alloy
RGB in q3 the standard HyperX a low FPS
keyboard that we took a while back ago
is coming with a makeover with Cherry MX
brown or red switch options which is
pretty awesome another new addition to
the HyperX family is the pulse fire
mouse which is priced at just 50 dollars
and it was designed for gamers who want
a basic no-nonsense Mouse without a ton
of unnecessary features it gives us a
pixar 3310 sensor with four preset dpi
levels 400 800 1600 and 3200 and it's
designed with numerous gripping styles
in mind those dpi levels have a small
visual indicator right behind the scroll
wheel which glows white for 400 dpi rent
for 800 dpi blue for 1600 dpi and yellow
for 3200 dpi the pulse afire reminded me
a lot of the Razer DeathAdder has a
plastic body while defined scroll steps
and strategically placed grip surfaces
promoted a light but very controlled
Mouse that should be great for FPS
gamers its price of $50 makes it super
appealing to
the last product HyperX was showing was
their new cloud revolver s according to
them this is the most advanced HyperX
headset to date since it offers
plug-and-play dolby 7.1 surround sound
through the integration of Dolby's
headphone technology this is all packed
into a new USB download that is supposed
to deliver three-dimensional positional
audio with a push of a button we tried
it and the Adobe send plain one sounded
very good in games with well-defined
directional effects but the 7.1 didn't
translate all that well into music
luckily HyperX is included and all
inline control which can turn off the
surround sound remember that this is a
hardware based Dolby DPS solution that
doesn't use a software layer so for the
time being an equalizer isn't being
included quite yet I should also mention
that the revolver S is compatible with
both PC and ps4 but not the Xbox one
since a Microsoft platform doesn't have
Dolby headphone support past the obvious
addition of a virtual surround sound
stage hyper axis also listen to critique
of their past revolver design and is
improved in a number of areas we
complained about the reverberations from
the original metallic headband support
but now there is a rubberized insert so
that minimizes those issues a noise
cancelation has also been improved with
the included advanced DSP HyperX is
hoping to have the revolver S available
on March 13th for a price of $150 so
that concludes yet another video from
