great technology selection and service
over the last six months solid-state
drives have significantly come down in
price and increased in capacity thus
closing that gap between value per
gigabytes versus the cheaper and more
common spinning hard disks or hard
drives or mechanical hard drives what's
up everyone I'm Dimitri with Huracan axe
and is it time for you to ditch your
loud slow bulky mechanical hard drive
ever since I switched my workstation PC
which is behind me to solid-state only
I've grown only more annoyed and less
patient when a wild hard drive appears
or when you can hear it approaching but
what if I told you that you don't have
to ensure that any more because
value-oriented SSDs are actually quite
affordable now so what if you replace
your one terabyte mechanical drive like
the very common Western Digital black at
99 bucks where the one terabyte SSD
instead so in our case testing the new
ocz tree on 150 SSD at $270 so the value
per gigabyte between these two options
is actually pretty significant at 10
cents per gigabyte on the mechanical
disk and the 28 cents per gigabyte on
the SSD but still 28 cents per gigabyte
for an SSD a one terabyte SSD I think is
pretty awesome especially considering I
remember when they purchased my first
SSD which was a 60 gigabyte model and I
paid over $3.00 per gigabyte now we know
that as these are much faster by nature
versus a mechanical
spinning hard drive but does it actually
make sense for gaming so I decided to
move my entire library my entire gaming
library off a hard drive onto the SSD to
see what type of improvement you can
actually achieve in sort of real-life
scenarios and you've noticed I've
noticed significant improvements in
installation times game loading times
and obviously just regular file
transfers from in to the SSD compared to
Campo Drive and so the first test I did
was copy my game folder which is at 95
gigabytes
it's pretty small right now but you can
see that you save so much time when SSDs
are involved next is game installation
with files already on the disk and steam
just needing to discover and install the
game and here we already see you know
various games with different total sizes
of those games and this is again where
you save so much time especially with
larger games that can take up more than
20 minutes to install on the hard drive
while only a few minutes or a few
seconds on the SSD and finally game
loading times which again shows a low
boost so you don't need to wait as long
before jumping into the game but it's
not as significant and when actually
dealing with installing or copying this
information but what about actual gaming
performance do you gain any extra
average frames per second when dealing
with a hard drive versus an SSD know
there is margin of error here and these
results may be wanted to frame
difference but the majority of
improvements that you can actually see
don't take up in the gaming scenario but
they take up on every single little step
that goes up to the point of displaying
those pixels on your screen so I like
installation copying the files and game
loading and so right now we're in this
very interesting time when hard drive
replacement is not only the most
affordable that has ever been we have so
many options to choose from as well when
it comes to value oriented SSDs but with
all the added speed improvements it
actually makes sense to do it now now
don't get me wrong
hard drives still have place with
archiving the general storage and the
best value per dollar but if you've been
contemplating or migrating that gaming
library off a mechanical Drive onto an
SSD
now's the time of friends now is the
time and so that concludes this video
again it was inspired by my shift
towards solid-state only machine which
is right behind me with my editing
workstation you can check out all three
parts of that link in the description
below if you want to check out the full
review of the OCZ tree on
50 SSD they'll also be linked in
description both 480 gigabytes and 960
gigabyte capacities if you're thinking
of picking one of those two up but that
would be it for this video I'm Dimitri
with her reckon ox takes much watching I
will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
