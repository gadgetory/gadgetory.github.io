economics on the gtx 1080 was all over
the show floor Computex I'm surprised
that the only gtx 1070 was all came from
EVGA despite everybody sort of
advertising in ten 70s now already you
can read our full review of the gtx 1070
down below the founders edition will be
linked in the description but now let's
talk about the gtx 1080s that we saw and
they're sort of respective positioning
within this entire pool huge thanks to
our Computex sponsors for sending us out
here shout out to nvidia fantex and cix
and msi so the first set of cards we got
to see were from EVGA I don't know about
you guys but I love the look of the new
white shroud with these honeycomb pieces
around the fans it is featuring the new
a CX 3.0 cooler which is awesome but I
really dislike the top plate with all
the text they'll be visible when the
card is installed inside your case I
think it's a little bit too much now
EVGA will be releasing six versions of
the GTX 980 in order of price so we have
the standard GTX 980 with EDG ace
reference cooler then the 1080 with the
a6 3.0 shroud then the superclocked card
the FTW edition the hybrid and then they
classified and their price from 609 to
619 to 649 to 679 respectively and not
yet revealed for the pricing for the
hybrid nor the classified and aside from
the cooler difference we have higher
boost clock speeds on the SC to 1847
megahertz and then only a mere 13
megahertz increase on the FTW Edition
but now with a full RGB accents on the
shroud and a higher power envelope with
dual eight pins for power versus a
single eight pins on all the lower cards
the hybrid GPU is basically the FTW
Edition but with a different cooler with
the advantage of being cooler and
quieter at load versus the standard AC X
three panel design
I think the FTW Edition will be the most
popular card when it comes to the RGB
implementation simply because I think it
looks the best on all the 1080 cards
I love the hybrid version as well they
performed well but an all-in-one card is
also often by Corsair so the GPU itself
is provided by Amazon
while coarser installs their age 55
cooler on the GPU bracket branded as the
hydro GFX looks wise it's a more subdued
design which is maybe what you're
looking for and MSI will sell an
identical card under the Seahawk line
with a max boost clock of 1867 under the
OSI mode it is very strange to see only
a single 18 for power here considering
how much you can push the core when it's
underwater
especially with EVGA giving us 2 8 pins
and this might indicate a different
target audience for Corsair and MSI who
will potentially not want to push the
car to its full limits like you would
with a VGA card but perhaps more focused
on silence and cooling and we saw plenty
of cards from MSI as well so their
gaming Z and X that features that Twin
Frozr outlets probably one of the most
popular ones the distinct red and black
color scheme is certainly the staple for
MSI while offering RGB lighting it's a
little bit a weird color combination
especially with the large msi text and
the dragon on the backplate on the
gaming Z card the gaming X will just
have a plain backplate the gaming X
boosts clocks reaches up to 1847
megahertz while the gaming Z is supposed
to provide an even higher overclock
which is right now unknown both cards
required 8 plus 6 pin for power and a
dual slot design but with very high PCB
so now let's talk about Asus Strix
with their directs III cooler it is $679
it's very large its angular it's very
different from all the other brands we
have RGB lighting on the LED strips on
the shroud and the ROG logo on the back
plate which will all link to the or
aligning on their boards for this nice
cohesion but the most impressive part
about the strikes are the boost clocks
which are the highest in this round up
to 1936 megahertz so almost 2 gigahertz
here now having such high boost clock
here's awesome because every board
partner has to go through the Nvidia
greenlight program which means a serious
overclocks the card or any other vendor
they send it back to Nvidia for approval
so that the Nvidia can say yes this is
the correct boost clocks for that card
so to avoid any measly
clock speeds so the Strix will require
six plus eight pin for power there are
two four pin fan headers on the card
itself and you can dedicate it a few
fans to cooling the GPU based on the
core temperatures and it's awesome and
this is the first card from our list to
feature a dual HDMI and dual DisplayPort
for VR since HTC vive and oculus require
an HDMI plus you can also have an HDMI
display without compromising on any of
the connectivity moving on we have the
zotac amp next with two fans on the
shroud I really love how the shroud
beautifully wraps around the back of the
card and the backplate is looking fine
if you decide to go with that yellow
theme and that's going to look awesome
the zotac text on top is RGB the same
goes for the two angular strips between
the fans the boost clock here is 1822
it's a little bit lower than all the
other cards but it will require dual
eight pin for power that might indicate
more Headroom to increase your power
envelope and further overclock but a
higher-end Zota card is the amp extreme
which is a gigantic card with triple
fans it's two and a half slots with dual
a pin for power just as the amp the fans
here are cool because there's a
secondary set of blades in the middle
that keeps more air by the heatsink now
I'm really not a fan of the backplate
design especially with the RGB push the
limit text that's definitely over the
top you know what if I don't want to
push the limit come on unfortunately
still we have no information on price or
the boost clock speeds for the amp
extreme perhaps it's because of the
green light program they're probably
going through the processing still and
the last card on our list is the extreme
gaming by gigabyte so we have this cool
overlapping fan design that shrinks the
card sized length which is awesome but
it extends it so it's a two and a half
slot card because of those thicker fans
there are two HDMI ports out of the back
for VR applications full RGB shroud that
I think is a little over the top with
the size of the text we have dual eight
pin for power and unfortunately not sure
why boost clocks for the extreme gaming
are unknown
yet and so that concludes our GT X 1080
roundup based on all the cars that we
saw Computex there were still a few that
we did not get a chance to see but we
will sure change that hopefully with
full reviews coming up make sure to
subscribe and what was your favorite
card on based on our list here today
leave them in the comments down below
I'll leave all the links to reviews and
everything like that they'll be
publishing later on on the 10 70s and
the 10 80s I'm Dimitri without wreckin
are extinct so much for watching we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
