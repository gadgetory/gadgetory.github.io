for peripherals I think that 2018 will
be the year when wireless technology
will be a must-have feature
nearly every other gaming company has
launched a range of wireless mice and
keyboards with various degrees of
success except one Corsair and they have
been quietly sitting on the sidelines
waiting until the technology who was
mature enough to offer what gamers
wanted lightning quick response times
and longevity
now Wireless has finally progressed to a
point where it may be able to
consistently deliver on those items and
the result is a series of mice and
keyboards that really break new grounds
but before we talk about these new
products I wanna give a huge shout out
to fantex Coursera and colormaster for
sponsoring our CES coverage because
without them this just would have been
not possible the theme of this year's
Coursera CES presents was unplugged and
play and their new peripheral lineup
reflects that the dark Cornell's mmm
1,000 mouse pad and the new k-6 with
your keyboard all incorporated wireless
technology in some way let's start with
the K 63 when we first saw this keyboard
it didn't look like anything more than a
standard but a slightly larger tkl
keyboard with wire free connectivity
however it's the way in which Corsair
went about its design that's different
not only is there a very high quality
feel to the construction but there's
some really interesting stuff that's
installed within the chassis
now the k6eid suite offers connectivity
via a dedicated 2.4 gigahertz wireless
channel which offers an ultra-fast
response time of one millisecond but it
can also be switched over to use a low
latency Bluetooth 4.2 protocol of course
if you want to use a wired connection
that's there as well the cool thing
about the 2.4 gigahertz mode is that it
also offers the option of a ES 128 bit
encryption through software which
doesn't add any perceptible lag but adds
security against hackers who may be
snooping into wireless connections with
key loggers expect battery life of up to
75 hours of continual gaming before he
recharges required when using an a
default 50% backlighting brightness at
$110 this keyboard really isn't cheap
but there's a ton of features beyond its
Wire free operation
there's perky blue backlighting Cherry
MX Reds which is perky macros and
programmable keys that can be controlled
within a Corsairs utility engine
software basically it's the blend of the
best features from Corsairs current
generation of keyboards baked into a
compact decal design that's also
compatible with
a new lap board accessory moving on to
mice and the wireless trend continues
with the dark or RGB mouse this is a
brand new design for Corsair with a claw
grip formed for right hand users if you
don't like the format that the mouse
comes in out of the box there's a swamp
oval side grip and two included
contoured surfaces that can be changed
out to match your grip type and playing
style they're held in place by a pretty
strong magnet so there's no worry of
them slipping off personally I like the
one which gave me a bit more pinky
finger support but that's just my
opinion I also happen to like the
dimpled palm rest even though it looks a
bit uncomfortable the textured surface
actually works to make sure the sweat
doesn't accumulate under your hand
Corsairs of course added RGB to this
mouse but in a pretty subtle way so it
isn't too flashy it is set up in three
different zones around the perimeter but
the really interesting stuff with this
mouse lies on the inside since it uses
the same three more connection options I
talked about before with the keyboard
there's 2.4 gigahertz with a fast one
millisecond polling rate and Bluetooth
4.2 with a low-energy protocol for
wireless modes which can be changed via
a switch on the dark cores bottom of
course there's wire too in case if
you're out of battery or just want to
use the mouse while it's charging the
ones away a bit encryption from the
keyboard isn't available here since
there's no reason to secure a wireless
mouse connection the optical sensor
being used here is the Pixar 3367 which
has been custom made for Corsair it
offers 16,000 dpi and a range of other
features tracking was really good from
the limited testing I did battery life
is also supposed to be excellent with a
claimed of up to 24 hours of continuous
use with the RGB enabled right now it
looks like the dark or RGB will be
available before the end of January and
will cost for about $80 but if you want
to spend more to get a really cool bit
of technology there's also the dark core
RGB se this special edition Mouse costs
in ninety dollars and comes with
integrated Shi wireless charging
technology this means it can be charged
on any compatible qi surface or duck
course it will also be offering this
their own Qi compatible mousepad called
the mm 1000 this is a regular non
reversible hard surface mousepad but the
trick here is that small round Wireless
Qi charging spawn in the upper right
hand corner this is quite different from
the likes of logitech's power-play and
razors new hyper flux system since you
need to move the mouse on to corner to
begin the charging process it can then
be left there during the non-gaming
session so the dark core
we fully charged every time you want to
use it I did find that actually getting
the mouse to charge was a bit of a
challenge since it needs to be placed
very precisely over the charging spot
actually aligning the two charging spots
isn't easy and I think courses should
add a small guide imprinted into that
mousepad since Coursera is using a
wireless charging standard that's widely
available on many smartphones and soon
other devices as well you can simply put
your cheek compatible device onto the
mousepad circular area and it'll start
charging while you game meanwhile if
your device doesn't actually have
wireless charging capabilities or you
just don't want a cell phone hanging out
out of your mousepad Coursera also
includes a small a charging pad with
adapters from USB micro-b type-c and
lightning luckily the MM 1000 is large
enough at 260 by 350 millimeters that a
six inch phone can hang out on the edge
and not interfere with gaming too much
then again if you want to charge a phone
normally or plug in another device a
Corsair provides a USB 3.0 pass through
port well there you guys have it what do
you think of course there's wireless
peripheral announcements at CES 2018
