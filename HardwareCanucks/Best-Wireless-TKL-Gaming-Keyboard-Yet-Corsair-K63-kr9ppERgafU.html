look at a mechanical gaming keyboard
I mean how exciting does that sound it's
it's a gaming keyboard but on a serious
note though this is something I'm sure a
lot of you guys were expecting this year
a wireless mechanical keyboard and today
we're tackling Corsairs first product in
that category so meet the k63 wireless
that's priced around a hundred and ten
dollars now to be clear this isn't the
world's first mechanical keyboard there
are plenty of them out there but the k63
wireless features a few unique
characteristics that might attract
gamers who are looking for something a
little bit different from their
traditional full-sized gaming keyboard
so let's take a closer look at this guy
right after message from our sponsor hi
I'm looking for a case well look no
further I got this beauty the H 700 I
buy NZXT with all steel premium frame
with a side of tempered glass -
beautifully showcase any cooling
adventure you might pursue and cable
management system that you wish you had
earlier all this lit up with integrated
RGB lighting and built-in fan control
the Aged 700 I this one's for you oh
I'll take it okay so the first thing to
discuss here is the wireless convenience
we first started seeing this trend in
gaming headsets and gaming mice and it
was just a matter of time to hit gaming
keyboards the k63 Wireless can be used
in three different modes the first one
will obviously be through wired mode or
you can use the ultra fast one
millisecond 2.4 gigahertz Wireless
saying and Corsair has included a
dedicated receiver that users can plug
into their PC it's very low-profile
although I wish Corsair included a
compartment within the keyboard to store
the receiver because this could be
easily misplaced if you decide to travel
with the keyboard lastly you can also
connect the keyboard to an Android or
iOS device via the built-in low latency
Bluetooth 4.2 protocol you can also
connect the keyboard to a computer via
bluetooth but you can't use coarse hairs
cue software to customize it macros and
lighting and as much as this might sound
ridiculous you can actually pair this up
with an iPad and start using it at a
coffee shop or when traveling it's a
welcoming addition in my opinion but I'd
love to hear your thoughts about
Bluetooth implementation on a gaming
mechanical keyboard I mean do you see
yourself pairing this up with a smart
phone or a
if you're into mobile gaming or you know
if you just want to get work done let me
know switching between 2.4 gigahertz and
Bluetooth is very simple Coursera is
implemented those buttons within the
function keys and they're very quick at
that so that's awesome
speaking of buttons let's quickly go
over the layout of the k63 wireless so
if you recall the original wired k63
from corsair that retails for about $80
this should feel like home the wireless
version sports the exact same 10 keyless
layout
you've got dedicated media playback
buttons on both the top left and right
hand sides along with brightness adjust
in three step intervals including the
option to turn it off a windows lock key
and 4 LED indicators one for power one
for 2.4 gigahertz and Bluetooth and the
colors on that do change depending on
which mode you're in same goes for the
power LED if you're running on low
battery the LED turns to red the last
few LEDs are for caps-lock
and firmware updates so pretty
straightforward there are no dedicated
macro buttons unlike what you'd find on
Corsairs much expensive key 95 series
and that makes sense because this is 80
Cal keyboard in the first place
but the rest the keys can be programmed
through Corsairs q software and we'll
talk about that shortly the build
quality of this keyboard is really good
the chassis is mostly made out of hard
plastic materials and the structural
integrity is top-notch
and no complaints in that department
there are two variants for this model
one comes with the normal dark blue LED
backlighting and another special edition
that comes with ice blue backlighting
yet they cost exactly the same I'm not
really sure where Corsair selling the
exact same keyboard in two different LED
backlighting
but it is what it is and for those of
you who are invested in other RGB
peripherals you might be disappointed
with the case 63 Wireless because it
lacks that feature that being said the
backlighting on this keyboard is very
bright and consistent across keys so
there's no gradient whatsoever and part
of this luminosity has to do with the
blue coating underneath the keys I do
note that it might look odd with the
backlighting
turned off on a personal note I feel
like the LEDs were a little bit too
harsh than normal because I'm more used
to the subtle lighting than it's found
on something like the G Pro with just
the letters lit up instead of the whole
backplate but that's just me so I'd love
to hear your thoughts on that in the
comment
given that Corsairs approaching the
unplug in plain mantra
they've also decided to launch the case
60t wireless gaming lap board to target
users who might want to expand their
gaming experience to their living room
seamlessly without having to invest on
specific peripheral setups and this is a
brilliant execution in my opinion unlike
the lab dog which was a little bit on
the bulkier side and if obviously it was
also a lot more expensive so say for
instance you want to continue your
gaming session from your desktop to your
living room you basically grab the k63
Wireless along with the USB receiver and
your wireless gaming mouse I suppose
I'll hook it up to your HTPC and then
you know carefully slide the front end
of the keyboard into the cradle of the
lab board and use the built-in retention
hooks to secure the keyboard into place
upon completion you can sit back on your
comfy couch and enjoy the rest of the
gameplay
I do appreciate Corsair for including a
cloth type mousepad with the lab board
as that's my personal favorite but yours
mine very the memory foam underneath the
lab board features plenty of cushions so
from a comfort standpoint you're really
not being compromised although I will
warn you if you're planning on gaming on
it for longer hours the heat buildup
might start to irritate you at some
point of course they are selling the lab
board for about sixty dollars but
remember it is an additional investment
on top of the hundred ten dollars that
you'll be spending on the case 63
Wireless so it all comes down to your
use case scenario are you just looking
for a wireless mechanical keyboard or a
hybrid solution that can adapt into any
environment think about that before
pulling the trigger I should also
mention the Corsair is selling a combo
kit so you get the case 63 as well as
the lab board for a hundred and sixty
dollars so that's $10 cheaper then
purchasing them separately coming back
to the case 63 Wireless there are a few
more accessories including the box let
me start with a detachable wrist rest
that simply clicks onto the keyboard the
rubberized textured material provides a
good amount of grip and throughout my
testing period I didn't run into any
discomfort issues Corsair also includes
a one point eight metre micro USB cable
to charge the unit I wished if it was
Type C because it's 2018
you also get a mini USB to type a female
adapter this can be used to extend the
wireless connection but throughout my
tests it wasn't necessary given that
this is a wireless keyboard you may be
wondering about battery life it's
actually pretty good so of course their
claims that you can get up to 15 hours
of use with the included LEDs set to
100% if you tone that down to 50% you
will get an additional 10 hours and if
you want to completely turn off the LEDs
expect at least 3 days worth of use
I left the LEDs at their brightest
setting and upon mixed usage between my
PC and my iPad I was able to get roughly
a day and a half of use and again this
was not me completely using it you know
24 by 7 I was just coming in what from
my regular work day I'm getting work
done doing a little bit of gaming here
and there and that was it unfortunately
coursers cue software doesn't give you a
visual indication on battery status
unless you get into the advanced
settings which once again is if no use
because it only cycles between high and
low mode it honestly doesn't make any
sense because Logitech does a much
better job with their gaming software
and their wireless peripherals for
instance I have my G 403 hooked up to my
main pc and the logitech gaming software
has a separate tab for battery and it
shows the exact percentage on how much
juice you have on the mouse so if I'm
running low I can always plug it in and
it's a good way to estimate how long
your devices can run in Wireless mode
but that's not the case with the KCC T
wireless there is no way to visually see
how much percent you have remaining on
this keyboard but I hope they'll fix
that with a software update hopefully or
maybe the next revision let's talk about
switches on the k63 wireless they're the
standard Cherry MX red types
so nothing custom-made which I respect
after all it is the most popular switch
type out there and it's the only
offering on this keyboard honestly after
using it for about a week or so it was
refreshing to try these out again after
switching between multiple keyboards
over the past few years my daily driver
the Logitech G Pro features the roamer G
switches which took me a while to get
used to since they're very lighter and a
bit faster the MX Reds provides good
balance between actuations and tactile
feedback it only requires 45 grams of
force to register press and actuations
takes place at two millimeters so it's
not the fastest when compared to MX
speed or the Oromo G both actuate at one
point two and 1.5 millimeters
respectively in real-world use you're
not going to notice a huge difference
when typing or even gaming because all
you need is a keyboard that's quick to
respond to creep
and anti-ghosting so you're not getting
screwed over during a gameplay session
while switching weapons thankfully the
one millisecond response time with the
wireless connection was strong and
reliable and it really did feel like
gaming on a wired keyboard which is
great the wireless range was also
excellent you shouldn't have any issues
gaming with this keyboard in your living
room but if you do depending on the size
of the space the included adapter for
extension can come in handy Corsairs cue
software definitely needs a lot of work
I feel like previous generation
software's were a lot better than what's
available right now because it looks
like navigating through it is backwards
then what used to be very intuitive
anyway so the user is greeted with a
physical layout of the keyboard and if
you want to assign macros you can head
over to the actions tab and then assign
macros to any individual key on the
keyboard if you want to adjust lighting
effects you can head over to the
lighting tab and cycle between different
effects so there's static visor rein
pulse
there's also ripple effect and you can
adjust the direction and the speed so
that's convenient
last but not least there is the
performance tab that allows you to
disable certain functions when you press
the windows lock button so in conclusion
the k63 wireless nails a lot of things
that people were looking for any
wireless mechanical keyboard for one
it's ultra fast one millisecond response
time is really good if you're gaming on
it you're really not gonna notice a
difference when you're gaming it with a
wired keyboard it really is pretty fast
the Bluetooth functionality is
definitely an awesome feature I see
myself of taking advantage of this when
I'm taking notes on my iPad if I want it
because you're typing from a mechanical
keyboard it's it's so much better it's
really hard for me to go back to a
traditional low profile membrane
keyboard that's just that's just a way
how it is
I love the tkl form factor this keyboard
is nice and compact it should fit within
any setup and of course it's also a lot
better and a lot convenient to travel
with Corsair might come up with a full
sized keyboard I'm not really sure when
but it is a possibility
the lack of RGB lighting might be a
deal-breaker for some of you out there
because you might have invested in
peripherals or other peripherals that
feature that lighting and but maybe the
blue lighting wouldn't really complement
your setup so that is something to take
in mind if you're considering a wireless
gaming keyboard the battery life is not
the greatest but it is respectable for
my usage you know just using it on my PC
and pairing
with my iPad I was able to get a day and
a half worth of use but that again is
inconvenient to me because I have to
constantly you know charge it every once
in two days and the last thing I want to
talk about is a lap board because I feel
like that is a pretty interesting
addition that complements the KCT
Wireless if you're looking to build
yourself a pretty cool living room
gaming setup and if you're really aiming
for that cord-free gaming experience so
you want to have yourself a gaming
keyboard that's wireless a gaming mouse
that's also wireless and a gaming
headset that's Wireless I feel like
that's again once again it all ties down
to the convenience factor if you want a
complete wireless setup I think Corsairs
offering that with the addition of the
lap board and if you think about it the
premium difference between the k60
Wireless and the wired version is only
$30 so it's not that huge and $410 I
feel like there's a lot of value with
the KCC 3 Wireless especially since it's
a mechanical keyboard it is something
that you really can't find with other
brands at least as I'm making this video
so I'd love to hear your thoughts on the
KCC Wireless supports price point and of
course the features that it offers do
you see yourself switching from your
traditional full-size gaming keyboards
or something like this let me know in
