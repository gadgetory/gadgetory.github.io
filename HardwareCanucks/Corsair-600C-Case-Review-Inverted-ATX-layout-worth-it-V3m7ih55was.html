impress us or the consumer with
something innovative in the enclosure
market this space is already filled
variety and so the price in my opinion
maybe the one key competitive component
for any brand what's up guys I'm Dmitry
with higher conducts welcome to another
video make sure to stay until the end
because we have a very exciting ello
surprise coming your way so on the
review table today is the latest case
from Corsair the carbide 600 sea bring
us inverted motherboard layout which has
its benefits and drawbacks and price at
$150 for both the windowed and the
silent versions it is a compelling full
Tower one that may encourage someone to
experiment with this new layout so let's
see if it's all worth it physical tour
first just by looking at this case from
the sidelines it's actually kind of
difficult to distinguish it as a coarser
chassis unless you notice the small
Corsair logo in the bottom right corner
and you might recognize the plastic side
panels that was also found on the 760
from a physical standpoint I love the
glass quote unquote look of this panel
but for quality junkies out there this
might not pass first you can notice the
plastic color difference at certain
angles around the handle and you can see
it here on video from the slightly
higher angle I personally don't mind
that it's a very flexible panel given
the rest of the frame is absolutely
solid and it actually reduces the weight
of an over the elephant case which makes
removal from its hinges that much easier
and the same goes for reinstallation the
rest of the case is very minimal with a
solid top panel where you find the i/o
with four USB ports chrome audio jacks
illuminated power button and the reset
button plus a three speed fan controller
for three fans which are meant to
complement the three fans included with
a 600 C the front continues in the same
format as the top but with a visible
separated door that opens to reveal dual
five and a quarter inch drive base now
this metallic coating on the panel looks
awesome but any handling will be visible
so casual cleaning is required behind
the panel we find a securely attached
dust filter that covers every single
millimeter of that intake which is
awesome and the filter is dense enough
to catch particles without interfering
with the airflow here we see two 140
member intake fans with
pots for dual 120 millimeters as well
mounted on strips for extra flexibility
and notice the front panel gap is wide
enough for air to enter without any
interference given the inverted ATX
layout the power supply is at the top
followed by 8 PCI slots and 1/3 140
millimeter fan and the 600 C purposely
stands on tall case feet that allows
adequate room for either exhaust or
intake for the cooling installation on
the floor which can house triple 120mm
fans or dual 140 millimeters with their
respective radiator sizes removing the
park panel here's where you'll be
installing your drives and handling all
the cable management so first we have
three SSD caddies that are to list and
choose three and a half inch drive
brackets right above that but that's it
on the one hand I'm pretty disappointed
with the limited storage option so for
this massive enclosure just look at it
side to side - something like the h4 40
the 600 C is way too wide to not offer
any more storage options and there's no
additional drive cage options for the
interior and that can be seen as a
negative now on the flip side of that
coin
perhaps this limitation is a benefit and
maybe encouraging users to acquire
larger capacity drives and sticking with
less drives in total but I still would
have liked to see a drive gate of some
sort on the inside which from this view
is very basic with large rubber grommets
and they're really open layout and BAM
this is the finished system inside the
corsair 600 c which was an easy breezy
to assemble due to nothing being on the
way and power supply being inside its
own chamber at the top you can see just
how much room there is from our 10 1/2
inch card to the front fans so fitting a
radiator on there and push-pull
configuration will not be a problem plus
there's nothing restricting airflow
entrance which makes cool air delivery
that much more effective the top chamber
has this angular piece that extends
beyond the power supply which is
installed with the fan facing down to
intake air from the main chamber for
exhaust and you can see the two Drive
caddies here that are somewhat exposed
for cooling my H 105 cooler went on the
floor with fans set to exhaust which is
a good-looking setup but here's the
thing with everything inverted
you may not like the non inverted
elements of your hardware like the text
on the GPU and some smaller text on the
motherboard the GPU block can be rotated
easily to display correctly but this is
something you'll have to live with with
this type of layout for cable management
it seems like you have a lot of room to
work with but not enough cable tie hoops
around the SSD brackets to cleanly route
all the cables into that one corner
grommet but other than that I'm pretty
happy with how it turned out but there
seems to be more work here than expected
again just because of the enclosure
seems to offer so much room and because
it's so wide but in reality it's not as
easy to work in as expected now I wanted
to do temperature tests to see if there
would be any difference between this
inverted layout versus a more standard
ATX layout so I ran my idle and stress
tests on the CPU and the GPU literally
just flip the case around and looks more
familiar and in line to 95% of the cases
out there to find that the standard ATX
layout is one degree cooler than the
default orientation of the case which is
kind of strange one degree difference is
not significant but then you would have
the window on the right so the computer
can be on your left and so in the end I
don't mind this inverted motherboard
layout at all the case is well equipped
against dust and all types of hardware
and water cooling but I simply don't see
a unique factor here aside from the
massive side panel I wish we had more
drive slots perhaps a thinner frame but
it's actually pretty clear that the case
favors more advanced water cooling
setups I wish we also had more cable
management options I mean only three
cable tie points that's not enough for
what this aims to achieve at the end of
the day the carbide 600 CE is one of the
options if you want the case on your
left so the components are visible but
it's really up to you to decide if you
see this infrared layout as a benefit so
I hope you guys enjoyed this review make
sure it's go Corsair on that like button
