TX motherboard
why don't micro ATX cases and systems
get much love well that changes today
I'm coming for you my friends 1 &amp;amp; 2 get
back in there you sneaky little rubber
piece trying to escape the dust filter
once this this fell out you know I
really don't want to peel this right now
because it is all acrylic on the
exterior so it'll just be covered in
smudges and finger marks in the end but
of course I got a deliverer the peel a
satisfying peel but I am sorry if you're
not into that wow so this is a little
detail but I appreciated the plastic
film on the side panel is in three
sections so you remove them from the
place where you can access the thumb
screws but then the actual main portion
that's the film here so you can remove
it after reinstalling the side panel so
that the entire thing is not covered
with finger marks only these sections
where you're actually going to be
handling the side panel well done so
these cases are very much budget
oriented which is why I have this super
basic z3 70 motherboard from gigabyte I
think this one sells for $100 and
normally micro ATX hardware is a lot
more expensive so I'm finally excited to
see what type of budget oriented micro
tax systems we can acquire moving
forward so the Q 300 L sells for $40
it's nice and affordable while the Q 300
P is the slightly more fancy one because
of those rubber handles on the four
corners and the blackout exterior
acrylic paneling and so if you are in
the budget and potentially have some
size constraints within your space is it
actually worth it considering this whole
micro jigs direction let's discuss right
after this
damnit laundry machine it's always a
pleasure upgrading or adding new
hardware to your system especially when
it comes to storage like this new OC ZTR
200 drive from Toshiba it's a great
value SSD offers a nice boost in
performance
for boot times file transfers and just
general system and work operation with
cutting-edge 3d flash memory and ultra
reliable controller with built-in power
management consider the upgrade today
with TR 200 it's available in different
capacities check it out below all right
so these master box cases have an
identical core frame and they look
different because the Q 300 L is the
bare-bones version with no paneling on
the exterior while the Q 300 P has the
super good-looking character with
handles and this fake TG impersonation
the build quality on both is actually
pretty good and the only way to tell
it's a cheap frame is by looking at the
non-reusable PCI slots I mean come on
Coolermaster what is this now it is
really interesting to see how this dust
filter design on the q 300 L really
elevates the chassis from this plain
boring frame into something that
actually looks good it's cheap it's
functional as both the front and top are
covered with this dust filter which
reveals the perforation that in many
ways is an exciting development for case
customization because precisely because
of it we have this entirely different
version of the case with the acrylic
paneling instead so this perforation
spends all three sides which are equal
so exterior visual options in theory
should be plenty
this also complements fan mounting with
dual 120mm fans that can be installed
along anywhere as the perforation is
spaced out accordingly while the 140
more fans mount have only the one set of
holes that are marked for visual aid
now the two disadvantages of this design
is the see-through nature of the
perforation when the interior is
illuminated completely hiding the
pattern on a dust filter and secondly it
is of course an airflow barrier the
handles on the fancy model are
rubberized and feel great both to the
touch and supporting the weight of the
frame during transport they are
removable and each corner can have this
mind of its own for future accessories
with this mounting method is just a
matter of Coolermaster actually
releasing something cool to complement
this module in nature for example the
only flexible element is the i/o panel
that lets you mount it on any of the
three sides because the frame is square
and so is the side panel and you can
even mount the i/o behind the
motherboard tray if
reason you'd want the acrylic panel
there it's a really cool starting point
on how cases can be innovative because
let's face it it's a really stagnant
market right now we just need to see a
lot more flexibility when it comes to
the frame itself so this flexible eye
you're mounting is pretty cool but you
have to keep in mind the cables they
exist straight from the center right
there so for example in its default
orientation you cannot mount radiator at
the front because the cables will
interfere so you got a maneuver that IO
somewhere else if you want to occupy one
of the walls for a reader also while the
bottom of your mouth is possible I had
issues getting it installed because the
cable exit is kind of a mess and needs
to be low-profile and it interferes with
my power supply the rear fan mount is on
small rails for a little height
adjustment if needed the thumb screws on
the metal side panel for some reason are
covered in this thick rubber which can
actually be used as case feet so if you
want to lay the case flat and I'm sure
you've already been thinking it the
acrylic panel is an absolute nightmare
if you hate particles me and the
styrofoam piece have a good time so if
you can force yourself to admire the
case from a distance you'll need to
accept the static nature of the exterior
the interior is superb lento literally
nothing on here but a few cutouts for
cables we have a three and a half inch
drive caddy behind the motherboard tray
plus two mounting locations for SSDs so
this $40 price point is justifiable plus
there is an exhaust vent at the back
wait a second if this case comes with
two additional front fans aside from the
rear one like on the cheaper version how
does the front get any air I can see the
fans and they're basically just flush
against this panel there's nothing here
the only open the only opening is at the
bottom right here
what have they not learned from the H
500 P I mean great they're RGB fans for
I there's no previewing this but come on
this needs to be a mesh so I've removed
the panel and you guys can see that's
the fan and that is the front panel so
there's literally maybe I don't know
five millimeters of clearance between
the panel and the fan gonna get so much
airflow with this one they have learned
with the
addition of cases so I'm guessing maybe
that's in the pipeline but still quite
disappointing oh and we even have a dust
filter for the bottom but it keeps
flying out I'm not sure how this sits
there and so I decided to build inside
the 300 P because it looks better and
comes with an RGB controller something
you need to light those fans as my
motherboard does not have an RGB header
so you can reroute the recent IO cable
into the controller to cycle between the
colors although strangely none of this
is listed in the instructions manual I
am very sorry about my lack of cable
management job but there are some key
what I pointed here and quite a lot of
space quite deep space here to talk all
new cables and the side panel closes
just fine without me doing anything with
this cable mess boom alright so the
system is built and my experience was ok
you know the frame is fine for kale
management you know I would appreciate
like maybe a power supply shard over
here just to cover up this area you know
for $70 for the more expensive enclosure
rubber grommets would have been
appreciate it but they're not present
here but really my main sort of sour
point would be the micro ATX motherboard
and our choice of it so this one's kind
of terrible because it's not full size
micro ATX it's kind of in-between ITX
and standard micro ATX so the
incompatibility with the rear fan and
the cooler is kind of an issue oh crap
the fan it interferes with a damn cooler
plus the motherboard is shorter so the
cables have to travel longer distance
from the cable cutouts but overall I
mean this is OK but I was expecting a
little bit more for $70 so for the
cheaper frame the $40 Q 300 L which
actually has air flow because of dust
filters the frame is identical so there
is no difference in terms of your
building assembly the only difference
would be the aesthetics so here you know
this is completely blocked I mean it
looks beautiful it looks like glass but
of course it's acrylic and lots of
issues come with that the handles are
cool so you can potentially orientate
the case the way you want whereas with
this you can't really and while I
appreciate Co master strive to do some
risky and innovative like this because
you know we haven't really seen
accessorizing the exterior of a case on
this level before right now this is only
the thing that exists we don't have any
more accessories for exterior paneling
you know there is no mesh version for
the Q 300 P right now so there is
absolutely no airflow coming in here
which I find ridiculous so why would you
want to spend $70 or something that has
no cooling potential you know you might
as well just go for the $40 version that
has proper air flow but of course it
doesn't look as fancy or glamorous as
this guy and aside from this hilarious
front panel that is here for visuals
only it literally has no air flow I
cannot feel anything coming from the
back I was going to commend Coolermaster
for including different fans on their
cases then I thought hey this is great
but these fans they're terrible
absolutely terrible loud first of all it
doesn't matter how much air they push
though because there's nothing coming in
here anyway now I do want to bring out
the size argument for micro ITX systems
smaller motherboard smaller cases
altogether generally but not in this
case for the Q 300 L maybe but not from
the Q 300 P it's about the same height
as this 275 our mid tower from Corsair
that can fit an ATX motherboard a 360
cooler so I'm not sure if ku master is
doing this right in terms of bulking up
the exterior to be almost as big as some
other mid towers that are very common in
this form factor I really do love their
sort of that bare bones basic approach
with the Q 300 L dust filters everywhere
proper airflow and it's only $40 so for
budget build in which a micro ATX system
makes sense the Q 300 L makes sense also
and so my worry here is not Coolermaster
avoiding risk because they've clearly
shown that they're not afraid to do
something different but it schoolmasters
you know persistence and making sure
that there are plenty of accessories
that are actually also affordable
because you're not gonna buy a $40.00
case to only spend forty sixty two more
dollars on paneling and accessories for
it because that doesn't really make
sense and I feel like more people are
asking for this whole micro ATX bubble
to expand and this is clearly happy
right now but maybe there should be
focused on compact cases which makes
sense for micro ITX motherboard and not
something that already almost approaches
the size of a standard mid Tower join
the wireless club with Corsairs new dark
core Mouse play the way you want with
nine programmable buttons aligned in the
comfortable shape and fantastic sensor
you can trust and crazy-good wireless
performance plus qi wireless charging
built-in focus on the game the dark core
will do the rest
I feel like cooler masters really just
poked a little tiny hole in the entire
potential of this direction
you know customizing the exterior panels
because of this sort of perforation that
allows other things to be mounted
anywhere on the chassis which is super
cool as a concept but its implementation
currently is very much in the infancy
stages and so I'll be avoiding my
critiques for now it's just not for me
it seems but I do appreciate their
courage to move in with something like
this and I'm interested to hear what you
guys think about micro tech systems and
hardware and cases in general so let me
know in the comments below how about we
treat thanks much for watching we'll see
you in the next video on cool master may
be a mesh version would be nice and
maybe some better fans too on the power
supply shroud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
