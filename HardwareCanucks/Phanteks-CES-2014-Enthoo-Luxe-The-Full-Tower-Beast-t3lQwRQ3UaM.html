is brought to you by and cix technology
connected alright so before we get into
this enter Lux which is right behind
here I want to mention one more thing
about the n4 Pro is that right now here
you can see is just a plastic plastic
exterior but it will come with a brushed
aluminum looking plastic at the top
something like what we've seen from
fractal design so it giving us that the
elegant feel without actually actually
costing like aluminum because you know a
little in cases cost away
well not way too much but they cost a
lot of money so this is the enter probe
and now we get on to the enter Lux which
is it's the smaller brother to the Intel
primo and it's the way that's the
correct way to pronounce not the end of
prime of a tree until primo so this is
the enter lock so let's take a look at
what this this case feature so on the
exterior it does have a sandblasted
aluminum as you can see it is beautiful
has a slightly slightly shiny and sort
of a sparkly finish which looks awesome
and probably because the light is so
harsh and you can see sort of the
fingerprints but in normal daylight when
it's softer light you don't particularly
see that so it's giving us that aluminum
look but without all that fingerprint
mess so we have three five and a quarter
inch drive base with a slide and cover
like this to reveal some USB ports
headphone jack reset button and one very
unique feature about this case is this
this really awesome LED illumination on
both sides of the case so once you come
around and see the actual LED it's very
soft light what you can do is you can
actually change the color of the LED
kind of with what we saw on the NZXT
phantom 820 but this is a really awesome
addition to the Central Lux because I'm
getting the price point later but this
for this type of feature this type of
LED feature to be incorporated into this
priced case is very excellent so we have
multiple colors and you're also able to
add an additional LED strip and on the
inside they'll have a
or connector as you can see now the
interior is illuminated with blue is
awesome and that's just also switched
with a single button and take off the
front panel to see what type of fan
options we have well first of all the
dual dust filter at the bottom since
we'll have as you'll see 240 millimeters
support for your radiator at the bottom
just like with what we saw on the ends
of primo crap I keep saying primer so
here as you can see a little bit of
cable from your LED so I'm sure they'll
be kind of fixed up on the retail
version but we have a removable dust
filter for your front fans that is just
attached with clips so this one has a
removable dust filter ed there with a
dash with clips so thank God they remove
those screws because that was a little
bit of pain but the dust filter is
removable from the inside not from the
outside like we saw on the enter primo
here you can see it will come with a two
hundred millimeter fan actually right
now they have a one to 120 minor fans
but you can see those options are also
available so if you do want to mount a
240 millimeter out at the front that's a
possibility there is a built in dust
filter in there as well that is
removable simply by touching the the
this clip system there we go there's our
dust filter very convenient for removing
removing at one fans doesn't work right
now but it will so have support for a
480 Milner radiator so that's you know
in such a sort of let's say I mean it is
a full tower but 480 support is sort of
limited and it's not available in most
full towers so it's awesome to see that
fan takes is really really targeting
that water cooling community and they're
making it really easy for us to water
pool and providing full dust proof
support so let me close this back so
okay now let's come in onto the inside
this case will come with the power
supply bracket like we saw on the enter
Pro right now it's just not available
because of the radiator it's a little
bit on the way but for example if you're
not water cooling it will definitely
cover all the power supply cables it
will prevent that fan from doing
anything if it will be covered alright
so coming out to the side panel this is
sort of the same design
actually it probably is the same design
as what we saw on the anthro primo same
triangular design revealing the fantex
logo and a very large non tinted panel
to reveal your interior which is really
good to see
I do like side panels and I hope you do
too
on the internals is an ATX support a
lots of room at the top as you can see
the fan at the back the fan is
adjustable based on the height of you of
your radiator so that giving it a given
user slip with flexibility of how much
height you need based on the height of
your radiator so that's awesome here
this is the you can potentially mount a
reservoir very thin reservoir tube
reservoir in there if you want and
that's it so we have a fan mount at the
bottom that will support 240 radiator
and will support 120 and 140 number of
fans there alright so guys they have a
full system assembled in there so you
can really see how easy it is to deal
with a bunch of cable management here
they do include the same velcro straps
for all your cable management so you can
expand them depending on how many cables
you have in there coming up to this hub
here this is exactly what we saw on the
enter primo but what's cool about this
this fan hub is there as you can see
there's six connectors five of them are
expandable to two additional fans so you
can have up to 10 fans on those hubs and
one of them is not expandable so up to
11 fans on the from this initiative from
this simple one hub is awesome to see
exactly filling up this case with fans
and you will have no issues controlling
them since from this single hub we have
an SSD bracket like we saw in the
original awesome to see utilizing the
space behind the motherboard the back
here for your cable management is
slightly wider allowing you to store the
majority and the thickness of the cables
from the power supply and you can see
they did a really nice job cleaning this
whole thing up and there we go this this
thumbs it up one more thing to mention
about the Anto locks is that while
coming on to the price right so price is
very important for a lot of sort of hope
I think I just turned it off
there you go price is very important for
a lot of gamers a lot of builders and so
this end
lux will come around we'll come retailed
at 139 dollars
and from somebody who reviews a lot of
cases and we do review a lot of sub $200
cases this is a very impressive case
from fantex feature-packed
lots of compatibility water cooling
extremely simple to work in and include
a power supply bracket that you don't
see here and as you can see it cleans up
well full dust proof I mean the list
goes on and I'm very happy to sign
things and finally in the market with
different cases that are about to hit
the streets in I believe this would be
in March so there you go you'll be able
to get your hands on this enter Lux for
$139 to begin your water cooling
adventure so guys thanks for watching
our fan takes coverage here at CES 2014
don't forget to subscribe and like this
video if you potentially could want to
see some more cases from pantings
sometime in the future because I sure
want to see more cases from fantex so
thanks guys for watching and we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
