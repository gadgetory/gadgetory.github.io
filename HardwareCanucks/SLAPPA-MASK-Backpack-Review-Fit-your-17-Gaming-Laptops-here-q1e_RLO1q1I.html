great technology selection and service
hey guys
eva here with harmonics and if you're a
photographer videographer or a mobile
gamer who care about your equipment you
know the importance of a good camera
back to protect your expensive gear
during travel and also act as a
functional tool in the field i think a
camera / laptop bag is just as important
as the rest of your gear when you move
around today we're taking look at a
slopper mas que custom-built DSLR
backpack that's priced at $140 it's
custom built because you select the face
of the bag thus the mask in the name the
patented customization may seem minor
but each face has different
functionality and can come a long way to
personalize the bag how it looks and how
it's used in the field the mask is the
only thing that can be temporarily
changed all you need to do is unzip that
part all the way around it to easily
detach it and reattach the new face if
you have multiple options further the
internal lining color can be selected
from blue black or red and an insert
with a custom graphic in the main
compartment can be selected as well as
for a personalized to feel inside the
bag - although no option to upload your
own logos or graphics as far as build
quality I was pretty impressed at first
sight the zippers are made out of high
quality metal and can take some serious
abuse the outer layer of the bag is
covered with a high-quality ballistic
shell that is water-resistant slappa
also markets this as a puncture proof
bag generally the exterior feels tough
that should not rip if caught on a sharp
angle and throughout my entire time with
the bag I have not discovered any rips
the dimensions of the bag are 13 inches
wide by 18 inches in height and 11
inches in depth this means you can fit
laptops up to 17 inches in size with
large enough lip to cover the laptop and
plenty of additional pockets for laptop
accessories such as hard drives a mouse
maybe and you
the medium-sized pockets at the bottom
can be used for tablet and it's a
perfect size to fit a large power brick
for your machine the padding and the
very bottom is plenty deep feels like
any impact from a drop would be observed
without damaging your laptop
although the bottom plate is soft aside
from the single hard plastic strip
Horning across I would feel more
confident with a reinforced harder
bottom plate taking a look inside slappa
has appropriately organized the camera
bag with proper layouts and you can
orient them in any ways to your
preference I was able to fit my macro
lens along with my few monitor and a
bunch of other accessories more
importantly all of the cushions and
separators are well padded but are slim
enough for space efficiency while
providing enough protection for all your
gear I particularly love the fast access
feature to access my camera outdoors
without needing to open the main zipper
which was useful and time efficient the
side pockets are tight enough when not
in use but appropriately stretched to
fit a water bottle or anything else your
creative mind can think of stacking
there it seems every spot in the sloppy
bag has been equipped with a pocket so
the internals are pretty much top-notch
as far as comfort goes the straps are
size adjustable and feels extremely
tough tough in a sense the cushion
portion seems to be too thin if you
really load the entire bag you can feel
the rough edges of the relatively thin
straps cut into your skin I would have
preferred extra padding on the inside
and perhaps a wider straps to spread the
pressure the rear cushion for your back
support has this interesting shape it's
to minimize the total area of your back
with your backpack that would in turn
make you sweat less
however this portion would totally
protrude out words once you overload the
bag and feel totally uncomfortable with
minimal loading this issue was not a
problem but a more reinforced back plate
is needed furthermore the top handle is
fairly large this is great to pick up
the bag with large and pick venture
gloves but I felt skeptical of this hang
mechanism that over time could rip due
to so much play so the slop amassed DSLR
bag is the most customizable bag you can
get that fits 17 inch laptops the
personalization options with color and
interior
lining does not add much value but the
mask face is awesome to suit your needs
the quick access pocket is brilliant and
compartment separation is just right for
any gear when you travel it's tough
enough to rough use although extra heart
padding at the bottom would be nice
along with more comfortable straps to
compliment a fully loaded bag the price
is a bit steep but considering the gear
you'll carry inside and the overall
quality of the frame you get what you
pay for thank you so much for watching
