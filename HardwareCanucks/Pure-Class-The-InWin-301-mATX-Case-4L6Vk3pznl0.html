three one is often but is it Fred worthy
let's find out
you can only rely on the pros to do the
job with every keystroke satisfying like
the millions before it
quality filled every key regardless of
your speed to the master master keys bro
take it with you make it good alright
the three one is exciting for many
reasons aside from being an extra
excellent addition to a very limited
category of micro-atx this one's got
four PCI slots and it's about time we
filled the middle gap so let's see how
the $69 301 stacks up as a contender for
the best micro ATX enclosure let's start
with the design first its boxy it's
modern it's got metal and glass very
limited plastic and the only plastic we
find are on case feet but the bottom
dust filter basically sits on top of the
case feed so perhaps that was the
cheaper version for tooling then going
full metal the dust filter is kind of
course which most likely is to minimize
air flow restriction because there's
very little room underneath it the
overall design formula follows in the
footsteps of the N one three or three
ATX tower and there is a bit of
resemblance to the s340 elite so if
that's your flavor of a case companion
then England have done a good job the
tempered glass panel is to us with an
excellent mechanism that has a bit of
stiffness to it which I think is by
design and it's just so much easier to
remount and now the thumb screw method
seems so 2016 ill the handle protrudes a
little bit but without taking away from
the character and the glass is tinted
and it doesn't seem to have any color
caps which I prefer over a warmer or
colder glass and there's also this
dotted shading on the perimeter that
helps to conceal the frame underneath I
really like this touch and we haven't
seen this design on the glass yet I have
the black and red model wife in blue is
also available so you see the front i/o
is illuminated with dual USB 3 power
reset and audio jacks along with that in
win text in vertical orientation so it
doesn't really look like a logo instead
you can view it as just basic squiggly
lines and since both the front and top
are completely covered in metal the main
Air Flow Intake is on the side which is
a bit odd but I love this ventilation
honeycomb design you could light it up
from the inside for this really cool
illumination pattern the side panel is
held in with two captive thumb screws
and while the design of this ventilation
is cool
the spacing here is very limited plus
there is no dust filter and you guys
how feel about that on top of that
decide airflow entrance is very much
blocked on the inside as well you can
see this area shares the space with
cables it's an odd airflow design and
with dual 120mm fans at the front
perhaps the three one is suited for a
radiator with good static pressure fans
and so this case has no fans included
and you can look at it from two
perspectives one is because it's in this
budget category it's a shame because at
least one exhaust fan in the back here
would have been great but - I feel like
this case is really targeted towards
people that might do custom water
cooling and you know this micro-atx
direction is picking up pace or you are
going to populate your own quality fans
and here anyway and so no fans included
both negative and the positive and so
the main chamber it seems to have all
the primary elements like a large CPU
backplate an open frame with a plastic
cable cover beside the motherboard the
power supply chamber is at the top that
is fully closed off aside from having
the fan openings and the small cutouts
for the cables so the power supply is an
active component for interior cooling
the bottom supports dual 120mm fans but
unfortunately no cutouts are available
right underneath the motherboard which
is the consequence of having the power
supply chamber at the top while wanting
to minimize the height and it's just
interesting to see how different the 301
feels from today's expected frame layout
now I normally don't mention accessories
but it is important to mention how they
are included so here they're well
organized and they're separating the
nice baggies but they're not reusable so
one can open one bag that's it how do
you store the rest of the little screws
and stuff and this is something as
fantex have been doing for like three
years now ever since their first case
the enter primo these little pouches
with separate compartments so you can
sort your screws and everything and I
use these and these are life savers when
you want to just find the exact screw
and this is so useful down the road when
you do multiple builds something
companies should definitely start
including for storage there's a drive
cage in front the power supply it is
removable and accommodates a single
three and a half inch drive or an SSD
plus two more SSDs at the bottom and
only the ITX motherboard standards are
pre-installed but a tool is included to
fill
rest now when it comes to the power
supply mount here are a very large 1200
watt overkill power supply from be quiet
technically this frame would allow it to
sit there in lengthwise it will not
interfere with the drive gauge but
because of this mounting point where the
thumb screw for the side panel fit you
cannot simply insert the power supply
this way you have to angle it in order
to mount in size so I'm not sure that
the limitation or not to sort of limit
of very large power supply compatibility
but only a hundred sixty millimeter
power supplies are supported all right
so as I start to do cable management one
very disappointing thing came about and
that is the entrance from the top
chamber of the cables into the main
chamber so we have this plastic cover
kind of similar to what we saw on the
NZXT s340 but here the entrance from the
back into here is very small so you have
to pass all your cables through here
because that is the only opening from
the top channel unless you want to of
course route it from from here where
it's you know it's kind of open and the
cables are not really hidden but look at
this this is the sada area there's
nothing there to accommodate your SATA
cable pass-through
ah that's how you do it maybe they
should have included that in the manual
alright so by design you can remove any
of these five pieces and this is plastic
so that it helps to channel the airflow
into your you know the where the fans
are supposed to be but I didn't realize
that you're supposed to actually break
you know these little pieces so that you
can pass your cable through like the
SATA cable into the motherboard area
it would be nice to include this
information so that users are aware and
taking all that into account here's the
full build it's a little bit messy
because the main opening is not that
large and many of these cables have to
cross the motherboard to their final
destination particularly for the USB and
the i/o cables so keep that in mind if
you're installing the fans at the bottom
- I installed the radiator and then the
fans as the tubing at the top with
otherwise interfere with that area so
your radiator fans has to be configured
in pool setup it would have been very
good to see the power supply shroud to
be a little bit more open for cable
routing or these larger cable cutouts as
this was not an easy space to work in
coming around to the back it's actually
quite simple to just clump your cables
in this area and use some of these small
cutouts on the motherboard tray for
cable side points and you have to
remember though that this is your main
intake area so to keep it as clean as
possible is the goal for best airflow
and because the power supply is at the
top be prepared to deal with the thick
cable coming from there so just maybe
come up with some solution to hide it
for a cleaner look and finally I wanted
to see how effective that side
ventilation is and so let's begin with
the benchmarks GPU stressing we're using
the furry donut is 64 for the CPU here
are our temperatures so we were hovering
around 70 degrees Celsius on the CPU at
load 82 degrees Celsius on the GPU I
have the 4690k overclocked to 4.5
gigahertz and the GPU is the r9 380 X
now the thing is the fans here are
maxing out so that's full speed because
temperatures like really went up high so
this is your best-case scenario now I
want to put the fans into their more
normal profile like the silent curve and
like my custom profile curve so that
there's they still do a very good job
but they're not super loud because right
now the machine is not exactly silent AC
moments later here are the temperature
so the CPU hovering around 75 to 76 the
GPU drop degree I'm not sure why that is
maybe it's because of the circulation of
air is better when there is less air
flow coming from the front you know it's
not as turbulent or something but the
system is much quieter so that's good
but still what do you guys think of
these 10
it's a little hot I would say five to
ten degrees maybe more even you know the
Delta between such a restrictive intake
and well what can I say I love the look
the materials on the build the price
point at 69 bucks is just where it
should be to remain relevant and not
overstep any toes and perhaps
incentivize the switch to a micro ATX
build but it's not really optimized for
air flow that is its biggest weakness
that will run your components warmer
than usual and you just have to accept
that but I love this unconventional
approach to frame design and we are
giving it a higher canucks
damn good award now because the techs
but on how you feel when the system is
ready and the only question remains is
it fredward
so thanks for watching we treated her
our kinetics what do you think of the
three one let me know in the comment
