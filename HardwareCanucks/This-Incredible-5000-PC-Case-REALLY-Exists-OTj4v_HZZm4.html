it's always a pleasure to see what they
can come up with every single show
contradicts our CES they showcase
something totally extraordinary and like
that you would probably never think it
would exist so this my friends behind me
is the Z tower it is incredible it's
just pure case form arts you know
showcase piece but before we get to that
huge thanks to our sponsors thermaltake
fantex and to Landmaster for making this
trip possible so the Z tower is just
pure aluminum structure and it just
comes assembled in the crates otherwise
you will never be able to get it but
they have little piece of standalone
pieces so we can actually lift them up
and show you how heavy they are so come
come with me I'll show you alright so
this is one of the pieces so with two
hands you know you feel like Thor you
like just come out of like Avengers
movie like this is this is heavy this is
workout material okay this is the epic
piece we got in win Coffee thanks 2018
these pieces you know this will go
through customs and you'll definitely
get a lot of looks and questions to do
something like this but there's
definitely a showcase piece like no
other alright so this thing weighs 90
pounds or 40 kilograms that's a little
bit insane so you don't have to worry
about anyone stealing your case and if
they do they deserve it
so pricing wise check this out I mean
it's it's pretty reasonable around 5k
you're looking at 5k without shipping
and
let us know this is something that you
want to see on the channel
all right so aside from the crazy Z
tower the other showcase piece was the
inland 307 it is based on the 303 frame
so it's a nice compact mid tower but
here with the three or seven we get a
full front panel made out of a hundred
and forty four RGB LED squares of course
it's quite unique because these squares
can be customized with any color or
simply turned off to create the unique
pattern and so we have this soft glow
rather than over the harsh at least
shining through because of this kind of
like frosted / diffused front panel and
light output can also be controlled so
you can make it really bright or really
low depending on your preference we do
have 12 lighting modes controlled with a
silent button on the case so you can
kind of customize based on that and
there's a USB 3.1 gen2 type-c port and
also a microphone up top which can be
used by the RGB software to sing to the
leds with ambient sound of music and in
winds also developing glow software for
this particular sort of like array of
LEDs to further customize the lighting
so it's supposed to be really
user-friendly and intuitive interface it
can cycle through the 12 lighting modes
by itself and you can also design your
own patterns for each mode and so every
LEDs color output and reaction can be
controlled from the software but as we
all know software is very hard to get
right now for the customization you can
create four patterns that will cycle
right through which is kind of cool you
can create little messages or
potentially recreate your favorite you
know 2d game and overall this is a
really unique idea the three or seven
may not be affordable at like under
three hundred dollars considering the
original frame is only $89 but it's
really cool to see we're moving into
this direction where you can customize
the RGB illumination of a hundred and
forty-four LEDs on the front the case
and still kind of have a fully
functioning interior now for the third
case that got our interest we have the
in win 915 case so this one is a bit on
a premium site at $499 but it is made
entirely of aluminum we have this curved
aluminum structure for the front that
opens up to reveal our fans now the
intake here is kind of compromised
because there is no you know ventilation
for the front
it does intake air from the bottom at
the front which is covered by a dust
filter I do like their approach to this
mechanical top that raises when you push
a button and it allows for the top
ventilation to exhaust air and you can
simply press the button for that
ventilation to close so obviously this
is a showpiece both side panels are
tempered glass the front and the back
are aluminum and they have the same
curvature the back one has the
additional ventilation / looking things
that allow you to kind of like see all
the cables and potentially pass cables
through it and on the interior it looks
like a standard ATX layout you can
expand it to EA TX we have a power
supply shroud plenty of like you know
water cooling mounting brackets and
stuff on the interior so you can build
your ultimate showcase PC we do have a
type C Gen 2 port up top along with the
curved addressable RGB LED strip that
you can cycle between colors or of
course connect to your motherboard and
lastly it's all about addressable RGB so
we have this new ego fans from in win
because the RGB trend continues so this
time the focus is on lighting up this
silicon fan frame which is kind of this
transparent you know structure rather
than the blades themselves but we do
have 16 addressable RGB LEDs per frame
now the point here is to have the soft
glow rather than harsh LEDs shining
right through which is why we have this
sort of silicon frame and the eco system
has this dual channel Aurora plus
control box to switch through lighting
effects if desired
it comes with an IR blaster and the
remote control so you can change all
that looks from the distance and I'm not
really sure how many will use that if
they're mounted inside your case now
they are using their own aurora plus
software which is you know it's a unique
software but of course it might
introduce its own set of challenges when
it potentially might not work the
coolest thing about the fans aside from
the looks would be how you can daisy
chain up to 120 fans this is what
they've done for the show booth here so
120 fans were controlled through a
single hub of course additional power is
required but it's kind of cool how he
can daisy chain that many fans and still
have full control of each one that one
potential issue
the performance would be this large
square hub at the back that could
potentially impede air flow and there is
no indication and whether or not that
will work with motherboards RGB
connections and so that is it from
inland incredibly unique Z tower
enclosure a very cool unique front panel
for the in one 307 case and the premium
/ niche specific Inman 915 and I would
say even really cool ego fans that I'm
excited to play around with just to see
what type of color effects you can
create in your system thanks so much for
watching make sure to check out this
other Ellen content and we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
