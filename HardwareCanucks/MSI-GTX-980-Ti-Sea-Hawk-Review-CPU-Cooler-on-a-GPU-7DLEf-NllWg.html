great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Haruka
Knox and we have a very exciting GPU
review today for you not because we
haven't seen an all-in-one cooler
integrated for cooling on the graphics
cards before but this one is exciting
because of a collaboration between MSI
and Corsair to release this edition of
the gtx 980ti seahawk the price premium
on this one is $100 over the reference
bring it to a whopping $750 u.s. and
over $1000 for us in Canada
ouch so this collaboration between
coarser and MSI brings us a beautiful
looking card with a hybrid cooler so we
still have the blower style fan to cool
the VRMs and other PCB components while
the GPU is cooled via the coarser age 55
solution the logo of which can be found
through the transparent window the 120mm
radiator is standard 25 millimeter
thickness and and illuminated fan with a
light blue LED for the cooling power the
tubing here is threaded to match
coursers other
all-in-one CPU coolers it's plenty
flexible but lengthwise at same mounting
location is pretty much only limited to
rear exhaust or the top now I love the
aluminum back plate with overclock
series embedded in the center right
behind the GPU core but the only
questionable design choice here is the
color combination
well it's yellow the MSI logo on top of
the card is illuminated and thus for
those with particular color needs you
might need to mod the color yourself or
it can be actually turned off through
invidious GeForce experience now we
actually use this card in our main
editing workstation machine video that
you can check out in the description but
here is what it looks like in its
natural habitat surrounded by other
Hardware being a 980ti the power
requirement is not any different with 8
plus 6 pins but power consumption is
slightly higher than the rest of the 980
T is and that's in part because cooling
is so efficient that the card runs just
under
fourteen hundred megahertz on the core
which is a fantastic result but not too
far off the air code competition the IO
remains unchanged from the reference
with triple DisplayPort HDMI 2.0 and DVI
now unlike other integrated working
solutions the seahawk card requires you
to plug the fan header into your
motherboard and thus it is controlled by
the user and is not dynamically
controlled by the GPU itself the blower
style fan on the other hand is
controlled by the GPU nothing surprising
here it can be manually adjusted via GPU
driver software like MSI Afterburner so
be aware that different fan profiles on
your motherboard header will affect both
the acoustics and cooling performance
for that main radiator fan and here we
set it to low standard and turbofan
profiles through the motherboard that
give you slight variation in
temperatures and we recommend the just
standard profile as that provides the
best balance of acoustics and
performance there's about five degree
deltas between all three fan profiles
but still outstanding cooling result
regardless so now onto the battery box
so now that you've seen all the results
the Seahawk cart has plenty of expected
overclocking Headroom that is still
limited by invidious voltage locks but
the end result is a satisfactory 1520
megahertz on the core and 8,000 74
megahertz on the memory with a fan
header set to standard and running at
the solid 50 degree Celsius
delivering just a few extra frames on
average so it makes us happy and in
conclusion the 980ti Seahawk is exactly
what we expected it to be delivering
outstanding clock speeds good
temperatures and fairly low noise levels
provided you set an appropriate fan
profile if only both fans were
controlled by the GPU for less to do
work for the user out of the box now
that would have been fantastic
this corsair and msi collaboration makes
for a strong statement though between
the brands and likely won't be the last
and we're giving it harbor Canucks damge
reward so guys thank you so much for
watching make sure to subscribe for more

hardware conducts thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
