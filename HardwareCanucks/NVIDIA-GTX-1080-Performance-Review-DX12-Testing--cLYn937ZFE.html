Canucks welcome to another video the
wait is over for the GTA X 1080 here's
our full review I promise you you won't
be disappointed and if you want to check
out our unboxing video it will be linked
in description below along with our GT X
1080 explain to give you some reference
and context as to what this card is all
about plus our full written review is
linked in the description below ton more
information there make sure to check it
out
the z9 neo buys all the right features
on a budget with a large window side
panel 5 included fans and the excellent
interior layout with super simple cable
management get it now link in the
description below so let's begin with
specifications on paper the new card is
seeing a decrease in CUDA cores texture
units and arrow keys compared to a 980ti
but have no fear the Pascal architecture
with TSM C's 16 F infant process and
much improved 8 gigabytes of gddr5 X
memory all play in harmony to deliver a
freakishly fast card with the TDP of 180
watts so almost doubling the performance
of a GTX 980 while only increasing power
consumption by 10% the clock speeds here
are quite high and NVIDIA hints that
most GTX 1080s will pass the two
gigahertz mark when overclocked giving
us an efficient GP 104 core and we think
it will only be a matter of time until
we see Pascal architecture GPU oh no
force or some derivative of that in the
notebook space considering the GTX 980 s
implementation for gaming notebooks the
only thing that's still unknown to us is
full specifications of the gtx 1070
everybody's super excited about that it
will most likely be like a cut-down
version of the GTX 980 but it will still
somewhat compete with the tight necks or
the higher-end maxwell cards so next is
pricing which has been a topic of
confusion since we have MSRP of $5.99
and then we have the founders Edition at
$6.99 which Nvidia is treating as the
premium card since
features an exclusive power distribution
system improving efficiency between the
power supply and the core now many are
wondering how and when we'll be able to
buy the 599 dollar cheaper GTX 1080 and
come launched May 27th the truth is you
may not have a choice as custom board
partners rollout for their you know
custom coolers perhaps extra for clock
ability somewhere built into the card
that may be a higher price premium than
the 6 $99 price point so it would be
interesting to see what type of
compromises are we to expect for the
cheaper GTX 1080 at $5.99 and until we
see a 599 dollar GTX 980 we will treat
this card as a 6 $99 card because that's
exactly what it is but moving on from
the price point the redesign in most
eyes is seen as a positive move as the
reference shroud hasn't seen anything
new since 700 series I personally love
the angular variation of the shroud it's
still a fairly short card at 10 1/2
inches in length so case compatibility
is standard even for small form-factor
pcs we have a back plate with the this
linear engravings which looks awesome
and a pretty discreet model number
sticker would just so appreciate it
because it isn't slapped in the middle
of the back plate to ruin the aesthetic
it's almost hidden but in the age of RGB
lighting why isn't the illuminated text
RGB this would have been a pretty sweet
touch from Nvidia now it only requires a
single 18 for power which is one of the
many wow factors that we saw during
launch and perhaps we'll see this
expanded with custom board partners for
you know marketing that extra overclock
the i/o consists of three DisplayPort
1.4 HDMI 2.0 B and dual link DVI with 4k
HDR support it we still have two sli
fingers and users will be able to run
two-way SLI configuration with Pascal
cards as adding more cards will not
result in scaling improvements and
actually in the video is shifting focus
away from 3 &amp;amp; 4 Way SLI on these Pascal
cards and more on the SLI
conversation what nvidia is doing with
pascal a deeper dive into the Pascal
architecture with its a synchronous
compute dx12 and many other features
make sure to check out our article down
description below so much information
there awesome stuff but now let's get to
the benchmarks so first-come 2560 by
1440 gaming results and our speculations
initially we're totally on point with
this giant leap in performance compared
to the high end maxwell cards the
minimum frame rate on the GTX 980 is
higher than the average on the 980 with
performance increase not just by a few
percentage points but up to 30-plus
frames in Star Wars Battlefront and the
minimum increase of 11 frames in far cry
4 verses and 980ti stepping into 4k now
and the trend continues with the 1080
performing consistently across the board
with fantastic minimum frame rate at
this resolution that a gigabytes of vram
surely is helping and notice where the
few reacts sits in comparison so there's
just no chance it can compete aside from
hitman with similar results
getting into DX twelve testing while you
can see that red bar is not moving
anywhere from the top slot even at 4k
resolutions the GTX 1080 is the most
powerful single GPU graphics processor
ever created and check out this power
consumption it's well below the 980ti
and with such efficiency we think that
two-way SLI will be an extremely popular
configuration for you know those diehard
enthusiasts acoustics are next and the
card is quiet like previous designs
without coil whine so that's awesome
and that load temperatures reach 82
degrees Celsius which seems to be the
ceiling and the card does in fact
throttle when hitting those low
temperatures frequency staying below
1800 megahertz which could be the cause
of the fan not kicking in until it's a
little bit too late so we can fully
expect consistent frequencies with water
cooling or just custom coolers and also
just custom
fan curves with precision software which
brings us to overclocking and remember
that two gigahertz mark that we
mentioned earlier
well we achieved that our founders
edition card hit 2120 six megahertz
overclock on the core where the decent
memory overclocked is well fan speed was
just set at 55% and we were below sixty
degrees Celsius now are you ready to see
the result because we were mind blown to
see the performance increase I mean look
at that minimum in the rise of the Tomb
Raider while gaining almost ten extra
frames in the division which approaches
the performance of two gtx 980ti is in
sli which brings us into conclusion the
gtx 280 on the performance front is a
massive lead compared to high in maximal
cards and it looks like nvidia has put
much-needed architectural improvements
into pascal for asynchronous compute for
DX 12 and vr applications moving forward
it's a fantastic card and we're giving
it the Huracan acts damn good and a damn
good value award now we're very eager to
see how this new pricing strategy will
impact the sales and the distribution of
GTX 10 80s and 10 70s especially since
we don't know when the 599 dollar card
will hit the market but despite that the
graphics card market as we know it has
really changed with this launch you
gotta appreciate what NVIDIA has done
here what they've accomplished with
Pascal and the roadmap for Pascal looks
to be in really good hands and that
would be it for this review I hope you
guys enjoyed it what do you think of the
GTX 980 I'm sure everybody's super
excited to see what the performance
would be like on a GTX 970 so make sure
to subscribe to be notified when that
will be released somewhere in June and
also I'll be testing the GTX 980 in a
video production environment or anybody
who's interested so give this video a
thumbs up if you want to see that but
I'm Dimitri with Iraq Knox thanks so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next video
