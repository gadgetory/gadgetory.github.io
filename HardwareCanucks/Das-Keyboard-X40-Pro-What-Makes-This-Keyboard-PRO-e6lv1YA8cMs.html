is one of the few companies that makes
minimalist pure mechanical keyboards
ones that don't provide all the
flashiness of typical gaming designs
well it was just a matter of time since
they launched a new gaming lineup called
division zero Pro today we've got the X
40 pearl priced a hundred and thirty
dollars is it a yay or a nay the -
keyboard moved too far from their simple
roots we'll find that out but before
that quick look at our sponsor Toshiba
now offering OCC products that are
awesome and affordable like the Rd 400
TR 150 and vt1 80 that are backed by
advanced warranty program now stronger
than ever under Toshiba the first thing
I noticed after unboxing is the loud
gaming slab of decorated aluminum the
aggressive styling might suit your taste
but I have mixed feelings about it
if you're not a fan of the silver and
black color scheme you can swap the top
panel for a different design in this
case they have five different options
that include a limited edition Fox
layout Defamer mustard and silver
striker olive and finally strike a red
which is the extra panel that I have
here all you have to do is remove the
eight screws with the included allen key
and install the new panel the problem is
each faceplate costs $30 and
unfortunately - keyboard doesn't allow
the option to order the X 40 with your
design of choice pre-installed really
disappointing on a positive note the
build quality is top-notch the chassis
alone is made out of some hard plastic
material but the top panel is crafted in
metal which adds weight to the keyboard
plus it refines the structural integrity
of the keyboard which is nice you'll
find a single USB 2.0 pass-through along
with the audio jacks at the back of X 40
I suggest they add another port next
time plus please make it a free point of
standard it's 2016 the lack of a
dedicated wrist rest could be a negative
factor for this keyboard for some people
but not me coming from my daily driver
the epic little white fox which doesn't
feature a wrist rest I didn't feel left
out but it is something to be aware of
especially at this price point one thing
I should mention is the screws holding
down the faceplate actually protrudes
upwards
that means depending on your typing
position your hands may brush up against
these it can be pretty frustrating
especially with these screw closest to
the spacebar Plus having your hands rest
on aluminum during a cold day is
absolutely uncomfortable I'm not sure if
this is just me but I finally think
braided cable to be a little annoying
since it doesn't Bend easily there is
good braiding and bad braiding but with
this cable I miss a simple rubberized
coating I like to keep my setup as clean
and minimal as possible but this cable
is just not easy to route plus the
fabric started fraying already on my
samples so be mindful of that there are
appropriate flip-out feet for angle
adjustment and the rubber pads at the
bottom do a pretty good job holding the
keyboard in place the media buttons are
programmed to the function keys but I
want to hear your thoughts about this
implementation would it be better to
have a dedicated section for playback
control on a keyboard of this size or
are you fine with them being programmed
to the function keys let us know in the
comments down below on the left there
are five dedicated macro keys that can
be programmed on-the-fly this can be
done by pressing the function key and
the f12 key pick the macro key of your
choice and start programming commands
characters or anything that suits your
convenience make sure to hit the
function and f12 key again to save the
recording the windows lock button is
programmed as function plus f3 so you
don't accidentally swing back to the
desktop mode while gaming it is
certainly nice to have the keyboard that
saves your setting locally but I should
also mention that there isn't any
accompanying software here that means
functionality will be limited when
compared against similarly priced
competitors - keyboard has designed a
new switch for the X 40 called the alpha
Zulu switch and they come in linear and
tactile variants both have 1.7
millimeter actuation distance versus the
2 millimeter on em X cherry switches and
both have 45 grams of actuation force
with a total of 4 millimeters of travel
distance it's like their own version of
MX red and brown switches with the Zulu
tactile offering a softer actuation
point it's somewhere in between a brown
and blue feeling but with a slightly
lighter press comparing to the MX blue
on the white fox the Zulu tactile is
much softer switch that reduces finger
fatigue especially if you're performing
really fast keyboard strokes for many
many hours
when compared to the strafe RGB that
features cherry MX red switches I notice
that the keys on the X 40 required a
tiny bit of actuation force to register
this could be due to the tactile force
on the Zulu switch and I think that the
linear variation of this switch would
yield similar results like the MX Reds
let's do a sound test after playing
Battlefield 1 I noticed that my movement
throughout the gameplay was a lot
smoother plus my fingers were more
comfortable without in cramping also
take note that the X 40 supports full
and key rollover so the switches are
nice but does it grandiy X 40 such a
premium status for keyboard enthusiasts
maybe s the switch is high quality and
has unique actuation properties but if
we're talking about the entire package
it's hard to ignore cheaper alternatives
like the Corsair straight with real MX
cherry switches of your choice and
that's the
we can look past the lack of driver
software but the lighting system leaves
more to be desired it's only red
illumination with brightness control but
that's it the strafe RGB that costs $10
more than the x40 comes with more
features and better lighting that can be
customized through a dedicated driver
software although no doubt the faceplate
customization on the x40 is unique and I
think that's the main selling point
combined with the awesome alpha Zulu
switches but in such a competitive
market it may take some time more to
stand out we wish the top light
customization at the time of purchase
was more open letting us choose which
play we want by default and RGB lighting
is expected at this price it makes sense
for their gaming line to be totally
different from their professional series
but - keyboards are known for the
simplicity and that certain elegance and
perhaps some stealth black panels for
the x40 would appeal more to their
already established and graphic overall
this is a very good gaming keyboard with
interesting homegrown mechanical
switches but lacks some features I've
come to expect at this price point so
let us know your thoughts about the X 40
pro gaming mechanical keyboard from -
keyboards would you pay $130 for this or
are they any alternatives that you might
pick up like the strafe RGB looking
forward to your responses I mean both
hearken acts think it's much watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
