here at lien Li I'm super excited to see
them revamp the PCO 11 closure oh by the
way stands for open just found out today
so let's go check out the new PC Oh 11
dynamic and PC 11 air and by the way
thanks to FEA Tech schoolmaster and
Corsair for making this trip possible ok
guys so this is the new PC oh sorry so
this is the PC o 11 air so if you guys
check out my review of the PC all 11 at
the original which has the full
aluminium and glass and some more
airflow options inside they've basically
taken some of the feedback from the
community and taken some appropriate
measures to address some of the
complaints so this is the PC all 11 err
price point is super attractive no
longer the $200 case this would be 119
so a very affordable direction but
because of that they're also removing
the aluminum element from it so lien
Lee's kind of known for their aluminum
but I'm kind of happy to see them moving
into this direction instead so the air
in the name obviously stands for airflow
and that's exactly what they're trying
to focus here with large mesh in the
front large mesh at the top lots of
openings on the bottom and a really cool
addition they've added on the interior
is this side exhaust which I really am
excited to see more of in 2018 and so
the plastic panels up top and the the
front quite nice they don't look cheap
in any way they're easily removable so
you can access all those fan slots so
you can fit and 360 at the front and the
top at the bottom and at the back and
obviously some sort of a combination of
radiators and fans so they don't overlap
and kind of choke each other off the
front IO features a type C port along
with dual USB threes so that's awesome
to see and on the interior my favorite
option is that slightly expanded
motherboard tray so that you can have
those angled rubber grommets and allow
for that clean cable exit but this also
allows for that side radiator mount or
fans so you can have decent airflow
while still having a clean system
obviously dust filtration is super
important so they've got you covered
large dust filters to the front on the
side and the bottom and the top now I'm
like on the original PC 11 you can now
install
140mm fans at the top which is awesome
so you can have a 360 rad or a 280 rad
up top and I guess yeah both in the
front and the bottom can also support
140 millimeter fans 2x and the side
ventilation area can only do 120 member
of fans but you can do a 360 rad in
there and because 360 all in ones are
becoming so popular I think that would
be a really popular spot for those
things to populate to better populate to
occupy and my only complaint with this
prototype they're showing here is the
rubber grommet above the motherboard
tray that I think is too high so if you
were to potentially populate a radiator
and fans up top it'd be very difficult
to access that rubber grommet for all
your cable needs but they are aware JP
so I'm hoping that they will fix it for
the final production run now I love the
paneling approach so the top panel just
slides off like this it's secured with
thumb screws and the side panels just
kind of slide in like this from the top
and are basically held in by the top
panel which means that you know if
you're carrying the case around it's not
going to be an issue but I love the
redesigned rear section and so we have a
new hard drive that you can access from
the back it has dual caddies so you can
install three and a half inch or dual
SSDs the power supply is here at the
bottom and it's vertical so you save
space and it's awesome to see so it's
kind of like a dual chamber design but
still very spacious on the interior but
kind of a compact exterior given this
whole thing can accommodate so much
hardware but if you remove the hard
drive cage you can mount a second power
supply which is awesome for a system of
this caliber and the new cable
management bracket is good because it's
easier to immobile it hides a lot of
this cable mess and you can mount dual
as has these or a three and a half inch
drive here and this whole section is
large enough if you want to move in to
mount the radiator outside of this
exterior of this interior frame so you
can have fans on that side or radiator
on this side and don't have too much
thickness on the main chamber so that's
I really love this approach and now I'm
realizing why the top grommet is so high
up because the drive cage will almost
block it if this was any lower so
all righty then so this is the PCO 11
dynamic it's taking the exact same
interior frame as the air so I'm love
that they share that whole building
experience of having the motherboard
tray that's expanded all the same
airflow options aside from not having
any intake fans at the front so that's
just tempered glass tempered glass on
the side and the same thing with the
side panel just slide from the top or
the top panel covering up and then holds
the whole thing in place and the dynamic
basically it's a little bit more elegant
it's not as aggressively visually so
just nice clean lines follows in very
similar footsteps as the the original
PCO 11 and I like that so you have those
two options either for air flow focused
or glass and still being able to mount
those fans and radiators on the side
which will still deliver great airflow
because there's a lot of volume here and
if you mount a 360 rod on the side it
will take in take a lot of the air from
the bottom and I don't think it'd be an
issue with air flow but make sure to
subscribe because we'll be doing
comparisons between the two and the
dynamic version is a bit more expensive
because it has additional tempered glass
panels and they've moved away completely
from the aluminum because the frame is
completely made out of steel and the
only aluminum piece that we have is at
the front it's this tiny little thing
that I guess reminds you that you're
still only in the case and the vertical
GPU bracket is available here of course
it is an optional accessory but as you
can see with this configuration mounting
a radiator on the side a vertical GPU
here I think you have a lot of potential
for a very beautiful system and we have
these new fans that leonie's showing off
here there are their budget
you know kind of entries $40 for a three
pack featuring interior our jeebies
aluminum frames that you can take off
and potentially interchange with others
and yeah looks like a really nice budget
entry to make your RGB addiction come to
life without breaking the wallet and one
last thing here at Lee and Lee so last
year was a little bit of a terrible year
for airflow and so they're trying to
mitigate that and trying to go in the
direction that will keep the community
happy and your components cool so what
they're showing here is like a prototype
exterior showcase and
they want your feedback on what you guys
think about this type of front panel
opening so instead of including a mesh
thing we have nice elegant cutout in the
middle that's pretty large it's good
little bit unconventional lots of
airflow on the sides too and so this
whole thing is just a like a ventilation
machine so that your components can get
enough air here but it doesn't look like
you know your standard sort of mesh
thing in the front the LED strip is the
front is actually pretty awesome because
it illuminates the interior fans and the
interior space too so it's kind of like
a 2 and 1/4 illumination but yeah let us
know what you think of this kind of
aluminum and centered cut out in the
middle down comments below alright guys
so that's it from Lee and Lee I
absolutely love the new direction for
the PC 11 air and dynamic this whole
interior restructuring is definitely
paid off and I can't wait to check it
out let us know what you think of this
you know change are you kind of happy
with it and if you want to see the
reference point of the PC 11 in my
review and like all the little things
they've actually changed go check it out
we'll link it below but yeah thanks much
for watching we'll see you in our other
CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
