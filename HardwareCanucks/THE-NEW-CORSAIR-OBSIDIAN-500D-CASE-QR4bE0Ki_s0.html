lovely to visit these people see Jorge
see other people and this place is
always so busy but they have some new
cases that we obviously are gonna check
out so come along see we have people and
some more people so the 500 decays I'm
really excited about that stuff there
but it's quite busy so let's first check
out the carbide spec Alfa okay so the
spec Omega is an exciting mix between
the original spec Alfa case and the 460
X so the interior has been completely
changed up but that Bulldog gaming
exterior remains the same we get three
color options all of which are $99 we
have tempered glass at the front with
that angular portion that looks awesome
it's much cleaner versus plastic and we
also have the large side tgd panel that
is weirdly attached with hex screws
instead of thumb screws so corsair
believes a thumb screws don't provide a
good user experience because of
fingerprints and unattractive looks
because they stick out too much so the
lower profile hex screws were introduced
here the jog or the cutout beside the
PCI area is non present here so you need
to fit this screwdriver through the
holes to secure your PCI slots there's
also no power supply shroud so the full
interior is just open exposing your
drive cage in the front in the power
supply
you can fit a 360 rat in the front and
dual 140 mm fans up top so it's a nice
refresh to a unique frame with better
internals but I am curious if you think
it's a good deal for $99 so let me know
in the comments and now let's check out
the Corsair obsidian 500 d it's the new
case it's kind of like the merge between
the 570 X and the concept slate that we
looked at Computex aka I guess if you
cut that in half you get 500 d kind of
makes sense but yeah these two variants
one a little bit more on the premium
side aluminum and tempered glass and RGB
fans versus the other one that's a
little bit more you know kind of like
okay sexy in black so that's the 500
deep let's check them out so this one is
a bit more exciting because the interior
matches that of the crystal 570 X but
with a revamped exterior shell to add
some life into the Obsidian series so
the fully SPECT out 500 e with all the
tempered glass panels and the curved GG
panel and the front that by the way has
terrible yields is the 500 d SE or
special edition with a pretty steep $249
price point while the regular 500 d
sells for only 150 so the reason as e is
that expensive is because the commander
pro fan controller / lighting controller
hub is included with three RGB fans plus
one non RGB and all that glass on
quality hinges for that suite swivel
action the power supply shroud here is
closed at the front with ventilation and
cutouts there are reservoir and pump
mounting points in front of here too
there are two vertical PCI slots but for
some reason they don't include the PCI
riser cable and they don't even sell
that yet but at least it's future
proofing that enclosure the top fan
bracket can accommodate 8 to 80 min
radiator with a total of 60 millimetres
stack on thickness because of the
additional height of the frame and you
can fit a 360 rad and different to the
top of your features a type C port which
is one the first for Corsair and as for
the empty interior you can see the
motherboard is slightly compressed
inside and that helps with cable
management and for storage we get three
SSD caddies behind the tray and dual
three and half inch caddies and the
front so I would say that's pretty good
and the only difference between the
special edition and the regular 500 D is
the brushed aluminum exterior versus
glass and you also get non LED fans
inside the 500 D and it's also $100
cheaper making the case actually quite
an attractive full tower option at $150
so stay subscribe for our full reviews
to come soon and the last thing here is
this a X 1600 eye power supply make tell
me it's the best part plane in the world
that just got better
oh and behind me is the best view of any
boot that will visit so we'll conclude
here thank you so much for watching what
do you guys think about the spec Omega
and the obsidian 500 d I'm really
looking forward to actually working with
those cases just to see what the
experience is like you know even though
it's just a little revamp of their
previous iterations but it's really good
that they have upgrading the frame and
they're listening to our feedback so
thanks so much for watching make sure to
check out our other CS content I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
