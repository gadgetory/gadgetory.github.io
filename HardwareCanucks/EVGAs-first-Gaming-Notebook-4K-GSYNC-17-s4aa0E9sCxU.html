possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX without them we wouldn't be
here so aside from the cool gaming case
EVGA is also branching out to create
their first the gaming notebook
and it seems they're learning from what
the market wants to see and so here's
the SC 17 superclocked 17 and this is
exactly how you make a splash in this
category it's got a full aluminum
unibody design incredibly thin and
lightweight for what it is considering
this 17 inch form factor and don't you
worry
this thing is Specht out we have 4k
g-sync IPS display that's covered in
glass it is not touched oh and also
seems to be more reflective than a
macbook pro display but the solid
aluminum lid means no flex whatsoever
when opening it by one of the edges and
it's awesome to see given how thin the
damn thing is on the inside the trackpad
was just okay surface wise but the left
and right clicks were light enough so
that's great to see the keyboard is
backlit with satisfying amount of travel
time and this would probably be the
first 17 inch notebook that I would
actually carry around for editing on the
go for specs we have a skylight i7 6820
HQ that is unlocked and EVGA will offer
a one-click overclocking button but
users will also be able to enter the
BIOS and overclock from there we have a
gtx 980m
16 gigabytes of ddr4 ram and some
combination of spinning discs with an
MDOT 2 SSD the higher tier will cost you
just under $3,000 which is the premium
but you still get better hardware than
the higher-end
15 inch retina MacBook Pro also in terms
of ports we have dual USB 3 USB type-c a
headphone jack and HDMI port and dual
display port the dual front-facing
speakers are a good touch with the base
port firing underneath and the power
brick was surprisingly small but I
forgot to shoot it so the entire
cumbersome very well in mind for serious
creative professionals and/or gamers so
well done EVGA the bottom of the
notebook
reveals a few smallish ventilation ports
so it is safe to assume that cooling
will be challenging but hopefully fan
noise will be still under control and I
gotta say that this being EVGA is first
notebook it does not disappoint from its
first impressions and features wise all
the latest goodies we need to see in
2016 gaming notebook are present with
the SC 17</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
