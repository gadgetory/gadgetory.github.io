great technology selections and service
hey guys this is dimitri and welcome
back to another harbor canucks review I
think we can all agree that tablet
serves multiple purposes with particular
attention to portable entertainment and
multimedia the key word here is
multimedia so you can check your email
watch some YouTube and play a game while
you're on the subway for example many of
the 7-inch tablets and below are quite
affordable to fulfill that exact purpose
so the question is how low can you go to
meet that budget requirement for those
wanting a 7-inch tablet experience that
also runs Android so you guys are
looking at the d2 tablet a sub 100
dollar device equipped with 4.1
jellybean a 7-inch display with a
resolution of 800 x 480 512 megabytes of
memory and 4 gigabytes of storage and
running the whole thing is a 1 gigahertz
processor surprisingly the d2 pan
despite its low price is very well built
it weights only 317 grams which is very
comfortable to hold and the backing is
rubberized which isn't exactly anti-slip
but gives the d two sturdy feel all the
connections are located at the bottom of
the device with a volume rocker charging
port USB port headphone jack and power
button it's also welcome sight to see a
micro SD card slot for expandable
storage and they stare your built-in
speaker at a very random position in the
back speaking of random positions a
point three megapixel camera is located
in the corner which makes any
front-facing chat or rather should i say
side facing chat quite awkward
regardless of how you hold the device
for myself i found to be most
comfortable to hold the device and
landscape mode with all the buttons
located on the right side for easy reach
as it was very awkward trying to adjust
volume for example while in portrait
mode the do to pad features a G sensor
which helps to rotate the screen based
on its holding position it works well
just not a smooth and during rotation I
encountered a few crashes which was
quite unexpected so specs wise it sounds
like it should do the job given such a
low res display and quite frankly it
operates like an eighty dollar tablet
the touch display works very well but of
course it's not a smoother fluid as
we've come to expect from tablets and
the major issue arises with performance
when doing anything online YouTube
playback is practically impossible going
to take you some time just to navigate
to video when checking email a similar
situation occurs with stuttering
performance and unresponsiveness now I'm
okay with the resolution simply because
any more pixels the d2 pad has the
process with only worse than your
experience and of course seeing
pixelated text would be painful for
those on retina displays the real issue
is the performances you cannot play the
most basic apps like angry birds and
fruit ninja for example without getting
annoying lag and extremely low framerate
apps that run just fine are available so
it's not all lost for the d2 but it does
make you question the purpose of the
device also there's no Google Play but
it has its own version of an app store
called one market mobile and the good
thing is that all apps are free battery
life on the d two was all right with a
four-cell 3,000 milliamp hour battery
with about four to five hours of
extremely painful web surfing and one
thing we did notice was poor heat
dissipation as the d2 pad got really
warm on the opposite side of the speaker
also an upsetting realization was the
internal storage capacity while rated at
four gigabytes our device had only one
point one nine which is unacceptable so
while it is targeted for kids and is
preloaded with a few kid-friendly apps
we cannot say the d2 pad is worthy of a
consideration because of its poor
performance the best thing about the
tablet is the build quality and a decent
enough touch screen but you are getting
eighty dollars worth of performance
which is very laggy and unresponsive so
while it is a budget-friendly 7-inch
tablet we would strongly suggest you
look elsewhere so if you were to
recommend the tablet to a friend which
one would you get and why leave your
comments down below and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
