single GPU card on the market it's
fantastic for games no doubt about that
but how does it perform in a video
production environment specifically for
GPU accelerated effects and CUDA support
through Adobe CC what's up guys I'm
Dimitri with I recognize and the GTX 980
is behind me in that PC and this is the
gtx 980ti we'll be comparing these two
cards today
I've been using the 980 TI ever since
launch for video production it has been
a fantastic card but with a new
performance King in games right there
right behind the how will that impact
rendering times with Adobe Premiere and
Adobe CC applications let's find out and
before I show you the benchmarks which
card do you think will win this test
will be the 980ti with more cooler cores
more texture units and more ROP s but
slower clock speeds and less V RAM or
will it be the 1080 which has less cuda
cores but faster clock speeds more V RAM
which is also faster for testing I'm
using my sky like workstation PC behind
me with these specs and to establish
some type of reference point for
comparison of how much faster the new
GTX 980 is compared to the 1980 I for
gaming
here is the firestrike ultra test and
you can see the result with the 25%
difference between the cards which is
fairly significant Baljit 4 is next
which gave me a 27% boost on the GTX
1080 Metro last light Redux showing a
20% boost and finally Armour 3 showing a
16% difference between the averages but
look at that fantastic minimum which is
totally playable so no doubt the GTX
1080 wins the gaming round but surprise
surprise when it comes to video
production environment that performance
gap just closes so we're going to start
off with Cinebench r15 OpenGL benchmarks
which shows an almost identical score
moving over to Adobe Media encoder where
we transcode native
four key files from the gh4 to sinha
form correct which is a lot more editing
friendly and this 11 second difference
on a total of eleven files is truly not
significant then i exported a six-minute
4k project and a one-minute 4k project
and you can see here the 980ti finished
exporting that larger sequence 25 second
faster than the GTX 1080 now when we
move away from the benchmarks the only
real difference I noticed between using
these two cards is temperatures the GTX
980 staying much cooler at 53 degrees in
idle and 66 degrees Celsius while at
load while exporting stuff while the gtx
980ti was at 66 degrees Celsius at idle
so you can see there is a huge
difference there and 83 degrees while at
load so seeing all these results are you
at all surprised to see no difference in
the rendering performance me that's
exactly what I was expecting
that's why I teased it a little bit
simply because driver support is not
there yet so retesting will have to be
done as soon as both Nvidia and Adobe
side of things sort of come up with a
cohesive driver that implements Pascal
engine when better cooler support with
Adobe applications we'll be doing three
tests as soon as they come out but a
perfect example here is that driver
support is so important it's not all
about raw horsepower a perfect example
of Pascal being so fresh in the market
and how it's not really utilized just
yet
is with octane bench the 980ti scores
114 points while GTX 1080 is not a
supported GPU just yet because they have
to redo the CUDA and the engine in
octane so that it can support the new
Pascal architecture and so the bottom
line is the GTX 980 is not a worthy
upgrade for video production as you saw
there was no difference in the rendering
performance between the two cards yet so
much such a large gap and gaming
performance between the GTX 1080 and the
980 TI it all comes down to drivers and
I hope that Nvidia and adobe come up
together to fix that problem with
drivers and hopefully having a better
driver support from the Adobe side of
things for more officially supported
GPUs for well more maxwell cards and
hopefully eventually pascal cards too
and this concludes this video thank you
guys so much for watching if you have
any suggestions on what type of software
and production environment you'd like me
to test the gtx 1080 in the future I'll
definitely be doing a retesting with the
card as soon as any patches or adobe
driver stuff comes out so make sure to
subscribe for that and I'm about to
start packing for Taipei for Computex
so we'll see you there and actually
we'll be editing you in the next
