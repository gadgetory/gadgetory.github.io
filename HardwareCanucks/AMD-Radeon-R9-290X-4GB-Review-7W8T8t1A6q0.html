axe and welcome back to another review
now we're going to take a look today at
the highly anticipated flagship graphics
card from AMD this is the AMD Radeon r9
290x now earlier rumors have stirred up
the hype for this being the Titan killer
so let's find out if the 290x lives up
to the rumored expectations now first of
all aim DS pricing on the new our Series
GPUs is extremely competitive and many
gamers and enthusiasts alike
will find aim DS aggressive pricing
strategy pretty beneficial as the 290x
is released at 549 dollars this is $100
cheaper than nvidia gtx 780 and almost
half the cost of the titan this is a
huge game changer in the industry and
we're going to have to wait to see what
type of price drops are to a cure from
the greenside if any but this is also a
huge step for AMD given now we have a
card that not only outperforms the Titan
but also it's significantly cheaper than
the competition
and aside from extremely competitive
price point the r9 290x incorporates all
the latest technologies from AMD
including mantle true audio DirectX 11
point 2 and then updated power to an
engine all features in sort of their
infancy stages at the moment and only
time will tell with revealing their true
benefits now compared to the rest of the
lineup the 290x has at 2,816 stream
processors with 176 texture units which
one compared to the HD 7970 gigahertz
Edition in theory means about 40%
increase in processing power it features
four gigabytes of gddr5 memory for high
resolution crunching with a 512 bit
memory bus for that 4k that's been
slowly penetrating the market base clock
of 850 megahertz with potential of
reaching the one gigahertz mark which is
absolutely highest the r9 290x will
reach given its thermal and power
conditions also this is a power-hungry
card despite a m-- these claims of TDP
to be around 250 watts now this
reference design
is good-looking with the Radeon branding
and the red stripes no glowing logos
here unfortunately this is a blow style
cooler with integrated intake
ventilation around the back of the card
that would certainly come in useful in
tight crossfire situations and notice
there are no cross 5 fingers and what
the AMD has done here is incorporated a
new hardware DMA engine for multi card
interaction which carries benefits such
as improved latencies and higher
bandwidth over the PCI Express bus now
despite the high waters draw the 290 X
is powered through an 8 + 6 pin
connector and feature a multitude of
appropriate IO connectors for Eyefinity
setups including two DVI ports an HDMI
output and a display port with daisy
chain support meaning you can run 6
displays out of this single card now the
r9 290x includes a switch at the top
where the crossfire fingers would be
that allows the car to operate at either
silent or uber mode with better cooling
provided in the latter with 55% fan
speed this consequently allows user
flexibility for better performance or a
more silent operation and the new power
to an engine helps the car to maintain
maximum utilization of the core provided
there sufficient cooling now the car
temperatures in either mode reach 94
degrees Celsius but the uber mode allows
more Headroom for higher clock speeds
because the heat is removed quicker and
partying essentially helps to stabilize
the clock speeds to an appropriate level
based on thermal capacity of the core
now this leaves the temptation for even
better performance once non-reference
cooler and eventually water blocks
entered the market another exciting
feature incorporated into the card is
true audio which allows the GPU instead
of the CPU to process audio elements in
the game and therefore release the
limited CPU resources assigned for audio
this in terms helps game developers and
helps to improve audio fidelity and
detail with more resources allocated for
audio processing from the GPU now the
real big question here is how does it
perform in games and looking at
benchmarks the r9 290
eggs comes on top or just below the
Titan in the uber mode while the silent
mode allows the slightly lower clocks
due to thermal capacity now for a car
that's almost half the price of the
Titan the results speak for themselves
and this is an absolute powerhouse and
brings an incredible price to
performance ratio that many gamers will
appreciate at $549 the compromise
however here is threefold
first is acoustics with this being the
loudest card within the lineup for most
gamers stoke would like to blast out the
volume on their speakers or usually wear
headphones this really shouldn't be a
problem second are the temperatures with
a 94 degrees Celsius threshold not only
does this bring up concerns of life
expectancy of the core due to such
massive heat but you also have to take
into account for the overall case
temperatures this will affect and lastly
the power draw of the 290x is incredibly
high for a single core GPU the card is
targeted for enthusiasts so it's not
really an issue of having a weak power
supply but your power bill will
consequently be higher and that is just
something to keep in mind and I would
like to conclude by saying that AMD has
introduced some serious competition to
Nvidia that feature a lot of new tech
like mantle trueaudio
DirectX 11 point 2 capability and power
tune to keep clock speeds in balance
with the thermal threshold and
consequently do all the heavy lifting on
making sure the core is fully utilized
we have the two modes silent and uber
are beneficial for user preference and
the capable performance out of this card
is truly impressive given the price AMD
has made it smooth and now I'm very
eager to see how this will affect
invidious pricing structure but of
course we are dealing with louder
operation higher and whirring
temperatures and warping power
consumption that all add up to one big
pile of concerns but I still think that
the 290x is a huge step for AMD that
aims to acquire a larger chunk of the
enthusiast market with incredibly
aggressive pricing and tighten killing
results and we're giving you the hard
work NOx damn good and damn good value a
word now what do you guys think
of this move from AMD and what does this
mean for the Titan leave your comments
