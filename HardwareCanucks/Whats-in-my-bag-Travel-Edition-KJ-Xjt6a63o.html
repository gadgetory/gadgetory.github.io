constantly need a better solution what's
up guys I'm Dimitri with Huracan arcs
welcome to another video today we're
gonna be talking about what's in my bag
travel edition my mentality for taking
gear on the road would need to cover
shows and other things has changed
significantly over since a year ago when
I realized that I cannot be carrying so
much as I normally do and I've
completely minimized what type of gear I
take with us to cover the shows that
does not compromise on quality and my
ability to create great coverage so this
is what's in my bag travel edition
silverstone reversible cables feature
beautiful aluminum housing in various
colors and nylon braiding for protection
with reversible USB 2.0 on one end for
that really easy plug-and-play and on
the other end available in both
Lightning connector for the iPhone or
reversible micro USB get your cables now
with a link below now to give you a bit
of a point of reference as to what I
used to use for Computex and CES over
the last three years is this backpack
it's awesome it's got padding everywhere
it's great for gear but it's not a great
backpack for gear and other things and
you know if you're traveling just with
gear all one backpack it kind of sucks
because if you want to put a shirt in
there other things for hygiene and
whatever then you might get stuck short
so I thought about what what should I
use and luckily we got this from Oris
from Computex and it turns out this is
actually quite a great backpack not only
is it so much more compact but though on
the interior it's all one big pocket so
you can stuff things at the bottom here
like the extra pants extra shirts and
whatever and then fill up the rest of it
with gear and because there is no
separation on the interior and Plus
check out the thinness of this thing has
got extra pockets on the side for water
and other things it's got this extra
security thing built in so the zipper
cannot pass
you have this little lock here extra
secret pocket on the back which you can
stash you know your passport and
whatever the color scheme I don't mind
it
it's orange you know I don't work for
LTTE but you know this is good
and so no impressive part about the
backpack is it can fit everything that's
in on this table without a problem the
choice for editing right now for me is
yes a MacBook Pro 15 inches
it's the 2.5 gigahertz Edition with
discrete graphics and the reason why
this was picked for me is because of the
size I need to prioritize on performance
but I also need to prioritize on saving
these shoulders if I have to carry my
giant eurocom m5 Pro which is actually
let me get that for you so I would
actually consider this to be a very
portable workstation PC and I've used it
so I've grabbed grated bunch of stuff on
it but in terms of the size and the
weight I mean I couldn't use the
backpack that I use now if I was to come
with this especially because the power
brick for this machine is basically half
the size of the notebook itself and you
know you got a compromise somewhere and
yes I lose the ability of Windows but
I'm pretty happy with the MacBook Pro
for now now for storage I used to use
external hard disk like these this is
one terabyte it's got these this rubber
exterior for shock protection and
whatever and it's USB 3.0 so it's fairly
fast but I never actually utilized more
than say 200 gigabytes on the shore
floor during coverage so we had to
minimize and without compromise we're
using now these Kingston HyperX USB
sticks this is a USB 3.1 and it is the
savage SSD 128 gigabytes and this one is
the HyperX DT 3.0 so the blue one is
slightly slower than the red one at 128
gigabytes per USB stick it gives me
enough storage to offload media off the
computer if I need extra space on it and
I've actually started using the savage
USB stick as my cache dry
for the MacBook Pro and because the
speeds here are incredibly fast there's
absolutely no compromising performance
and my workflow to compliment my editing
I'm currently using the largest like G
900 it's a wireless mouse with a 3366
optical sensor which is fantastic who's
actually developed to be used in
wireless mode and ever since the g502
came out I've been sort of waiting
patiently waiting for a wireless
iteration of that sensor and the
slightly different body this is a you
know symmetric a body it only comes with
a tiny USB receiver that plugs into the
notebook like so and I carry a micro USB
cable just in case I need to charge it
this is a fantastic addition if in case
I need to do more mouse intensive work
and to complement this I have this
fabric raw cat mouse mat so this one can
actually act as you know a little
protection for inside the backpack like
I would wrap a lens or something and it
would also act as my mouse mat so for
the camera side of things you guys know
this the gh4 I'm a heavy gh4 user still
use it that's a fantastic camera and I
rode videomic pro on here for reference
audio or when I need to actually use
this audio for shooting a little
interviews or whatever and the Sigma 18
to 35 F 1.8 the sharpest lens I have
ever used especially on the gh4 in the
meta bones adapter fantastic low-light
combination and you wouldn't think that
I would get such pretty shots such bokeh
licious shots with a microphone third
sensor well you are wrong my friends
check out this clip which was done with
a single light and ambient lighting
inside the bar and to complement this
type of low lights beast I also carry
the rocking on this is a 16 millimeter F
2.2 which is awesome I carry a ND filter
on top of it so this is my on camera
lens because it's wide enough so I can
actually be so close to the camera that
I can focus on myself being a one-man
team to shoot stuff whenever I am a one
team one main team d clicked aperture
fantastic quality and this is the lens
that I used
or all my on-camera stuff and I also
carry the rx100 mark 3
unfortunately the nonde mark 4 because
for a pointed shoot at this size for
1080p60 quality fantastic and this is
why we we acquired the pilot fly h1 plus
now the gimbal is really awesome because
it allows me to do other things that
I've never done before like running with
a camera and getting establishing shots
on the floor outside talking to people
product photography whatever we can do I
put the rx100 on there it's light enough
to compensate for the weight the
vibration motor doesn't have to do a lot
of work and when they need to do 4k
stabilization shots I use the g7 which
is recording me now put that on here
because it's a very light camera where
the light blends and bam not coming out
to the audio side of things my
headphones of choice for editing music
listening and travel are a key G K 182 I
actually literally sat with these for 11
hours on the flight then talked to the
guy next to me and did not experience
any sweaty ears there was absolutely no
pressure fatigue and the isolation of
these ear pads is fantastic I'm also
using the AKG
C through a three on four microphone
which is my condenser microphone to do
voiceovers and stuff and guys I haven't
been able to figure out a proper
solution for a microphone stand so
anytime I travel this is the heaviest
piece in my collection a little
microphone stand because this whole
thing is just an iron piece it's an IV
piece I get so much trouble going
through security with this because
security is wondering what the hell is
this especially like a hole a pole
whatever but it's disassembled whenever
I travel so I can thesis stash it away
somewhere but guys if you have a
suggestion for a light and compact and a
stable microphone stand where I can put
the actual you know a little shock mount
for my condenser microphone please leave
them in the comments down below
and the final piece is the h5 zoom which
is currently recording this entire
conversation with my Sennheiser wireless
system it's awesome because you have XLR
inputs you have also a 3.5 millimeter
input if you need to record external
audio with a 3.5 mic and the built-in
microphone module here is absolutely
fantastic if you need to record any
ambient sound or whatever and so that
would be all that I carry
aside from two last pieces because I'm a
baller like that a little business card
holder for when we need to exchange some
dips and some email stuff and my daily
driver still continues to be the oneplus
2 until the last night it has been a
declining
experience with its camera performance
it's slowing down this but now they
actually rolled out with an oxygen OS
update so it's 3.0 which means that it's
a marshmallow update and that has
improved on so many things so the camera
is so much faster now the performance
seem to be improved I didn't have to
wipe and factor reset in order to you
know bring back the stability and the
smoothness and the fluidity of operation
as it was in the beginning and I am
super happy about that and the last
piece of the puzzle is my portable light
it can change color and it can change
intensity this is awesome because it's
portable you can place it anywhere you
want you can add it as a highlight for
your face you can add it as a highlight
for a subject you can place it really
close to the camera to add very nice
ambient lens flare so much functionality
built into one single light that if you
do not own one I would highly suggest
you pick one up it's a really good
mentality to be thinking about
minimizing things you carry so that you
can utilize everything that you bring
with you in the past I've brought in too
many lenses too much too many cameras
like you know three cameras on the show
floor and then use one for something use
the other for something else but this is
a really good way to learn your gear as
to minimize what you take and utilize
its full functionality but guys I hope
you guys enjoyed this what's in my bag
