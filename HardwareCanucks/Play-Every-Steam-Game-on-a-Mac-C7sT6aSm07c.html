announcing a cloud powered game
streaming service dubbed GeForce now
unlike online and other similar
alternatives with GeForce now you aren't
leasing a game library you're releasing
a virtual GeForce powered computer in
the cloud in many ways this can be
considered the next evolution of
Nvidia's ambitious great initiative from
the last few years instead this time it
has been opened up to other devices
outside the shield environment the show
coverage is possible thanks to Nvidia
gigabyte fantex and NCI X basically you
provide the games and NVIDIA provides
the hardware horsepower to run them on
any PC or Mac with a 25 megabits per
second or faster internet connection all
you need to do is sign up for the
service get the GeForce now application
and install your games up to one
terabytes worth on the virtual gaming PC
basically they aren't being installed
onto your PC but on the drive in cloud
the games themselves can be from any
source it can be steam origin you play
Gog or battlenet games once loaded the
games will actually remain installed on
your virtual PC in the cloud so no need
to reinstall every time you want to play
you also don't need to worry about
patching game configuring and Driver
updating as it handled automatically
save games achievements and other
settings are also automatically
synchronized and available on any PC
with GeForce now app and a fast-enough
connection
now while nvidia is claiming that the
games will be running off gtx 1060 or GT
x 1080 gaming pcs hosted in the cloud
the service is obviously not going to
run on actual gaming pcs you're just
borrowing a tiny fraction of a percent
of computing horsepower from one of
invidious Pascal GP of powering data
centers however the concept is pretty
awesome
even though output is limited to 1080p
when we went hands-on with GeForce now
and Nvidia suite at CES it performed
equally well on both 8 small Dell XPS 11
a MacBook Air and an iMac unfortunately
there was quite a bit of lag and some
rendering issues since the hotels
internet connection admittedly wasn't up
to the task to provide enough bandwidth
for all the devices in parallel we're
already anxious to test this in a proper
environment according to Nvidia there
are 1 billion PC users who don't have a
computer that is suitable for game
as a result g-force now might be a
perfect solution for those with
underpowered laptops old obsolete
desktops or just about any Mac computer
ever made since they have never had a
great selection of game titles available
however perfect solutions are never free
using the GeForce now service to
instantly connect to a high performance
gaming machine in the cloud is going to
cost you a bit of money $25 will buy you
20 hours of game time on a gtx 1060
PowerPC or 10 hours on a GTX 1080 if you
do the math that comes out to between a
dollar and 25 cents to $2 and 25 cents
per hour which is still pretty much
cheaper than most other forms of
entertainment in video we'll be offering
free trials of both the GTX 1060 ng tix
and 80 options so go add yourself to the
early access waiting list if you want to
give this new service a try sometime in
March
Nvidia also announced some further
optimizations to GeForce experience
application which includes the ability
to stream live over Facebook's so all
your friends can easily interact with a
stream
it also has better integration with
ansel and 360 degree images and super
resolution screenshots that can easily
be shared over the social network so
that's it for now but expect more from
us as we continue to cover in video at
CES 2017
I mean bar with hurricane axe thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
