suite at CES 2019 something caught our
eyes standing in one corner was a
grouping of three pretty standard
allergy monitors that didn't have any
visible bezels between them it looked
amazing to be honest and we needed to
see and understand how that was
accomplished it turns out that Asus had
a pretty simple setup to achieve the
illusion of one seamless gaming panel
but before we get to that I want to give
a huge shout out to our sponsors for CES
2018 fantex Corsair and cooler master
without them the show coverage would not
have been possible so I mentioned that
the setup here is actually easy and
that's because asus hasn't created any
type of brand new technology or anything
instead they're using three simple
adapters that clip onto the edge of
their existing monitors each of those
has a pair of integrated PMMA acrylic
panels to refract light from the
monitors back towards the viewer
basically each of the two adapters in
this kit is installed between the left /
right and center monitors at an optimal
130 degrees this allows Center bezels to
disappear
there are some small hiccups that needs
to be addressed - since this is pretty
much a passive mer like setup the
displays aren't extended but rather
whatever appears on leftmost and
rightmost sides of the center monitor is
repeated the refraction takes on a
slight perspective view that makes it
look like a continual image then meshes
well into the side monitors however when
there's a menu or weed out on-screen in
one of the corners that could be
refracted - depending on its positioning
relative to the screens edge it looks
pretty odd in some situations
particularly when there's an ammo
counter or speed indicator too close to
the monitors side the thickness of the
plastic also causes a slight shadow
effect that can be more of a visual
issue than pestles we were told that
Asus is actually in the process of
optimizing the PMMA production process
in an effort to reduce that effect if
they can do that it will be absolutely
amazing installation is pretty easy
though since the reflectors are made of
a flexible plastic and so are the two
top and bottom claims I did realize that
they have to be installed in a specific
direction though since installing them
upside down leads to an odd-looking
image recreation given the fact that
this is a proof-of-concept which isn't
ready for production yet the amount of
options for this bezel free kit are
limited to a single monitor the PG 25 8
Q if the response of this version is
enough in the future asus plans on
launching kits that are compatible with
other sizes and even other vendors
products as well planned for launch for
the bezel free kit aren't firm yet as of
right now but asus expects a slightly
more refined version in time for copy
tax and mass production starting in the
second half of 2018 regardless of time
frame though the target price is under
$100 right now the other item we saw
both at Asus and Nvidia was the new big
format gaming displace from Asus HP omen
and Acer this is an Nvidia sponsored
project which represents a combination
of most of their current generation
display technologies into one epic
display many people have asked for
better 30-inch in larger gaming monitors
but this one turns the dial to 11 more
all of the BFG d-- monitors use the same
massive 4k 65 inch annual panel which
makes the display some of the largest
around outside the digital signage
market now you might be wondering why
Nvidia and their partners are calling
this a display or a monitor rather than
a UHD TV and there's a simple reason
behind that
unlike TVs this thing doesn't have a
built-in tuner so they simply can't call
it a television but that doesn't stop it
from being one beautiful looking gaming
device so what makes this thing so
special even though it will never likely
be installed on a desk it could be
considered the father of all other
gaming monitors the 4k 65 inch panel
uses IPS technology as a 120 Hertz
refresh rate supports HDR DCI p3 color
space and includes a quantum dot film
for the ultimate in color reproduction
basically it's a massive monitor that's
ready for the future of gaming since not
all that many games support its higher
level features like HDR with that being
said there are a few other goodies
thrown into this big format gaming
display as well there is a fully
integrated shield TV console with access
to features like a full Android
operating system game stream and the
ability to stream 4k content from
Netflix Amazon and other services NVIDIA
has also added an existing module for a
good measure at this point B of GDS were
introduced at CES in order to gajj
response before a decision was made to
enter production it seems like the
reception has been extremely positive so
Nvidia is looking into enabling their
partners to start production sometime in
late 2018 with that in mind pricing
hasn't been announced yet but I expect
them to be an unbelievably expensive
given the flagship status coupled with
the price of Kuran a 30-inch plus a
g-sync
enabled gaming displays so let us know
what you think is the relatively
inexpensive bezel free Kent or a big
format gaming display of more interest
to you also stay tuned for more coverage
from CES 2018
I mean bar with Harry Canucks thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
