great technology selections and service
hello everyone i'm dimitri with Haruka
Knox and we attended the Berlin Aoife
which is an equivalent of a CES in las
vegas and computex in taipei and where
everything technology related comes
together in berlin to show off their
latest introductions into the market and
this time Samsung really put on a show
of dominance within the consumer
electronics fear obviously there was
emphasis on curved display technology
with screens getting bigger and better
and desktop monitors starting to catch
up to the curve with 21 by 9 aspect
ratio panels being on the receiving end
of it and the biggest hit / were in the
mobile sector and wearables and starting
with the Galaxy gear s it's another
SmartWatch made to complement your
Samsung smartphone now with a 2 inch
curved Super AMOLED display with
resolution 360 x 480 packing in 2g and
3g connectivity Wi-Fi b/g/n it's running
Tizen on a dual-core chip with a 300
million power battery 512 megabytes of
ram and 4 gigabytes of built-in storage
of course health and athletic aspects
are fully incorporated to work without a
smartphone and for those already owning
a galaxy gear smartwatch this is just
going to be a slightly enhanced version
of the gear 2 neo with a new curved body
design with actual metal frame that
feels really solid now the curve face is
a step in the right direction as it
forms a nice shape for the arm although
it's still quite large but with the size
we have extra features like a full
keyboard so you can respond text
messages and emails directly from the
gear s and gain that extra real estate
for the rest of the applications the
wristband is made of comfortable rubber
in both black and white and of course
being a watch there are multiple watch
faces to choose from although nothing
super fantastic in terms of design and
moving on to the Galaxy Tab active this
is a new 8-inch tablet made to be
durable and protected against the
elements as it is waterproof without
needing a case it's fully dustproof and
sand proof and it's also drop proof
although you will need a protective case
for that and it comes with a removable
cover and the massive 4450 milliamp hour
battery pack and it looks rigid to
withstand some harsh handling with large
physical home back and multi window
buttons at the front there's also power
and volume rocker on the side placement
of the button feels just right with
great tactile click nothing mushy with
pogo pin on the side for easier charging
nothing outstanding in the specs
Department that the 8 inch display is
only 1280 by 800 with pixel density of
189 it is still quite like though at
just under 400 grams it is running
Android 4.4 KitKat with 1.5 gig of ram
and 16 gigabytes of internal storage
with a microSD card slot above the
battery to expand your storage capacity
and it seemed responsive from the time
I've had with it and really the selling
point here is this industrial focus on
durability so now let's move on to the
most popular devices on the show floor
starting with the Galaxy Note 4 now with
an actual metal frame outstanding pixel
dense 5.7 Super AMOLED display with 2560
x 1440 resolution the note 4 is
everything that I think many people are
expecting with an approved build quality
and a high res screen incorporated
fingerprint sensor into the home button
and the s pen that has seen some changes
please note that the large pan I'm using
here is not the standard pan that comes
with a North for and one interesting
aspect of this device is incorporation
of fast charging that brings your device
from zero to fifty percent in just half
an hour very impressive the leather
cover at the back looks great to my eye
and adult for definitely feels like a
premium handset that is an improvement
over the note 3 in almost every way now
moving into the galaxy note edge which
basically is a note for in every way
with an added curve strip on the right
side to display additional information
and host your icons it is an interesting
approach to explain how we interact with
the screen especially since it modifies
the form and from the
time that I've spent with the note edge
it was a bit awkward to be honest in the
handling department as the right side
thins out and holding a non-symmetric
body on a phone on a smartphone would
require some period of adjustment the
curve is 160 pixels in width and it's a
seamless transition into the main
display so there's a certain way you
need to touch the curve to activate it I
found the camera app very useful with
this implementation as the shutter
button is right there for your thumb and
mainly I think it's a way to remove the
icons from their traditional spot on the
home screen to expand the overall real
estate and allow quicker access to your
most used apps with a quick tip of your
thumb without needing to modify the grip
the curve can be used to display the
time when the phone is off and access
quick shortcuts like voice record time
stop flashlight and some more plus
Samsung is opening this up for
developers to experiment with with many
other applications and uses an overall
Samsung really showed off their desire
for a competitive and aggressive
presence in the mobile market and they
have done exactly that with all these
new releases so what are your thoughts
on the gear as the tap active the note 4
and the note edge and do any of these
excite you to migrate to these devices
when they finally become available to
the public so let us know in the
comments below how you feel about all
