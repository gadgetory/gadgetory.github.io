GT s 450 video card and I'm not going
over the whole series this is just the
EVGA z' model a quick unboxing if you
want full details link in the
description or follow the annotation
anyways just looking at what is
different about this card first off this
is EVGA 's fpb model which is actually
the basic or entry-level model what is
different about it like with many other
manufacturers EVGA is offering a factory
overclock on it and it's only the same
price $129.99 speeds on this card are
822 megahertz for the graphics quad core
compared to 783 megahertz which is the
factory settings specified by Nvidia
anyways other than that everything is
the same it's got 1 gig of memory the
memory clock is 1804 or 36 oh 8
effective 192 cuda cores 128-bit memory
interface so just the graphics core is
updated but for the same price who's to
argue everything is pretty standard with
the technologies we have vision physics
CUDA SLI all that fun stuff like I said
nothing has changed with the card
there's a little sneak peek of what its
gonna look like so pull it open let's
see what's different about this card
compared to the rest alright so now we
look at the goodies we have a DVI to vga
adapter molex into PCI power adapter
Quick Start Guide as well as the user
guide and Driver CD make sure you read
this if you aren't familiar with how to
install or setup your graphics card and
drivers and video comm and download the
latest drivers always card fresh out of
the bubble wrap there we go very nice to
see they've kept the same short design
like we saw with the GTX 460 great for
people who are sort of get getting tired
of you know will it fit here will it fit
there right this is gonna fit in most
any case you don't have to worry about
it the the cooler itself and the shroud
are very similar to what we saw with the
GTX 460 if you can see it there there is
actually sort of a dip in the fan shroud
and what that's for is when you're
installing these in SLI or if you're
installing them the other one is going
to you know be fairly cool
this will give it a bit of breathing
room it allows the fan a bit more room
and it'll give you some good airflow as
we look at the back here we have our six
pin the six pin power 400 watt power
supply is recommended outputs we have
the DVI and mini HDMI you also have an
exhaust port down at the bottom that is
pretty much it for the card we have our
sli adapter there will only be able to
do dual sli no triple SLI for those
hoping for it and that is the GTS 450
very good looking card make sure you
check out the full review for all of the
benchmarks and a little more in-depth
look at the entire GTS 450 line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
