axe and this is the cooler master hyper
212 black edition CP cooler it now comes
in this awesome gunmetal matte black
finish that looks absolutely gorgeous
with the brushed aluminum texture on the
front and I just love it I just love the
way how it looks I mean I love anything
matte black if it's a phone or you know
coffee mug or heck even my car actually
I had to manually wrap that but anyways
coming back to the point we've seen an
exponential growth in terms of computer
components receiving the RGB treatment
and of course aggressive design elements
to that might be appealing to some of
you out there but it's always refreshing
to see companies go back to the drawing
board and perfect some of their very
popular components from you know 5 or 10
years ago to make them even better
and that's exactly what defines the
hyper 212 black edition the best part is
that this thing only cost $35 so I was
actually wondering what kind of
performance can you expect when you
decide to upgrade to a cooler of this
caliber from your traditional stock
cooler that comes out of the box with
your CPU regarding if it's Intel or AMD
so that's exactly what we're going to
find out right after this optimize your
desk space with the surahs new gram
spectrum TTL keyboard with a compact
steel frame and low-profile keycaps
removable cable and sweet illumination
plus your choice of the source agile
blue or red switches to satisfy those
fingers sieve the gram spectrum TTL
keywords for you links below
alright so most of you should be
familiar with the way how this cooler
functions it's still a basic design that
still happens to be one of the best for
the price you pay so you get four heat
pipes on each side connected to the cold
plate installation also was pretty
straightforward cooler master does
include brackets for both AMD and Intel
unfortunately this won't work on tr4
they now include this 120 millimeter
Silencio fan that's supposedly really
quiet during idle and load operations
plus they simply attach to the heatsink
via these metal clips you can also add
another 120 millimeter fan at the back
if you wish to go for a push-pull
configuration and I appreciate
Coolermaster for including an extra set
of clips for that now for testing
purposes I'll be using this $1,000 AMD
pay system that I built a while ago
and I've been using this to test the
latest adrenaline and 2019 Edition
drivers to see what their new features
are like and it's been great so far but
it has been rocking the Wraith spire
cooler that came out of the
stocke CPU so I thought it would be a
great example I guess a great use case
scenario to see what kind of
temperatures can we expect when we
decide to upgrade to this bad boy
now the specs in the system includes a
risin 5 2600 X with 16 gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance lpx memory I've also
got an XFX
rx 590 Fatboy graphics card all sitting
on an MSI p450 tomahawk motherboard and
in the case of choice is the fantex p300
and i will be running all of these tests
with the sight palettes closed just so
we get a more realistic use case
scenario when you have the PC right
beside you but I know a lot of you guys
may be wondering why I decided to go
with a 2600 X versus a 2600 and the
simple answer to that is that the 2600 X
has a 95 won TDP rating compared to the
65 watt TDP rating on the 2600 so it
actually flexes or pushes the limits on
these coolers when it comes to
performance so without any further ado
let's check out the results
now I ran prime95 for 15 minutes to
stress test the CPU both at stock and
overclock settings now the 2600 exit
stock settings with the rates bar cooler
yielded around 37 degrees Celsius idle
and 92 degrees Celsius under full load
with the fan speed set to its default
setting I did manage to increase the fan
rpm all the way up to 2800 which did
result in lower temps but the acoustic
performance was not that great take a
listen for yourselves
now switching over to the hyper 212
black edition and I saw temps around 33
degrees Celsius and under load it only
got as far as 62 degrees Celsius with
fan speed set to 1,400 rpm and the best
part was the acoustic performance was
phenomenal
here's a quick comparison between it and
the stock core
so right off the band you can certainly
tell that there's a significant decrease
in temperatures when you decide to
upgrade from the stock cooler to an
aftermarket solution like the hyper 212
black edition now I also did some
overclocking to see how this cooler can
handle it and I used the rising master
software to overclock the 2600 x2 4.15
gigahertz at one point four to five
volts but the sad news is that I was not
able to get a stable overclock with this
stock or installed every time after I
run prime95 runs 6 minutes the system
just crashed and just wasn't able to
keep up
I even tried increasing the fan speed
all the way up to 2,000 or more well
over 2,000 and again the system just
crashed because a stock core is just so
tiny so I can only do so much and it
just wasn't able to handle the overclock
but the hyper 212 black edition did
pretty well so we're talking around 37
degree Celsius idle and 90 degrees
Celsius under load which is still hot
but remember the fan speed was set to
about 1,400 rpm bumping that up to 2,000
did bring down the temperature
significantly and the acoustic
performance was also very respectable
all right so I think it's safe to say
that upgrading from your stock holder to
something a little bit more robust can
certainly help bring down those
temperatures I mean even with the fan
speed set to its max setting I was
barely able to hear the system which was
awesome but there are some other factors
to consider first and foremost the case
of choice the p300 is certainly not the
best case when it comes to air flow it
certainly has some restrictions so if
you were to switch that out for a case
that has better front intakes that would
have certainly helped decrease OCP
temperatures on both the stock and this
cooler as well another important thing
to consider is even at load at the stock
settings with the CPU the clock speeds
weren't hitting above 4 gigahertz at
least during my test
so certainly overclocking the CPU can
help bring up those 2 clock speeds at a
consistent rate and I think that's
important especially if you plan on
doing some rendering work could that
could potentially help take advantage of
those higher clock frequencies so a lot
of factors to consider especially when
you're planning on building your system
within a certain budget and again for
$35 this cooler surprised me in a lot of
ways so that concludes its video I hope
you guys enjoyed this one let me know
what you guys think about the 212 black
edition from Coolermaster I mean for $35
would you consider upgrading to this
from your traditional stock cooler and
also if you're looking to see
comparisons between this and perhaps the
ones from Noctua are you interested in
something like that a lot tune your
