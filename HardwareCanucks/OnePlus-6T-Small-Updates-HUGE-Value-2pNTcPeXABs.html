Eber here with hard-working acts and I
just got back from the one +60 launch
event here in New York City and overall
my first impressions with this device is
that I'm not really I'm not really
excited about it because this whole
cycled you know the whole cycle refresh
every year with oneplus is a little
confusing because it all started with
the three then we had the 3t then we had
the five the five t1 plus six and now
we're on to the 60 it's their second
flagship smartphone for 2018 that's
technically replacing the one plus six
and just looking at the features
standpoint it's again not a significant
upgrade over the one plus six
just like the five to the five t alright
so some of the minor changes with a1
plus 60 is that they've eliminated the
rear-facing fingerprint sensor on the
back and they replaced that with a
fingerprint sensor built inside the
display so they call it screen unlock
essentially there's a sensor built
inside the display and it is a Morcant
it's a more intuitive way of unlocking
the device it's I mean oneplus claims to
be the fastest way to unlock your device
although that's something to be
validated scientifically hopefully
someone will be able to do that but I'm
certainly looking forward to testing
that out
when I get my hands on with the device
next up we have a very slight
improvement in the display department so
it's a six point four inch AMOLED screen
with a tiny like it's a drop notch if
you want to call it a miniscule knotch
you can call it whatever you like it but
I actually kind of like the way how
oneplus has implemented the notch on the
60 because it looks very subtle very
sleek it's not as bad as the one found
at the pixel 3 Excel had hands down pick
the oneplus 60 over the pixel 3 Excel
any time of the day because the notch is
just it's bearable it's not super it's
not you know staring at your face or
anything like that
so I certainly like that approach but
other than that you're getting a
slightly you know slimmer chin at the
bottom so overall it's not a significant
upgrade over the six but it's again
something I guess it's a subtle look
that
I'm sure most people would appreciate
now one of the cool things that oneplus
did mention during their presentation is
that they're actually allowing users to
independently calibrate their displays
so if you want a supersaturated look you
can certainly go for that or if you're
looking for a more natural presentation
on your display you can offer that
option as well we're all aware of the
different color profiles that are built
inside oneplus smartphones so again
giving users the option to fine tune and
adjust and calibrate their displays is
pretty awesome
now specs wise it isn't a massive
improvement over the 1 plus 6 so you're
getting the exact same snapdragon 845
processor with 6 gigabytes or a
gigabytes of RAM depending on the
storage configuration or the model that
you're going for I do want to mention
that they have increased the battery
capacity on the 60 so it has improved
from a 3300 milliamp hours to 3,700
milliamp hours so that's definitely
gonna increase battery life on the
oneplus 60 s so that's definitely
something that I'm looking forward to
testing and I think that's about it you
don't get things like a wireless you
don't get things like wireless charging
which I was kind of disappointed about
because I was expecting that 101 plus 60
simply because it's the one feature that
I really wish this phone to have but
what really threw me away was the
removal of the headphone jack because I
really hoped that they would keep that
but unfortunately they have removed it
on the oneplus 60 which is really a
bummer I I'm pretty sure most of you
guys would agree with me on that but if
you have embraced wireless audio then
this shouldn't be a concern and for you
at all but let me know in the comments
down below if you prefer to have the
types of the headphone jack or not so
again it's a big bummer but
interestingly enough this is something
that I noticed is apparently they've
replaced the headphone jack with a fake
speaker grille and I just I didn't know
what to say my I was completely stunned
when I when I learned about that because
just it's just so weird about that
because I really wish if they actually
gave us two bottom facing speakers and
the most interesting part is the
speakers are not stereo so it's just a
single mono facing speaker at the bottom
which is again very unfortunate moving
on to the cameras and honestly it's the
exact same hardware as the one plus six
they're using the same Sony IMX sensors
the one thing that they really wanted to
focus one focus on was to improve the
low-light performance on the oneplus 60
and they've done that by implementing
nightscape which is a fine-tuned
algorithm that the text night scenes and
it fine-tunes majest so that you're
getting vivid and sharp results without
a lot of noise within the images again
that's something that I certainly have
to test out when I get my hands on with
this device but interestingly enough
they did mention that nightscape will be
rolled out as an update to existing one
plus six users so it's not like a major
upgrade and lastly I just want to
quickly go over software so the one plus
60 is rocking oxygen OS running on top
of Android Pi so you are X and roid
experienced with a few more
customization options that Google
doesn't really offer so if you really
want to fine tune within the settings
and make it feel your if you want to
really personalize it your way you can
certainly do that with the oneplus 60 or
just pretty much anyone plus devices
that are currently out there running
oxygen OS last but not least there's the
price so the one plus 60 is starting at
549 USD and for that you get a 60
gigabyte model with 120 gigabytes of
storage if the phone comes in two
finishes so you get mayor black and
midnight black I really like the
midnight black version just because it's
a more matte black finish and it's more
understated and it doesn't look as
glossy it has the mayor black finish
again personal preference here but I'm
actually really happy with the price
point here because at 5:49 I think
you're getting a it's its price so
competitively well in smartphone market
right now because if you really want to
get the best Android experience you
don't have to spend 600 or you know $700
or even $1000 for that you can certainly
get that with something like the oneplus
60 although I'm still bummed about a few
features that they were able to remove
with the oneplus 60 particularly the
headphone jack it's just something that
I didn't see coming but honestly it is
what it is but I'm going to chime in
Dmitry here for a second so that he can
talk about his experience using the one
plus six for the past six months ever
since launch of that particular device
just so you can get a rough idea on how
that device has been
Thank You Eber hope New York is treating
you well because the one plus six has
been treating me so well for the past
six months this has been my daily driver
ever since launch and I couldn't be
happier this is my favorite Android
device to date and it's so funny because
when one plus six came out
we were already joking about the
eventual 60 release because that upgrade
cycle is just too short to be six months
but you can't get into the mindset of
one plus and then kind of thinking like
Apple like one plus six owners will
probably not be upgrading to the 60 but
the one plus five or one plus three
owners will be so that upgrade is
definitely looking to be a much bigger
jump I've always experienced some form
of bugs with one place devices but this
one's no different
the most recent one which keeps on
repeating is the alert slider so when
it's in do not disturb and when I switch
it back to normal
there's like a couple of seconds until
all the notifications just come rushing
in and it's not like the notification
hasn't come through it's just the audio
comes through even though I've already
received a notification so that's really
annoying the fingerprint scanner has
gotten kind of slow where I have to
physically press into it instead of
lightly tapping like I had to on the
first device and for the price the one
plus six is just like an amazing value
and all-around really good performer and
I would compare it to my 10s which is
super fast but I prefer the speed of the
one plus six and that says something
about oxygen OS and the 60 obviously is
going to just fly right through but in
terms of speed and the button tactility
the display the speakerphone the
headphone jack everything has been
working so fine and the only thing that
I would give feedback to oneplus on
future is to improve on the screen
protector the included screen protector
because on my red model which looks um I
guess so so fire right now and hopefully
we'll see more colors than just two with
a 60 but the screen protector here that
I used for video is just completely
scratched up and really poor quality and
I guess it's nice to be included but the
actual screen on the device is pretty
strong it's much stronger than the
really soft things that we see
with the iPhones and yeah that's one of
my complaints for oneplus it isn't
exciting update but why did they have to
remove the headphone jack I don't
understand especially when they were
trolling Apple like two years ago that
they will still you know keep the
headphone jack but I guess that is the
trend now and I really like that
teardrop you know not or can you even
call it a knotch
it's a Drudge all righty bruh so my
experience with the oneplus 6 has been
super satisfactory
aside from minor bugs here and there
like with notifications which is odd I
don't know if it's hardware based or
it's something on a software
miscommunication there but hopefully
we'll see all that stuff kind of like
you know smoothed out with the first
device with the one plus 6t the be quiet
dark Bass Pro 900 revision 2 is here
with the modern IO for your Type C
accessories and Qi charging gadgets the
new hub is good for 8 fans and RGB
strips plus the interior is incredibly
modular for airflow water cooling invert
systems and now with the power supply
shroud check out the v2 down below well
guys that's the one plus 60 and honestly
it's not a major upgrade over the 1 plus
6 I'm pretty sure a lot of you guys saw
this coming eventually but again at 5:49
I think it's priced competitively
because it competes really well with the
pixel 3 the pixel 3 Excel because I feel
like it offers a little bit more
features compared to those devices but
none of the less what do you guys think
about it what do you guys think about
the price point and if you're an
existing one plus 6 owner would you
actually upgrade to the 16 or if you're
coming from something like the 1 plus 3
then 1 plus 3 T or even the 1 plus 5 is
it something or is one plus 60 something
that might be appealing towards you let
me know in the comments down below
I'm Eva with hundred connects thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
