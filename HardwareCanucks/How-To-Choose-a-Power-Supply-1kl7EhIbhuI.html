supply and maybe a case I don't know I
have built coming up later
they have joked about sending me a
pallet with just one case and I hope
they don't because I have no room but
this is this is great to see and walk
around
nice little warehouse hello good people
I'm Dmitry welcome to another video
recently I had a chance to visit a bit
quiets headquarters in Germany it's very
interesting to see how the products are
designed and by whom and how they are
tested but particulars on power supplies
and how they make sure to deliver a
quality product undebatable power
supplies are less exciting than let's
say graphics cards but we as PC users
have this understanding that having a
quality PSU is absolutely crucial and be
quite decided to sponsor this video on
how to choose the right power supply for
you but anything that you hear in this
video can be applied to any power supply
from any vendor this is just an
educational piece just for you of course
their HQ is absolutely loaded with all
types of power supply testing equipment
but one really interesting you know
experiment I got to observe was with a
particular system so they had a cross by
configuration with the AMD 295x2 cards
essentially four GPUs stressed to 100%
with four mark at 4k resolution running
off a 1000 watt power supply and we were
consuming around eleven hundred and ten
watts for this system so that's kind of
crazy now you wonder why somebody would
want a thousand watt power supply
because you got two GPUs that really
want all that power and here's a little
interesting Tim bit after switching the
resolution to 1080p instead of 4k
remember we were running four GPUs in
here and we were running right now at
443 watts so that was pretty fascinating
just to see you know that whole system
consuming 1,100 watts with those cards
but then dropping down resolution and
just how much you know lower power
consumption the whole system became so
that is a perfect segue on how much
power do you actually need many
manufacturers like be quiet have a PSU
calculator on their website to get you
started and this will allow you to put
in your components and do a calculate
how much power is needed the intent is
not to over buy but ensure you
understand that
a bit of extra capacity from your PSU
will certainly help with future upgrades
and then overclocking for example and
this is actually quite important for new
builders because I remember building my
first system like seven years ago and
thinking that I need a thousand watts
for a single GPU system obviously I
wasn't totally understanding what I was
doing back then but just gets you
started and that whole PSU calculator is
a nice guideline just how much power you
need now when it comes to size normally
this is not something to necessarily
worry about as most modern cases have
that nice large and open PSU section but
some smaller cases will not fit large
power supplies like the dark Power Pro
Series even though the case may be able
to fit all kinds of high-end components
I have encountered some incompatibility
with the larger power supply as you need
to insert it on an angle because of the
how the frame is designed on some
smaller cases so that's something to
keep in mind on the other hand some
smaller PSU SFX in particular may not
have the necessary cable length to reach
certain areas in the standard mid tower
full Tower so the happy medium would be
something like this to be quiet pure
power 11 it's 160 millimeters in length
it's semi modular design and available
up to 700 watts next up our cables this
is particularly important to make sure
the cables are long enough to fit your
chosen case and there's usually a cable
length chart like would be quiet for
examples you can see exactly how long
each of those cables are normally with
larger and more premium power supplies
you have slightly longer cables which is
great but I would say like cable lengths
for all power supplies and case layout
have sort of standardized to a point
where you don't really have to worry
about the main connections like a 24 pin
and the 8 pin and the PCIe but I have
encountered sometimes SATA cables not
being long enough to reach certain
sections of the case like if you're
mounting a hard drive on one of the
corners for the cases then it's it might
be a difficult reach and it's usually
quite easy to bunch up any unused length
but for larger enclosures like the dark
base from 900 graph 2 it is best to have
very long cables to make sure to reach
all parts of the enclosure also are the
cables braided or flat I prefer
personally flat cables when working
inside ITX cases or when spacing behind
the
motherboard is very tight while braided
cables generally look better inside the
main chamber but are slightly chunkier
next up is modularity and they have
three different types a fully module
unit examples the be quiet straight
power series every cable can be removed
or added and it's interesting if you
want a PSU with dual eight pins for
future expansion but only need one right
now you do pay more for a fully modular
IO even though you always need you know
a certain cable like 24 pin and the 8
pin CPU cable and most of the time at
least one 6 pin PCI II and the
disadvantage or a fully modular unit in
my example like I don't use 60 to 70% of
all the provided cables with a power
supply and they're just like left in the
back somewhere and number two because of
how the connections are spread
throughout the unit it expands the
length of the power supply next up is a
partially module unit the dark pro
series for example so most use
connections like the 24 pin and the 8
pin CPU and some GPU cables may be
hardwired and can generally cost a bit
less than the fully modular unit the
downfall is that if you don't need some
of those hardwired cables then you will
need to find a place to hide them and
this can be an issue in some smaller
cases and then the non module units like
the system power from be quiet typically
it's the least expensive option so it's
good to remain on a budget you know you
have no module cables and the issues
that you have to find place for a ton of
cables but since everything exits from
one side you're essentially are clearing
up room for long graphics cards if the
power supply let's say is installed on
front the case which happens to be quite
often for ITX systems and actually
prefer using like a non modular power
supply in tiny cases so that I can clear
up some that extra space for usually a
graphics card next up let's talk about
efficiency which is a key element in
choosing a more power supply and
efficiency is determined based on how
much input power is needed to supply a
given output power amount for example
even though your components may require
400 watts and inefficient power supply
may need to draw up to 500 watts from
the wall while a more efficient one may
only need 450 Watts from the wall over
time this can make a big difference and
more efficient power supplies will run
quieter and cooler generally
because less of that power loss is
converted to heat so what we're doing
now is doing power supply efficiency
testing and trying to estimate exactly
how much wattage we'll be consuming with
a gold power supply versus a bronze
efficiency so right now we have a gold
power supply in there we have prime95
running with 4 mark at 100% and we're
consuming just under 300 watts with a
650 watt power supply so we're measuring
exactly how much we're pulling from the
wall so we did just jump over 300 watt
consumption and that is because the
components are getting hot they're
getting less efficient and so now we
switched out the power supply for a
bronze efficiency this one's a 400 watt
unit we are running 8700 km gtx 1070 TI
prime95 on 8 cores so we can fully take
advantage of 100% load or close to 100%
with formwork and hopefully we can see
some efficiency differences between
bronze and the previous one was gold and
so with the bronze efficiency unit we
were pulling close to 340 watts from the
wall instead of 315 watts with a gold
efficiency unit and this was just a cool
experiment to see the power draw
increase as components get hotter and
also that whole efficiency variable
between bronze and gold and how in fact
we were consuming more power from the
wall with a bronze power supply and next
let's talk about the 80 plus
certification so typical efficiency for
power supplies used to look like a bell
curve chart here is you know it's a
dramatization and we use a thousand watt
output as an example but this is what it
shows typically at blow and very high
outputs efficiency is lower there's that
sweet spot somewhere in the middle where
efficiency is the highest and this is
bad because whatever capacity power
supply you have it will only operate at
the peak efficiency at only a slim
output range when it comes to load and
so 80-plus basically says that baseline
minimum efficiency of 80% plus at
different output levels titanium is the
newest and it also adds the minimum
rating of 10% output this is pretty
important for systems that are at idle
you know majority of the time and
usually the eighty plus rating aligns
with that the pricing of the power
supply but not always now let's talk
about something actually quite important
understanding the label this label here
is from the
dark power Pro 850 watts starting with
the AC input at the top it is rated for
100 volts to 240 volts which means it
can be used in both North America and
countries that use the 240 volt power
below that would be DC output what power
supplies do is take your household AC
current and convert it to five different
DC voltages 3.3 volts 5 volts 12 volts
negative 12 volts and 5 vs B we'll talk
about the first three since the five
years B is used for system stability and
negative 12 volts is for some legacy BCI
devices so both the 3.3 volt and 5 volt
outputs are used for SATA and molex
connections some controllers on
motherboards as well as memory it is
able to output about 140 watts to those
3.3 and 5 volt outputs typically you
don't really need that much power for
the 3.3 volts and 5 volt outputs as
modern pcs generally require the 12 volt
power which brings us to the 12 volts
section a high 12 volt value is very
important since your most power hungry
devices like the processor and graphics
card require mostly 12 volt power some
power supplies have a single 12 volt
rail or partition and in the case with
our 850 watt power supply it has
multiple 12 volt rails so neither one is
right or wrong but in the case with our
dark power Pro 850 watts you can see
that each rail has either a 35 amp for
20 watt limit or a 30 amp 360 watt limit
and if more power than that is drawn
from a single rail then over current
protection will kick in the likelihood
of that happening is you know very slim
but it makes sense for overclockers and
really for individuals who are pushing
their hardware to have a single large 12
volt rail so you can really channel all
that power towards that hardware without
having power wattage deficit for that
single 12 volt rail one other thing to
mention is that the over current
protection on multi rail PS use could
protect components in some situations
meanwhile a multi rail design also
follows the ATX spec while single rail
units don't and you can see with this
example almost all of the power supplies
power can be dedicated to 12 volt rail
about 840 watts and that's a good thing
we're in overclocking and making sure
that your main components just get
enough power and this whole label
breakdown is actually quite important
you know maybe check it out next time
you're buying a power supply to see what
type of 12 volt rail configuration has
single large ones or multiple and how
much power can be allocated for the 12
volt in total versus how much is going
through your three point three and five
volt outlets now we're not telling you
which power supply to buy but use all
the guidelines we discussed today to
help your buying decision and you avoid
all the bling like RGB power supply
things and wattage monitoring all the
kind of like useless things for a power
supply because obviously they have to
the cost now the whole efficiency level
for power supply you know that's more
important for high water systems that
are running at load most of the time but
that is not to say that you don't need a
titanium efficiency power supply for
your single GPU system it's just that
the savings that you'll get at the end
of the year before your power bill may
just not be significant but an immediate
benefit of course is that your power
supply will be running cooler and
quieter versus something that is lower
efficiency so big things to be quiet for
sponsoring this video definitely use the
PSU calculator to see how much power
your system really needs versus what you
thought it might need I'm Dimitri
