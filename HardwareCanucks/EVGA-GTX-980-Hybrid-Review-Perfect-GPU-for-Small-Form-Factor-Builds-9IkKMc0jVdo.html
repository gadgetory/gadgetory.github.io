hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Harbor
Canucks
and on the review table today we have a
really exciting GPU allowing enthusiast
users to push the overclocking envelope
- impressive Heights while maintaining
the thermal envelope and the noise
footprint to a minimum this is the EVGA
GTX 980 hybrid first announced at CES
the 980 hybrid is a really exciting card
for today's small form-factor pcs
because of the built-in 120 millimeter
radiator
thus the hybrid between water-cooled GPU
and air-cooled VRMs and the memory and
the rest of the board of course now
pricing wise you are looking at $650
which is actually quite competitive
around the non-reference 980 s clocked
at 14% higher on the base and boost
clock versus a reference card and is
actually the highest clock 980 that
we've seen so far while keeping the
memory speed at 7000 megahertz and to
refresh your memory the 980 is equipped
with 2048 quarter cores 4 gigabytes of
vram features all the latest from Nvidia
including g-sync support game works and
game stream MFA a and D SR or dynamic
super resolution about which you can
find out more here in our video the IO
has not changed we still have a triple
DisplayPort 1.2 output HDMI 2.0 and DVI
it still requires the dual 6 pin for
power and while I appreciate the text
here to reveal the model number there
are no illuminated parts on this GPU and
I think EVGA has missed an opportunity
to add back lights for that little extra
Flair however I am happy to see a
backplate for extra cooling Plus just to
cover the black PCB with proper
orientation of the lettering the shroud
on the card looks fine I still prefer
the looks of the reference 980 but the
inclusion of this 120mm
radiator means much quieter and cooler
operation the tubing is thread covered
and while we haven't told us any fraying
on our sample you'd still want to be
careful with any sharp edges inside your
case to maintain the tubing in pristine
condition the fan cable is routed
alongside one of the tubes and plugged
into an extension that is then routed
into the board of the GPU thus the RPM
is fully adjusted based on the GPU
temperature but this also means that you
can easily replace the included 120mm or
fan with one of your choice and if you
are thinking of placing a second fan for
push-pull system that will have to be
connected separately now you may be
thinking of it's an inconvenience to
find a spot for that 120mm a radiator
inside a case and I would say it's
actually a perfect fit for small form
factors where airflow is limited and
standard blower style would suffer but
here's the 980 hybrid inside the m3 end
case it's a tiny chassis but
accommodates the GPU very well with that
side bracket and here's another example
inside the fan Tech's evolved ITX where
both the GPU and the CPU are water
cooled resulting in an extremely quiet
system and also keeping the noise down
so it's benchmarking time and as
expected the 980 hybrid thanks to its
higher base and boost clocks fits right
in between the tight necks and the
reference 980 it's certainly a 1440p
gaming card that's for sure but it's
when we come to things like frequency
over time where the thermal envelope has
so much Headroom the clocks stay
consistent while you can see the
reference time 80 drops clock speeds and
midway due to the heat and the start of
the show I would say would be the
temperatures that barely reach 40
degrees C under load especially when you
compare it to the reference and the P&amp;amp;Y
card there but also don't forget the
acoustic performance maintaining such
stable thermal footprint and not needing
to ramp up any of the two fans making
this the quietest 980 on the market
and this makes it a perfect segment to
talk about overclocking performance with
our sample reaching and totally stable
its 1620 megahertz on the core so this
is a good two hundred thirty megahertz
over the factory boost clock allowing
you to really close that gap between the
Titan X so without a doubt the EVGA 980
hybrid is an impressively powerful and
capable GPU that handles thermals
acoustics and overclocking like a champ
as long as you can accommodate for that
120 min the radiator inside your case
you'd be completely satisfied with this
damn good card I would like to see
illuminated text on top of the card just
to spice things up but other than that
it's actually quite difficult to find
any flaws and well that concludes our
review of the EVGA GTX 980 hybrid what
do you think are we to see more GPUs
incorporate this water cooling approach
and would you consider installing one of
those all-in-one brackets on your card
