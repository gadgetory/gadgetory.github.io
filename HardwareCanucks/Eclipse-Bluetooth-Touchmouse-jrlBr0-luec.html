of the Eclipse light touch keyboard
we're also going to check out the other
half of the touchline the touch mouse
it's a pretty sleek looking unit that
really doesn't look like any sort of
typical pointing device but it should be
great for travelers that need
portability or someone just looking for
something with specific features so
let's take a quick look the touch mouse
is definitely a little different looking
than most mice for the most part it is
only a couple of centimetres thick aside
from the rounded section at the end the
top has a very executive sophisticated
sort of feel with the brushed aluminum
buttons and of course the touch feature
which replaces the scroll wheel
underneath you have the 1600 DPI laser
the power buttons and the feet for power
the touch most uses only a single double
a battery which fits right into that
rear rounded section now the touch mouse
is a bluetooth mouse meaning you can
have a great connection for up to 30
feet however eclipse does not include a
Bluetooth adapter I guess they're
expecting you to be using this with a
Bluetooth enabled laptop like many are
or otherwise you're going to have to
shell out the extra ten to fifteen
dollars for one of these so the actual
touch feature of the mouse is really
only used for scrolling as you can see
swiping the finger up causes the page to
scroll up and down does the opposite you
can also use gesture commands to do
things like head to your home page use
the browser's back or next functions and
refresh for this you actually really
don't use the touch functionality at all
you press the middle mouse button and
move the most which results in your
desired action so all in all while it is
definitely an intriguing little device
the touch capabilities are a little
overblown pretty stylish mouse once you
figure out how to hold it and the thin
flat design should make it pretty good
for a travel unit it uses laser and
Bluetooth and at fifty to sixty dollars
that's pretty much the going rate for
any mouse with those features and that's
about it guys see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
