Nvidia gigabytes antics and NCIX what's
up guys this is Dimitri and I have found
my favorite yet micro ATX case this is
definitely going to be a new category
for 2017 case awards but this is the n1
301 a much smaller version of the three
or three that is a fantastic case
actually saw this was an ITX enclosure
in the beginning just based on this
relative size comparison to something
like the Nano ads or the Manta ITX but
space efficiency inside the 3-1 is
impressive to say the least
all thanks to the power supply location
at the top pretty much all the unique
elements carry over from the bigger
brother including an all illuminated
front yoke panel this honeycomb
ventilation design on the rear side
panel and simply box this frame that
does not look dated and pretty awesome
stands for enough ventilation or
actually enough elevation for air intake
from the bottom there's a rear exhaust
pin and four PCI brackets and I
absolutely love the Thewlis tempered
glass approach that said some simple
hinges and it's super easy to remove
inside a micro ATX board is installed
below the power supply and I love how
you can do full custom loop in this
small space too with dual fan mounts at
the bottom for intake that from the
looks of it are properly offset from the
board itself the front supports a 240
million radiator but since the front
panel is totally solid that's where the
upside ventilation comes into play but
as you can see this is where all the
cables are concentrated and I'm a little
bit worried about choking those fans and
be just you know affecting air flow in
general and Drive bracket is located in
front the power supply chamber that can
house a three and a half inch drive plus
an SSD
right below it and I really like the
unconventional layout with having a
power supply chamber at the top instead
of at the bottom and I really cannot
wait to get this in for a full review
also the pricing should be below what's
in 1 3 or 3 cost which is about $90 so
expect the 3-1 to be staying in this
affordable price bracket maybe around
like sixty nine to seventy nine dollars
and two more things to mention from in
win include a vertical GPU bracket that
looks so awesome and we can finally
showcase all those lighting zones that
you can never see otherwise of course
the limitation here is that you can only
install a single GPU but from
I can see it is well spaced out away
from the motherboard and attaches
directly to the PCI slot mounting and it
has the flexible extension at the bottom
that connects to the slot on your
motherboard itself which I would assume
is long enough so you can reach any slot
on the motherboard and finally RGB fans
that look very different from anything
else we saw so instead of illuminating
the sign blades for this consistent look
that we see from many brands the blades
on the in wing fans are actually a bit
more reflective so the lighting is a
little bit more flashy and these things
can also be daisy chained together via
these small connector cables that are
sleeve and open up a lot of options for
illumination across many systems and if
they all connect to this lighting hub
which is the size of an SSD which has
PWM control that can be routed into your
motherboard lighting control is
available to the software but this
physical remote is available which is so
much more convenient it is a bit larger
than I want but you can adjust the speed
all the lighting effects brightness and
some other cool functions and so that is
this for our CES coverage making all so
much for the amazing support our regular
programming resumes this week and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
