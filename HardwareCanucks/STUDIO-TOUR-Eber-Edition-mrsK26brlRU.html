my first time
vlogging okay so not really vlog style
but this is going to be an interesting
video because first of all I don't have
a vlogging camera and I'm shooting this
vlog on my c100 so that's definitely
going to be interesting today is a
Friday so I like to keep my workload as
light as possible so I decided to shoot
a setup video for you guys so you guys
can get a rough idea of what I'm working
with
especially space wise between these four
walls you know you know how you write
scripts I shoot video I do my voiceover
work pretty much all the production for
hardware connects from my end takes
place between these four walls I
actually want to point out that I will
be holding the c100 so this is going to
be a little interesting because that's a
heavy camera and I'm definitely going to
have some challenges but let's just see
how it's going to work out the new NZXT
s340 elite what makes it so elite we've
got a gorgeous tempered glass panel
extra view our ports improve tail
management and an awesome magnetic buck
the name is fitting elite features at
the good price s340 elite check it out
in description below ok so this is my
office
I guess you let's actually start with
the filming space this is going to be a
little interesting actually so this is a
white desk actually I picked it from
Ikea it's a glossy finish so I think
when I'm shooting b-roll I wanna shoot
Bureau it has some cool reflections on
the surface and I really like it I'll
actually leave some shots right now so
you can get a rough idea of what I'm
working with obviously this is my tripod
it's they been will tripod that I've
been using for about two years now it's
been holding it pretty well in fact the
screw started to I guess the spring
started to loosen up so I had to tighten
it at some point I think I tighten it up
last week and it's working as if I
bought it yesterday so that's pretty
awesome
so for the fluid head I'm using the
Manfrotto MBH 502 aah
it's been holding up pretty well
actually I mounted my c100 on top of it
it's a daily driver so I don't think I'm
not thinking of replacing anytime soon
it's been with me for quite some time
and I'm absolutely loving using that
this is probably the
interesting stack that I've had ever
it's the pretty much all of GTX ten
series cards the 1072 1062 1050 Ti and
the 1080 from P&amp;amp;Y
so I'm actually looking forward to
filming these cards next week so I
received a gaming chair yesterday and
this is actually the verdict year PL
7000 so that should be an interesting
review that should be coming up very
shortly I'm actually loving it so far
it's um I used to actually tested out
the SL 5000 I think that was a few last
year so this is I think this is their
new series that they're launching and so
far it's been holding up pretty well I
really enjoy sitting on this it's an
actual it's a different experience and
I'm definitely enjoying this stay tuned
for that review as well so this is an
interesting setup first of all I'm
actually thinking of setting up a test
bench over here I'm actually planning to
move away
obviously when that when kb light comes
out I'm definitely gonna replace my main
workstation PC with KB Lake and replace
I'll take all the parts from my current
editing workstation probably put it in
the Infoblox and create a test bench
over here so fantastic GPUs or any
components beasley related components
this is where the testing progress will
take place it's actually an interesting
setup because I don't I'm actually using
this as a filming space too because this
black mouse pad from alpha cool optical
is something that I use I've started to
use this for my filming or from a b-roll
and it works up pretty well so yeah it's
an awesome setup and I enjoy filming
here too and of course we have the bunny
which is the cutest looking thing next
week stay tuned for the review of these
the cooler master master pulse Pro oh my
god this is probably the most ridiculous
pair of headphones that I've ever tested
but I'm not going to be going any detail
or any further detail but yeah check out
the review or - stay tuned for the
review next week it'll be live but yeah
not a fan of those cool master I'm sorry
I guess this could be called as my
storage unit it's a little bit of a
weird setup you know everything that I
review basically comes here
I guess I'm starting to
this collage of boxes I mean I love
boxes so I don't really want to admit
lose them I don't wanna throw them away
so usually I mean there are stuff in it
so I'm definitely not going to throw
them but eventually at some point they
have to start moving out but for now
they work all right time for the setup
so you guys have been waiting for this
but I think it's about time that I
showcase my setup that I use on a
regular basis to produce content let's
actually start with the desk
this is actually an desk that I picked
up from Ikea I think it's collie hmm
good luck Ebert let's actually start
with the peripherals why do we do that
first so first of all I'm using the
white fox this is absolutely amazing I
love this keyboard ever since I started
testing this out I was like I absolutely
fell in love with it the small compact
form factor is amazing I have the review
of that keyboard posted on the channel
so you guys can check it out the massive
choice has been the my onyx AV or 7000
it's an optical mouse I love this I've
been I guess I have a sentimental value
for this mouse because my first video
review for Harbor Canucks was this guy
it was a review of the my onyx AV or
7000 and I guess it's what got me
started on this channel and I'm still
using it so I guess there's a little bit
of a sentimental value there so I'm not
I don't think I'm gonna replace it any
time soon it works great I mean the
sensor is amazing
I love playing battlefield one and
overwatch and Gears of War which I'm not
really a fan of but it's a great Mouse I
really enjoy using this now for my pair
of headphones you guys probably know
this I'm using the bear dynamic DT 990
premium headphones and I kind of hate to
say this but I'm actually driving these
on the focusrite scarlett 2i2 let me
actually zoom in so you can get a rough
idea
it's a terrible setup because first of
all the 2i2
is an absolute nightmare when it comes
to powering these kind of headphones you
really need a good DAC or headphone amp
to power these headphones so I'm
actually planning to pick up the create
something from creative labs or
Mayflower electronics like the o2 DAC or
anything with something something along
those lines to properly power these
headphones but regardless of that
and I really enjoy using these
headphones on a regular basis when it
comes to editing now listening to music
and stuff like that so it's really
awesome I really enjoy listening to
these I also have this headphone stand
it's from spigen so this is what I use
to dock my phone so that way I can
easily you know look at notifications or
any sort of email if I want to respond
or sometimes if I want to watch content
all I do is I just place out in front of
me like this I'll leave it in landscape
mode and the best part about the 6b is
the front-facing speakers so I can just
watch content and it looks pretty
awesome my choice for desktop speakers
or the bose companion 20s you see the
problem with my setup is those two
monitors because they are wall-mounted
or sorry they're mounted to a
traditional base amount I'll talk about
them in a bit but the problem is that
there's no room for a proper studio
monitor so I was looking online I was
looking for probably I was I think I was
researching for about a week or two just
to find it proper set of speakers so I
decided to pick these up
I think they fit properly on my space on
a tight space like tight space like this
and they sound great I mean for a 2.0
setup they sound really good okay now to
the pixels that power the whole set up
so that is a Delpy 2715 q 4k monitor and
the one that's sitting beside it it's
the acer xB 270 hu 1440p monitor now
both monitors have different resolutions
that's 4k and that's 1440p but they have
their own purposes for example I use the
4k monitor for Premiere Pro because I
can get a lot more real estate when I'm
editing in 4k
especially when I'm editing 1080p
footage because my c100 shoots 1080p and
of course the color accuracy on this one
is actually a little better compared to
the AC xB 270 hgu monitor so I prefer
using this for editing in Premiere Pro
after effects ones on this one but I use
this primarily for gaming so if I'm
testing peripherals or hardware or GPUs
or anything like that or if I'm gaming
just for cat casually this is the
monitor that I'm using because it has
the refresh rate is 144 hurts and it's
g-sync so
that is obviously a bonus especially
when you're gaming so I really enjoy
having best the best of both worlds and
it's still a pretty awesome experience
and now on to the workstation PC that's
powering the whole setup this is
something that I just can't stop staring
at every single day because of that
tempered glass for those of you
wondering this is the fantex evolved ATX
tempered glass Edition case I actually
upgraded to this case from my Mpho luxe
that's sitting over there and this is an
absolutely worthy upgrade it looks
amazing it's beautiful it's definitely
something that I just can't stop staring
at like I said one of the things I like
about this case is the build quality I
mean this is rock-solid it's a solid
aluminum plate I mean if you listen to
the sound you can you can tell that
they've taken the premium quality the
next level of course your payment
playing a premium price for that now
specs wise is nothing I guess it is a
kind of old-school but it's still a
beast I've got a 49 30 K overclocked at
4.5 gigahertz and cooling that is an
alpha cool ice bear 240 I've got a GTX
1080 from EVGA it's the superclocked
version and it's running the whole show
and beneath I have two
OCC Rd 400 PCIe drives the first one is
a 1 terabyte hard drive I use that for
my footage and pretty much when
offloading our using Premiere that's the
drive that primarily has been utilized
for reading and writing footage and I
have my drive that's beneath it is a
scratch drive 4 WM Pro and After Effects
and that's pretty much it I mean the
specs are kind of outdated except for
the graphics card and of course if you
are the components but eventually when
kb lake comes out I'm definitely going
to plan to upgrade to kb lake and like i
said before take the parts from my PC
put it on my intellects or maybe a
different case or test bench and use
this as my testing station so that is
definitely going to be an interesting
video so stay tuned for that now if
you're wondering about this little wire
over here
this is actually an LED strip connector
that I use that I connect my fantex
LED strips to to get that blue ambience
over
that side so that's how you get some of
the shots when I'm doing my on camp
stuff you'll be able to see that blue
hindrance or egg is a blue ambient light
on the back and it's a pretty cool
effect so this is what I use and this is
the connector to it so yeah
ghetto setups guys ghetto setups so that
is my first vlogging experiment using
the c100 I hope you enjoyed and if you
have any suggestions definitely leave
them down in the comment section so I
will make sure to check them out I'm
thinking of picking up a smaller camera
before I have to CES when because we're
thinking of doing a vlog content we're
thinking of doing blog content along
with our actual coverage content for CES
so it is something that I need to work
on soon and if you have any sessions for
cameras that are perfect for vlogging
leave them in a comment down below and I
will make sure to check them out I'm
