front of me is what I would consider to
be razors best product ever and so this
is the Razer Mamba wireless mouse with
the Firefly hyper flux combo which means
that they go together as a unit you can
buy them separately but they don't
function the same as when they are
together I feel like everyone's moving
towards wireless peripherals mice
keyboards headsets you know how we have
wired mouse pads but to compensate for
the lack of a cable for the mouse and so
we've seen that implementation from
large deck with their power play stuff
and the Corsair mm 1,000 miles map with
the dark core Mouse so those
implementations are really good and you
can check out my comparisons right over
here but I feel like Razer has really
kind of closed the loop in terms of how
this technology should actually be
implemented for your desk so let's check
it out right after this the new master
keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a
comfortable magnetic wrist rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection Coolermaster
doing it right check it out the law sir
first would be the price man it's really
punch in the gut when you hear about it
two hundred and forty nine dollars I
don't blame you if your turn away from
this video but you probably shouldn't
because while it is among the most
expensive combos for a wireless mouse
and it's charging dock the large tech
power play with the G 903 Lightspeed
Mouse also cost $249 so because we only
have three players that produce this
type of product obviously there is that
chunky price premium whereas Corsairs
approach with the dark core Mouse and
the MM 1,000 miles mat it's really kind
of like around 150 dollars for the set
so that's awesome
but despite the price I feel like razors
implementation here is the best so
size-wise it is smaller than the Corsair
mm ah ow
and it's also smaller than the large
stick power play which is unfortunate
because it's kind of like the most
expensive solution yet it doesn't really
offer that size advantage but I would
say it's kind of the standard you know
size for the desk obviously I would
appreciate something bigger because I'm
actually used to really large mouse mats
where I can maneuver my hand at really
lower dpi for that FPS precision but of
course perhaps the super competitor
scene is not the target audience for
this product so this will be my first
RGB Mouse math man what a sentence but
the ambience strips around it actually
looks beautiful during the evening I
didn't think I would enjoy it as much
obviously this price point you do
appreciate it I do like their
implementation of dual surfaces so one
soft cloth material which I prefer all
my mouse mats have soft cloth and then
we have the hard one if you like more
speed and just kind of sits in this
cavity and it's flush against the frame
so you don't really necessarily feel the
edges and that's appreciate it so what
makes this product so special is the
Razer Mamba Mouse it has no battery
inside unlike all other competing
solutions that can hold a charge for a
while you have to recharge it whereas
this can hold a charge from 10 seconds
off the mouse mat which means that when
it's on the mouse mat it's constantly
getting charged constantly gaining power
so you don't have to worry about the RGB
illumination whereas that's been a
compromise for really draining the
battery on all other solutions whereas
here I mean that's obviously not
necessarily a huge benefit but for like
a really fancy glaring product like that
that's appreciated but the fact that you
never have to charge it so just
constantly getting charged on the mouse
math is awesome and you can actually
hear the little capacitor winding down
as soon as you take it off the mouse mat
like it's no longer holding charge but
when I place it down it wins back the
capacitor and that's what powering the
mouse and that is why the hyper flux is
my favorite wireless mouse because it
gets rid of that inconvenience of
needing to charge it and so it's
constantly just getting power when it's
on the mouse mouth where you'll
constantly use the mouse of course the
lack of any power when it's away from
the mouse mouth could be compromised to
you if you
just take it off and use it somewhere
else but you can use it in Wired mode by
plugging in the cable from the mouse mat
into the mouse one more thing to keep in
mind in terms of the actual area of the
charging so about one inch inwards of
the mouse mat that is where we lose the
capacity to charge so that's something
to keep in mind if you're like really on
the edges you'll have a little bit of
power until the capacitor that is down
but then you'll have to bring in the
mouse back in and there's bought it like
two to three second delay when the mouse
comes back down to when you can actually
start using it when the capacitor starts
to wind up and the one thing that razer
makes abundantly clear with this power
mat is its proximity to a Wi-Fi router
has to be at least one meter away
because otherwise it would introduce
some interference with the magnetic
field that the power math creates but
also you have to be careful with not
placing smart phone on top of this thing
I'm not sure if it's because it might
damage the smart phone or the power mat
but yeah just keep that in mind keep
your smart phone electronics away from
the razor hyperflex
now as for the actual mouse itself 96
grams fantastic body for the right hand
users really nice rubberized grips and
browser buttons are here the primary
left and right clicks are a little bit
on the heavier side but exhibit really
good travel distance the scroll wheel
man it's like a mechanical scroll wheel
it feels amazing like listen to this the
middle click is light enough to press I
always program something to that we also
have side steps for the scroll wheel
which are nicely controlled so you're
not necessarily going to activate any of
the scroll steps the DPI shift is right
behind there nicely accessible and there
is a profile switch right in front of
your thumb plus it's using an optical
sensor performance is just fantastic
landing flicks no issues with control no
spin outs the cloth material is awesome
you can also configure the liftoff
distance inside the software by choosing
the different intervals or selecting the
different material surfaces either the
cloth or the hard one inside the
software and so obviously the main
selling point here would be how the
mouse is charged on
the Powermat versus other solutions
where you need to position it in certain
area of the mouse mouth for the Qi
charging to actually work but of course
you know with the dark core Mouse you
can place it on any Qi charger and
charge it that way so that's awesome
but this mouse is much heavier so I
would not use this for FPS but for you
know if you actually prefer a heavy
Mouse this would be a good choice for
you so this is more targeted for people
who really prefer light mice and it's
also available I think in more regions
of the world versus things from power
play where large tech power play is not
even available in Canada right now
whereas you know only Europe in the US
because of the the charging technology
has not been improved
whereas this stuff available in Canada
no problem and obviously this is a
closed product circle so even Razer does
not have any other mice that support the
Firefly hyper flex charging method as of
yet but I'm assuming that we'll see that
in the future but I really want to see
like the expansion of it and in terms of
charging the keyboard as well by having
a bigger mat and having the similar
technology for your let's say wireless
keyboard and so that's gonna be in like
the next step of expansion of these
wireless charging docks and potentially
maybe more wireless peripherals but I
think we've already exhausted that
height sense mice keyboards wireless
charging mouse mats I don't know and so
what's next Wireless monitors that
actually would be pretty sweet and so
the price point for this combo would be
a huge deterrent for many gamers who
just see that as like just a cash grab
and like ridiculous pricing at 2:49 for
this stuff but obviously Razer is trying
to target those exact people who want
the best wireless mouse mouse mat RGB
combo that is available right now and
yeah they're winning the game and I know
I said this is razors best product and I
truly believe that because I was not
expecting to have such a like a complete
and the perfect experience with
something like this something that's
still growing in terms of charging your
wireless mouse and so I just like their
implementation
the most so guys let me know what you
think of the hyperflex
Mambo and Firefly combo in the comments
below do you agree or do you think this
is ridiculous
and just like completely pointless and
how would you suggest the wireless
peripherals mice keyboards headsets to
move forward within the industry so that
they become a bit more convenient for
users who you know enjoy them on a daily
basis so they don't have to constantly
recharge them and think about battery
life because we already have so many
devices that will constantly have to
recharge and so having one less to worry
about is of course appreciate it so make
