and I've had the P 600 s from Pantex for
about four months now and this has been
my main production machine it's been on
for at least eight hours a day for four
months so it has gotten a lot of air
flow through it and one of the main
concerns from people about this
enclosure has been dust accumulation
over time because of this whole fabric
performance mesh at the front and the
top now I initially wanted to place my
thread per system inside the P 600 s and
fortunately this case does not support
the ATX motherboards which is what my
thread Ripper system is all about
so instead let me show you how I clean
my system and see exactly how dirty it
has gotten on the interior and what has
happened with the fabric mesh and all
the dust filters let's begin
after this the new razor blade still
defines portability without compromising
on performance featuring Intel's latest
agent CPU and NVIDIA MX 150 GPU up to 16
gigabytes of memory and up to 13 hours
of battery life experienced some of the
most popular games wherever you are
learn more about the blade stealth down
below alright so the first thing I will
say is just how happy I am with that
exterior performance mesh surprisingly
it has not been clogged up by dust
particles and it's condition is almost
as they won but I will say the second
layer of this performance fabric is
slightly more grey than the first but
the quick vacuum cleans it up and turns
out that it's the front dust filter that
has accumulated a lot of that dust in
the past four months and it's really
only during this sort of analysis that I
can appreciate a quality dust proof
design not only is the filter flush
against the frame meaning nothing gets
through the sides but both panels have
these rubber seals to close off any
potential dust entrance fear smaller
openings for airflow I got two fans
installed at the front and that is
evident by the dust gradient which looks
hilarious
and again I'm surprised that not more of
these fine particles are stuck to the
more course performance mesh at the
front I vacuumed out the dust filter but
due to the really fine nature of the
threading
I'd recommend washing the filter as well
to remove anything that wasn't picked up
by the suction and now we're basically
back to day one cleanliness of this
front panel now the fan blades collect
dust as well and it's a good indication
of how much
penetrating the front filter I vacuum
the bigger stuff carefully and clean up
each blade with the damp paper towel and
I'm honestly a bit surprised just how
dirty things have gotten in just four
months if that is indication of how
clean my space is then my space is not
very clean and moving inside the dust
adventures continue with a thin layer on
the psuche out and about the same on top
of the GPU that might settle through the
top mesh or get sucked through the PCI
slots
although the back of the case is very
clean so I don't think the GPU fans are
sucking and all that dust also the rear
fan is much cleaner than the front ones
now to clean this I use a damp
microfiber cloth and that is something
you should avoid doing because of the
static that it might create but mine was
wet and I navigate carefully what
surprised me the most horror is how
dirty the radiator was almost on the
same level as the front dust filter and
yes I have used this all-in-one cooler
in another machine for about two weeks
but it spent majority of its time inside
the P 600 s and that is really alarming
it looks like whatever dust find its way
inside the case is sucked through the
top exhaust which is why it gets so
clogged up instead of it coming through
the rear and the best way to clean the
rod fins is not with a vacuum cleaner
like I knew here but with a dust blower
and also looks like because I'm
exhausting through the top the mesh here
is also surprisingly clean like the
front despite all that settling dust and
the last thing I do is a final sweep
with my manual air blower to pick up any
particles around the pump and the GPU
and now my system is fully cleaned up
inside and out and so it turns out to no
surprise that the dust front
accumulation and the clogged up radiator
was a massive airflow bottleneck as we
are now running 10 degrees Celsius
cooler on the CPU at load after the
cleanup and that makes sense
removing a lot of the dust particles
from the radiator and the front and also
the noise profile of the system with
full rpm on the fans it's much quieter
I'm guessing there's less turbulence and
just airflow is exiting and entering
without too much restriction and to be
honest I was expecting the front mesh
and the top mesh to be completely full
of dust of like tiny dust particles
lose its black color given the
distribution of those fine particles on
the interior but I'm guessing a lot of
that dust just goes right through based
on the design of the threading of that
performance mesh and a lot of the dust
is being caught by the actual dust
filter instead McMahon I was not
expecting such drastic CPU temperature
difference it's a good reminder to a
periodic clean your system so it runs
cleaner and cooler and now I have to be
thinking about my thread Ripper system
and what case I should choose for the e
ATX motherboard I wish that the P 600
has supported that's larger motherboard
size but it doesn't so why don't we
decide this together what should be my
next case for that monster Rison system
that have sitting right there and
waiting to chew through the Vinci
resolved and through some games as well
and just prepare for my you know
eventual return back to AMD so let me
know in the comments thanks so much for
watching I'm a Dmitry check out this

love this content and stay clean my
friends your system and you deserve it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
