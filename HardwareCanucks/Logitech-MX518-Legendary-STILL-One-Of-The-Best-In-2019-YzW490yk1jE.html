are fantastic my friend what about the
mic oh this thing is gorgeous okay what
about the mouse or the mouse my friend
this one is legendary and by the way
everything will be linked in description
below thank you very much so yes good
people the mx518 legendary is in the
building this is an upgrade to the
original mx518 from 2011 which was an
upgrade to 2004 MX510 it is a bit of a
nostalgic piece of hardware for many
gamers for me included I remember
wanting to read MX510 that Mike has I'm
sure this can take a hit though if I
drop it and so let me share my
experience with the mouse and include
Michael and Ebert to have a little bit
more diversity in opinion about this
gaming mouse in particular let's begin
right after this the new Razer Blade 15
is a machine for people who know exactly
what they want when you need a reliable
keyboard and one custom lighting when
you need an accurate display and what
insanely fast 144 hertz refresh rate
when you need a portable machine and
want a gorgeous thin aluminum unibody in
the world's smallest 15.6 inch gaming
laptop when you need powerful gaming
hardware to truly dominate with geforce
r-tx the Razer Blade 15 when you need
the power for anything you do and will
nothing to hold you back check out the
configuration you want down below
alright so let's get the basics out
first this is a $59 mouse which is a
super competitive price point it's
competing with like the rival 310 which
is still my favorite Mouse of all time
and it's kind of like slightly below the
G pro from large stick as well that has
the same sensor but slightly different
shape and targeted towards I guess the
professional arena while this covers
that the styl juh Carina instead the
weight is just over 100 grams which is
super nice for me I do prefer lighter
mice around the 80 gram territory but I
would say like for most gamers that the
weight is just perfect it is slightly
lighter versus the original MX510 so
for people who have gotten used to her
heavier Mouse this might be a little bit
too light I love the cable on here even
though it's very thin it's super light
doesn't kink it's not braided which is
nice and it fits into my mouse bungee so
all good as you can see it has this
triple tone texture so plain
black on the sides and this iconic
metallic gradient on the interior
section that goes from dark to light
where the primary buttons are and as
with the original it has that sparkle
texture built-in which may be perceived
as like dust particles if you're like
trying to look at it on the side but it
does not have RGB and I dislike that
glossy G logo in the center I wish it
was matte black as for the buttons
absolutely no complaints here
the primary left and right clicks are
slightly heavier and exhibit a little
bit more travel distance versus my dream
pro the browser buttons feel identical
in terms of their like that feedback and
how they're slightly soft in that end
and they're located in the perfect
position right above your thumb the DPI
shift buttons we have three of them so
we have plus or minus two cycle back and
forth and we have the DPI shift that you
can program to be anything you want so
if you play it 400 dpi you can simply
program one of those dpi levels to that
button and that is your particular
setting for whatever you do but the
weakness here is the scroll wheel first
of all the steps are not as defined as
the G Pro Wireless or the G Pro and
second of all it's way too low in the
body so when I'm trying to press it
which I normally use for us to talk
immune occation I always activate one of
the DPI shift buttons now as for the
shape obviously that's quite subjective
but I still prefer the comfort level of
the G Pro the G pro Wireless and the
rival 310 the left side for me feels
fantastic and while I've got me used to
the slightly larger hump on the top here
versus my other mice the one thing that
kills it for me in terms of comfort is
this right side so there's this Ridge
over here that supposed to I guess
somehow fit your maybe ring finger right
below it but my ring finger doesn't go
below it it goes right on the ridge and
I can feel it it's not natural for me
especially coming from other mice that
have that whole area either smoothed out
or have a nice curvature so that my hand
can comfortably sit in that section so
just be mindful of this right side
because from my hybrid claw grip I just
don't know where to put my ring finger
and it's constantly on that Ridge which
I wish was smoothed out and that's for
performance obviously they had to update
it with a hero 16k sensor which is the
same sensor found on the GPO Wireless
the G Pro the updated logitech g502 hero
it's fantastic absolutely no
acceleration true one-to-one tracking
throughout the entire dpi range up to
16,000 dpi which is crazy but the
technology is there so that there is no
filtering no interference of the sensor
is just like raw performance and that is
incredible if you like to play at 400
dpi or above 8,000 dpi you will be
satisfied as for gaming performance I
still prefer the G Pro it gives me a
little bit more freedom of movement it's
a slightly smaller Mouse and has nice
curves at the bottom so when I do pick
up the mouse for readjustment because I
play it 400 dpi
I feel like this thing feels larger and
heavier so that I have to increase my
dpi to have a little bit more control so
the shape here is not a hundred percent
for me but in terms of sensor
performance obviously it is incredible
oh I should say in legendary so having
listened to me all this time let's hear
what Michael and Abraham to say so
basically my history behind this is the
MX510 I've had this since the day it
was released it was about 15 years ago
now it's working still like a champ
I also had the at the older mx518 from
the day it was released unfortunately
that died about a year ago so I was
super super happy to see this but my
opinion is really biased because I'm
used to the forum now for the last 15
years these aren't the only mice that
I've been using but coming back to the
mx518 legendary because I didn't have my
mx518 for a while it's like coming back
to an old friend my my hand is used to
it but at the same time I can understand
how people would feel this is really
really uncomfortable now that I'm
noticing it it is a little bit
uncomfortable if you're not used to it
so personally speaking I haven't
actually tried the older mx518 because
I don't think I hear too young I was you
know having used the g403 as my primary
mouse for pretty much everything that I
do including editing and gaming just
switching over to the the mx518 the
first minute notice is just it's a
little bit uncomfortable that because
there's a lip on the right hand side of
the mouse that slides with my ring
finger so it doesn't kind of go in as
flush as it would compare to the g43 I
don't see myself adjusting to PM X Y V
Tina things for me in a long term the
other thing that I'm not too crazy about
with this don't get me wrong
I absolutely love the mouse it's the
fact that it's a little bit light for my
liking I like heavier mice I like the
accuracy of them but I'm really happy
with the sensor I'm really happy because
the older mice didn't have proper
working software under Windows 10 so I
love the fact that this is back on the
market but it has its limitations and as
for the software you do everything
through G hub so you can configure your
macros you can reassign all the buttons
obviously we have this entire dpi range
and that orange DPI shift button don't
forget about that and if you go into the
gear icon you can save all those
settings to the memory on the mouse
itself so you can carry the settings
with you and don't need the software and
so in conclusion for $59 the mx518
legendary isn't needed upgrade I'm glad
they put in the 16 K sensor in there but
I wish that they would redesign the
structure a little bit on the right side
and also change the scroll wheel to
include the same scroll structure as the
G pro which is leaps better and the
thing that I'm hoping for would be a
wireless edition of this Mouse with a
slightly redesigned write structure and
change scroll wheel and obviously
redesign internal frames so that it
could be lighter and enter the you know
the the G pro Wireless sort of not
competition but diversity because I feel
like many people still like the shape so
yeah that is our review of the mx518
let us know the mouse you're rocking and
if this thing you know rings any bells
if you recall the original mx510 I'm
