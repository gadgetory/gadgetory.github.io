is brought to you by and see IX
technology connected right here r9 290x
lightning this is the next generation of
the Lightning card that we have designed
we remove the GPU reactor for this one
yeah so the reason why we do that
because we want it we knew that AMD does
it have a cap on the overclocking so
that's why we even though they have 28 8
28 pins required but the six pin is
actually optional so you don't have to
plug it in you only the only reason why
you wouldn't want to plug in if you're
really going to do like more extreme
overclocking because it gives me the
more power okay now can he's also a
little bit more about this heating of
the fan of rape because this is probably
one of your most innovative cooling
solutions correct yeah so with the first
generation 780 lightning that we just
recently did that we have like about
seven or six super pipes right so now we
reduce the superpipe 24 here and maybe
one there so that's five super pipe but
then we increase the fins and the
thickness so that the air flow will be
actually better yeah and it'll be more
balanced on the way to like and taking a
look at this let's see meaning for like
the smaller fan and center so the reason
why we had the smaller fan is that we we
want to do like a fan control so the 25
the two sides and the headed own
controller and the middle one it has old
fan controller too yeah that is one bad
ass card and taking a look at some the
other one C of the 270x here as well too
with the new and innovative that's the
twin frozer for yeah that intro so forth
I like about this let's listen Ritter
this one is the first and only right now
in the market the 760 ITX card so
there's no other manufacturer have
produced 768 X and especially for this
card the reason why is really good is
one thing is that it retained the clock
speed and the performance as the 760
reference card but it has a smaller size
and more compact so it's really good
with the calm bowling with the you know
z87i gaming motherboard that we sell and
also it has a special fan of this is
called a radix friend so when this fan
starts spinning it'll air flow will
actually spread out to like all
different size instead of just no one
side or back so this is actually
something new yeah that's really going
the parable up is roughly about the
exact same right yes exactly the same
with eight mins so this that's uh you
know what for your ITX gamer I think
that'd be one hell of a good option
especially if you want to go for like
one of those that like really small
form-factor rigs I think that was dmos
yes definitely that's something that you
want to go with with this card and also
our gaming motherboard and you know a
lot of people are testing it and they
say it's pretty good combo together yeah
awesome well guys we've taken a look at
some incredible GPUs some brand new
motherboard technology that is coming
out featuring Kaveri CPUs and yeah
that's that's pretty much it for MSI
today guys make sure that you go and
