delivering some of the best consumer
oriented cases that fit the bank and do
the job right it was almost two years
ago when Kula master upgraded the half
series with the introduction of the full
tower the half X that was leaning
towards enthusiasts and water coolers so
today we're looking at the newest
addition to the half series behalf XM it
is meant to close the gap between those
who appreciate the industrial look of
the case but don't necessarily agree
with the size or the price of the half X
so in essence the case displays many of
the impressive qualities of the half X
but in a smaller form but the release
price of $130 while it is considered to
be a mid tower the chassis is fairly
large perhaps a new category should be
created that fits somewhere in between
the fool and the mid size range the half
X M carries with it the common
aggressive characteristics found on all
the half series with a combination of
plastic and steel for construction kill
master managed to deliver a solid case
throughout so let's take a closer look
for the front panel connections we have
the audio ports USB 3 and USB 2 ports
USB 3 connecting through the internal 20
pin cable and unfortunately no adapter
is included located at the top are the
power button LED switch for the front
fan and a reset button the front panel
has three optical drives with built in
dust filters below which two hot swap
drives are located an excellent addition
for any enthusiasts that supports both
2.5 and 3.5 inch drives the panel is
easily removable just don't forget to
take out the hot swap base first and it
also has a built in dust filter for the
front intake cooler master includes a
200 millimeter fan with mounting holes
for dual 120 or a single 140 millimeter
fan so plenty of fan sizing options to
suit your configuration moving back to
the top a neat little feature is this
top pocket with a rubber insert that
acts as a non-slip surface excellent for
storing USB keys and other small items
to get rid of some of that table clutter
and the top panel can easily be removed
with just one thumb screw and has a
built-in dust filter and allows for the
fans to be installed above the steel
frame a welcome sight for water
coolers the half XM comes equipped with
another 200 millimeter fan with many
other cooling options available such as
installation of a second 200 million fan
for extremely powerful exhaust or a dual
120 and 140 million their fans are
supported perfect for dual radiators at
the back we have water cooling holes and
exhaust fan ion slot a PCI slots plus
the vertical one for accessories and a
bottom mounted power supply
unfortunately without an easily
accessible dust filter and the chassis
is elevated with pre-installed case feet
that allows for ventilation for that
power supply both of the side panels are
not flat and have these pop outs to
allow for easier cable management in the
back and installation of fans to the
side panel without interference with the
internals getting inside the 1/2 X M has
been made extremely simple and is now
more convenient with this latched handle
the side panel is solid and supports an
optional 200 millimeter fan or dual to
140 million fans and the removable dust
filter is also provided the chassis will
also be available with a side window for
those who want to show off the internals
and starting it from our usual spot the
optical base user to list mounting
mechanism below which the internal ports
for the two hot swap bays are located
and the hard drive cage that can mount
six drives using a toolless bracket with
SSD support the top half of the cage can
be disassembled to allow more clearance
for the front intake and the caged wall
can also mount a single 120 millimeter
fan that would help in the thermal Dept
directing the airflow straight into your
graphics card additional cutouts are
also available to route any small cables
that would come in very handy on the
other side we have a large CPU cutout
with the rubber grommets around the
motherboard tray to accommodate for all
the wiring and this sliding power supply
cover which seems to become the staple
for the half series and is really useful
to hide all the cables coming from the
power supply the cover can slide based
on the length of your power supply but
must be removed prior installation now
one disappointing aspect of such a
promising interior is the dust filter
for the power supply it is placed
directly
the power supply removal of which
requires plenty of work just to clean
the filter and in the market we're
easily accessible dust filters are
becoming a must Coolermaster needs to
step it up it's a minor drawback that
really shouldn't be overlooked in the
future at the back of the case the large
back plate opening should come in handy
when replacing coolers and all the
rubber grommets are placed appropriately
especially the enlargement at the bottom
very handy for hassle-free cable
management with plenty of cable tie
notches for all the wiring and one cool
little feature is the ability to mount
the single 2.5 inch drive right behind
the motherboard tray and says these are
still pretty pricey and many use only
one drive as a boot drive leaving more
room for the 3.5 inch drives for the
hard drive cage so beginning with the
assembly the cutout below the
motherboard comes in quite handy
especially for routing those audio
cables and putting back the power supply
cover the system looks clean and even
with non modular power supplies all the
excess cables can simply be hidden
the case will have no problem supporting
the longest cards in the market even
with the fan installed onto the hard
drive cage this means all the drive
mounts can be utilized without any
hardware limitations as you see our 11
half inches card still has plenty of
clearance between the fan so the 1/2 X M
is quite impressive
coolermaster has yet again delivered an
outstanding chassis suited for
enthusiasts the essence of the half X is
felt throughout with indeed the high
airflow design both for air and water
cooling the build quality is nothing to
complain about and internal hardware
limitations are none so the case is
ready for practically anything
and lastly cool masters pricing for this
high-end mid tower is just right
entering the market at a really
competitive price the only flaw we see
with this case is the placement of the
power supply dust filter that is not
accessible when the system is assembled
and it'll be frustrating removing the
power supply just to get to the filter
and as with every case in the half
series the rough industrial looks may
not be to everyone's taste but thumbs up
for kou masters damn good and damn good
value case keeping up the tradition with
practical and affordable chassis thank
you guys for watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
