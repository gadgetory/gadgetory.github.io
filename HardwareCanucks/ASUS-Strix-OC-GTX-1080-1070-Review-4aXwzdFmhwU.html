today we have something that's been a
long time coming
so far we reviewed quite a few gtx 1080
and 1070 cards from the likes of EVGA
ZOTAC MSI and gigabyte but we finally
have some asus rog GPUs in the house I
know this little view is a little bit
late because one of these cards took a
whole round trip across North America
and I'm only getting them right now
creativity is fueled by the best
instruments it doesn't always come easy
and in the process you often realize how
important quality is the Rd 400 by OCC
gives you quality and speed with M de tu
interface the Shiban and flash and a PCI
bracket making it possible to focus on
what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty the subjects of this video are
the Strix OC versions of the 1080 and
1070 and it's too bad were only getting
them right now since I think there's
some of the best around but I'll get to
that later and for the time being let's
look at the specs starting with the 1080
weighing in with the boost speed of 1936
megahertz this card surpasses pretty
much every competitor clock speeds even
though pricing remains quite fair at
$719 just twenty dollars more than the
founders Edition and thirty dollars less
than the MSI GTX 1080 gaming Z that are
reviewed few weeks ago that's pretty
impressive and it points towards Asus is
competing mindset as for the gtx 1070
GPU it's very much like its bigger
brother in fact it has extremely higher
clock speeds but actually costs less
than something like the zotac amp
extreme it's one of the fastest gtx 1070
s currently available even though it
costs $10 more than the founders Edition
there's actually a reason why I wanted
to group these two cards into one review
even though they come from very
different price points asus has
literally used the same components for
both at least on surface of things both
use a CSS new direct cu3 heatsink which
has several LED strips integrated
directly into shroud and houses triple
80 millimeter fan
which use a unique triple wing blade
designed to increase airflow while
lowering noise what you can see below is
the heatsink itself which has heat pipes
that make direct contact with a GPU
score this is supposed to boost cooling
efficiency but with a core as small as a
GP 104 s it may be challenging for ACS
is designed to make complete contact the
temperature results will certainly be
interesting moving your onto the sides
some of the differences between the two
cars becomes evident the gtx 1080 uses a
six plus eight pin power layout while
the 1070 which needs less current has a
simpler single eight pin both should
allow plenty of overclocking Headroom
provided a surges software allows for it
one of the most unique additions to
these cards is actually hiding
underneath the heatsinks outer edge and
the PCB if you don't know where they are
you likely miss them but there's a pair
of pwm controlled for pin fan headers
with these you can connect system fans
which will then be controlled via the
cards built-in fan controller rather
than the motherboard I'm not sure if
this will be beneficial since most users
will want their chassis fans to help
regulate processor or ambient
temperatures but it is still an
interesting addition for anyone that has
system fans dedicated to direct GPU
cooling the back side of the card
contains a full coverage backplate with
asus logo that's illuminated with some
internal LEDs and some cutouts for some
additional vrm components you'll notice
that the gtx 1070 has less of these
secondary capacitors but that's to be
expected since I've already mentioned
its core and memory needs less power
current I should also mention now that
the 1080 Strix has a huge eight plus two
phase PWM while the 1070 Strix is still
well equipped with a six plus one phase
layout speaking of LEDs Asus uses a
stand-alone software to control both the
front and a back LED zones on this card
there are several options and the full
RGB color spectrum to choose from but
there are some limitations too I really
do wish both the front and the back
zones were to be controlled individually
and it would have been nice to have this
application rolled into Asus GPU tweak
software rather than being loaded as a
separate app however it is still easy to
use it and gets the job done pretty well
the IO is also pretty interesting since
it doesn't stick to invidious reference
design and
it houses a single DVI connector two
HDMI 2.0 ports and two DisplayPort 1.4
outputs supposedly this makes it more
compatible with upcoming VR headsets
which is a nice addition if you are
looking into making a jump to a virtual
gaming environment so now with all that
out of the way let's get into those
benchmarks which you've all been waiting
for
you
and as you can see boats tricks OSI
cards provide much better performance
than the founders edition and comparable
frame rates to other custom GTX 1080 and
GTX 1070 options while the differences
aren't extreme a few extra frames per
second here and there for the cards that
cost less than their competitors is
impressive to say the least there's a
good reason for that impressive
performance the asus card delivers
consistent frequencies regardless of how
long they are used the GTX 1080 does get
a bit hotter than its little brother and
its fan speeds are quite a bit higher
but that's we expected given its more
powerful core more importantly both
cards were able to grant either equal or
better temperatures than some more
expensive options absolutely incredible
this is an interesting result given the
low temperatures here let's actually
have a listen to the cards
on one hand the GTX 1080s tricks OC is a
bit noisier than some competing
solutions but the gtx 1070 version is
whisper quiet it seems like asus wanted
to maximize their high-end cards
frequencies while sacrificing a bit in
the acoustics department but will you
actually hear a difference between any
of these when gaming likely not
overclocking may be an inexact science
but one thing is certain here both
districts OC cars achieve the highest
clock speeds we've ever seen from GT x
1080 and gtx 1070 so far it's not like
Asus is offering anything unique here
either since a power limit of 120% it's
pretty much the course among higher-end
Pascal cards maybe this point towards
better bidding for the upgraded
components making a difference you never
know since Nvidia launched their Pascal
architecture we reviewed quite a few
custom cards and many of them have
performed great but I have to say that
the Asus GTX 1080 and 1070 cards are
among the best even though they cost
less than some competing solutions the
temperatures the overclocking results
and the performance literally everything
but step ahead of the table it is almost
impossible to find anything wrong with
them so much so that we're giving these
are damn good value award they should be
at the top of the list when you're
considering buying high-end NVIDIA GPUs
but what do you guys think about these
issues cards are there any alternatives
that you might be interested in let us
know in the comments down below
I'm Ivar with hurrican decks thank you
so much for watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
