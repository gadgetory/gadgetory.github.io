and welcome to our 2018 Computex
coverage here at taipei our first stop
was at an asus meeting because they
officially unveiled the rog smartphone
yes we are looking at a smartphone
designed by the Republic of gamers or
under the Republic of gamers by Asus and
this brings up a lot of questions
because for one you know the smartphone
market is pretty saturated in 2018 and
the point of launching a smartphone
designed for gaming is definitely
interesting I'd love to see where Asus
is taking the direction to of course see
what their outcome is at the end of the
year because you know we've seen
companies like razer come up with a
razer phone which was it sort of sparked
the whole gaming centric smartphone last
year and now we have Asus with the ROG
film but before we get to that huge head
out to fan tax Thermaltake and
Coolermaster for sponsoring our Computex
2018 coverage okay so why a gaming
smartphone well the RG phone is actually
targeted towards a niche market someone
who's looking for a specific feature of
that gaming device someone who finds a
certain feature impressive or attractive
that they just you know appreciate so I
don't think this is gonna perform or
it's gonna beat the flagship smartphones
that are currently in the market in 2018
but like I said it is it comes with some
exclusive features I think Asus is just
showing a bunch of features at your face
with the ROG phone and I think some of
the cool features of this phone are
pretty interesting so let's dive into it
from a design standpoint well expect the
aggressive gamer centric elements given
that this is an ROG device I mean take a
look at the back clearly this does not
look like your typical average flagship
smartphone there's Gorilla Glass back
that's a fingerprint magnet and super
slippery but the mainframe is
constructed out of metal you also get
these super cool aggressive design
elements at the back as well the
fingerprint reader is located at the
back it is fairly easier to reach but
it's designed in an odd way it really
purposes form over function and of
course we all saw this coming the
implementation of RGB lighting yes this
is the last thing that we all wanted a
smartphone
kidding this is not what we wanted but
hey if you are someone who wanted RGB
lighting um smartphone
I guess the RGS phone is probably
something that you want to look into
because that lighting the back supports
aura and you can go through certain
effects like you know rainbow color
static stroking effects and whatever you
need to and you can customize that
through the app center that's built into
Android now considering that the RGB
logo is a showcase piece I think 99% of
the time you would be covering that with
your hands so it really wouldn't make
any sense if you want to showcase that
RGB goodness when you're outside walking
down the streets or if you're in a you
know lower situation where you just want
to showcase your phone that comes with
this splash you aren't you be lighting
so that is something to keep in mind but
again if you're someone who's again
looking for art should be letting in a
smartphone I guess this is it the ROG
phone comes with front facing speakers
and they have decided to not eliminate
the headphone jack so kudos to Asus for
that now getting into the specs this
thing comes with a snapdragon 845
processor with a sustain clock speed of
2.9 6 gigahertz and they've been able to
achieve that through an advanced wafer
chamber design with a copper heat
spreader and the carbon cooling pads
within the chassis pretty impressive and
the idea behind this was to deliver the
best possible cooling to achieve the
highest sustained CPU and GPU
frequencies it comes with 8 gigabytes of
RAM 128 gigabytes or by talking about
save on board storage remember 512
gigabytes of on-board storage on a
smartphone is just insane I don't think
an iPhone 10 can go as far as 512
gigabytes so a SUSE is really stepping
things or they're definitely taking
things to another level another
impressive feature of the ROG phone is
the battery capacity so it comes to a
four thousand milliamp hour battery with
support for Asus hyper-charged quick
charging that can be done through the
side custom USB C ports speaking of
which is an interesting addition to the
ROG phone you see normally we're used to
seeing a single USB type-c port on a
device and sometimes you know you might
end up using that types of device to
adapt a frequent from our headphone jack
with smartphones that don't come with
one but the Origin phone you're getting
three of them so the two custom USB
type-c ports you also get your headphone
jack and of course a single type C port
at the bottom for charging the device so
issues has designed this to work with
different accessories that ROG has also
launched along
the smartphone for example visit arrow
active cooler is a detachable fan
equipped cooler that cooks onto the
phone and is powered by these side USB
ports the fan can be controlled via the
Asus Game Center half and it also
happens to come with RGB lighting and
just so you know this is included with
the device the mobile desktop dock is
pretty straightforward basically it
allows you to connect external displays
up to 4k resolution and the phone can be
used as an accelerator display so you
can have your game play on the main
display and perhaps the mobile display
up to view stats or other things like
that which is pretty cool I should also
mention that you can plug in other
peripherals like a mouse keyboard
Ethernet and check this out they also
included a full size SD card reader
that's pretty amazing next up we have
the game vice controller and it actually
makes the whole setup look like a
portable console it comes with
integrated physical buttons and triggers
for an enhanced gaming experience there
is an integrated magnet for easier
storage it feels pretty good in the hand
but a little flimsy because it doesn't
come with proper grip support asus has
also included a YG dock that allows
transportation of display signal via the
802 dot 11 ad wireless protocol to a TV
or monitor lasts accessory to cover here
is the twin view dock consider this as a
Nintendo DS or a dual screen mobile
gaming device it sports a six inch
AMOLED display that looks identical to
the ROG phone but it's built into the
unit it also has a six thousand milliamp
hour battery so when you dock the ROG
phone that features a four thousand
milliamp hour battery you're looking at
a 10,000 milliamp hour monster of a
portable gaming console given that this
is a handheld device asus has
implemented to trigger buttons as well
as enhanced cooling solution to cool
this monster now just here where all
these accessories are being sold
separately from the ROG phone with the
exception of the arrow active cooler
that loge clip attachment that goes with
the cooler that provides active cooling
for the device and Asus hasn't given any
confirmation in terms of pricing for
both the accessories and the ROG phone
as of right now but they are expecting
it to launch sometime between July and
September of this year so and they are
and they've told us that the pricing
would be the device would be right on
par with some of the Android Flash's
smartphones of 2018
my guess would be somewhere in marks of
like I don't know
99 or something on that price point if
it's even lower than that great because
you're looking at an absolute spec
monster of a device from Asus but yeah
I'm curious to see what this thing would
cost coming back to the ROG phone I just
want to go over something pretty
interesting in terms of the gaming
features that they've integrated within
the device you see the lack of physical
gaming buttons is often thought as
limitation for smartphone gaming Asus
took another approach here by
engineering the ROG phone or landscape
mode gaming they added something called
air triggers which are ultrasonic touch
sensors that act as left and right
triggers at the top of the display when
gaming in landscape mode there's another
one which can be used in portrait mode
as well and I think this is pretty
awesome the air triggers are fully
programmable for any on-screen action
and since they are engaged by our index
fingers your thumbs will be freed up for
other things think of this as a virtual
buttons over your typical tactile ones
that come with the controller it would
certainly take a while to get used to
but I'd love to test it out if I get the
opportunity to review one sometime this
year now considering that the RG phone
is a smart phone you should expect some
sort of camera implementation so what
they've done is implement a 12 megapixel
and an 8 megapixel dual camera system at
the back and of course I guess this is
expected because it's 2018 you gotta
have two cameras so it is interesting
I'm not exactly sure what type of sensor
they're using but of course I'm not mics
I'm gonna keep my expectations pretty
low because Asus hasn't been quite up
there in terms of smartphone quality or
smartphone camera quality so yeah if I
get my hands on with this device I'll
definitely make sure to test on the
camera now a few things that you may be
a little disappointed is of course a
lack of support for wireless charging
and water-resistant rating like IP 67 or
IP 68 it has some sort of resistance but
it doesn't feature or doesn't have that
IP 68 standard just like what you find
with other smartphones like you know the
pixel to so that's something to keep in
mind it could be a deal-breaker for some
of you out there but you know what
overall I think you know the RG phone is
an interesting device again like I said
in the beginning of this video
Asus has just jam-packed a bunch of
features on this device it is a flagship
or it's a suspecting monster I mean
you've got a gigabytes of RAM a
Snapdragon 840 processor that can be
sustained at higher frequencies is
probably the world's fastest chipset on
it
vice and it's got four thousand money at
our battery which is insane considering
you know the size of the device so I'd
love to hear your thoughts on the RG
phone what do you guys think about it
of course the different accessories that
come along with it are you a fan of the
RGB lighting implementation is it
something that you expected this year in
2018 again love to hear your thoughts in
the comments
I meet up with Henry connects thank you
so much for watching stay tuned for more
Computex coverage here in Taipei and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
