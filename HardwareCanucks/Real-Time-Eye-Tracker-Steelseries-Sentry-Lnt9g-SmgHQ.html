two-time case of the Year winner fantex
the always incredible Corsair and NCIX
so it's been a while since we really
have seen a revolutionary step in gaming
for the past two years the oculus rift
has been the ultimate showstopper when
it comes to the potential of really
changing how we game or even use our pcs
so with that said the SteelSeries
century has us as excited for the future
of gaming as the rifted when it was
first announced originally built as a
training tool for gamers this eye
tracking device has exciting
applications even beyond gaming launched
earlier this week with a twitch
streaming event plus a plethora of
well-known streamers took this
revolutionary product online to show how
it worked so after a quick calibration
procedure that can take into account two
glasses prescription and even contacts
the sentry tracks where your eyes are
focused on the screen it is very
impressive but how accurate the tracking
is and of course given you remain within
the range but natural movement the
side-to-side heads way is totally fine
and it will track just as well it is
attached to the monitor via a magnetic
strip and it is USB powered but more
importantly for the eSports community it
will allow for addition of another
important analytical layer for
evaluation for example those who
livestream their gaming sessions will
now be able to not only show off their
styles of gaming but also through the
way they view the map the way they
interact with a screen and their entire
decision-making process will be visible
for the viewer
so in general it delivers an even more
transparent and product for
live-streaming gaming however for the
majority of us won the game it will
allow us to track how much time you
spend looking at certain areas of the
screen and so we can make adjustments to
improve based on those results there's
still no word on how or if this tech is
going to work its way into other
products but we are one thousand percent
certain that quite a few industries
would be waiting with bated breath
