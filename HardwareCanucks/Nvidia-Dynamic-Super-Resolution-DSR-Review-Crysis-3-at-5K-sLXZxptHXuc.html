great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Jara
Canucks and in today's video we'll be
taking a look at invidious DSR or a
dynamic super resolution and this lets
users with Nvidia Maxwell GPU render
their game or their desktop even at a
much higher resolution but downscale
that rendered image at to their native
resolution of their display so say you
have a 1920 by 1200 monitor and what DSR
allows you to do is render your game at
multiple factors of your native
resolution everything from one point to
X - 4 X meaning you could be rendering a
game at a much higher resolution like
3840 by 2160 but down scaling it to
1080p
therefore receiving a more detailed
picture especially visible within
elements like grass where edges are
smoothed out and we'll be taking a look
at the bunch of GPUs and their potential
for higher resolution rendering to give
you an idea of this is something that
you can try given you own one of these
GPUs starting from the gtx 960 we have
the 970 to 980 and a Titan X so first
off to enable DSR you must go into the
video control panel manage 3d settings
and check off all the DSR factors that
you wish to experiment with I've
selected here the one point - 2 X + 4 X
of my native resolution of 1920 by 1200
the DSR smoothness slider just sharpness
of the downscaled image that's by
default set to 33% and here the extremes
of 0 and 100% smoothness and I prefer to
leave it at 15% for the best-looking
image to me when you upscale in non even
factors and you can even see the 100%
smoothness looks even softer on the
edges then the native 1200 peak capture
and so once you select your desired DSR
factors and smoothness percentage all
that's left is jump into a game and bump
up that resolution as Nvidia drivers
enables this so there's no further
tweaking required and I've really been
pixel peeping to see exactly what the
difference is with using DSR and I'm
very impressed with the amount of extra
detail that you can pick up for example
here is B of 4 with native 2x + 4 X DS
sar side-by-side and notice how the
edges on the gun are more defined but I
think it's the background elements that
become more detailed especially with the
trees here's another view of the scope
and that triangle is much sharper along
with those edges on the wood and overall
the scene looks much cleaner and
detailed in the distance now this isn't
particularly something you would fully
notice with fast-paced gameplay but for
games like trying to we're getting that
extra detail for a more beautiful
scenery just makes gameplay more
enjoyable and 2d games like valiant
hearts where DSR emphasizes the detail
on the objects in the game without
significantly impacting performance
StarCraft II looks gorgeous with 4x DSR
effectively playing in 4k so the detail
on that command center is so much more
defined if you look at the logo above
the entrance Bay all the edges are super
smooth jumping into watchdogs and look
at how much cleaner the speed limit sign
becomes along with more defined edges on
the background on the buildings and
Aiden himself like his hair and his
clothes are extra emphasized another
example where DSR glory comes into view
is divinity original sin a title that
I've been playing often lately it gets
immediate detail boost for my liking and
once you try this resolution upscale for
titles that you love it will be
difficult to go back to the native
resolution so you might be thinking okay
Dimitri you've convinced us the DSR does
give you the benefit of improved image
performance so the edges become smoothed
out everything much clearer as much
crisper much cleaner but what does that
do on your performance and that's a
little caveat with DSR because you are
effectively rendering that image in 4k
resolution or how many ever factors that
you want to render that resolution from
your native resolution and therefore it
is taxing on your system so unless you
are playing all the titles the daunt
that are not very demanding
then DSR really shines through because
you can still have an enjoyable
experience to getting really good frame
rates at a high resolution for the games
but if you are playing triple-a titles
then DSR will be
kind of a little bit tricky because you
have to have either a beefy GPU or beef
the entire system in order to render
everything in much high resolutions and
you know to get the best experience out
of the SR so let's take the least
powerful card out of the bunch the GTX
960 and see how it handles 2x and 4x DSR
for my 2560 by 1440 P display and see
how much it can eat games like Starcraft
2 with 4x no problem
same with dota 2 where there is a
significant decrease in framerate from
our native resolution but still not
enough to spoil the entire gameplay 40
fps is not terrible but you can lower
some of the in-game settings to maintain
that resolution to get better framerate
and other not too demanding games
certainly benefit from the extra detail
without impacting playable performance
like Crysis 3 here's for XD s are from
2560 by 1440 giving us effective
rendered resolution of 50-120 by 2880 no
big deal
60 FPS no problem I'm just kidding but
check it out the quality is just insane
so say you own a 1440p display so is DSR
for you I would say definitely try it
because you could experience a better
image quality with higher resolution
rendering being down scale to your
native resolution and 2560 by 1440 P
already looks very clean and crisp but
having the ability to upscale that to X
and have that resolution that makes
things just extra cleaner and all the
edges are just a little bit extra
emphasized is very much appealing but as
long as your system can handle it for
example I've been playing the
borderlands pre-sequel at 2x no problem
from the 2560 by 1440 P which has been
giving me a little bit extra detail in
the game because it's not too demanding
and I can also tone down some of the
settings like anti-aliasing within the
game to get the best possible framerate
and I also like to mention how GeForce
experience is an integral part of
getting best gaming experience out of
DSR where you can select the title on
your left click the wrench tool to
reveal your preferred in-game resolution
that can be adjusted with your specified
DSR factors with
on window and then you can use the
optimized slider below for optimization
and for many titles optimal settings are
already recognized for really seamless
gaming with no need for any further
tweaking with DSR enabled however there
are a few instances where DSR is not
very helpful like in anno 2070 we're
changing in-game resolution to 2x or
even 4x DSR so as you can see the menus
just become unreadable and you can't
really do anything with the game at this
high rendered image when it's being down
scaled to your native resolution I've
also had problems with my dual screen
setup where I will jump into a game I
would choose a much high resolution like
a 4x resolution of my native display but
then as the game changes the resolution
it would pop up on the second monitor
instead of my primary monitor and I
would have to completely exit the game
and the only way I've found this to work
is to just disable my second monitor and
no to experience
nobuggy DSR when the resolution changes
also one of my games did not recognize
the multiple factors that I selected in
the Nvidia control panel
this was the Wolfenstein the new order
where after my 2560 by 1440 P there was
only the 4x DSR available of resolution
there was nothing in between like the
1.5 and 2x were not available to be
selected within the menu which was a bit
of a letdown because at 4x from the
1440p resolution is just unplayable so I
guess it's something to do with the
engine of the game and whether or not it
can support these high resolutions and
lastly Nvidia shadowplay which is the
built-in tool to record your gameplay
has been buggy with DSR not letting me
record at my aspect ratio of the monitor
so it would be recording at 16 by 10
aspect ratio on my 16 by 9 monitor and
it would be giving me 1920 by 1200 P
resolution of output after rendering a
game at 2560 by 1440 so there's aspect
ratio differences and resolution
differences whereas in shadow play I've
set it to record in-game resolution so
maybe something Nvidia has to go in and
fix some of those bugs in order
or shadowplay to actually work properly
with DSR so the main thing to take away
from this video is dynamic
super-resolution is taxing on your
system unless you find all the titles
that can new that can be rendered in
high resolution like Starcraft 2 and
dota 2 non very demanding games that can
be rendered at much higher resolution to
give you much better image quality and a
little bit extra detail within the frame
when it's being downscaled to your
native resolution is awesome because
know there are many titles that I want
to revisit now like half-life 2 and play
that in pretty much 5k in order to get
sort of new to see all the detail all
the textures now you may be wondering
what does AMD have in store for to
answer for DSR and they do what VSR or
virtual super resolution so make sure to
subscribe because our video coming out
on DSR vs. DSR and comparing the 290x
versus the GTX 980 and see if there's
any image quality differences between
the two technologies because they're
practically doing exact same thing but
make sure to subscribe because we have a
video coming out on that shortly and if
you have any suggestions on games that
we should try rendering a 5k resolution
then leave them in the comments below so
we hope to see you the next one and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
