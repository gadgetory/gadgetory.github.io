great technology selection and service
hello everyone i'm dmitri with Huracan
axe and today we're talking about gaming
versus real headphones so let's begin
now gaming headphones have this
unpleasant reputation among the audio
enthusiasts community because a lot of
the time gaming audio products come with
a lot of added value features that are
just totally would be considered
pointless by many which includes overly
complicated gamer redesigns that are
most the time just uncomfortable and
don't add any sort of physical appeal to
the actual design of the headset or the
headphone lighting features which we've
seen recently to be introduced which for
consumer side is completely pointless
but I could see why they would be
appealing for competitive arena and
eSports and you can check out our RGB
conversation right over here and lastly
a few gaming companies prioritize on
different things things like 7.1 channel
surround sound immersive gaming
experience you know hear your enemies
before they hear you and my favorite
exquisite craftsmanship and fashion
appearance know just know okay for that
last one I went digging a little bit to
just emphasize my point but why is it
that when it comes to gaming audio
product promotion it all sounds so
surface-level and immature so I decided
to do a little bit of research to find
out how a gaming audio product would be
marketed or sold to you versus a non
gaming audio product and see if there's
any similarities if there's any overlap
and see if one category or the other has
more emphasis on the audio and if you
know what I mean you can probably guess
which one that would be and so I've
compiled a list of features that you are
first exposed to if you were to buy
their product based on the marketing
material or just visiting the website
and see how a gaming versus non gaming
company is trying to sell you their
product so for a non gaming company
you're first presented with
uniquely tune drivers with huge emphasis
on telling you how their audio is best
and this followed by comfort and
something about the frame and lastly
anything about the included accessories
and this is based off websites from San
Heiser AEG buyer dynamics great oh sure
Audio Technica - and yes I've also
visited the beats by dre just for fun
you know how it is but when it comes to
gaming audio products this is where
things get a little bit interesting the
number one marketing emphasis falls onto
comfort which is explainable you know
you're most likely going to be gaming
for multiple hours at a time then
surround sound gaming then design
platform compatibility and microphone
are in that last year and this is based
off gaming products from Logitech razer
corsair steel series kingston hyperx
asus and the rock cat and so based on
these two categories there's one
particular item that stands out and
that's surround sound gaming think about
it for a gaming audio product to sell
you their gaming Audio 7.1 channel
surround sound is so easy to sell
because it gives you that perception of
directional awareness of everything
that's around you and for for gaming
stuff that's obviously very important in
your mind but remember we have two types
of surround sound implementations within
the headset real and virtual so one
comes to real surround sound this is
when we're talking about multiple
drivers on each side to be in charge of
a specific audio channel so center side
subwoofer rear channels and in theory
working those all these drivers together
in harmony to produce very nice surround
sound because you have literally every
driver that's in charge of each of these
directions however in practice every
single real surround sound gaming
headset that I've tried have been
absolutely terrible and disappointing
because there's very little bit of
harmony between these drivers so if
you're in game and your character is
rotating in theory you're supposed to
receive sort of a three dimensional
rotation of audio right no
that's not the case what usually happens
is audio channels are never working in
harmony so you have audio popping in and
out of each of these channels as you
rotate and it's just unnatural sounding
and absolutely terrible virtual surround
sound on the other hand is done through
the software side of things on your
computer or on the headset itself where
you have a stereo headphone so just one
driver per each ear cup the way it's
meant to be but now you're changing the
EQ settings or the equalizer and you're
adjusting the bass the mid-range and the
treble frequencies to widen the
soundstage which most of the time works
really well to widen the soundstage so
your audio environmental larger but you
inherently change the way things sound
so a powerful gunshot will not sound as
powerful and punchy anymore but it will
sound slightly more distant slightly
muted and less detailed and this is
where the conversation gets interesting
of picking up non-gaming headphones for
a gaming scenario if you want the best
type of soundstage I found picking up an
open-back headphone to vastly improve
your audio experience because by Nature
open bag design for the headphones means
they enlarge your audio environment
already which does not need to be
simulated through software and game
engines are becoming so good already
that it's just so awesome to be jump
into a game and feel like you're
immersed into that environment you feel
like you're there and you can feel the
scale of your audio environment not just
to the sort of the visual side of things
but through the audio side of things as
well but then you may be thinking that
gaming headsets have the inherent better
value because of the built-in microphone
and therefore it's more convenient
because of cabling stuff and just the
connection is easier you don't need
anything external microphone but from
our experience only a handful of
microphones in the gaming headset are
actually decent so here's a sound sample
from the son Heiser game one headset the
headphones itself are based off the very
popular HD five five eight and five nine
eight button here the drivers are
slightly tuned differently but they've
added the boom microphone which is nice
and clear it's detailed it's noise
cancelling it's away from any breathing
noise and some people actually gaining
commentary are used for broadcast
but this one's plugged directly into my
motherboard so the sound is a little
it's not the best because you can still
plug this thing into a preamp to get the
best type of audio quality out of the
microphone but most people will be using
their sound cards on their motherboards
anyway so this is the best
representation on what type of sound
quality you can expect from one of the
most expensive gaming headsets out there
now we switch to the Logitech G 633
artemys spectrum RGB gaming headset the
microphone is a lot further away so it's
not picking up any type of noise or
breathing material coming from the area
but it's a very clean microphone
probably cleaner than the game one
headset because this one is coming from
a digital connection so it's connected
via USB and it's using its own
compression and cleanup without using my
motherboards clean up and stuff so it's
a very good microphone as well one of
the best within the gaming headsets that
we've tried and now what you're hearing
- is this still series and Sabir 200
it's one of the lower and gaming
headphones but extremely popular within
the gaming community and now you can see
the difference between all these
microphones this one sounds terrible and
it's precisely why so many people tend
to gravitate towards you know desktop
solutions with a microphone that is
returned it recorded externally so the
audio it doesn't sound like and this is
where a clip-on microphones are so
important like the mod mic 4.0 which has
a fantastic microphone capsule one of
the better microphones out there for you
know your gaming needs and you can
actually use it for many other things as
well it's got a very nice mounting
solution it is quite expensive at the
hundred dollars just for a microphone
add-on but if you're you know already
have a headphone and you don't want to
shell out money for a gaming headset
with a dedicated microphone this may be
a very good solution alright so now
let's talk about sound quality
apologies for such a long build-up up to
this point but this one's going to be a
little tricky because we all like and
hear sound signatures differently or
like sound different sound signatures
but the three main problems that plagues
gaming audio are one overpowering bass
that lacks any definition and overpowers
the rest of the frequencies so that you
just get mush the second problem is
uncontrolled
treble so uncontrolled higher end range
where all the esses the footsteps and
higher and other audio cues within the
higher end range just become
cringe-worthy or you may lack in the
treble department so the entire audio
frequency just loses detail and you go
back to the mush thing again and the
third is distortion where poor drivers
cannot handle frequency separation and
even add moderate volumes you lose
detail going back again to the mush
thing and so this is where non-gaming
headphones really prioritized on those
three aspects of tight bass that doesn't
overshadow anything but still evident
you can feel it but without it entering
into the mid-range and disturbing any of
those frequencies you have the treble
extension which usually is what its
diverse but you can have either a bright
treble extension so it's quite fun it's
emphasized or you can have more flat
fixed treble extension but the most
important thing is that none of those
are fatiguing most of the time and that
also is based on preference and stuff
and the third one is distortion where
good quality drivers handle volume
output and signal output much better so
they distorted much higher volumes or
don't distort at all and I completely
understand that the higher-end headphone
category is completely intimidating
because there's so many things to choose
from so many things to consider do you
like warm bass with very full body
mid-range or do you like analytical
sound signature where the treble is
emphasized but the rest of frequencies
are staying flat so this is where I'd
like to get your guys's input our
viewers to get a sense of what you gain
with and to give your suggestions on
certain budgets let's say under $100 and
$150 plus for a headphone and a
microphone combo and in the end of the
day I really think it's comfort and
sound quality that you should be looking
at when choosing the right pair of
headphones for you whether it's for
gaming or any other use in our
experience I found the game one in the
game just the game series from
Sennheiser to be really nice because
it's based off the very popular and
fantastic sounding HD five five eight
pair of headphones from from Sennheiser
they've just added a boom microphone
there and I've also been really enjoying
the Logitech G 633 because in sound
quality and comfort department they're
fantastic
although they are almost kind of the
definition of game or a gimmicky stuff
with the RGB lighting and all types of
buttons and the last thing I want to
mention if you are in the market for a
pair of headphones for gaming scenarios
then perhaps don't get sucked in unto
all the marketing BS that usually
plagues gaming audio stuff and also if
you're brand loyalty is diverse perhaps
look into non gaming headphones first
because they usually prioritize on sound
and comfort before anything else that is
on the other list and this concludes
this conversation I hope you guys
enjoyed leave a like if you did make

oh my god I gotta take these off before
I break some Jesus okay okay it's really
the cabling that I'm worried about
you know find a suffocated Demetri at
some point nope
all safe and sound</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
