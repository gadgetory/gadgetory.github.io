good options for cases in the mid tower
range all of which carry similar design
that is functional and user-friendly
both the define then the arc series are
designed to suit your specific needs
but each case is unique in its own way
so the latest addition to the arc series
is the midi r2 which takes the internal
options from the define r4 and an
exterior look of the arc mini and
released at 120 dollars I feel this case
is priced appropriately to be competing
with fractal design themselves and other
high-end mid towers and flaws we can
appreciate the simplicity of the case
the midi r2 is very subtle in its
appearance with a hint of fancy for that
aluminum looking plastic front panel now
the use of plastic is highly welcomed as
it reduces the cost of the case and to
be honest this aluminum disguise is very
believable now we have two five in the
quarter inch drive base with a removable
dust filter right below it's very
convenient for cleaning without having
to remove the entire panel and we have a
single 140 millimeter front intake
included with dual fan mounting options
available now the fans are attached
directly to the panel which makes it a
breeze to install and the r2 features a
very nice acrylic window with a slightly
darkish tint and it's very clean to
complement the rest of the design and
look in the back we have some venting
holes for the top and exhaust fan seven
PCI slots with an additional vertical
one for accessories and they bottom out
the power supply now the case stands on
good solid rubberized case feet to
absorb any vibrations and this is where
a large duel dust filter is attached
covering the power supply area and an
optional bottom intake all the
connections are placed at the top with
an included three speed fan controller
for three fans two USB 3 ports power and
reset buttons and of course your audio
jacks the top mesh is completely
removable simply with two thumb screws
it acts as a dust filter and can easily
be
taint now the top fam configuration
provides plenty of fan mounting options
a good variety to choose from to suit
your needs but one clever consideration
is the offset of your dual 120 and 140
millimeter fan mounts away from the
center and closer to the side panel this
is especially useful for installation of
dual 120 millimeter radiators that may
otherwise have clearance issues with
high motherboards now the internal scene
looks familiar keeping an identical
layout as with the define r4 first we
get to optical base at the top followed
by a modular cage system for your drives
the top cage can be rotated to allow
additional airflow to penetrate to the
inside or remove completely if you don't
require any additional storage the drive
caddies are not tools but nevertheless
are a lot sturdier than the common
plastic brackets we've seen on many
competing cases now there are four
grommets for your 3.5 inch drives to
absorb any vibrations and SSDs are
mounted in the middle now when it comes
to the bottom drive cage we also get a
few options that will allow a little bit
more clearance for that front radiator
first you have to remove the rails from
the top of the cage which is a little
inconvenient but it is not a
deal-breaker but then the cage can be
mounted slightly farther away from the
front allowing optimal room for a
radiator to be installed while having
plenty of clearance for your power
supply and the other option is to mount
it even further away on the spot of the
optional bottom intake in case of a
really thick radiator so we have about
six inches of room of clearance for the
second position and about four and a
half inches for the first position so
the bottom optional intake fan can house
both standards fan sizes and that will
become unusable if you do decide to
reposition the bottom cage now overall
it's a good set of options to allow two
dual radiators to be installed without
any hassle on the front and the other
for the top and coming around to the
back we get a decently sized CV opening
however it could be bigger
nice quality rubber grommets all around
with cable
tiny notches and one thing everyone will
sure appreciate is the ample of room for
all your cable needs we have an inch of
room to work with so you can tidy up
your build straight from the beginning
also the back are mounting holes for two
SSDs it's a nice consideration but a
real pain if you have to reinstall them
once your motherboard is in place and
installing our monster or eleven
half-inch GPU is not a problem
even with the cage installed and it
looks like 12 inch cards may also fit
but it might be a little tight of course
you always have the option to remove the
cage completely to allow a bit more
clearance now the bottom intake slot is
always a concern with longer power
supplies so with our 180 millimeter unit
you'll still be able to mount a 120
millimeter fan so checking out our final
build so no surprise there is really
nothing negative to say about the middie
r2 it handles really well in the airflow
Department with full dust proof covers
both harddrive cages are modular so you
can configure them to suit your needs
and there's absolutely no issues
handling enthusiast hardware plus a very
complimentary design to suit multiple
water cooling configurations and what's
the purpose of spending all that hard
work on cable management if you can't
show it off
so I clean tinted side window is a major
bonus now if we have to be picky a large
CPU cut out would be nice to accommodate
for a large array of motherboards and
that's about the only flaw of the middie
r2 so this new addition to the arc
series is bound to receive a lot of
attention because fractal design truly
showcases their series of delivering
functional and well designed cases for
any user the middie r2 is the hybrid
between the define r4 and the mini
encompassing everything we need in the
case plus giving us the opportunity to
water pool without any compromises and
we're giving you the hard oka Knox damn
good and damn good value a word
so thanks for watching I'll see you in
the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
