and welcome back to another video I just
got back from LA yesterday covering
risin though AMD's rising tech day event
it was a lot of fun there were a lot of
product launches and as most of you are
aware the RX Vega line of GPUs were
finally announced so if you're
interested to learn more about those
GPUs I'll leave a link to that video in
the description down below today we're
talking through Red River and I'm
actually really excited for this
platform because this is Amy's response
to Intel in the high-end desktop market
personally this is more exciting to me
than Vegas so here's what you need to
know but before that a quick message
from our sponsor investment source that
makes a difference choose toshiba Rd 400
and DME SSDs that are incredibly fast
and reliable
backed by advanced warranty programs so
you can focus on what matters
Rd 400 check it out from the description
below ok so aim D's targeting rising
thread repair to customers who are
primarily software developers
researchers content creators and
multitasking gamers if your work
requires a numerous amount of course for
processing a large number of data sets
rendering 4k or even 8k videos streaming
while also gaming thread Ripper has you
covered
what 204 isn't targeting are people who
are only looking to game on their
systems I think that's why the Rison 7 5
and 3 processors are meant for there are
three processors that complete the risin
thread refer family so let's start with
the flagship CPU the 1950 X that's set
to retail for around $1,000 this monster
is sporting 16 cores with 32 threads and
it features a base clock of 3.4 gears
with a boost of up to 4.0 the XO far
range on all three skills are about 200
megahertz higher so technically single
core speeds should hit 4.2 gigahertz
provided adequate cooling performance
wise AMD does claim that it's up to 30%
faster than the I 970 900 X and
Cinebench multi-core and here's another
chart showcasing different comparisons
take this with the grain of salt guys
because we still have to validate those
results in our full performance review
so stay tuned for that moving down we
have the 1920 X that's priced at $800 it
features 12 physical cores with 24
threads and it's cost slightly higher
than the 1950
so 3.5 gigahertz versus 3.4 on the 16
core variant loose remains the same
at 4.0 once again you get XF our
frequency range of 200 megahertz and
support for 65 PCI lanes along with quad
channel memory support I should also
mention that the 1950 X and 1920 X have
pdps of 180 watts and are both being
launched next week lastly we have the
1900 X priced at $550 which will be
available on August the 31st this is an
8 core CPU supporting 16 threads and it
comes with the same base and boost clock
speeds as the 1800 X so 3.8 gigahertz
versus 4.0 now a lot of you guys may be
wondering why would someone up for this
over the 1,800 X because spec wise
they're almost identical at least for
the most part here's why if you're
looking to configure a system with
multiple GPUs and nvme drives this CPU
can handle that without a problem
because unlike the 1800 X that sports 20
PCIe lanes and support for dual channel
memory the 1900 exports up to 64 pci
lanes and quad channel ddr4 so that
means you won't run into any bandwidth
limitations until I'm sorry did you hear
that Intel here's a brief comparison as
to where the 1950 X 1920 X and the 1900
stand with respective Intel skylake X
CPUs this looks very promising guys and
we can't wait to give you our final
verdict on these new thread Ripper
processors ok so most of you should be
aware of the new socket tr4 mounts on
these new XP 99 motherboards if you're
looking for a little glimpse on the
chipset
I'll leave our Computex coverage where
we got a chance to get our hands on
experience with a few motherboards from
as rock and gigabyte so I'll leave links
to those in the description to sum it up
expect a lot of features and we'll make
sure to cover that in our thread repair
performance review and the last thing
that I wanted to touch base on is
cooling for these new thread Ripper CPUs
I mean looking at the tr4 socket alone
brings a lot of questions regarding CPU
die coverage and existing coolers being
incompatible good news is that AMD will
be including a mounting bracket for all
ACE attack liquid colors including
offerings from NZXT corsair thermaltake
EBG etc if you're planning to use your
existing air coolers
you might run into compatibility issues
not to us coming up with a few options
that support bigger heat pipes and
larger heat spreaders for efficient
cooling on these monstrous chips air
coolers won't be here for at least a few
weeks but I might get my hands on a few
of them so maybe I'll do a temperature
test comparing a Iowa's vs. air coolers
on these new processors if you're
interested let us know so there you have
it
a low limps to what could potentially
turn into an awesome platform for
content creators developer streamers and
passionate enthusiasts the red ripper
completes the entire rising ecosystem
and there is a cpu for pretty much
everyone out there for starters rising 3
is an excellent option for gamers on a
budget rise in five steps things up to
the mainstream users lies in 7/4
enthusiasts and rising thread ripper for
h EDT customers I mean what with
hurricane X thank you so much for
watching make sure to hit that subscribe
button because we will have our full
performance review for these new
processors coming to you very shortly so
yeah I guess I'll catch you all in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
