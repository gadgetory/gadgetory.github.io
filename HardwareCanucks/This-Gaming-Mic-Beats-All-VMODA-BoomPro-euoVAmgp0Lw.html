v-moda boom mic Pro has gone under our
radar for so long and then any gaming
headset review any microphone test
people are always commenting hey check
out the vimana boom mic Pro because it
is actually a really good alternative to
let's say a mod like 4 or mod like 5 and
a really good substitute for you know
built-in or included microphones on many
gaming headsets this thing is only $30
which makes it a really good value to
add a professional good sounding boom
microphone to your gaming pair let's
check it out right after this what would
you like so I'm looking for a gaming
headset with a bit of everything but not
overkill something that folds on your
neck sure how about the light frame
without excessive clamping force yes yes
you have to be air cushions with proper
internal padding excellent I will take
the cable and the microphone are
removable
fine fine this is the one multi-platform
compatibility with a virtual surround
sound dongle avail can I just take one
and the sound quality you'll be
satisfied with so the new Coolermaster
MH 751 and 75 to are here to make your
gaming experience so I think many people
are wondering whether or not the cheaper
boom pro solution is you know a better
direction for quality microphone audio
to your gaming headset versus something
like the mod mic series the mod like 4
or the mod like 5 those things are more
expensive of course especially the mod
like 5 that sounds fantastic but it's
$70 and you know it's almost the price
of like gaming headsets that you might
be adding the boom mic Pro 2 so from a
pricing perspective the boom Pro all the
way but unlike the mod mic series that
you can attach to any gaming headset
because of the magnetic clamp system the
boom Pro is a different solution it is
not meant to clamp on the side of the
headset like the mod mic series instead
it has its own 4-pole connection that
you insert into compatible headsets
therefore replacing the default cable
and this brings us to our first
limitation almost where this boom mic
Pro is designed to work with v-moda
headsets but many also gaming headsets
you know removable cables that use a
standard 4-pole connection and it's
perfect for that but if your cable and a
headset is non removable then you cannot
really attach the boom mic to that
headset now luckily for all the gaming
pairs that I own that have a removable
cable for the headset this thing fits
because it's slightly longer it has a
nice thin profile so if there's any
housing limitations or like the Sonos
like proprietary clip on clickin system
for the headset the boom pro should fit
it fits on my cooler master image 75 to
and 75 1 it fits perfectly fine with my
G pro headset from Logitech because
again the cable is removable and it's a
standard 4-pole connection so it's not
proprietary to anything but for my son
Heiser pairs that use a thinner input
here you cannot install the boom mic Pro
because it will not fit I really like
the low profile nature of this
microphone the boom arm is flexible it
is quite thin but stays in position
unless you move it the actual microphone
capsule is quite thick you can kind of
detect where it is around your mouth and
adjust it accordingly it does not come
with a boom filter or a pop filter but I
think that's fine you can simply move it
further away if you're breathing into it
and definitely I would say like a more
discrete solution versus something like
the mod mic series that has its own
cabling and that is definitely one main
main advantage unless you go with the
wireless mod mic this is all in one
cable since it replaces the default
cable on the headset you don't have to
worry about cable management we have
nice little joystick control with a clip
on we have Mike mute and the volume dial
and the cable itself splits into another
4-pole connection so you can insert that
into your notebook for example or we
have a splitter so you can split that
into headphone and microphone for your
motherboard or notebook one thing to
mention is that it is meant to attach to
the left side as with most v-moda
headsets microphone is on the left
but because the flexible nature of the
boom mic if you know the removable cable
on your headset might be potentially on
the right side you could plug it in
still there and rotate the microphone to
face the proper side because the actual
you know steel band here is flexible and
that
not an issue by rotating the capsule
back but now it is time to here with the
microphone sounds like let's read some
home adios
let me read you a little excerpt on the
chapter called the right to happiness it
appears that our happiness banks against
a mysterious glass ceiling that does not
allow it to grow despite all our and
precedented accomplishments even if we
provide free food for everybody cure all
diseases and ensure world peace it won't
necessarily shatter that glass ceiling
achieving real happiness is not going to
be much easier than overcoming all age
and death the glass ceiling of happiness
is held in place by two style pillars
one psychological the other biological
on a psychological level happiness
depends on expectations rather than
objective conditions we don't become
satisfied by leading a peaceful and
prosperous existence rather we become
satisfied when the reality matches our
expectations the bad news is that as
conditions improve expectations balloon
dramatic improvements and conditions as
humankind has experienced in recent
decades translate into greater
expectations rather than greater
contentment if we don't do something
about this our future achievements too
might leave us as dissatisfied as ever
on the biological level both our
expectations and our happiness are
determined by our biochemistry rather
than by our economic social and
political situation according to the
life sciences happiness and suffering
are nothing but different bounces of
bodily sensations we never react to
events in the outside world but only to
the sensations in our own bodies
conversely science says that nobody's
ever made happy by getting a promotion
winning in the lottery or even finding
true love people are made happy by one
thing and one thing only Pleasant
sensations in their bodies if you get a
promotion but for some reason don't feel
any Pleasant sensations you will not
feel satisfied the opposite is also true
if you have just been fired but are
experiencing very pleasant sensation
because you popped some pills you might
still feel on top of the world this is
the fault of evolution for countless
generations our biochemical system
adapted to increasing our chances of
survival and reproduction not our
happiness thank you for sticking along
during this inside
reading about happiness I think the boom
Pro sounds excellent for $30 comparable
to the mod like for very similar
sounding but $20 cheaper I still feel
like throughout this entire collection
the mod like 5 sounded the best has the
most body the most clear and warmth
versus everything else you know has
little compromises here and there in
terms of the vocal characteristics but
let me know which microphone sound the
best to you in the comments
improve your workflow it stream deck
mini by Elgato
giving you six fully customizable LCD

array customization for OBS Twitch
xsplit and more check out the stream
deck mini down below and I would say the
main downfall for the boom pro is
actually it's also its strength simply
because of the installation you need to
have a headset that supports a 3.5
millimeter 4-pole connection otherwise
you know it's going to be incompatible
but also the fact that you are replacing
the default cable means that you don't
have to deal with additional cables like
you would with the mod Mac series and
while the price point is competitive the
microphone quality improvement you get
versus let's say the G pro from Logitech
or the image 75 - it's there it sounds
better than the default microphones but
you just ask yourself if that is worth
to you the $30.00 and I'm guessing it's
a really good addition for v-moda
headphones because that 3.5 millimeter
input on the side all right guys I'm
Dimitri thanks much for watching and
I'll talk to you in the next video
