that I see under the CM storm series
this being the CM storm trooper
incorporating all the enthusiast gaming
needs for a mobile system now the
aggressive look of the case really adds
this armored and tough feel to the case
using the concept of armored transport
as the main idea behind the design and
coolermaster has added a number of
features that will stand out from the
rest of the mobile towers the case is to
be released in October 2011 at the
retail price of around $190 so for the
full package with all the features that
this trooper offers you'll be pleased to
know it is fairly priced first as you
notice the large handle at the top of
the case which is rubberized along with
a rear support handle and no worries it
can handle up to 43 kilograms of weight
so considering the case itself is only
around 15 kilograms additional 28
kilograms of Hardware can be installed
inside while still maintaining a safe
carrying capacity now coolermaster
thought of coating the case with damage
resistant rubber surface to prevent from
scratches if the case is in transport
now not only will that prolong the life
the chassis but it also adds this
quality feel to the outside plastic the
top panel is quite busy featuring your
activity light your audio 2 USB 3.0 and
2 regular USB ports eSATA and the reset
button now the trooper comes with an
integrated fan controller and an
illuminated CM storm logo for your power
button be able to connect six fans to
the fan controller which can also
regulate LEDs on the fans and the LED
indicator on the top of the case shows
either dimmed or solid light
corresponding to one of the six speeds
unfortunately Coolermaster does not
provide USB 3.0 2.0 adapter so for
non-supportive motherboards two of the
USB ports of the front will not be
utilized
right below that is what they call an X
Doc allows for a 2.5 inch hot-swap drive
to be installed is a much welcomed
feature and would be nice seeing more
case manufacturers incorporating that
into the chassis design below that are
our nine five and a quarter inch drive
base with an included 3.5 inch adapter
all the dust filters and can be easily
accessed and removed from the front next
this is what makes schoolmaster ahead of
its competitors see the nice brushed
aluminum cover at the bottom remove that
and here you have yourself a hidden
toolbox inside which case accessories
can be stored and found along with an 8
pin CPU extension moving on to the side
panel we have a large venting area with
the option for two 120mm fans and the
other side panel has more venting area
if you want the hard drive cages to be
installed
facing the back side panel to allow for
passive air flow at the back of the
trooper we have water cooling holes rear
exhaust fan io area nine PCI ventilated
expansion slots plus an additional
vertical one either to use with the
storm guard security or mounting
additional accessories now the storm
guard security bracket allows for
effective lock of a gaming peripherals
to the case especially used for four LAN
parties now Coolermaster recognizes the
importance of a dust-free interior and
incorporates three easily removable dust
filters
okay moving inside users have the option
for different harddrive mounts either
facing the back side panel and hiding
the cables or rotate it either of both
pages in a more traditional matter with
cables facing the motherboard the
advantage of such layout is that allows
for passive airflow throughout the case
meaning delivering cold air inside the
case for further cooling if the cages
are facing the back
none of that air is being utilized to
cool any other component but the drives
themselves speaking in which in total 8
3.5 inch drives can be installed all of
which have support for 2.5 inch drives
so a total of 13 2.5 inch drives can be
installed with 12 being inside the case
and additional hot-swap ex-dog on the
exterior now in terms of cooling this
full Tower comes equipped with 2 120mm
fans in the front 200 millimeter fan at
the top and a 140 millimeter fan for
exhaust but in total troopers cooling
potential is 9 fans and support for 2
dual rads one at the top and the other
at the bottom but cooler master suggests
that with some creative mounting users
are able to mount a quadrat if you
remove the hard drive cages the optical
drives and the toolbox but also says
that altering the steel frame may void
your warranty and the potential mounting
bracket for the front may also be
released in the future as you see there
is an extra large CPU backplate opening
with rubber grommets around the
motherboard tray for routing and cables
and this scary-lookin amount of cables
for the front panel but not to worry
there is enough room in the back for
cable management with plenty of cable
time mountings
the rest of the assembly went really
smooth with no issues for your cable
management and as you can see cleans up
nicely on the inside with plenty of room
for future expansions our eleven and a
half inches long graphics card fit in
with plenty of room to spare and the
case supports up to twelve point seven
inches in length for your GPU so an AMD
6990 will be no problem coolermaster
year again has delivered an exceptional
photoshops II this time concentrating on
the mobile gamer incorporating all the
enthusiast features into this enclosure
and armoring this trooper even if your
main purpose for the chassis to be used
as a workstation the carrying handle
doesn't interfere and most likely will
come in handy in the future but for a
mobile user a steel construction is
durable and the carrying capacity should
suffice for even extreme gaming
configurations the integrated fan
controller along with the hot sorbet
really adds value to the chassis and the
damage resistant rubber coating will
definitely protect against minor
scratches during transport but also keep
in mind it is plastic the internal hard
drive configuration options allow the
user slightly more flexibility with
their own setup which doesn't require
too many steps and an included toolbox
really can be useful for storing extra
case parts or accessories that will not
be lost
and finally for a price tag of one
hundred and ninety dollars this being a
mobile full tower that can handle
practically anything cool master has yet
again delivered to our expectations for
a reasonable price
the only negative comment that we can
make about Trouper is that a triple rad
support the top would have been made
that deal and make this case even more
competitive among other full towers and
the USB 3.0 to 2.0 converter should be
available with the case to utilize the
USB 3 ports on the front even with
non-supportive motherboards beside the
slight drawbacks
thumbs up for cool masters damn go
Trooper

you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
