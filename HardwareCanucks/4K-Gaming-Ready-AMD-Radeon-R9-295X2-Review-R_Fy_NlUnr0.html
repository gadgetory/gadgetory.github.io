Knox and the card was all been waiting
for these initially as Vesuvius along
with a few questionable deliveries first
there was a rather creepy a mirrored
picture of yourself followed by dual
Pringle cans green volcanic water
hinting and what's about to come
and finally with a very intriguing watch
me DVD that I'm glad wasn't some
inappropriate fan mail MD has finally
tied the knot with a pretty badass
delivery in a briefcase that totally
deserves your undivided attention so
this is the AMD r9 295x2 codenamed Hydra
incorporating dual Hawaii XT course
basically slapping dual r9 290x azan to
a single PCB and of course being the
latest dual GPU flagship from AMD
retailing for fifteen hundred dollars is
not surprising considering it's only a
light premium over dual 290x cards
so 295x2 is the first water-cooled
reference design incorporating a 120
millimeter all-in-one cooler designed by
acetic and this was absolutely needed to
control the temperatures on the
extremely hot course now on a single PCB
the inclusion of this 120 million
radiator should cause no alarm over
installation as any modern case should
easily accommodate for it and a 38
millimeters thick
this means push-pull could serve as a
cooling upgrade fan speed is linked up
directly to coolant temperatures and the
cable is routed along run the tubes and
so there's no need for external power
for the water cooler and since the fan
connects to a three pin fan hub
replacement is an option also tubing is
quite long allowing placement
flexibility within your case depending
on the layout now one more thing to
mention is the acetic water cooler is
not modular so you cannot replace the
rod with something bigger but as you'll
see this is an absolute powerhouse as it
is the water block encompasses the
entire card so the 80 millimeter fan in
the middle is in charge of cooling the
VRMs with a full copper heat sink
underneath this is needed as the card
features eight gigabyte of gddr5 memory
so four gigabytes per core on the dual
512 bit bus that tells you that the
295x2 is 4k gaming ready and to get the
rest of the specs out of the way the
base clock is actually higher than the
290x and 1018 megahertz that's because
the main limitation when the heat has
been addressed and the card can maintain
a stable clock without throttling it
measures at full 12 inches the
compatibility with many met hours isn't
the concern and the fact that this is
only a 2 slot card meaning ITX potential
which brings a whole new level of
powerhouse in a small form factor the
backplate is included as well and
overall the card is stunning with
aluminum shroud covering the water block
and the Radeon illuminated logo up top
to complement the red LED fan for
connectivity we have four mini display
ports all of which support 4k at 60
Hertz and a single dual link DVI you've
probably guessed it already but the r9
295x2 requires a lot of power and named
in his office
for dual apron connections but giving
the power draw for each GPU each eight
pin cable must run at least 28 amps of
current so power supplies you know
within the 1000 watt range should be
considered there is a dual BIOS which as
well as was found on the 290 X but this
one is left clean to be configured by
the user so you know you can perhaps
create your own uber mode and here is a
295 inside our office fool tower the
rear exhaust train allows for the
radiator to be installed just perfectly
nothing unusual here but it's when we
move into a completely different
category such as Mini ITX things get
interesting in most cases in this range
have a 120mm fan slot so here's an
extremely powerful gaming configuration
inside the schooler Master Elite 130
that also happens to be one of the
smallest cases we've ever reviewed here
at Harbor Canucks so you no longer have
to worry about internal heat as most of
it is blown through the radiator as
exhaust also micro ATX and mini ITX
enthusiast builds becoming very popular
so this type of configuration is not
totally out of line to preserve on space
without significant compromise on
cooling and with all that said the most
eager question is how does it perform
for 4k gaming and most importantly how
does it compare to 290 X and crossfire
and 780ti in SLI and starting off with
2560 by 1440 resolution the 295x2 holds
its own ground and shows neck-to-neck
results with 290 X and crossfire with
excellent scaling then depending on the
game it's actually very close to 780ti
in SLI as well of course it's 4k
capabilities that matter and what we're
seeing is seriously impressive results
at the highest settings with pretty much
every game aim these mantle is one of
the key points and so far only two games
supported and results are not surprising
as mantle really shines with lower end
systems but the API is still sort of in
its early stages and we hope results
will improve over time now one of the
most amazing aspects of this card is the
cooler with 75 degree threshold compared
to 95 degrees Celsius on the 290
X and this is one cool card maintaining
65Â° under load meaning there's still
more power to be squeezed out of the
course before reaching the temperature
threshold so overclocking results are
proved successful although not
significant boost in performance as the
card caps at seventy-five degrees
Celsius another Brown moment for the
asset the cooler are the acoustics this
is the quietest card in its class
even at blows showcasing how efficient
the only one solution is without
breaking a sweat and of course it always
comes down to power consumption with a
high course and this is one power-hungry
GPU which was expected needing more than
70 watts over 780 Ti in SLI and over 150
watt extra compared to 780 SLI but as
AMD has made clear this card is not for
everyone and we have a more in-depth
coverage on temperature many more
benchmarks and core frequencies over
time and many other things in our full
review on the website they'll be linked
in the description if you're interested
and to conclude amy has done exactly
what we wanted to see from the Hawaii XT
core as the asset tech all-in-one cooler
allows for incredible stable
temperatures under load quiet operation
with automatic fan speed adjustment they
didn't skimp on the reference design as
the card is gorgeous and being a 2 slot
card is also highly appreciated the
295x2 is made for 4k gaming and delivers
to that expectation with stellar
performance without throttling however
does lag behind the price per watt and
price to performance ratios as the 780ti
in sli would be considered better value
and even 290x and crossfire however the
added benefits of improved cooling and
reduced acoustics make this one damn
good and damn innovative card but what
do you guys think of the AMD r9 295x2
with regards to pricing and design leave

video and three the full review on
Haruka NOx calm the link will be in the
description for a more in-depth analysis
off the cart so thanks for watching
we'll see you in next one
wouldn't you agree the twos better than
one hashtag - better than one come on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
