the opportunity to experience a cordless
vacuum cleaner I'm not kidding
considering that I receive a lot of
packages here in the studio it's really
hard for me to keep track of cleaning
this space not to mention the gunk that
gets collected between my keyboard keys
the case fans the dust filters inside my
case the narrow spots that are here and
there in the studio and of course the
rest of the household cuz I'll be honest
I'm not really up for pulling out a full
sized vacuum cleaner to complete that
task it's pretty difficult to lug around
and it just isn't practical considering
that I live in a pretty compact space
not to mention storing such an equipment
could be frustrating so I was looking
for a new vacuum cleaner for my tiny
studio and we decided to collaborate
with Dyson to give you guys an in-depth
look at the new cycle and v10 that's
launching globally today it's cordless
powerful flexible for any environment
last longer than its younger brother the
v8 and it's been redesigned to replicate
the suction power that matches any
full-size of vacuums performance and it
convinced James Dyson to put an end to
developing their upright vacuum lineup
it's the real deal guys
all right so what's new about the
cyclone v10 it starts with the all-new
redesigned Dyson digital motor v6 40%
smaller than the v8 motor yet it manages
to create a much higher suction power at
up to 125 thousand rpm so that's 20%
more powerful than the v8 because of
just how fast is new v10 motor is the
engineers over a dyson had to switch to
a new ceramic shaft because the metal
used in previous Corrine vacuums could
deform at higher rotations so how does
that translate into real-world use well
here's a quick demo see you accidentally
spilled coffee powder on your precious
carpet don't you worry the Dyson v10 can
suck it up easily without leaving any
stains cereals are also a great example
especially when you have kids around
this thing is a lifesaver
Dyson took a different approach when
designing the cyclone v10 spin it now
features a 90-degree format and the
absolute variant is 40% larger than its
predecessor the v8 this was also done to
increase airflow efficiency as well as
offer users a superior experience
cleaning it
so if you want an empty tube then you
can simply point push the red handle
underneath the bin and the front door
just opens and shoots to debris I
actually wouldn't mind doing this all
day long it's really fun but seriously
though considering that I don't have a
lot of free time and due to other
commitments that I have outside of
YouTube this is just a simple process
that only takes a few seconds and that's
important to me because because time is
precious
ergonomically the cyclone v10 does not
disappoint as well the handheld
operation is intuitive and quicker to
get used to and the entire unit isn't
that heavy I can quickly clean up my
office space and the next thing you know
is that I'm cleaning my living room
without worrying about chords or lugging
around a big bulky vacuum it's just
practical and my mom loves it too given
that the cyclone v10 is a cordless
vacuum cleaner powering the motor
requires a battery and I wasn't willing
to compromise on running time
considering its higher suction power my
house is about 1,500 square foot and it
usually takes me an hour to clean the
entire place the good news is that the
cyclone v10 lasts up to 60 minutes the
engineers have spent five years into
developing this motor and they've
managed to not only make it more
powerful but also power efficient this
is all thanks to the integrated energy
dense lithium-ion battery cells I spent
about an hour cleaning my entire house
and I'll admit it was very quick and
efficient and that's something I
couldn't say with other cordless vacuums
I've had in the past since they
typically didn't have the power to clean
all the different surfaces and they ran
out of battery power long before I could
finish I should also mention that there
are three modes built into the v10
unlike the v8 that only feature to this
essentially allows the user to switch
between different power settings so max
means the suction power at its highest a
minimum translates to lower power mode
the cycle region also charges in three
and a half hours compared to five on the
v8 so that's a welcoming upgrade and
there's a battery indicator located
beside the trigger for monitoring
storing the Dyson v10 is also pretty
convenient thanks to the included wall
mountable docking station it can hold up
to two additional attachments as well as
store the vacuum cleaner while docked so
it's always ready to go i'd say the
overall package is pretty low profile
when compared to a traditional full-size
cleaner and that exactly what I've been
looking for in a while one of the unique
aspects of Dyson's cordless vacuum
cleaners is the different attachments
that come with a Motorhead if you think
about it most users have a full-size
vacuum cleaner for their carpets and
hard floors and sometimes they'd find
trouble reaching narrow spots given that
the vacuum might come with a long brush
head in other cases you know if you're a
car owner like myself you would probably
look into investing in a portable
solution that might not be as powerful
but at the same time you might have to
find additional storage
well Dyson once again solves that
problem by creating an all-in-one
solution with a cyclone v10 and it's
different attachments the mechanism is
just as simple as building Legos you
simply pick the ideal tool attach it to
the motor head and start cleaning it all
revolves around transformation being
able to switch from a direct drive
cleaner head to a simple handheld
solution for quick cleanups is just
downright brilliant for example I can
use the included soft roller cleaner
head that features soft woven nylon
materials as well as anti-static
carbon-fiber filaments that remove fine
dust particles from hard floors switch
over to the torque brush bar it can take
care of larger debris especially in
carpets thanks to the integrated nylon
crystals that just dig deeper into the
carpet pile and remove the dirt both the
soft head and the torque brush cleaners
feature a motor and it receives power
through these pin contacts I should also
mention that the cyclone v10 is
compatible with all the attachments from
the v7 and the v8
another great example of using the v10
at least for me would be by cleaning the
dust filters inside my case using the
crevice tool it's narrow shape allows
for a consistent suction and given the
advantage of being cordless I can
quickly and easily maneuver around and
given that there are three suction modes
the low setting comes in really handy
since it won't damage the filters also
this service is an excellent tool to
clean my keyboard as well so yeah there
you have it I also tend to clean my car
on a regular basis and I was looking for
a vacuum that was both powerful and
portable well
the cyclone v10 with its excellent
transform ability does exactly that and
I've never looked back so at the end of
the day Dyson cyclone v10 has surprised
me in a lot of ways first and foremost
it's the convenience factor
this thing just works and that's
important to me because I live in a
pretty compact space the different
attachments that come with the cordless
vacuum are simple to attach and very
intuitive to operate the included wall
mounting bracket is a great addition and
the cleaner is always ready to go
whenever you need it it's simply a grab
and start cleaning kind of situation
here so it's very simple plus giving it
can last up to 60 minutes on one time
that's plenty for me to clean the entire
space the newly designed v10 motor is an
absolute monster and you've seen that
with the demos it can handle fairly
larger debris like nobody's business and
that's exactly what I've been looking
for in a vacuum cleaner and we know
what's even cool the way how this thing
sounds checks out it just it's so cool
I have never yeah it's it's it's amazing
the cyclone v10 is actually replacing
its predecessor the v8 so Dyson's
current cordless vacuum cleaner line up
consists of five different products
starting with the v7 the v7 complete the
cyclone v10 motor Han the v10 animal and
the v10 absolute with these respective
price points so I'd like to take this
time to thank Dyson for helping me out
with this video and allowing me to find
a huge upgrade for my office vacuum but
most importantly I want to hear your
thoughts on Dyson's new cyclone v10
cordless vacuum cleaner let us know in
