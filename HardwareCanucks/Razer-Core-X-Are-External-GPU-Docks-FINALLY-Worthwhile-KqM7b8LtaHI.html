Eber here with hardware connects and
external GPU enclosures have been an
interesting topic to discuss because for
one it is an awesome add-on for your
portable setup especially if you're
someone who always carries an ultrabook
on you and if that is your primary
device and if you want to get you know
some extra performance out of it
especially when it comes to gaming or
just other productive tasks adding or
harnessing the power of a desktop class
GPU can definitely come in handy when it
comes to you know better frame rates or
just lower render times and all that
kind of stuff so as you can clearly see
I've been testing the Razer core X with
the Razer Blade stealth and of course if
you're the devices which I'll get to
later on but I wanted to talk about my
experience using this guy and overall
talked about why it even exists and why
would someone or why would you even
consider spending you know three hundred
dollars for an enclosure and of course
the extra investment when it comes to
the graphics card so I'm gonna walk you
through my experience using the Razer
corex right after message from our
sponsor menu and there Mac slick fusion
is their first addressable RGB
all-in-one cooler with a standard 240 ml
rad and absolutely beautiful RGB ring
elimination on the fans and the pump to
highlight that unique flow indicator
through the transparent top check out
the lake fusion down below alright so
let's quickly go over the design of the
Razer core X so if you're familiar with
the Razer core v2 they should feel like
home
albian it's a lot bigger than the core
v2 because it can accommodate larger
graphics cards but this whole thing is
crafted in a gorgeous cnc anodized
aluminum finish the fun panel is made
out of plastic materials but the whole
thing is it blends in really well with
the aluminum finish of course and it
looks stealth I mean you're not going to
notice there are no fancy gaming
elements throughout the chassis it's
just pure it's minimalistic I love the
design of the core X you've got mesh
materials on the side for air flow which
is great and this thing weighs 15 pounds
which is a lot but considering that
you're going to be placing this
stationary at your desk it shouldn't be
a big problem
for size comparison here's a shot of it
sitting beside an ass Rock decima need
GTX this thing is 2.7 liters in volume
and of course as you can see the core X
is certainly not small it is a huge
enclosure so you definitely have to find
some room in your desk space to
accommodate this guy
not to mention this thing is just as big
as a fully loaded ITX system which is
just ridiculous in terms of features the
cortex is certainly lacking a lot of
that when compared to the Corby -
remember this is a $300 enclosure
compared to $500 but there are a few
improvements when it comes to powering
ultrabooks so the USBC power delivery is
at a hundred watts when compared to 65
on the core v2 this thing can also
support up to three slot graphics cards
without a problem so if you do end up
picking up aftermarket solutions like
the ROG Strix series you shouldn't have
a problem accommodating that large
graphics card inside the core X whereas
with the Corby - it's only compatible
with 2.2 graphics cards so ideally your
best bet would be reference based GPUs
or even ITX base GPUs that are much
smaller in size as for connectivity well
as I mentioned earlier you're not going
to be getting a lot with the core X so
the only port on the core X is a USB see
venerable three port that you can use to
connect or establish a connection
between the core X and notebook and
that's pretty much it you are not going
to be getting extra USB 3.0 ports or LAN
port like what you would get with the
core v2 and of course you won't get
things like a chroma RGB lighting so
those are some of the things to keep in
mind and getting into the core X is
fairly simple all you have to do is
gently pull the lever located at the
back then pull out the compartment from
the enclosure you can then remove the
PCIe slot cover that's installed by
default install your graphics card into
the PCI slot just like installing one
onto a motherboard and tighten the
bracket with the included screw the last
step is obviously to connect the power
cables into the GPU and slide the
compartment back into the enclosure and
lock the system with the lever and
that's it now Razer is integrated a 120
millimeter fan for intake to bring in
cool air for the GPU you can technically
replace the stock fans with aftermarket
solutions from Noctua or be quiet or
your preferred brand the core X comes
with a built-in 651 PSU where it can
supply up to 500 watts for the graphics
card and
hundred watts for powering your notebook
this means you wouldn't have a problem
with power delivery issues with NVIDIA
based graphics cards like a Titan xB or
even GTX 1080i you wouldn't also have a
problem with envy AMD based graphics
cards like a Vega 56 or 64 and what's
even interesting is that the cortex can
also support quad row based graphics
cards and if you're looking to see if
your graphics car is compatible with the
core X make sure to head over to razors
website they do have a compatibility
list under the tech specs so just make
sure that it makes it is compatible but
nonetheless I think you should be ok
when it comes to installing you know
Nvidia or AMD based graphics cards
now the included 0.5 metre Thunderbolt 3
type-c cable is pretty short in length
and one of the challenges when it comes
to routing this open your setup is that
you need to have a notebook right beside
the core X because the cable is pretty
short so if you're looking to place a
core X on the left side and have the
notebook on the right side well you're
definitely gonna have a lot of
challenges with short cable Razer does
offer a two meter cable rated at 40
gigabits per second speed for $60 but do
keep in mind that the maximum power
delivery is only at 60 watts
versus a hundred watts with this stock
point 5 meter cable remember there's a
lot of bandwidth to transfer between the
core X and the notebook with just a
single type C cable over here so length
could be a discerning factor when it
comes to bandwidth limitations so that's
something to keep in mind I think the
only thing that you should need to be
worried about is power delivery for the
notebook the blade stealth shouldn't
have a problem because it is rated at 60
watts in terms of power delivery so you
could technically get away with a 2
meter cable and not experience bandwidth
issues or performance issues in that mom
but if you're connecting a slightly
powerful no bug that requires 100 watts
for power then obviously a lot on cable
wouldn't make a lot more sense and one
of the suggestions that I do when it
comes to setup or setting up the blade
stealth or any ultrabook with the core X
is perhaps get a vertical docking
station more like a stand or something
where you can place a notebook like that
and have the core X where I decided so
that would obviously eliminate the
clutter and make it'll sort of clean
things up so ideally I'd highly
recommend planning out your setup before
you even considering investing on the
core X or if you do investor if you do
decide to invest on the core X then
obviously you would have to make
few setup changes within your space so
that's something to keep in mind now the
setup process was actually a lot easier
than I thought I had the blade and open
in the background and all I did was just
plug in this cable from the cortex the
blade stealth and the Thunderbolt 3
software automatically detected the core
accident asked me to allow it for access
so as soon as I did that it started
installing the PCI drivers and all that
kind of stuff and after a quick restart
I saw in video drivers right on there
which was absolutely fantastic so I
didn't have to go in and download them
directly which was great the one thing
that I did do is actually update the
Nvidia drivers because it was running
out of the drivers so I went into the
Nvidia website and I downloaded the
latest updated it just fine and it ran
perfectly so why don't we talk about
gaming performance to give you some
context I ran battlefield 1 at 1080p set
to low settings and the integrated UHD
graphics inside the stealth dished out
18 frames per second on average well
that's obvious expected considering this
is and demanding title after plugging in
the GPU
I bumped up the settings to ultra and it
was comfortably able to achieve over 80
frames per second now that's an upgrade
over watch at 1080p set to low averaged
around 72 frames per second with the UHD
graphics
mind you this isn't as demanding as
battlefield one but after plugging in
the e GPU I got around 117 frames per
second at 1080 P set 2 epic settings
lastly I ran tomb at 1080 P set to low
using the Vulcan API and I gotta be
honest it was a terrible experience the
UHD graphic struggled a lot dishing out
just a tad above 10 frames per second so
that was yeah that was that was pretty
bad but hey e GPU to the rescue right
after plugging that in I got around 110
frames per second at Ultra settings
which was just amazing now just for your
information I did decide to test the
core X with a gtx 980ti reference based
graphics card so the performance numbers
would vary depending on the type of GPU
that you decide to invest in and pair up
with the Razer core X so keep that in
mind and I guess from all the results
that we've seen so far it's obvious that
investing in an external GP solution
would make a lot more sense especially
if you're an ultrabook owner
because the performance benefits
especially when it comes to gaming is so
much better
you can cane comfortably at 1080p with
the highest possible settings without a
problem but what about real-world
applications so since I am a content
creator I do render videos for work so I
decided to perform a premier Pro render
test and the results were actually
surprising so I took a one-minute 4k
h.264 video and then exported it to the
YouTube 4k precent using Adobe Media
encoder and what's interesting is a
media encoder automatically detected
CUDA thanks to the gtx 980ti
and the you HD graphics rendered it the
whole video in roughly 12 minutes when
compared to 1 minute and 41 seconds with
the external graphics card paired with a
gtx 1080i that's 7 times faster guys
it's just incredible alright so this is
another use case scenario for the razor
core X so right now I have it plugged
into an external display because I
wanted to see if we're going to be
getting any performance benefits by
plugging or by literally just sending
the display signal to an external
display to say for beginning that extra
performance when compared to just
plugging in the blade stuff to the core
X and sending back the signal to the
display or the built-in display on the
blade stealth so that'd be interesting
to see another cool or I guess another
odd situation that I'm encountering
right over here is a lack of i/o so
right now I plugged in my a wireless
mouse and the receiver is right over
there so that's occupied one USB port
and I have an external drive plugged
into the blade itself and that's pretty
much it I can't really plug in a
mechanical wired keyboard I mean I could
go wireless
if I want to take that route but
nonetheless you would still need an
extra is report to plug in the receiver
and that is unfortunate so after
plugging in the external display to the
core X and disabling the built-in
display on the Stealth's all I did was
just close the lid on the laptop I reran
the gaming benchmarks with the same
settings so battlefield 1 at 1080p set
to ultra settings gave me ninety three
point six frames per second overwatch at
1080p again set to epic settings gave us
one hundred and thirty eight point three
frames per second and finally doom at
1080p set to ultra gaybies averaged
around 125 point three frames per second
so you can definitely see there is a
performance improvement when you
see both the integrated GPU because all
the cortex is doing is communicating or
it's creating that pci link with the
core with the blade stealth and the GPU
and then it's displaying or it's
literally just displaying an output to
an external monitor so it reduces the
bandwidth of sending back that signal
back to the display which would
obviously which gave us that extra FPS
boost so in one way it is beneficial you
obviously have to consider investing in
an external monitor and there are a lot
of prices to factor in when it comes to
you know using this hybrid set up but
just for fun I decided to test the core
X with the LG Graham 15 ultrabook and my
to my surprise I was pretty disappointed
with the gaming performance with the
grin when paired with the core X
featuring a gtx 980ti so for instance
battlefield 1 averaged around 17 point
two frames per second with the same
settings that I used for the blade
stealth I made sure that the drivers
were up-to-date I even made sure the
connection was established the 1080i was
detected by the Graham and it was really
surprising to me even when I ran
overwatch the frame rates where I had
41.5 frames per second and the doom with
the same settings I used for the blade
stealth were averaging around 61 point 5
frames per second so gaming performance
with the Graham was definitely terrible
especially when you decide to plug in an
external GPU so I think there is an
issue when it comes to the communication
between the Thunderbolt 3 cable I think
that's ideally where the issue is or it
could potentially be the integrated
cooling solution from the threat from
the grand notebook that could be causing
a bottleneck not really sure but I
wouldn't recommend you know investing in
an external GPU with if you're an LG
grand owner because the gaming
performance is definitely not impressive
and for those of you have watched my
Intel Hades Canon review I'm sure a lot
of you in the comments were wondering
how an external GP solution would work
with this nook surprise is that I've
good news is that it actually does
detect so as soon as I plugged in the
core x2 the Hades Kinyon the tombow 3
software automatically detected the core
X with the gtx 980ti
and i did run some tests so battlefield
1 at its the same settings averaged
around ninety point one frames per
second overwatch the same settings
averaged around 102
7.7 frames per second doom unfortunately
was not playable for some reason the
game engine crashed every time I've
tried launching it I've restarted the
system I made sure the drivers are
up-to-date I did all sorts of
troubleshooting stamps could be a driver
limitation there's probably something
wrong in terms of drivers especially
since this has you know until you HD
graphics along with Radeon Vega M
graphics so the fact that you know it
has to disable those GPUs and basically
just connected directly to the 1080i
could cause some driver limitations or
some driver issues so nonetheless you
could technically pair the nook with the
core X but again this by itself is an
awesome product so I just wanted to put
it out there so to conclude extol GPUs
are awesome the fact that it can harness
the power of desktop-class graphics
cards with an ultrabook
through federal three is just marvelous
now the processor could be a determining
factor in terms of performance and if
you have an ultra-low voltage processor
you may not be getting optimal
performance from a high end GPU like a
gtx 1080i with an enclosure that could
turn into a serious bottleneck the razor
core by itself is an amazing product to
work with installing the graphics card
didn't require too much of a hassle all
you had to do is just pull out the lever
popping the graphics card put in
plugging the power cables and then you
know bring back the compartment and
that's pretty much it it was just a
simple set of process and it's just a
plug-and-play solution all you have to
do is just plug in this cable from the
razor core to an ultrabook like the
stealth and the Thunderbolt 3 software
automatically they text the coax you'll
start downloading the drivers
automatically and you're ready to go
right away and that to me is just great
I mean you don't have to worry about
drivers or crashes or anything which is
which thankfully I didn't experience
while gaming so that's awesome so I
guess you know the last thing I want to
talk about is pricing because this is
certainly not a cheap investment because
the core X by itself costs $300 and if
you add the value of a graphics card
which is another thousand dollars
depending on what you want to get and of
course when you pair that up with an
ultrabook you are looking at a solid
you're looking at an investment that's
way over two thousand dollars so you're
much better off of course billion
desktop gaming PC and getting those
performance but again this is targeted
towards a certain type of audience
someone who is looking for a hybrid
solution someone who's looking for an
ultrabook with great battery life and of
course great bill quality and when they
come home if they just want to casually
sit back and relax and play some games
you know something like the cortex
commit very beneficial
all they have to do is just plug this in
plug to plug in their ultra book to the
coax and they can start gaming at higher
frame rates had higher resolutions so
that to me is just awesome I'd love to
hear your thoughts on the razor core ex
what do you guys think about external GP
enclosures do you see yourselves
utilizing something like this with an
ultrabook
if you are and if you are someone who is
you know an ultrabook owner and if you
are looking to invest into an external
GP solution let me know in the comments
