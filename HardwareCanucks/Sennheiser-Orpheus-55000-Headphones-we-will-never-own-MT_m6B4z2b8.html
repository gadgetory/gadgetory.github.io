possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX without them we wouldn't be
here
ever wonder what a headphone worth
$50,000 sound like obviously we expect a
best-in-class build quality a nice yet
cool-looking presentation and last but
not least the best audio experience on
the planet guys meet the Sennheiser
Orpheus reborn precision unlocked to the
next level the headphones come inside
this beautifully crafted Carrera marble
with eight hidden decoupled two
amplifiers and by just pressing the
volume button you're presented with the
tubes moving up and reaching their
optimal temperatures in just 20 seconds
that lets you admire the mechanical
initiating sequence while the control
knobs coming out and the best part was
the headphones revealing themselves at
an angle while the glass opens up the
tube amplifier stage is designed by a
patented ultra-high impulse amplifier
stage that is also directly integrated
into the ear cups of the headphones this
eliminates the need to amplify the
alternating voltage to high voltage at
the beginning of the cable but rather
the gold vaporized ceramic electrodes in
the headphones themselves so in simple
terms the second amplifier is built
inside the headphones what's also
interesting was that the system's MOSFET
transistors outputs a square
characteristic curve that essentially
prevents the hardest distortions that
occur in most amplifiers with bipolar
transistors we were fortunate enough to
try out the Orpheus and while the
headphones is quite large the ear cups
is purposefully tall to provide a
perfect seal you put them on and just
listen and let me tell you the sound
stage is fantastic instrument imaging is
by far the most beautiful we've ever
heard and it comes to a point where
increasing the volume
adds an extra layer of satisfaction
without even a slight hint of distortion
with an immaculate tonal property and
it's just very difficult to explain the
Orpheus is an experience from start to
finish one that makes you realise the
perfect way to spoil your ears for the
headphones that you'll never own
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
