regarded as the quality brand due to
aluminum construction which has always
been reflected in its price but it must
come to a point when you using aluminum
as the main material is no longer ideal
since the high price may not reflect on
better features or even better build
quality so let's find out of this
aluminum full tower the PC a76 justifies
its hefty price tag of $220 now if you
are into spaceship looking cases the a76
is in a completely different spectrum we
have the leonie's standard design or you
can see the lack of it's very simplistic
with black brushed aluminum all around
with only the logo at the bottom now the
overall build quality is pretty decent
how are the side panels are very thin
and are prone to bending and the last
thing you want is a big ugly dent on
your side panel the internal frame
however is well built and since
everything is aluminum the case is very
light now the front panel has venting
strips on each side for the intake fans
all over the small hard drive activity
lights the panel can also be locked it's
just an extra feature that you might
utilize if you attend Len events and
behind the panel we have two five the
quarter inch drive bays including three
140 millimeter intake fans now I would
have preferred to see an external dust
filter for the fans just to simplify the
cleaning process but instead each filter
is attached to the actual fan and Lili
has made it quite easy to remove the
front fans as they pretty much just
slide in place using these rubber
grommets now the power and reset buttons
are located at the top to keep the front
clean and the rest of the connections
are hidden behind the cover with four
USB ports and your audio jacks and also
notice the cut out for the eSATA port
meaning you can buy the optional ports
panel that includes the eSATA connection
and of course having the connections on
top of such a large case they may be
hard to reach if it's placed in the
confined space and then he also includes
the USB 2 adapter for those incompatible
motherboard
and what is a full tower without top fan
placement unfortunately we only get two
cutouts for 120mm fans meaning no native
triple rat support or any larger fans
unless user modified the side panel has
an additional duo 140 million or cut
outs to help in the thermal Dept and
included are the two dust filters to
complement the fans for the side panel
and in the back we have a bit more
venting at the top water cooling holes
and exhaust fan io area 11 PCI slots
more venting on the side and the bottom
mount the power supply with a remove
dust filter the case also stands on
rubber feet which is a must for
stability and noise reduction so taking
off the side panel we get the first
glimpse on the inside notice this is a
black on black chassis having black
aluminum interior it's actually quite
nice as we usually see this plane in
Lumina m-- this will definitely help to
calm a flash all the cables now this is
a full Tower so support for ATX and hptx
motherboards is available so first
things first
only one optical drive has to last
mounting below which this massive drive
cage then there's the graphics card
support bracket and some rubber grommets
around the motherboard tray
unfortunately these rubber grommets are
still quite poor and can't fall out
easily and léa léa should really
develop something better for a $200 case
so in total of 4 fans are included the 3
140 mm in front intake fans along with
the 120 millimeter exhaust and looking
in the back the CPU cut out is actually
quite small and will be rendered useless
for mini motherboards then we have two
cutouts at the top one for the 8 pin and
the other for routing the fans for
example then notice this large area
behind the motherboard is all bare
without any cable tie notches so I'm not
sure while Ian Lee ignored the basics of
cable management is only the front panel
cables are routed through this little
channel so overall very limited cable
management quite disappointing for a
case of this caliber now let's check out
the drive cage it supports three SSDs
that mount to the bottom of these
dividers and in total of 12 3.5 inch
drives can be installed using provided
screws in rubber
Komets you simply slide the drive in
place and using the drive lock sort of
have been the staple for Lee and Lee you
can secure the 3.5 inch drives now this
hole mounting system works great it
prevents vibration and is relatively
hassle-free however the design of the
cage is questionable for a few reasons
well first it is not modular so there's
plenty of resistance on the airflow even
if you're only using a couple of drives
second the drive cage is not removable
unless you take out your power tools
third there are no fan mounting options
on the side which holds great potential
for that extra cooling and finally
probably the biggest issue is the
clearance for those power SATA cables
for the SSDs the mounted drives are
slightly more pushed in so using only
the end tip will allow the connector to
fit so there's plenty of practical
issues with the drive cage and we really
hope Leonie can justify its future
pricing not an aluminum alone and
finally getting on the assembly Leonie
includes the motherboard thumb screws
which are a lot easier to use and just
look how spacious the interior is it's a
great advantage for enthusiast hardware
unfortunately the space is not
efficiently used for example there's
plenty of room at the bottom for an
intake fan which is not utilized there's
also no other space to route the cables
from behind the motherboard tray but the
three cable cutouts now installing our
11 half inches card the case pretty much
devours anything you put inside of it
and we have clearance up to 15 inches
now the last thing I want to mention is
this support bracket we have different
height levels which will depend on the
location of your GPU and by using these
three plastic pieces two of which will
clip on the bracket you no longer have
the case with a sagging graphics card
this feature will probably not be useful
to many unless you own the heavy beast
of a triple slot card now the GPU
bracket will help to separate dual
triple and even quad card setups however
due to some motherboard layouts you may
encounter problems fitting dividers
between two closely placed cards
now fully assembled first notice the
stretched audio cable which could be an
issue for some motherboards and the
interior cleaned up pretty well with the
use of modular cables and coming around
to the back it looks pretty decent
although I can't imagine it can get
quite messy with a heavier build so to
wrap things up the PC a76 has plenty of
potential so if you're looking to mod
this guy you will definitely be
satisfied with the end result now the
main advantage here is the size it will
need 12 inch cards for breakfast and
have the e ATX motherboards on the side
and also great the amount of drives it
can support all topped with a hassle
free assembly however I keep scratching
my head too while Ian Lee decided to
leave out so many useful features like
modular drive cages different fan
options for the top and side panels and
really leave us hanging in the wiring
department so summing up all these
features that would have made this a
killer case it just does not add up to
the asking price so what are your
thoughts on the case leave your
responses in the comments below or in
the hardwick NOx forums and we'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
