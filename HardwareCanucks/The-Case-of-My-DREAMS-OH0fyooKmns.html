we saw at CES this year just landed here
in the studio it's the new BM Lee let's
see if we can feel the difference ah the
new O 11 dynamic from LAN Lee I have
both black and white versions I feel
like I'm gonna go with the white one for
now Wow
man I spent so much time be rolling good
thing there's boot sequence to catch me
up on all the news here I'll write you
people so the PCO 11 from lien Li is
finally here I'm super excited and that
potentially might replace my current
enclosure if I'm you know feeling
optimistic about its air flow options so
let's reel right into this finally an
ultra slim body keyboard with mechanical
red or blue switches designed and
perfected for work and play that the
Sorel Graham XS evolved to fit right in
check it out below alright so I'm going
to cut straight to the chase
I think Liam Lee is going in the right
direction with the O 11 dynamic and this
is my favorite case yet from the company
you can kind of tell this is Liam Lee's
chassis based on this dual chamber
design but they've almost completely
moved away from the aluminum so the
entire frame is just a steel glass
panels and this small brushed aluminum
section on the right side of the front
panel it especially looks good on the
white model and I appreciate this
elegant touch away from your finger
prints and it's exactly this material
choice is how they're able to achieve a
super competitive price point of 129
dollars that is available in two colors
with the black one going for a special
pre-order price of $99 for the next two
weeks so check it out below but I'm
really happy to see alia me being
aggressive and branch out into the sub
$200 market but what's interesting about
this frame design is the lack of any
exterior branding so they're clearly
confident in this product but the
inclusion of this plaque on the inside
reveals their collaboration with their
Bauer and talented German overclocker
who has been involved in this whole
redesign of the O 11 so thank you Roman
now if you're seeing this type of dual
frame for the first time and wondering
why the front panel is covered in glass
this is actually not another fad to kill
airflow as the interior is actually well
designed for radiator support which is
why all sides have this cool ventilation
pattern so a quick note about the white
frame there is slight color mismatch
between the metal side panel and the
plastic case feed but otherwise
attention to details awesome
like refined edges on the exterior
plating it comes
chrome IO to match the aluminum plus the
type C Gen 2 port is here with
appropriate motherboard connector plus
the glass is only tinted without the
color cast and the only compromise here
will be handling because the case
doesn't have anything in the front to
grab it by it like normally so these
side openings are kind of there so you
can grab it like so and move it around I
really like their approach to side panel
installation so all three sides utilize
a drop-in approach with small inserts up
top and at the bottom that tightly fit
the panel the so it doesn't like wobble
around the frame that is further secured
by the top panel with convenient captive
thumb screws this way all sides remain
super clean so there are no a thumb
screw sticking out but you will need to
remove two panels minimum to gain access
on the interior up top we have a dust
filter that sits inside the small cavity
to not interfere with the panel above it
you can mount a 360 rod no problem or to
80 mil and I kind of wish that this was
a bracket to simplify installation
outside of the case and one thing you'll
notice is the lack of any fan mounts at
the rear because this entire motherboard
section is slimmer than usual and moving
inside I hope you'll see similar layouts
as this in the future so one big chamber
for the main hardware including a ATX
motherboard support a 360 rat at the
bottom although to SSD caddies must be
removed and unfortunately you cannot
remount them anywhere else on the case
and it does block for PCI slots and so
this is where the side radiator mount is
important a 360 can go in here without
interfering with the motherboard nor the
GPU because the mounting tray is pushed
out closer to the side panel and you can
still have a 360 right up top with a 360
on the side and I appreciate that all
the ATX motherboard standoffs are
pre-installed but the two bottom cable
cutouts are bare so only the large ones
get the rubber treatment I do appreciate
the black and white PCI slot stuff
without the visual complement of this
white and black frame and so the one
major advantage of moving the power
supply area and storage at the back with
this dual chamber design is height look
at this the PCO 11 is the same height as
the 275 R from Corsair which I would
consider to be like your standard size
mid Tower look at them
they're exactly identical in height yet
because we don't have any power supply
shout out here
we have all that additional room
upstairs for radiator support we do have
to acknowledge that the case is wider
because of this dual chamber layout but
look at that it's not that much wider
than your standard mid Tower so having
the power supply rotated in this rear
chamber is actually pretty genius really
hoping more companies start to take this
route for frame design in the future the
right side panel has to dust filters
once spanning the power supply area and
the other for the fan area and in the
rear chamber we get a cover bracket the
only piece actually to include a Lian Li
logo very discreet I like it that can
also house dual SSDs or a three and a
half inch drive and there's a proper
drive gauge above the power supply with
two Drive caddies I also like how the
side fan area has enough clearance for
push-pull mount or let's say you want a
thicker radiator on the inside you can
still mount a fan on the outside of that
fan mount now I'm not sure why but this
case supports dual power supplies one in
the bottom here and another over here if
you remove the drive cage and then the
thing is if you have this drive bracket
the top power supply has to be a little
bit shorter in order to have
compatibility with cables whereas the
bottom one has this cutout here so you
know power supply length is not really
an issue but yeah dual power supply is
inside this frame if you want to combine
multiple power supplies to potentially
power your system that is of course an
optional alright so that's the overview
now let's build this sucker
and so here's the finished system
I just might transition my coffee like
machine in here
with the white and black hardware
because the experience was super smooth
the 360 all-in-one is perfect fit on the
side
even if my GPU extended beyond the
motherboard you know even further I'd
still be ok because the motherboard is
high enough to clear and starter fans
and the radiator on the side the side
cable exit is absolutely not a problem
but the one above the motherboard tray
can't really sticks out in this white
frame and removing it helps a bit
visually and with my single radiator as
you can see the top feels kind of empty
I would definitely install fans up there
for exhaust and intake fans at the
bottom just to drive some fresh air for
the GPU and this frame for an air cooler
would not really make sense without some
front intake so the dynamic version is
aimed for water cooling only I do want
to mention this team group memory that
I've been using for a cup of builds now
it looks absolutely fantastic not just
in this like white chassis but also
combine that with a white motherboard it
will look absolutely amazing this like
laser-like effect coming down with the
LEDs looks awesome and it's all
compatible so I can control it directly
from my asus motherboard so if you guys
are interested in this team group memory
check it out below now in terms of cable
management man what an upgrade over the
original 11 so here not only do we have
so much just space to put any of your
cables behind the motherboard tray or in
from the power supply but we have these
nice large rubber grommets so you can
pass anything without any issues and
cable tie points spread kind of all
around here so you can kind of secure
everything to the case and make it you
know it doesn't have to be super flat
but this works the only thing is you
have to route your let's say cables
behind the power supply before you
actually populate the power supply
because otherwise you won't be able to
route anything behind it and the only
inconvenience with this whole cable
management thing would be this drive
bracket because well they've removed the
swivel joint that allows the bracket to
pop out you can you know route your
cables so now it's kind of standalone
attached at the bottom and the top so
you need to pre route your drives with
before actually installing this thing
back into the case also I want to say
that the SSD mount is not ideal because
right now the SATA power cable is kind
of on an angle because this SSD is
completely flat against the bracket so I
wish that we had slightly thicker rubber
pieces so that we could offset the SSD
higher to avoid this SATA
incompatibility with mounting I do love
how this cleans up though this drive
bracket certainly covers up that entire
section from the power supply for this
really cool look
obviously I'll populate the side panel
back on there but for example if you
want to put the glass panel on there
because they are backwards compatible
you know you still have this really
clean aesthetic on this side - all right
so now it's time to do some preliminary
temperature testing with this case I've
only had it for two days so I would like
to spend more time on the temperature
side of things so a second video will be
coming up so let me know what type of
configuration for radiator and fans
you'd like to see tested so that's gonna
come in the second video but right now
let's see what type of temperature we
get we'll just exhaust the air without
360 all in one see what our CPU and GPU
stays at after an hour
all right so after 50 minutes of torture
testing my temperatures are pretty
impressive here with the CPU remaining
at 72 degrees Celsius and just to give
you a little comparison that is only two
degrees hotter than me testing it on the
case that has no front panel so having
zero intake and it's performing just as
good as it would on the case without the
front panel that's pretty good but also
impressive is the GPU below 80 degree
Celsius at low so I'm like 78 79 degrees
Celsius which is awesome all the cases
that I've tested this card with ran
about 84 degrees Celsius so really good
temperatures I don't know what's
happening inside but really can't wait
to populate more fans to see how we can
improve that airflow and in my second
video I'll also be testing out their
vertical GPU bracket so this is an
optional accessory it sells for $60
which is a little pricey so the thing is
because there are no like vertical PCI
brackets on here you have to replace the
entire wall of the PCI so that gives you
some limitations but for my particular
scenario with this blower style GPU
we'll see if it makes any difference in
cooling and so yeah I'll test it in the
second video alright so for my
concluding remarks all I gotta say is
damn liam lee well done the name was
still kind of weird PCO 11 dynamic but
it does improve on all fronts versus the
original and the price point of 129
that's pretty damn good for a dual
chamber layout a water cooling ready
enclosure that looks beautiful it's
elegant you know it's it's different and
I just feel like they're pushing towards
that pre order price of $99 and if this
case launched at $99 that would have
been so good but still for the black
version for the next two weeks if you
guys are interested
make sure to preorder it to save you
some cash and we haven't actually given
out in the word in a while because
everything just feels kind of stagnant
but this feels fresh and we're giving it
the hard knocks
the input award alright everyone this is
it for me thanks much for watching let
me know what you think on the PC or
lemon dynamic and I can't wait to show
you what the air will deliver later
