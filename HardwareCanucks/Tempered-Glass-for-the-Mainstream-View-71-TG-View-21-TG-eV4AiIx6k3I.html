fantex schoolmaster and MSI what's up
guys some creatures are Canucks we are
Thermaltake right now and a very
interesting case popped up here this is
the view 71 PG I think what Thermaltake
is trying to go is a approaches from a
full tempo glass perspective just like
we saw in the course at 570 X but I
actually think that they've done
something different here that makes this
a better enclosure in terms of
functionality in the visuals it's a
little bit more chunkier we got same
kind of angular designs with tempo glass
corners here that have been smoothed out
and now the side panels have a swivel
mechanism they still sit on two thumb
screws to the front that have nice deep
rubber pieces that can be removed if you
want to get access to the maintain light
show yourself a side panel that swivels
temple glass panel that swivels that's
very good that can also be removed now
because there's so much so much glass
around you definitely have to think
about air flow and so this one will come
with two fans one 148 the front one at
the back that will be blue ring friends
so some from the thermal take as for the
i/o we got four years B's let's turn
this back on audio reach the button a
power button Skype on the right side is
also illuminated in blue to go with the
match with the blue LED fan that's going
to be included I honestly think that
they should gone with some maybe like
RGB fans but obviously the price point
is very difficult to achieve if they are
including some RGB fans so the price
point here is like 159 so for so much
glass you can see if that's something
that you value plus because of the
interior they leave everything pretty
much open lots of room for radiant
installation and pump installation at
the bottom the power supply shroud is
non-evidence so that's kind of a bummer
I was hoping to see something built in
there but the vertical GPU riser is
there so you can house your GPU in this
format and show it off if your water
cooling and really thermal take is just
really pushing hard on the whole water
cooling agenda and I think the view 71
is a good case to start a 360 minimal
radiator can be supported at the top and
at the front and also on the side as you
can see the fan mounts are located at
the back so you can install radiator in
this way and push-pull now because of
their approaching this from like a more
open perspective the the tempered glass
in the back is slightly extended from
the case therefore if you are installing
radiator facing in this direction the
airflow is actually fine because there's
enough there's no gap between the
glasses between all the glass - for
airflow to exit now that is one thing
that you have to think about you have
quite an open interior so dust
filtration is a concern of course but I
guess with so much glass that is
expected alright so for cable management
at the back now because it's a temple
glass panel everything is exposed I was
hoping maybe we would see like some type
of covers that we saw earlier at Kula
master today but here because the
airflow will be entering this panel so
it's open on purpose but of course it's
not going to be 100% coming through
because of the glass but here lots of
room to to work with in terms of cabling
stashing cables here with some we got
some rubber grommets a a fan hub and
check out the top here so one
interesting perspective here is that the
fan bracket can be either installed
slightly offset towards the side panel
or it can be centered depending on your
configuration and looks like there isn't
much in terms of cable management here
to help you with that but these are all
RGB connections and there so that's the
consequence of trying to connect so many
things and so the view 71 TG as a
concept enclosure to show off your water
cooling abilities to show off your you
know RGB goodness and any lighting
possibilities can do is a very good
place to start especially because
tempered glass is visible it's not very
dark and it's not tinted which I like I
like the sort of natural stance but of
course approaching this sort of very
open the closure so you have to think
about air flow and thus dust buildup
especially since everything here is kind
of open I would have liked to see a
power supply shroud in here just so we
can cover some of those cables and
that's one of the major I think
challenges that would you would face
building is something like this here
management you really have to know what
you're doing in order to make things
pretty again just because everything is
so open so what do you guys think of the
view 31 how do you like all the glass is
it too revealing for you let us know in
the comments below but there's one other
enclosure that we saw here that's very
exciting and I'm excited to see how it
will do on the market it's the view 31
PG budget enclosure oriented at $69
price point tempered glass on both side
panels and very compact enclosure good
power supply shroud and that seems to be
very nice accommodation for a radiator
at the front which is 360 millimeters
and it does will compete with like like
so s340 elite for example and I think
many people will love the fact that we
have tempered glass on both side panels
and we have do it two of these so the
view 21 sorry and the core g21
basically the exact the same enclosure
in the frame aside from having a
different front panel so more airflow
oriented and more visual oriented
alright so the tempered glass guys look
at this there's a little little focus on
the bottom of the panel so it allows you
to not really the panel will not fall
off the hinges it allows you to place it
in there and comfortably place the glass
panel on the hinges a nice smart move by
Thermaltake I appreciate that on the
inside if you come around here either
look we got 360 monitor radio the
Front's everything in the front here is
open so you don't have to fiddle around
with trying to decide if you want to
open up this area I do like that for a
budget enclosure that's very good we
have two SSD brackets here two more at
the back that can be installed on this
whole little panel there nice cutouts
that are not rubber ground that not
rubber grommet it but that's kind of
like my only feedback here is that you
know no rubber grommets but for a budget
enclosure it's pretty good it's pretty
good and so the view 21 and the court 21
really proved that tempered glass cases
don't have to be expensive I'm happy
that the thermal take is coming out with
these options it's going to be competing
very well with the s3 40 perhaps with
the s3 40 elite and the new P 300 from
fan tech so let us know what you guys
liked the most and I think there's
potential with these cases simply
because everything instead of sort of
covered
and from the looks of it and me handling
the case they feel like really good
quality especially with tempered glass
panels and those little hooks that
allows you to catch the panel before you
insert it so guys that is this from
thermaltake I'm a Dimitri's however
connects thanks much for watching we'll
see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
