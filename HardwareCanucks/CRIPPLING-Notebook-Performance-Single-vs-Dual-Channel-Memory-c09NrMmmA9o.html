with an apology with regards to my
recent review on the gigabyte arrow 15X
gaming laptop if you're actually
interested in checking it out
link will be right over here but there's
something that I've really missed on
that review that some of you did bring
up in the comments and that is the
memory configuration which I'll get to
in a bit
now just to quickly go over the specs of
this laptop it features an RTX 2070 max-q
GPU an Intel Core i7 8th generation
processor and it has a really fast and
me me and 16 and 16 gigabytes of memory
clocked at 2666 megahertz the catch is
it's running in single channel mode so
it's a single 16gb dimm that's
populated in that one slot it comes with
two slots but one of them is unpopulated
so that actually got me thinking as to
would dual channel mode really bang
bring a huge performance boost on
notebooks because we've known or we've
seen that with desktops there is a
difference of running you know system
with single channel memory and of course
dual channel memory but I really wanted
to test out and see if it would apply to
no but which it technically should but I
really wanted to say for myself so I
decided to do just that and the results
are really eye-opening so let's get into
it but first a quick message from our
sponsor the new Razer Blade 15 is a
machine for people who know exactly what
they want when you need a reliable
keyboard and one custom lighting when
you need an accurate display and what's
insanely fast 144 Hertz refresh rate
when you need a portable machine and
want a gorgeous thin aluminum unibody
in the world's smallest 15.6 inch gaming
laptop when you need powerful gaming
hardware to truly dominate with GeForce
rtx the Razer Blade 15 when you need
the power for anything you do and want
nothing to hold you back check out the
configuration you want down below
alright so to make things fair I want to
make sure to run these comparisons with
you know the same clock speeds as well
as timings because that's important too
so the one that comes with the air 15X
is a Samsung module that's running at 20
666 megahertz with timings of 19 19 19
and 43 and again it's a single you know
16gb module so I had to obviously do
a little bit of digging in the office to
find the exact same capacity except
running in dual channel sticks
running at the clock speed and
the same timings and luckily I found
this it's a ram axle 16 gigabyte kit
that i popped out of the Lenovo Legion Y740
gaming laptop and it also happens to
run at the same clock speed which is
2666 megahertz and the same timings as a
Samsung memory that's coming out of the
air 15X with that out of the way all I
did was basically rerun the benchmarks
that is three times on every single game
and I took an average of that and I also
did some video rendering test to see if
it actually makes a difference and why
don't we take a look at it and as you
can see there is a significant
improvement in terms of game performance
so with overwatch we're getting about
seven percent increase you know from 140
frames per second to 150 frames per
second
apex legends didn't really yield that
much of increase but I think that's more
of an game optimization thing but what
battlefield one the increase was against
massive I mean we went from around 80
frames per second to just a tad below
110 frames per second which is just
amazing then we have doom running at
1080p set to the Vulcan API and we got
roughly 20% increase in terms of frame
rates and then lastly we have metro
Exodus running in 1080p high and as you
can see the performance boost is just
massive finally I did want to run some
rendering tests so I did take this
12-minute 4k project and I exported it
to the U to 4k preset using Adobe Media
encoder and the results are just amazing
I mean you are really saving some time
while 2 minutes is not that significant
it you know when you do longer projects
when your rendering longer projects on a
notebook it really does add up and I
think it's important especially when
you're thinking about configuring gaming
laptop or just to not look in general to
make sure that it comes in dual channel
mode so the takeaway from this video is
pretty simple first of all I completely
missed out on that single channel
configuration on my Ruby videos so again
I do want to take this time to apologize
for that but it also it brings up a
really good point with regards to how
brands tend to offer their gaming
laptops in different configurations and
the one thing that you really have to
pay close attention to is whether or not
if they're providing it in single
channel mode or dual channel mode some
brands don't do it I mean especially
when I looked at the
Phoenix's website they just don't even
mention as to whether or not if their
notebooks are running in single or dual
channel mode the same story goes with
Asus but when you look at companies like
Dell Lenovo or even Razer they do
mention that the RAM capacity or the RAM
configurations that are running in dual
channel mode so I really want to hope I
hope that brands actually takes
something away from this video and that
is to be more transparent with regards
to the configuration on their notebook
and if you're actually looking to spend
anywhere between a thousand to three
thousand dollars on a notebook you want
to make sure they're getting the best
out of the money and single channel
memory can definitely cripple the
performance of your notebooks so I would
highly recommend doing your research and
of course making sure that you are
getting the best out of what you're
paying so that's it for me guys thank
you so much for watching make sure to
