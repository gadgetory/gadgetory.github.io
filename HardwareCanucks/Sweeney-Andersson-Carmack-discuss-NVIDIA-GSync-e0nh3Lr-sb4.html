to come and talk to you about Jesus now
the reason why we invited these three
people Juve ZZ Top and Hollywood
beauties it's because they also happen
to be some of the most important
contributors to modern 3d graphics I
think as soon as you realize who they
are there will be no question that they
have contributed more demonic computer
graphics and just about any money the
mass contribution to the number of
people exposing them to computer
graphics if not for their work our
reward point have been possible if not
for their work our contribution wouldn't
have been possible these three game
developers are true artists in every
brain amazing technologists in their
contribution to the industry to the
world is now completely unquestioned it
has never been that all three of them
have been in one place at the same time
these three luminaries i am sure are
your heroes they're surely mine and this
is the first time that they in fallen in
love simultaneously with a technology
that they believe is as important to the
future computer graphics that they
wanted to come and share the stage
together and tell you guys how they feel
about this revolutionary breakthrough
we call GC ladies and gentlemen can we
bring out our special guests
sweetie welcome what do you guys think
on talk about cramsey morning can the
muse getting up yeah these guys are
really really amazing now if we cantle
up when you get when you get John Johan
and Tim on a stage can we just all agree
we're not going to rehearse they're
going to say whatever they are going to
say okay and that's that's really great
and I want them to tell you how they
feel about this technology so maybe
anyone is doing for them from this side
out so it tends to stand out here so
they can all see it and you want to do
you know what it is Carly they're a
little awestruck by the southern Bertie
of you guys so you know I know I know
it's not I notice you guys you guys
don't feel you're Brad Pitt but to them
you want
plus two months you are alright so now
here on the shadows and so so so ten
what we just when we start first of all
some of the challenges in computer
graphics I think I think the audience
would love to hear about your reaction
jisuk move aside what do you think of
our communications of g-sync you know
that now that's what he needs to happen
so most questions this one of the
students of gravity name is what it is
infants not recognizing benchmarks but
it's currently important two layers
experience and detectives all games an
opportunity to the gene that previously
had to work commencing heart is make a
lot of sacrifices to give advice today
six defendants happened when she said
you can hit any reasonable frame rate
and potentially get to take level
Instagram pics it's one of those magical
moments to play a game and the CM is
created is completely free of architect
yeah it's like is in my zone for the
first time just having this very
seamless experience you can't recognize
instantly what's happening this makes it
so nice but you can see it as orders
above the previous experience Wii U is
going to happen again how's ur game
developer when you have technology like
this how would you think about it
differently everything freezes up the
game developers take much more immersive
experiences without this
we have to make you know if you're
aiming a steady 60 frames a second in
the last generation we would have to
absolutely assure that every single
frame its target where is what do you
think we have a lot more with over on
each side because in this continuum of
performance anywhere between 30 to
hundreds of pages happened early Mabel
continue to operate smoothly and without
apartment that's cold you know what were
you think tell us tell us your feelings
about G sanken and as you think about G
saying what it for the implications to
the future of gaming and how would you
develop Kingston point it's pretty
awesome it's really it changes the
reception quite a bit and I was really
surprised by that why should you see in
action which we were terrible well it is
that the best possible experience you
get a gift before running 100 FPS in the
game when typically without decent of
people do that's sort of what we used to
be the best possible type of experience
but with this well you don't it's
continually changes the actual
perception of the picture you see a
continuous stream over something that
you might actually interprets as a
pitcher and really like that were
surprised by how my left to interpolate
tended information and we tried it out
and just that
or more people in nice to just as
everyone this is graduating what
everything's going to happen to this one
comes with widespread attention I think
one thing that has not been reflected in
engage the Timbers int'l bit of okay we
design games for some specific budget
other games nowadays are not really the
games you played 15 years ago or even 10
years ago 25 years ago is now are these
massive experiences of very different
types of environments that happen to me
sometimes you have a cutscene and
sometimes you have to adjust our feel
that we're traveling through and
sometimes here you have massive amounts
of explosions and it's essentially
possible to design a game for a fixed
frame rate today and you don't want to
get to make massive compromises in all
areas even if we think I'll remember all
game runs at 60fps you have to run
rather than 114 he'll sacrifice a little
budget for six that Kathleen predicted
are immersed and this what we don't
really need to do the same way sure you
probably don't want to jump to bunch of
fragrance but if the storytelling and
national game experiences are that
before
and this technology is actually much
easier to make the games they actually
want an expensive want and still again
we need to get a picture of Turkish
that's really cool fanatical about
displays as John Doe easy for that is
because he's putting them awfully close
to his eyes these days and when he saw
he wanted to come out and share with
sure his opinion with you guys it is his
first reaction because John what do you
think anything's going to happen first
hicistes had willful blind spot to the
artifacts of Terry and Jennifer where we
can talk and try to get people excited
donkeys are relatively subtle effects
like gamma correction and subsurface
scattering and some of these things that
we can spend tons of you know flops on
and kind of point out squid say this is
really important while why do you know
covering our eyes over the huge Gator
line racing up and down the screen it
was really really egregious artifacts
and yeah I've been a lot more sensitive
about this for a long time we did make
thing the decision to make those
compromises our last title with new 60
frames per second which meant that we
didn't have this fifteen twenty percent
cushion and we had
to make sure that we wouldn't I see that
we would only very rarely wind up
missing that which meant that for me
given amount of processing power
targeted for maybe twenty percent or
more in many cases a lot more was just
left completely unused because we were
at the maximum 40 60 frames per second
and that was important for the
smoothness that it gave us we had to
make a lot of compromises to make that
happen and being able to use all
graphics power with you got to unlock it
from 60 and open up towards the higher
frame rates and to be able to make it a
smooth continuum there rather than
dropping from 60 count to 30 and one
huge lurch are suffering the stuttering
or suffering the tearing it's just a
better experience in almost every single
game and benefit from this we're being
able to go over 60 frames per second
lines up bringing in additional benefits
and once we start crossing something
magic numbers above 90 95 heading
towards 120 and we started dating with
the little persistence builder and so it
makes things and digital benefits that
you haven't received here today so I
mean that you sync technology involves
not just the variable refresh but also
is a remote assistance which would have
additional benefits as can start moving
towards those higher agreements but the
only way you're going to get things
towards those higher frame rates is why
having this smooth incremental path
video we could ship an old name repaid
like doom 3 bfg they can run a hundred
twenty frames per second but the only
way you're going to start seeing
absolute bottom triple eight
is if they can creep up and at 16 that
70 then somebody's got a reason to get
some crazy to elicit as an ally system
that's going to go ahead and spend
another five hundred dollars on video
cards but oh my god it was this at 120
per second load resistance that's going
to be awesome absolutely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
