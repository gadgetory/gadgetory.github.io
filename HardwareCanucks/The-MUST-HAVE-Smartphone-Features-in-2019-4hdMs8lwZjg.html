connects and this is the Samsung Galaxy
S nine so this is the BlackBerry key -
alright good people so it is time for
the one plus six this is ninety days
with the Galaxy Note nine the Google
pixel three so in this video I want to
share all my ups and downs with the most
expensive smartphone I have ever bought
but but but what would be the perfect
Android smartphone for 2019 let's talk
about that right after this the new
master liquid ml ai a liquid coolers
from cooler master come in both 120 and
240 millimeter variants now with
addressable RGB LEDs both the fans and
the pump that can be controlled via this
hub with options to adjust the lighting
effects and speed along with the ability
to control them through the respect to
the motherboard software check out the
ML 120 and ML 240 ra iOS down below
alright so the first thing that needs to
be addressed is the design and handling
because throughout 2018 pretty much
every smartphone that I've come out
almost looks similar to one another I
mean nothing really stood out to me the
most except for a few exceptions because
you know if you look at a smart phones
or the smartphone market in general
every smartphone came with some sort of
a glass back which obviously is prone to
cracks and it also scratches easily it's
also slippery so it has it's all
drawbacks but I really liked what Google
did with their pixel 3 device that came
with a frosted matte texture at the back
that gave it a little bit of a grip but
also it looked really nice in person so
I'd love to see companies sort of take a
different approach when it comes to the
material finish on the back so that it
not only gives you a better grip but you
can also you know look at it and admire
it in person when you're you know just
handling the device in general now an
honorable mention has to go to the
BlackBerry key - and I get it no one
really buys blackberry these days but I
mean the textured finish of the back
really gives you a sense of confidence
when you're using the device and
honestly I really enjoyed my time just
handling that unit in the first place
moving on to quality components and this
might be a weird one but hear me out for
a second you see you even see all these
Android smartphones that have come out
in the market that come with the wow
factor that just automatically makes you
want to hold it and feel in your hand so
that you can not worry about the rest
well the thing is some brands tend to
cheap out on a few other components on
the inside that just takes away from the
whole experience
I'm not kicking some wooden microphones
because it is an essential increment or
I guess an important element of a
smartphone because you are making phone
calls you're recording video here and
there so you want to make sure that you
have a really good microphone to
actually pick up good audio and the bus
of the year has to go to the pixel 3
because this in my opinion has the worst
microphone ever I mean you really can't
take proper video with it sometimes you
really can make proper phone calls so
you know I'd love to see brands
implement better microphones and just
little things that can help elevate that
experience and just complete the device
in the first place now I'm not sure if
this is just me but I would love to see
Android phones come up with an alert
slider on the side so that you can
quickly toggle between your ring your
wipe right or your silent mode so that
you can easily you know switch between
those different modes rather than having
to you know fiddle around with software
or the operating system so that would be
an excellent addition because the 60 has
it and I honestly can't go back to a
device that does not have it because
it's an awesome feature next up is the
display and having looked back at phones
Lemmon launched in 2018 it's
unfortunately very difficult to
distinguish one from the other because
of the knotch implemented at the top
it's sad I mean I get it everyone's
trying to follow apple's footsteps but
you know it would have been really nice
to see brands sort of take that notch
implementation a step further by making
a little bit more minimal I love what
oneplus did with a 60 with the tear drop
notch approach I mean it looks
absolutely gorgeous and minimalistic
doesn't take away from the whole content
consuming experience and I absolutely
love it but when you look at things like
the ones found on the Google pixel 3
excel it just doesn't make any sense now
word on the street is that next year
slash ships might feature punch hole
displays and honestly I just I don't
know what to say
because it's a hole on the screen and it
just I'm pretty sure it's gonna be a
distracting element but I'm gonna let
you guys timing on that in the comments
down below now we obviously have to talk
about the display technology whether
that be IPS or AMOLED I mean everyone
has their own preference some people
love the dark contrast supersaturated
images to whom AMOLED might be the way
to go
whereas other people might prefer the
more natural look that you want to be
able to see which is where IPS comes
into play but I'd love to see brands
Prue and tune the brightness on this
place for next year's phones bill so
that what people can actually view
content a little bit more comfortably
outdoors I love what LG did with the g7
thank you it's a different color matrix
within the display in this case it's RGB
W instead of the standard RGB so that
means there is a separate white channel
for the backlit to pass through
resulting in consistent color uniformity
as well as increased brightness I mean
we're talking a thousand nits which is
pretty awesome now another thing that I
would love to see brands implement on
their displays for next year would be to
implement high refresh rates we've been
seeing this with gaming phones lately I
mean the razor phone - with its hundred
twenty Hertz screen is just absolutely
phenomenal
once you go 120 Hertz it's really hard
to go back I mean the experience is just
so fluid and I just just now getting
through that uy just makes a phone feel
faster and it's really hard to go back
to a device featuring just a standard 60
Hertz screen so we've seen this with the
ROG phone with an AMOLED display going
all the way up to 90 Hertz so it's
definitely possible but I'd love to see
it on phones or at least majority the
phone's flagship devices for next year
also fun facing speakers please because
I get the whole point of brands trying
to make their phones look more
futuristic by going the whole bezel-less
approach but in my opinion the pixel of
three strikes the right balance between
screen to body ratio because not only
gives you a bigger display in a compact
form factor but it also gives you two
speakers of the front so content
consuming experience is just so much
better and listen to music of course
it's awesome so I'd love to see more
phones for next year come up with
front-facing speakers okay so this next
factor is an important one and that is
the software experience because as much
as awesome as your hardware might be if
the software experience isn't as good
enough then the whole experience just
doesn't add up it doesn't complete the
whole equation so I'd love to see brands
keep it as simple as they can simple and
clean don't give us a lot of blur and
duplicate apps just keep it simple and
give us a few customization options
within the UI and a few other general
items personally speaking
oxygen OS and the oneplus 60 and other
oneplus devices has surprised me by a
big margin I mean the amount of
customization you get with this
particular OS is just insane for
instance there is a dedicated dark mode
built-in which translates really well
into other apps like messages phone etc
you can also change the
excellent color switch between different
navigation buttons heck even customized
a call vibration patent which is just
insane and there are a whole lot of
other gesture controls baked into the
oneplus 16 and I absolutely love using
this device over the Google pixel 3
which is just insane and of course I'd
love to see brands guarantee software
updates for at least the next three
years so that the next version of
Android comes out you're not left out of
the equation especially after spending
at least a thousand plus dollars on a
device that just can't give you
guaranteed software updates it just
doesn't make any sense
LG and Samsung I'm looking at you guys
because when you look at one plus as a
brand you know the 60s continually
receiving software updates but heck even
the 3t has been receiving software
updates since day one which is pretty
awesome next up is battery life and
unfortunately there hasn't been a
significant improvement in that
department for the last four or five
years I mean an average Android
smartphone in 2018 would still last you
for about a day or so but I'd love to
see brands experiment on that tech for
next year so perhaps we'll see something
that's revolutionizing so it changes the
way how we use our devices I am also
really thankful for you know
technologies like warped charge and -
charge from one plus or even while we
supercharge that just gets you up and
running in no time so you don't have to
worry about you know running out of
battery very soon because fast charging
is certainly a thing now but also I'd
love to see wireless charging becoming a
standard on most devices I think it's
almost getting it to be a standard right
now in 2018 but when I look at a phone
like oneplus and they're 16
you know this phone doesn't have
wireless charging and I really wish it
did but it doesn't so I loved that to be
a standard for next year
moving on to camera performance and I
would love to see Android smartphones in
2019 come with a wide-angle lens so you
can play around with a different
perspective when you're shooting
outdoors or just playing around with
mobile photography that's one of the
features that I really loved with LG's
flashing devices so I'd love to see that
being a feature in 2019 but you know if
you give us a wide angle a standard lens
and a telephoto lens that would be
highly appreciated I know while we does
that with their main 20 pro
but I'd love to see that being a
standard in flagship smartphones for
2019 the next thing that I want to talk
about is software processing because LG
Samsung Huawei and even one-plus tends
to you know over processes the image and
just
away from the full potential of the
sensor so I'd love to see Brian's
minimize on that department I mean a
good example would be a recent video
that I did with the oneplus 60 I
installed the Google camera port on this
device and it just totally changed the
way and how I took pictures with this
phone the difference is just Dane
noncompetitive stock camera app you get
more detail
you know the shadows are awesome there's
just better dynamic range with this
particular device and it's more
contrasting and I just love the way how
it looks with the Google camera port
compared to the stock gaps so certainly
minimize on software processing
Department for next year lastly this
might be too much to ask but manual
focusing for video mode I mean it's a
lot to ask I get it but it would be nice
to see that on a phone in 2019 all right
so I'm gonna wrap things up with a few
extras particularly I just want to talk
about in display fingerprint readers
because we initially saw that with the
oneplus 16 a few of their phones
primarily the 60 because it's now
available in the states but it's still
first gen tech and it still has a long
way to go it's not as fast as a physical
reader at the back but with the recent
Qualcomm summit we saw that the new 855
processor has support for a 3d Sonic
sensor so it actually you just act it's
the accuracy when it comes to reading a
fingerprint is just a lot more better
compared to the first two in tech that
we're seeing with oneplus and a few
other devices so I'm sure the brands
will tend to implement in display
fingerprint readers on their devices for
next year it's definitely cool tech but
my only concern is replaced ability
because if something goes wrong if your
screen cracks I mean what's the process
of replacing that right because the
sensors underneath the glass and is it
gonna get a Z is it gonna cost you an
arm and leg that's my that's my question
and finally I just want to comment on
pricing for devices because
unfortunately phones are getting
expensive year by year thousand dollars
is sort of the standard now when it
comes to the flagship premium smartphone
but when you look at a device like the
oneplus 60 that costs less than $600 it
offers all the basic features that you
have but it also offers the greatest
software experience that you possibly
could want on a device of this type so
I'd love to see more brands follow the
footsteps of oneplus by offering you
know devices within this price range by
taking away some of the flagship
features but also
the bare essentials that we need on a
device so I think $650 is a cool sweet
spot for phone for next year but I don't
even know if that's gonna happen so what
I'm looking for an Android flasher
smartphone in 2019 is basically a device
that simple in terms of design that
comes with a different texture at the
back so that it's easier to hold in the
hand also I'd love to see brands
implement quality components like a good
microphone good speakers and displayed
wise I'd love to see brands to minimize
on the knotch just so we're not getting
something that looks like a bunch will
display which I really hope doesn't
happen and in terms of the operating
system just give us a clean UI without
any bloatware and of course I would
appreciate guaranteed software updates
for at least three years and finally in
terms of camera performance I'd love to
see brands sort of take a step back from
post-processing and give us the true
natural potential of what the sensor can
capture have you ever wondered how to
build a system you can't hear it starts
with a case my friend the silent based
601 an 801 might be quiet are the tools
for the job with all the expected
airflow options in the video interiors
and awesome tools panel design and noise
absorbing foam in all the right places
check out the cases you cannot hear in
the description below I want to hear

smartphone for 2019 what are your
expectations for that let me know the
