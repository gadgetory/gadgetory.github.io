hello everyone I'm Dimitri with the
Huracan Ducks yes the same Dimitri now
just with a shaved face but in this
video we'll be exploring the potential
of future desktop PCs that are super
compact and you know as our desire grows
for small and powerful pcs it really has
pushed the market to develop space
efficient machines that still offer some
DIY elements while you know compact
enclosures and PCs generally don't offer
much upgrade ability while on the other
spectrum we have larger cases larger
builds that offer plenty of
customization so where is that middle to
balance out of great ability versus size
and this is where my experience with
Intel skull Canyon a nook or next unit
of computing begins will explore the
experiences with everything from the
basics to video streaming and gaming and
also some like productivity stuff and
also everything in between so let's get
on with it now I've always been curious
about how I would utilize a small PC
like this nook but as soon as it was in
my hands I knew it would serve me very
well this is a DIY unit so the user will
need to populate their own RAM storage
and the operating system and so while
the Nook is $600 right now by the time
you have a working PC the total price
may be close to a thousand bucks this
definitely brings things into
perspective because for that price some
buyers may approach it as a novelty
product you know the tiny size being the
main selling point I mean it's thinner
than my pocket camera or the keyboard
for that matter and ridiculously smaller
than my smallest ITX case that I
currently have on hand and that's
incredibly impressive talk about
portable standalone machine which is
just slightly larger than its own power
brick even though there isn't a
dedicated graphics card installed this
little unit has a quad core 8 thread sky
like CPU the i7 6770 HQ which is
pre-installed and consumes less than 100
watts while that may not sound like much
for most people there is a reason why
intel markets this as a mini PC with
full-sized performance that processor
features iris pro graphics 580 which
should be adequate to play many today's
games at 1080p
medium settings and also the cool thing
is the user can select how much system
memory is allocated for that graphics
processor inside we have two sodium's
slots with up to 32 gear by capacity and
then 2 m dot 2 slots with 80 millimeter
SSD supported and I love how
user-friendly the installation is
everything is accessible once the bottom
plate is removed and the cool thing is
the screws stay with the panel so they
don't get lost and check out these
installation instructions there clear
concise well done and I was able to
assemble the nook with its components in
only a few minutes at the front you'll
find the power button that's dimly
illuminated in white and SDXC card slot
dual USB 3.0 the orange one is for quick
charging a headphone jack and a consumer
infrared port and this IR port is key
factor if you want to control the Nook
with large the harmony remotes or other
infrared controllers switching science
there's the power in audio with optical
Gigabit LAN couple of USB 3 and a good
array of display a o such as mini
DisplayPort Thunderbolt 3 and the full
size HDMI capable of 60 Hertz at 4k and
so this type C Thunderbolt 3 here is
very important for external GPU
solutions and this can be added later if
more graphics power is required the
chassis is adequately ventilated there's
a single blower fan with heat pipes
coming from underneath the board and
placement wise it's meant to lay
horizontally like this there is no
vertical position but there is a vase
amount that can be used to create your
own sort of all-in-one if mounted behind
the monitor although on most monitors
the vase amount is hidden by the stand
the top plate with a skull can be
swapped out for a plain one if you're
not digging the game ring appeal and
it's on this side that you'll find the
Wi-Fi antenna with dual band wireless AC
and some proprietary connections and so
finally let's get the Nook ready I
connected all the basics and it's a
strange feeling having such a tiny PC on
the desk for productivity it's perfect
and I can also see this fitting into a
home theater environment that's also
used for some light PC gaming I got the
4k display connected I could work on my
Photoshop projects the system has no
problems handling Lightroom and maybe
this could serve as a video editing
system you know on the go but that's
perhaps pushing it but what's nice for
these workflows is an 8 thread processor
that does provide plenty of processing
power for my living room I've been using
the eurocom notebook as the HTPC which
is a total overkill so a nook would
occupy this position very well while
minimizing the footprint and forcing
need to buy a wireless keyboard but 4k
Netflix is gorgeous absolutely smooth
playback and no surprises there
considering the processor and the GPU
are both beasts for such a small
computer which brings us into gaming and
I was honestly surprised to what we
could achieve here playing overwatch at
1080p at low settings gives me 50 to 60
fps and I initially played with a tank
hero for a slower-paced character and
give me an understanding of the Schnucks
performance but switching to a sniper
class was totally fine we're hovering in
high 50s and I can aim well with that
framerate however less demanding titles
are perfect for the nook transistor is
one of them it doesn't require much to
run at 60fps and if you're like me with
a large indie library of games it could
be how you gain in the living room dota
2 at 1080p with the best-looking preset
was between 40 and 55 FPS which is fine
but lowering the quality gives us a
solid 80 plus framerate which is nice
for multiplayer and then jumping into
csgo at 1080p again on low settings our
frame rate that's hovering around 140
FPS so it's totally suitable for
competitive gameplay and so it depends
on how and what you play and then the
nook could be a nice addition or even a
substitute for a dedicated light gaming
PC and so to conclude this conversation
I legitimately think this would be an
appealing product for power users
provided you value the small form factor
given the extra price premium now sure
you can upgrade the end or to storage
and the RAM which is a good thing but of
course I can hear the argument of
spending that money on a more powerful
desktop PC but the thing is it will
never be as small as the skull canyon
nook also the expansion options are
quite good with an external GPU adapter
if you require extra horsepower from the
GP
side of things via Thunderbolt 3 the
type-c port here you can connect a bunch
of USB hard drives if you need more
storage or upgrade the m-dot to slot
inside it's a very exciting product and
we'll be doing more testing plus
comparing into competing products that
are currently on the market and maybe
even building to comparing to like an
ITX system that is similarly priced that
we build ourselves so make sure to stay
subscribed I'm Dimitri how are Canucks I
hope you guys enjoy this video and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
