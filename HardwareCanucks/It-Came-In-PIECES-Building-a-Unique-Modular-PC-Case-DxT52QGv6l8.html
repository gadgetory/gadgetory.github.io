enclosure has really evolved over time
you've seen you know hard drive cages
that can be relocated elsewhere to allow
for extra clearance better air flow etc
motherboard trays are now becoming
modular so you can invert the system but
what happens when you move that whole
modularity element from the interior to
the frame level
so behind me are all the parts for a
real Taurus new enclosure the Morpheus a
fantastic play on words and the model
name for an enclosure that can morph
into two form factors so well done there
it comes disassembled which I'm assuming
is because you can decide whether or not
you can go for the small form factor the
slightly bigger one depending on your
hardware comes with a mouse mat I
haven't found the instructions yet but
I'm hoping this could be it
oh mistake now I'm actually really
excited about this whole dual form
factor approach and you know let's say
being able to collapse the frame if you
don't need that there's no height or
extended if you need that there's no
clearance for thicker radiators for
example and I'm hoping realtor have done
their homework to make sure that this
whole convertible approach is actually
functional and known just a marketing
gimmick RIA Torres case history has not
been exactly positive in my eyes but I'm
hoping the Morpheus bumps them back into
this competitive sphere because the
convertible market for the frame itself
is definitely rising and I'm thinking
people are expecting some sort of
modularity that is beyond motherboard
trays and hard drive caddies and stuff
and I think this is the future way to go
all right let's check it out after this
what would you like
so I'm looking for a gaming headset with
a bit of everything but not overkill
something that folds on your neck sure
how about the light frame without
excessive clamping force yes yes you
have table air cushions with proper
internal padding excellent I will take
the cable and the microphone are
removable
fine fine this is the one multi-platform
compatibility with virtual surround
sound dongle avail can I just take one
and the sound quality you'll be
satisfied with so the new Coolermaster
MH 751 and 75 to are here to make your
gaming experience so this my friends is
the real tour Morpheus a patent-pending
convertible PC case with a brave price
of $189 I appreciate what they're trying
to do and this will definitely entice
other K's brands to pursue a similar you
know nature in terms of making something
modular on the frame level and not on
the interior but this price premium you
know is solely based on that convertible
factor because the build quality and the
overall user experience you know it
feels a little bit less for exam
the build quality of the defined s2
which is $149 is far superior and also
that whole refinement on the user
experience just feels better
however Morpheus comes disassembled
which opens up opportunities for modding
and those wanting to get that full PC
building experience so it is made
entirely of Steel with some plastic
front and rear pieces and I actually
love the fully perforated design with
all sides fully covered in dust filters
and it's kind of refreshing not to see a
tempered glass panel and the side panels
are made of three pieces since you can
extend the outer sections so it is a
heavy panel but not reinforced and
therefore a bit flexible but I
appreciate the magnetic dust filters
that also cover the expansion areas if
you decide to go the second form factor
out the red anodized thumb screws for
the side panels are a pretty nice accent
to this all black frame with black thumb
screws also available plus the
illuminate front the logo is red it's
tasteful but I prefer it disabled now I
appreciate Realtors unique take on a
user's manual this being the actual
mouse mat but having only four
paragraphs of descriptive text for the
assembly process without any visual aid
is just unnecessary it's more of a
hassle than anything also what is this
piece alright so we're on the website
right now maybe they'll have something
here so I can see the Morpheus case and
look oh yes spec sheet excellent oh wait
it's just the sales kit so I did get the
user manual from Ryutaro but even
without the visual step-by-step
guidelines you know the whole assembly
was pretty straightforward all the
pieces just basically kind of a line and
you screw them in place and this is
where you need to decide how many PCI
slots you need since that determines the
form factor by default the bracket with
five is installed but it can be swapped
out for this one with eight slots and
what we're left with is a spacious
interior for a micro ATX ITX or a
full-size ATX /e ATX motherboards with
bottom two PCI slots covered by the
frame in the smaller configuration it
still leaves enough clearance for cable
management with ATX motherboards but
notice this is an inverted layout
meaning the GPU will be up top and it
will have been so awesome to have the
option to rotate the motherboard tray as
well because of this whole modular frame
but it's not it's inverted layout and
it's locked that way now the one
surprising thing about the Morpheus
is the IO and how it's kind of like two
steps forward and one step back so the
step back part is all the sliding
control for the optional RGB hub that is
not included so you need to get that
separately and use this connector
otherwise it's pretty useless and on the
other side the step forward are two USB
3 ports and for the first time I'm
seeing this two type C Gen 2 ports which
is awesome but most motherboards only
have a single front io type C gen 2
connection and this that has two cables
so you need to find either PCI Adhan
card with the Gen 2 speeds for the front
io connection or or find a motherboard
that has two of those which is quite
difficult and most of the motherboards I
have right now only support a single
type C for the front io and so that
renders the second type C port on the
top i/o useless now the cooling options
for the Morpheus are a bit disappointing
for the price point I was expecting more
so you can do a 240 or a 280 right up
top but also keep in mind the GPU is in
this area as well the bottom has fan
holes for 120 and 140 mm fans but for
some reason the spacing is non-standard
maybe because of those individual dust
filters but you cannot mount a 240 right
here only 120 or 140 singles and because
of this dual chamber design the main
section is thinner than usual so we only
get an 80 memory fan mount for the rear
which by the way is included and finally
for the front they are mounting holes
for 200 member fan and this removable
bracket for dual 120 s and we're 40 ml
fans that installs behind this large
plastic housing for this led logo you
also cannot easily remove the front dust
filter and because of the perforated
design any illuminated fans will shine
right through and by the way there are
two standard red LED fans included but
they're nothing special for the price
point the rear section holds your power
supply their cable management velcro
strap hoops and to drive cages one for
hard drives and one for SSDs and if you
end up extending the frame you can fit a
second SSD cage on top of the first one
there is a lot of wasted space here
though just because the frame is so long
and what will have been really good to
see is an indented but abort rate to
increase
CPU tower height clearance because it is
very short in the main chamber so you
can see my 145 motor tower
extends beyond the frame however because
of the flexible side panels I was
actually able to force mounted the
official spec claims 122 millimeters of
high clearance for the CPU tower which
is not a lot so you might as well go for
you know water cooling but you can only
do one of the front and maybe the top
given the GPU clearance and all that so
cooling in this case you know it could
have been better cooling options that is
because the temperatures and this whole
perforated design are actually pretty
decent so with the side panel removed
I was running three degrees cooler on
the CPU and four degrees cooler on the
GPU so pretty decent there is some
restriction going on with the front
panel because there's the metal frame
the dust filter and more plastic pieces
on the exterior but the good thing is
the bracket for the front fans is
slightly spaced out so they're not
necessarily too much against all that
restrictive stuff and also keep in mind
the frame is basically open so any noise
from your system will be audible because
it doesn't necessarily condense it all
inside the case now to extend the frame
and turn it into a slightly larger
enclosure you don't necessarily need to
even disassemble the entire Hardware you
can do it even with everything installed
some things might get loose a little bit
here and there like the GPU has to be
removed so you can substitute back that
eight PCI slots instead of the five here
and the motherboard tray because it's
attached to the top and you have to
install the additional expansion bracket
it's possible you don't necessarily need
to remove everything which is nice and
so with the expansion in place I'm
having a hard time on why you'd want
this the obvious benefit here is the
additional clearance above the GPU so if
you're installing like a slightly
thicker radiator or dual graphics cards
with some fans for exhaust or intake
that is a possibility but expanding this
top section does not grant you any
additional airflow options so you still
only have a 240 or 280 mount for the
front nothing for the bottom either and
so it's basically just exactly the same
frame width that is slightly taller and
you know gives you access to eight PCI
slots once that expansion is installed
instead of five and you also get
additional SSD cage for two more SSDs
and so that I guess is fine but look at
all this space they could definitely
figure it out to place let's see
standard SSD caddies or something in the
space so that you don't necessarily need
to expand the height to get that
additional storage capacity and so the
two form factors side by side the
difference in height is only six
centimeters so it's not a lot but it
would grant you additional clearance for
the top if you're doing radiators there
and want a little more spacing from your
motherboard area or from the GPU so if
you're doing multi-gpu setups so that's
the only reason why I can think why that
would be beneficial but it is kind of
disappointing not to see this taking a
step forward you know because this whole
expansion thing in height is very
surface level now as for the system
itself inside the Morpheus I like it no
issues here plenty of space at the
bottom so you can route those eight pin
cables and anything underneath for the
power supply all the rubber grommets are
in like good locations and so I decided
to pursue this whole red illumination
route because of the front logo
unfortunately it is not RGB but I have
the TB RGB Animax fans in the front and
the top absolutely love how they look
and also you know because the perforated
design they peak through which is
awesome I have the Liam Lee 24 pin RGB
connector that I set to red to match all
my other illumination and also kind of
peeks through the interior and spills
quite nice light between the hardware
and for the thermal tape power supply
that also has our tribulation on the
interior so I set that to red so it can
shine a little bit of that ring nation
from the fan on to the exterior because
of that perforation and you can check
out all those RGB goodies in the
description below Wow
could this be the one this actually is
the land cool one the case with a
fantastic front panel design with a
brushed aluminum plate complimenting
airflow and the gorgeous RGB
illumination through the central cavity
we've got a type C port at the front a
capable interior for water cooling an
airflow and a totally flush glass panel
on the side and to spice things up Lily
and the East River cables give off
unique RGB illuminations for twenty four
and eight band cables controlled via the
case lighting or through its own
controller hub for this interesting
color spill on the interior and you can
check them out in the description below
and so the Morpheus to me is such a good
idea but I think the convertible factor
has to be taken step forward because
imagine that this was like an ITX form
factor that could extend to eight
that would have been slightly better not
just vertical expansion but also
horizontal and the sole perforation
Multi paneling layout allows for that to
happen
Andrea torus first step is exactly that
it's pushing the boundaries on what we
think would be the next step in
modularity for PC cases and I really
admire them for doing something like
that and being brave because you know
there are a lot of compromises here but
I'm hoping this whole concept will you
know push many other brands to go a
similar route I'm still confused about
the dual type-c for the front
connections because not many
motherboards have the dual type-c for
the front IO and also you know for $189
you're definitely paying the premium for
the convertible factor which is nice but
then it's kind of it's very surface long
for example having that additional
height would have been the perfect
opportunity to mount a 360 rather the
front you know maybe with a little
attachment for the main 240 bracket but
that is not possible and I would love to
hear what do you think about this whole
dual form-factor convertible PC frame
let me know if this is something that's
interesting you and let's say if it was
refined and you were able to extend the
front section or collapse it even but
more do you think that is something that
more people would be interested in
versus just having this six centimeter
height difference let me know in the
comments below I'm Dimitri thanks so
much for watching and we'll see you next
