appealing for entertainment solutions in
your home due to practicality price and
the additional features that have
evolved over time that enhance the
overall experience
today were taking a look at the home
theater enclosure from NVDA PC a company
that focuses particularly on htpc
enclosures and accessories the model we
have here is the HTPC 7000 B it's a
smaller sibling to their larger similar
chassis and sizing is really important
for cases like this one which should fit
in most of home entertainment cabinets
and the case is priced at $80 just for
the enclosure with the accessories sold
separately and we are also taking a look
at the optional wireless keyboard that
is sold for around $50 which should also
act as a universal TV remote but first
let's take a look at the case this unit
resembles the typical format for any of
the entertainment devices such as a
blu-ray or a DVD player or an audio hub
so it's meant to blend them on your
media center it is constructed out of
thick black steel and has an exceptional
build quality the front of the chassis
has a really nice brushed aluminum plate
with a reflective strip that contains
the power and your reset buttons with
silver chrome accent and they also light
up and blue for the power and red for
the hard drive activity lights which
actually may become a bit distracting if
the unit is directly visible and next up
is the USB 3 and a regular USB port
placement of which can be problematic if
the camera and has glass doors and we
also have the colored audio ports which
should have had the silver chrome
accents like on the power and reset
buttons just to keep things uniform now
the front LCD is optional and displays
the standard information like your
volume channel number of playback time
and others and is meant to work with
your Windows Media Center now the front
labels display the functions the HTPC
would be suitable for and with the
blu-ray drives becoming more affordable
the optical bay door has the blu-ray
logo the case it's on solid 4 case feet
with rubber surface which should prevent
from noise vibration and scratches on
the bottom panel ventilation is cutout
for your power supply with more venting
available on the right
which can utilize a small intake fan and
the left side panel has to exhaust fans
which are the primary drive for the
airflow it's unfortunate to see the top
panel is completely closed without any
ventilation cutouts which would make
sense as heat rises and help in the
thermal Dept alright let's take off the
top panel and get inside the 7000 beep
on the bottom right there is the 3.5 to
2.5 inch drive mounting plate then
there's a 2 exhaust fans and the
motherboard area which support Mini ITX
and micro ATX ports with 4 full sized
expansion slots and all the front cables
including the internal USB 3 cable
unfortunately without an adapter and
then there's the optical drive mounting
bracket and support for a full sized ATX
power supply which on many htpc cases is
not supported alright so the case
supports three drives all in fairly
inconvenient spots and the first drive
is installed on this mounting plate
positioned behind the front panel and
the plate has rubber grommets for
reduced noise vibration and it also
supports 2.5 inch drives now the dry
SATA and power ports are fairly
difficult to get through especially
after connecting a 24-pin motherboard
cable so it's not exactly made easy
especially if you have to replace the
drive and moving on to the next drive it
is installed beneath the optical drive
on the same bracket which unfortunately
doesn't have any rubber grommets a place
that would be the most required as
optical drives usually produce quite a
bit of abrasion and combined with a 3.5
inch drive you have yourself a potential
noise problem and this is what the
driver installed and the bracket is
secured back on on spot however with
power supply is longer than 160
millimeters clearance for this drive
won't be possible and so the third Drive
can be installed at the back of the
optical drive being secured to the back
panel and practically sits on top of
your power supply now this seems to be
an excellent way to squeeze the extra
storage room for such a small enclosure
but you must use a shorter optical drive
in order to have clearance and
installing a system into the case and
the APC State's graphics cards and
length of 11 inches are supported but
unfortunately with all the
Abel's coming from the power supply
graphics cards only in length of 10
inches we'll still have clearance and
some may have issues with the power
ports facing the back and before we
conclude let's check out the wireless
keyboard which uses a regular USB
wireless receiver and this is a plug and
play device so no need to install the
drivers and we recommend plugging in the
receiver at the front of your computer
otherwise the connection gets lost after
about 4 meters if the receiver is
plugged in at the back and the unit is
fairly small and lightweight and fits in
the hands nicely so no issues in the
Economics Department
however the build quality tends to lean
towards the cheap plastic feel which is
reflected by its price the right side of
the unit has a joystick for mouse
navigation which actually can be quite
frustrating the precision of movement is
not there and navigating to a small
button on the screen can be challenging
as the joystick has issues recognizing
movement on an angle so this is a quiet
disappointment however the rest of the
buttons on the keyboard come in quite
handy for example the scroll wheel and
the left and right click aren't easy to
reach spot and the rest of the shortcut
controls like the new web browser page
which you can zoom in and out or close
or even go back and obviously we have
all the media controls for playback
volume and navigating within the menu
now we recognize it's quite a challenge
trying to squeeze the entire keyboard in
such a tiny space and in total of 80
keys have been placed in the middle of
this unit and while you have all the
controls right at your fingertips
it was almost impossible trying to use
the keyboard for any serious typing and
that's because the keys are so close
together this makes it prone to many
typing errors but for quick internet
search with rare use and if you have
small hands this actually isn't bad at
all now the keyboard runs on triple-a
batteries which can be recharged using
the provided mini USB port and we have
the battery charging and battery low
indicators which are very useful on the
back of the keyboard we have the
universal TV room
with our support but unfortunately no
more TV functions such as TV guard or
even channel I put down and now with all
these functions this is not an
alternative to a good mouse and keyboard
combo but a decent all-in-one solution
that is space efficient so let's
summarize the 7000 B brings some good
and some bad first a relative of small
stature will be attractive for users
with limited space with its simple and
elegant aluminum front panel and an
extremely solid construction throughout
and actually decent hardware options for
the inside with three drives full sized
ATX power supply and two exhaust fans to
keep the system cool all in such a tiny
enclosure the major gripe we have about
the chassis are the certain limitations
on storage based on your hardware which
are not outlined in the manual and may
cause confusion lengthening the chassis
perhaps just by one inch would have made
the installation of all three drives
without any clearance issues but this is
meant to be sort of a value htpc
enclosure with excellent build quality
with some compromises on internal
functions and the wireless device
manages to cramp in a mouse a keyboard
and a TV remote all in one small housing
that would be easy to store and provides
many useful shortcuts for browsing the
web and to use with Windows Media Center
however this device lacks the solid
quality feel and the a pointer Mouse is
not practical at all even for basic
navigation and the keyboard keys are
pretty tight making typing difficult and
a relative inexpensive price for this
keyboard with so many functions the
compromising quality is definitely there
and that concludes that are used for the
NVIDIA PC 7000 V and the HTPC KB 100
thanks watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
