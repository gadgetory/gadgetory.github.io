the month is complete the c7 100 M has
been added to my wall collection but now
it's time for another oh man this hair
this is a delivery from Sweden with a
model named nicely discreet on the side
finally we have a new fractal design
case come on Josh the define s - Wow
this is an incredible review guide
pricing and everything usually have to
follow up nice here comes the peel let's
do the interior one as well now the
reason why I love fractal design case is
because there are no surprises you know
exactly what are you gonna get quality
construction functionality this kind of
like elegant simple / boring design and
there are no necessarily new innovations
within it
they're all just refined iterations of
the previous enclosure and that is
exactly what we have with the define s -
let's check it out right - this hello
I'm looking for some fans well are you
married yeah I have a ring what is your
favorite number I would say 3 do I have
the perfect fan for you this is the new
thermal tech ring trio 12 fans with good
static pressure for radiators it is a
beautiful frame with double side and
center ring illumination with soft and
super bright spill with razor chrome and
compatibility control it through your
smartphone the RGB plus software on the
PC or Amazon Alexa well I'm gonna take
these home perhaps you should to check
them out in the description below so
good people that define us too after
working with it is the combination of
the original define s and the latest and
greatest features from the defined r6
both of those reviews are up here you
can check them out so it's a good thing
and it's also a bad thing because for
the price point of $149 for the define
that's - it is competing with a defined
r6 which you can pick up right now for
the tempered-glass version for around
$140 so it is slightly cheaper than the
latest defined s - which doesn't
necessarily bring anything new
that the defined r6 does not already
have however it does target slightly
different audience because the define s
the original was kind of like very roomy
and it carries over with the Defiant's
too but now we have the power supply
shroud such more features for the module
and covers and stuff so let's begin the
analysis of what is different the case
will be available in four colors just
like we saw with the r6 now I have the
gunmetal version which looks awesome
slightly darker gray not exactly black
but I was hoping it would be slightly
lighter so you can actually tell that it
is not black because right now it looks
black and only at certain angles when
the light hits it it looks gunmetal gray
now I will say that while I appreciate
fractals direction with keeping things
in this whole minimalist realm you know
the front facade is brushed aluminum the
glass panel is completely flush to the
case without any thumb screw sticking
out from the side because that mount has
been changed now with some screws at the
back instead for securing while
transport but also has these additional
pegs for support so we don't necessarily
need to have the thumb screws in there
and keeping them off actually gives you
easy access when you just pull the side
panel off we have the same mount for the
back panel and I like how they just kind
of slide into the front and then they
kind of close off like car doors into
those pegs so it kind of compresses the
cables you don't have to fight any
little pegs that are usually found on
both top and the bottom of a side panel
awesome mount all together and it looks
the way it has always looked for the
define series enclosure I will say
though that the gunmetal version
hides the finger marks with the brushed
aluminum in the front however the top is
completely planed and slightly glossy so
all the finger marks are visible which
is unfortunate the i/o should meet all
of our 2018 expectations which for USB
ports all blacked out two of which are
USB 2 we have a Type C Gen 2 port also
on here power reset buttons that
illuminate in this like very subtle
white glow which I wasn't expecting I
was expecting it to be blue but it looks
like they've changed the LED so it's a
little bit more subtle now in order to
remove the front panel you have to first
slide out that giant dust filter at the
bottom easily accessible from the front
and then behind it we have
our two included 140 member of fans the
dust filter no longer covers the entire
face of the fans instead we have these
smaller strips on the side of in the
ventilation to allow more surface area
and volume for the fans to intake air
and I think that is actually less
restrictive for the fans so that's a
good thing the top of the case now has
the upgraded module vent system so we
have this chunky button at the back that
you press to release that entire panel
that gives us access to the fan bracket
that can be used to mount up to 420
million radiator so you can do triple
120 and 140 number of fan installation
up top now the one little detail that I
appreciate that you only realize having
worked in the r6
are the offset well inserts for these
dual brackets because on the r6 they
were right on top of each other meaning
you can confuse and place the fan
bracket in the top slot instead at the
bottom and so now they're offset
eliminating any confusion as to where
the each of these brackets should sit
inside the frame nice the top fan
bracket also has a fill port right
beside the motherboard so it's kind of
this appropriate location for your water
cooling needs and so this whole frame is
designed for water cooling systems
because it is so long so you can fit a
420 at the top and up to a 360 at the
front so giving you plenty of options to
choose from in terms of your fan and
radiator options and you know it's kind
of like expected from fractal design but
then if you're not water cooling a lot
of that internal space is definitely
wasted but if you are installing
anything up top you can disassemble the
top panel into two so revealing a dust
filter that has this angled ventilation
potentially channeling air and noise
away from the user which is nice but the
problem is twofold
so first it is actually super difficult
to remove the solid piece away from the
dust filter I had to use a knife to do
so which is the exact same issue I had
with the r6 so this has clearly not been
yet fixed and number two is that when
the filter is installed there's a big
gap at the front between the frame and
it so I'm not worried about dust
infiltration it just does not look very
pretty alright so moving inside the main
thing that's been added with the define
that still is the power supply shroud so
it's been basically ported from the r6 I
love
sleek design simple fractal design text
so nothing intrusive we have ventilation
above the power supply you can also
install dual SSD caddies in there we
have dual of vertical PCI slots for
vertical GPUs that rise a card and that
low installation platform is not
included with a defined s2 the
motherboard tray is slightly recessed
with EA TX support and the main thing
that you'll notice is why is the case so
long and that is because that entire
side section beside the motherboard is
meant for reservoirs and thicker
radiators and all that clearance to be
kind of in harmony so they don't
interfere with each other we do have
these reservoir mounting brackets that
you can install and have a little bit of
height flexibility
I don't water cool but from what I've
seen in terms of builds from previous
define s systems is that it's quite nice
to have all that space that will not
interfere with the potentially long GPU
and a thicker radiator in the front
there's a third 140 Miller fan at the
back so cooling out of the box should be
just fine but the one thing that really
surprised me that I was not expecting
from fractal design is that there's no
piece at the front in for the power
supply shroud that you can remove to
allow for 360 rad to go into that
chamber so you can have a lot more
clearance about 7 inches of space for
really thick radiators in push-pull but
that will cover caused me a lot of
issues so we did define our six there
was a similar situation but the plate
simply popped off no hassle there where
else here it is super tight so removing
it required me to force it out almost
but worse when came to reinstalling it
back into the case I couldn't do it it
simply would not slide onto that second
little peg closer to the motherboard
tray and I'm thinking is because of that
corner and you know you have to almost
like wedge it in and it was almost
impossible for me to do it unless I cut
off that little corner on the plate
which I know is unconventional but it's
not a good design and when I cut off
that corner piece on that power supply
shroud plate it simply popped in place
no hassle whatsoever coming to the back
we have a few new things here like a fan
controller for 6 3 pin fans and 3 4 pin
PWM fans so that's
awesome they are powered via SATA you
can also plug this into your motherboard
for that rpm control for storage we have
two SSD caddies that can be relocated to
the power supply shroud and three new
drive cages for hard drives and SSDs
that look quite cool they can also help
you with cable management if you want to
stash some cables in that space and I do
like that all the pre-installed cables
are nicely routed along the side of the
case however the one little weird thing
is that none of the fans were connected
to the hub by default so you have to do
that
so don't turn on a computer thinking
that everything is being powered on you
have to remove those drive changes and
find those cables and connect them
yourself we also have this handy SATA
extension so you can connect all three
drives via one SATA cable plugged in to
your power supply nice and convenient
for those three drives that you might
populate into those three drive caddies
the one thing I don't like is how the
drives are visible from the front
because of the reservoir holes whereas
before there was like a black plate you
put on the drive there so the drives
would not be visible from the front so
that is one of those little things that
come with an improvement for the drive
cage how they look from the back but
then they compromise the visuals on the
interior it's a weird it's a weird mix
well now that we know what the case is
capable of let's do the system built
and so after the assembly all I can say
is that this has been an extremely
satisfying experience you know doing all
the cable management hardware
installation absolutely no issues
anywhere whatsoever you know once you
get into the groove of cable management
and everything just aligns perfectly and
this is like one of the easiest things
to do in terms of cable management I
love when things just fall into place
and there are no thousand little cables
floating around by default you have to
also worry about these just it's just a
good feeling when you look at the back
and you can just slide your hand and
everything is completely flat against
the motherboard tray and even though we
have you know there's plenty of room
beside the power supply just that the
back area is well designed to handle any
of those exits so they're not completely
sticking out
thanks to those velcro straps now the
one thing I absolutely love on the
interior in terms of cable management
are the long rubber grommets basically
spanning the entire height of the
motherboard and you know they're not
split into like three or four like on
many other cases this means that I can
route my 24 pin in the exact location
where my 24 pin cable is located on the
motherboard and that's been kind of
frustrating with many other cases but
not here now obviously there's so much
extra room beside the motherboard for
reservoirs and radiators but that's not
exactly what I'm going for here and in
terms of cooling so because I recently
did the cosmos see 700 M temperature
results with that exact system I can
compare and the defined s2 is slightly
hotter on both the CPU and the GPU for
my Delta T versus ambient and that is to
say that these fans are 1,000 rpm so
they are quieter versus what we saw on
the Coolermaster case also cool master
case had three fans so a slightly larger
enclosure but I am surprised at how much
hotter the GPU got at 2,000 rpm versus
the card running much quieter and cooler
in the slightly bigger enclosure alright
so I want to conclude by saying that the
fine s2 is a fan
stick release fractal design are rolling
out all the modern functional features
as with their previous cases into
defiant as to line and that makes me
happy
but I am a bit worried at how the define
s is now competing with the r6 which is
basically an identical spec to step spec
with a little of the definer six is
basically identical to the s2 in terms
of respect respect for water cooling air
flow the same glass panel the same
module and system the same looks
basically but the r6 has the advantage
of having that entire front drive cage
system that you can move back if you
want basically the layout of the s2 or
move to the front if you want a little
bit more concealment and space out those
drive caddies the one major critique I
have with the s2 is that power supply
shroud plate that in my sample would not
now come out and would not be put back
in until I took measures into my own
hands but otherwise like all the
features and everything on that are
pretty fantastic for 2018 but again it
is competing with the r6 and the r6
currently is cheaper it is no doubt that
defined s2 is a much higher end upgraded
version versus the original defined s
you know glass panel margin system the
interior
you know realignment the power supply
shroud new top IO new dust filter
implementation new storage options so
all those things are new and that is of
course a positive we've given many
awards to fractal design over the years
and I feel like the s2 deserves the damn
good award by default because it's
basically in our six without the hard
drive modular system but otherwise you
know I was hoping that it would be
slightly more competitive and price
point and so like around $120 so that
they don't isolate itself from the rest
of market and be like a really
aggressive competitive competitor in the
case space that is over the saturated
already for our Canadian audience memory
Express is a place to go for home
business and gaming electronics you can
try before you buy especially great for
peripherals by visiting one of their
stores and Winnipeg Calgary or Greater
Vancouver and more they do custom PCs
and will beat any Canadian price
guarantee but I would love to hear what
you think of the define
- and would you choose this over the r6
and why or why not let me know in the
comments and yeah thanks so much for
