you by fantex nvidia corsair and CI x
silverstone and in win make sure to
support them for helping us bring this
great content to you
beat Phoenix Pandora was one of those
ambitious projects who evolved into
something completely different from the
initial concept but they are moving
forward with this design and the Pandora
80x will soon launch at $99 without the
icon display and here it is next to
Pandora micro-atx for size comparison
and I gotta say beat Phoenix has
improved on so many elements for this
case to become really popular first the
side panel curves around the front panel
it's a very distinctive pandora look
it's no longer aluminum but now regular
steel which i think is more appropriate
for beat thanks with this glossy plastic
frame underneath that is now scratch
resistant and ventilation is available
on both sides for the front fans to
intake air the panels are slightly
higher than the top removable dust
filter thus creating this unibody like
structure there's a single exhaust fan
at the back and triple 120mm fan spots
at the front generating excellent intake
as you see there's nothing obstructing
the fans and air flow for the GPU and
the CPU is always fresh as for the
interior layout itself it's becoming is
sort of a trend to have no dedicated
hard drive gauges in the main chamber to
allow the best possible airflow and the
build that they have on display looks
really good with a 360 movement of
radiator mounted at the top the Pandora
ATX and will accommodate for water
cooling builds well it seems to be no
problem I love that they included this
shroud at the bottom separating an
entire bottom chamber that makes cable
management so much easier and they're
still debating whether or not to put SSD
brackets on top of that shroud taking a
look at the back all the cables are just
tucked away and from the power supply
where you will also find a duo three and
a half inch drive for mechanical storage
plus these side SSD mounts are handy
that will most likely support three and
a half inch drives for the final
revision but for now the Pandora ATX
looks like an awesome evolution into
proper ATX case that should fulfill our
needs for water cooling and awesome
cable management
and the side panels will most likely
utilize a swivel mechanism for easier
installation and really my only
uncertainty is dust proofing the front
intake but I'm sure big Phenix would not
skimp on such an important element for
the final release</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
