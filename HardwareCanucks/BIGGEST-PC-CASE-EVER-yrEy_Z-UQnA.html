my hair is today apologies hello
everyone I'm Dmitry with our Canucks
welcome to another behind-the-scenes
behind me these two boxes would be the
largest case that I would have ever
worked with and built and I pretty sure
it comes disassembled so now let's
unpack it and put it together and you
know just for reference these two boxes
occupy almost half my office have to
invite over a friend to help me bring
the big box because that's incredibly
heavy because the whole enclosure is
steel alright we're gonna do the big one
first whenever you are unboxing stuff
always cut away from you never towards
you seriously it's like unboxing a
fridge time for the second box to get
clean
oh I really wish to be an easier way to
do this and as I expected everything
here inside the main box would be
disassembled and it looks like it's well
protected
hopefully the instructions are nice and
simple okay one weird thing that I have
to share with you guys is all this
packaging material it smells really
weird I'm gonna toss it out before I
don't know what's gonna happen and so
the user manual nicely visible it seems
to be fairly large but to be honest I'm
fairly excited to build the system on
this side of the case and then here and
see what I can do
populate in the pedestal that's now man
check this out
everything is packaged in its own
plastic and very well protected verses
each other little pockets and stuff here
good stuff
Mike a look at this parts list it's kind
of like Lego step-by-step instructions I
like it
I've never worked in such a large
enclosure before it's like a fridge it's
like a mini fridge I want to build it so
that I can have an extra surface to put
stuff on a little outside of my desk sue
me
oh he's gonna have a system inside what
are you guys getting me there we go
complete 15 pages of instructions to
build the thing well let's begin
okay so just as a question low thing for
the comments how many hours do you think
you will take me to build this thing the
year of comas down though and then in
the end this episode I will reveal how
long it took me so I think I found the
accessory box or the bag with all the
screws I don't think I know where to
begin
I guess I'm tracking everything more
packaging this be packaging
looking mom we're training nobody it's
steel there's some flex foot like it's a
pretty large piece this is a sight panel
Jesus look at this thing
it's giant thanks let's see how much
flexor is white this panel has less flex
than the steel ones I just showed you
guys the piece of actual whatever
material here is Benedict reinforces the
entire thing I'm trying to know to
disperse all the parts too much so I'm
gonna have a dedicated screws and all
the accessories in this corner to the
left of the panel okay so I was just
going to build the system on camera for
you guys sort of behind the scenes
Stiles but I realized that I need shots
of all the parts that come with the case
so all that behind me and that's
currently lying on the floor and I need
to shoot at least like five or ten shots
of me holding the parts because I'll
integrate that into the actual full
review I know where I have to be so
that's my my cue I have to be sort of
like this in front of the camera there's
the microphone here right now and
there's the focus plane which is right
here I'll have like a nice quick cuts of
me changing the parts that I'm holding
so so I just started recording on the
gh4 it's right outside of the frame here
and let's begin
the side panels these are gigantic so as
I move away and trying to get more parts
one of my feet always stays in the same
spot so that these two have at least a
bit of a reference so that when I'm
doing jump cuts on the main camera I can
be in a fairly similar position every
single time so that there isn't too much
movement happening just the parts
changing as I'm holding it
our last shot
all right all the parts are finished
moving on to the build itself guitar
break before we move on I sack by the
way so the assembly so far is coming
along very well I'm shooting a little
time lapse on the main camera and check
this out now that thing is gigantic like
I'm here to scale right I wish I had a
wider lens but like see this like it's
it's bigger than my body it's coming
together almost almost without any
hiccups the instructions manual it's
okay it's nothing super special but I
wish that the diagrams were better but
it's not a big mess around here I mean I
have the the main case I'm all that
packaging material that I have to deal
with but so far I'm quite impressed at
how easy it is been to assemble this
thing and it's very solid can't wait to
put two systems in there together my my
only concern here would be what do I do
so it's cool you know this would be the
first of its kind for us doing two
systems in in a giant case like this and
obviously this has been targeted for
water cooling because it has so much
space for radiators and fans and stuff I
don't have much water cooling stuff but
they do have a lot of fans so maybe we
will do something cool with airflow to
figure out what the hell's going on but
I hope you guys enjoyed this behind the
scenes so I'm gonna go back to finishing
the build and then
finishing the or starting to film the
actual review for this one so make sure
to check it out they'll be a link in
description below or by the time you're
watching this it will not be ready yet
but it will be ready at some point but
hope you guys enjoy this I'm going to
lead you to our Canucks this is the
biggest case that I ever worked with
and we'll see you in next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
