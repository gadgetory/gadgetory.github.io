insanely innovative fantex our trusted
memory partner Corsair and NCIX
some of the biggest news coming out of
CES 15 would have to be the large amount
of free sync panels which are coming to
the market this year BenQ is included in
that group and was right on target with
showing off their free sync panel from a
very limited evaluation the free sync
panel performs exactly like a G sync
model wood tearing and stuttering are
all but completely eliminated but no
words on pricing nor release just yet
Ben Q is also showing off its
professional-grade 32 inch 4k IPS panel
now while this panel is not new it has
been on the market for a few months now
it is extremely impressive cost comes in
at about $1,000 and has similar features
that we've come to expect for a
professional banky product let us know
if you want to see a review of one of
these as I know I'd love to really test
it out Ben Q wasn't just showing off
monitors they've also announced a
Bluetooth speaker which is a little bit
unusual for a monitor company but the
major features that they use
electrostatic technology that has
usually found on massive reference
monitors for studios or the adazi
headphones that we tested earlier the
atmosphere for testing wasn't really
ideal inside this tiny locker room but
from what we heard the wireless audio
signal reveals plenty of detail and the
subwoofers at the front have some depth
at intensifying those lower frequencies
but stay tuned for our full review of
this promising bluetooth speaker</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
