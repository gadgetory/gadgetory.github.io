today I'm super excited to share this
video because we are going to experience
something together and that something
would be an HDR display we finally got
one here in the studio thanks to LG now
I've been using their 27 UD eighty-eight
monitor it's fantastic great contrast
and everything like that but what
exactly does HDR deliver in terms of
games production and entertainment
production of course means video
production so what exactly is HDR or
high dynamic range so in basic terms for
photography and video this is your
standard image while this is an HDR
image capturing as much information from
your shadows and your highlights without
destroying any of those details so how
does it apply to a monitor since HDR is
very much dependent on the content or
like source of your whatever you trying
to display and not exactly the display
itself so I'm curious to find out hope
you are too
this should be fine so free same type
scenes for care all nice but HDR is what
I'm most interested in beautiful new
round stand very low profile base I like
it such an easy setup that's it all
right so this is the new twenty seven UK
850 and this is my 27 UD eighty-eight /w
basically all the same specs so the same
4k panel the same free sing support the
same type see a slightly different stand
and without HDR so let's see this new
panel and this whole HDR direction is
actually worth it let's discuss right
after this the new master keys MK 750
keyboard comes with a comfortable
magnetic wrist rest beautiful RGB light
bar on the perimeter and perky lighting
control with a variety of Cherry MX
switches and the bottom type-c
connection coolermaster doing it right
check it out the law so a few notable
and appreciated changes include a new
back that is no longer glossy plastic it
is now this matte white material which
is awesome whereas before the glossy
plastic was just unpleasant and the
actual stands as you can see the bases
are different too in terms of the shape
so this one's very thin it spans a
little bit a wider area which is not an
issue you can still populate a few
things around it whereas before still
very low-profile but you can see they
done some changes so that I think it's a
little bit more desk friendly the cable
clip has also changed so this was the
old one it's locked into this one
position at the bottom and you had to
remove it every time you had to populate
any new cables whereas now this one has
this little clip on the exterior so you
can pass a new cables without removing
it and it has a little bit of motion up
and down and lastly the ports in their
location have not changed so a nice
diverse IO for you to plug in anything
you want I also now appreciate the full
black bezels on the sides in particular
whereas before they were chrome matching
the stand so now it's tiny bit cleaner
alrighty people so I've been using this
monitor for a few days now and I'm both
extremely frustrated because HDR on
windows and games is buggy AF but also
I'm quite impressed when it works
because it's actually pretty good so my
earliest HDR experience comes in June of
2017 and Computex when Nvidia showcased
Mass Effect Andromeda SDR versus HDR
side-by-side and Wow
HDR really has evolved because it sure
does not look like this anymore
now this whole HDR 10 spec has been set
in August of 2015 so quite a while back
but you can see that whole HDR 10 has
taken over the industry because it does
not require license fee it only requires
a 10 bit panel and also a REC 2020 color
space so it's not that difficult to
achieve and it's not like Dolby vision
where Dolby vision dynamically maps
certain areas of the TV based on the
picture profile and based on the
algorithms and the made of data that
actually comes with the content whereas
HDR 10 if you can think of it as like a
filter on top view content so it does
not dynamically change anything it's
kind of like a static thing that remaps
a certain pixels to whatever it thinks
it should display and that is clearly
evident through my gaming experience
because every game that supports HDR
kind of looks the same in terms of
vibrancy up to 200 percent brightness
also slightly higher shadow boost so you
can see little bit more in there so it
all kind of looks the same and force
certain games that looks fantastic for
others not so much
and now that I'm thinking about it it
would be so cool to see dolby vision
supported games where it will
dynamically map exposure vibrancy and do
those tonal contrast inside a certain
frame and not just a slap a vibrancy and
exposure filter on top like we do with
HDR 10 so the first experience with HDR
obviously comes through the desktop you
know opening in display settings and
turning on that HDR toggle and oh wait
what is that pink blanket over my screen
so that is the first bug that I
discovered have no idea why it's there
and it's been really ring throughout my
testing even with new drivers
reinstallation even with me trying to
troubleshoot things in the Nvidia
control panel and the windows color
settings disabling my spider Pro
calibration profiles etc and there is
one walk-around that I found to disable
this like pink blanket over HDR profiles
on the desktop and in games and that is
to cycle between the different HDR
profiles on the monitor itself and that
is the only way that I've been able to
actually enjoy HDR because otherwise it
would everything would just depend like
you see now and I would have to go into
the OSD and choose between HDR cinema
standards and just cycle between those
until we actually you know I don't know
what something happens in the background
where the colors go back to normal but
we still get that HDR profile and this
initial point of frustration is just a
huge turnoff for HDR for all types of
consumers and I've kind of lucky that I
stumbled upon this sort of fix where by
cycling between different HDR presets on
the monitor I'm able to go back into
this original color but otherwise if
you're a consumer you would buy the
monitor you turn on HDR on game
everything is pink for some reason you
would definitely return that monitor the
next day that is for sure and of course
this whole experience is soured by
windows drivers whatever else is running
in the background however if you are
connecting a console to your desktop
monitor then the experience of HDR is
perfectly fine fantastic for games and
there's no issues like you would
experience on
windows let's see how we can go back to
the pink stuff if I enable it back in
yeah back to the pink stuff look at that
it fixed itself which brings me to my
second main point of this video
PC gaming on an HDR desktop monitor so
first of all only a handful of games
support HDR profiles which kind of sucks
if you're investing into a really
expensive monitor want to play some HDR
games your options will be limited but
check this out on my first day I
launched them to be f1 I enabled that
HDR option and everything was completely
blown out so the sky was white the the
ground was black or dark and so we have
this like 2 tonal spectrum you know I
thought the whole idea of HDR was to
give you more information and your
highlights and shadows but here it was
not the case it was like a - total thing
really compressed color space really
unpleasant you cannot see anything and
then for destiny - it was exactly the
same thing really blown out highlights
and really crushed shadow areas so you
don't see any information in those
sections and that kind of defeats the
purpose of HDR and me seeing that for
the first time I actually assumed that's
what HDR was you know really blown out
highlights really crushed blocks you're
kind of like a really aggressive s-curve
if you know what that means so I didn't
realize that's not what HDR was because
apparently I was experiencing bugs in
those games and only after a few
restarts when HDR properly kicked in it
kind of also opened my eyes as to how
beautiful HDR can look in certain games
and that for some reason I've been
experiencing it all wrong because of
some bugs or something in the game or
windows on my Nvidia drivers or the
control panel I don't know some more
bugs that I've experienced include
watching HDR Netflix content then
turning off the monitor and then the
system shutdown so it was probably
switching between the color profiles and
then maybe the Nvidia control panel
crashed or some driver crashed but yeah
crashing while watching Netflix while
turning off the monitor that
not happen also far too often when they
exit an HDR game into the desktop the
desktop now turns into an HDR profile so
it automatically turns that on even
though I did not turn it on in the first
place the bugs just keep on happening so
I just exited the game where I had HDR
disabled in game so everything was fine
but when I went through the desktop
right now as you can see everything is
super pink and I saw a little HDR icon
as soon as I entered desktop and right
now we can see that HDR advanced color
settings has been turned on for some
reason even though I disabled it inside
the game but sometimes when I exit HDR
game it goes back to standard desktop so
it's a little bit messy right now in
terms of what app supports it and when
it switches on when it thinks it should
switch back to a regular desktop so it's
a little bit confusing ok so this is
what happens when I enable HDR settings
and bf1 quit the game launch back into
it and now we have this lovely ten bit
image in here I can still move my mouse
and like interact with whatever things
but it seems like the resolution and the
aspect ratio is all messed up and
obviously there's beautiful this looks
like Jupiter rings you know looks quite
abstract and unique but obviously not
the best in terms of the gaming
experience and that's for actual HDR
gameplay so we get a vibrancy boost we
get a shadow boost so you can see little
bit more in there and we get a slightly
brighter highlight areas but they're not
overly exposed and actually well exposed
areas that you normally would not be
able to see more detail of like the sky
are now a little bit more visible and
are also brighter so destiny 2 with HDR
when it works it's actually fantastic
because for example in these shots you
can see a little bit more of the gun the
vibrancy of the red channels really is
boosted to a point where you can see
more of the world it's a bit more like
in-your-face and punchy so that's much
much better than the standard version
that looks a little bit more muted for
example in the shadowy dark areas the
lighting just pops more it looks more
vibrant overall a better experience and
also the same thing outside so the world
is not so dull and like kind of like d
saturated
now we have a very vibrant punchy
picture that's also brighter without
losing the dynamic range of the entire
scene so that's awesome
however for battlefield one where the
game design weapon design lighting is
all a bit more realistic this additional
punch of color and this like additional
vibrancy and shadow boost may actually
not be as pleasant as on the cartoony
game designs so for example in this
scene you can see the color has shifted
towards the warmth and like the pinkish
side and I made sure the pink was not an
issue as before but you can see the non
HDR picture looks slightly more
realistic and potentially better for
your preference I will say I like the
vibrancy in the red channel more with
HDR because like all the sparks and fire
especially when the can as a firing
right in this scene it looks a lot more
vibrant and like pop right in your face
kind of in HDR mode which is something
that you might potentially prefer over
the muted colors that we get in standard
picture profile now as for actual
dynamic range in violet one for example
these shadows just slightly boost it so
you can see them a little bit more
clearly but also the highlights gets
light recovery so in this scene of the
clouds you can actually make up the
clouds and whatever is above the forest
whereas an SDR it kind of looks like
it's just a you know plain kind of
almost whitish piece of cloud but you
can't actually make out the cloud in
that picture profile however the same
cannot be said for destiny to wear an
SDR the cloud definition is a bit more
visible when an HDR because of that
highlight boost it almost like we're
losing those clouds and you know those
really bright areas they're still there
and they're still present they're not
being completely destroyed but they're
not as visible as we have on a standard
picture profile however it is a lot less
vibrant and the shadows are not as
detailed as on HDR however by far my
favorite game for HDR with the
Assassin's Creed origins wow that game
looks fantastic in the HDR of course
when it works sometimes when I enable it
it goes back to this pink overlay and I
have to switch the profiles in order to
get a new back to working colors but
when it does the vibrancy for that game
world and for that game design is
absolutely incredible known just for the
night scenes but for like especially
during the day when you have that Sun is
bright but it's not being blown out so
you can still preserve a lot of the
detail in the highlights but because of
the additional vibrancy and that
additional pop it looks absolutely
incredible it's not about the color
accuracy it's about the the poppin color
that you normally would not get with
standard non HD or displays unless you
go into like convenient control panel
maybe play around with vibrancy or
something like that but this I mean it
is absolutely gorgeous however right now
it's pretty light in this space so I
would say that this would be even kind
of overkill in a dark scenario where it
might be overly sensitive for your eyes
in like a dark room like if you play at
night but otherwise wow that is
beautiful it is beautiful another game
where HDR makes sense would be Shadow
Warrior 2 because it's also kind of
cartoony and this game design benefits
from the additional brightness and
vibrancy so you can make out a little
bit more details in the shadows it's not
necessarily for your benefit in terms of
like figuring out where to go you know
that's not really the point but it's
about just making the image slightly
brighter
whereas on SDR you can potentially do
that with a gamma adjust but then you
would lose the contrast and the
saturation so that's where HDR really
makes sense that additional vibrancy pop
so the colors are really in your face
and that there's no highlight boost and
the shadow boost so that your game world
is a bit more visible to you and to come
back to be f1 while we may gain that
additional dynamic range boost for the
highlight recovery the additional
vibrancy that we get with grass and like
all the you know the weapons stuff it
just may not look realistic to you so if
you're after a certain play style for
the genre of the color that you're
expecting from a game then you know take
that into account with regards to the
HDR profiles too now for games like Mass
Effect Andromeda
despite nobody playing that anymore it's
a good demo to demonstrate how HDR
complements the game
world with additional vibrancy boost so
you can see a little bit more colors the
sky is more blue the sand is more you
know yellow and like in your face and
there's no shadow lifts and the
highlights boost without destroying the
dynamic range is just a welcome addition
to that game world alright so for
conclusion I want to say that my HDR
experience has been eye-opening at how
not ready it is for the mass market as a
consumer you'd want to receive your HDR
monitor open up your favorite HDR ready
game and enjoy right no it will either
crash when you're changing to HDR
settings it'll give you color glitches
it will go back to Windows where HDR is
somehow enabled again and it's just not
a seamless experience that you'd expect
for an HDR 10 profile that's been sort
of the standard since 2015 if you really
want to experience HDR for entertainment
or your console just get a 4k HDR TV it
will be a much smoother experience and
you know if you want an HDR monitor for
your desktop why in terms of
entertainment on a desktop
I think Amazon Prime now streams HDR
content through the browser with Netflix
on Windows 10 you have to use the native
Netflix app from the Windows Store which
works flawlessly by the way with HDR so
that's not an issue but if you have an
HDR capable TV that will seamlessly
stream all that stuff without any
bottlenecks that you would experience on
windows and if you really have the 4k h4
27 inch foam factor like this monitor
you can buy the earlier versions which
doesn't have type C that goes for like
four hundred thirty bucks or the 27 UD
88 which is what I use it's like around
600 bucks and it's if you want the HDR
stuff that's an additional premium to
around $700 to experience HDR in the few
games and Netflix and my final thoughts
on this whole HDR gaming if you're
potentially thinking of going towards
that route or avoiding it is that I feel
like HDR 10 is a filter that goes on top
of your game it boosted the shadows and
highlights and it increases the vibrancy
and so for certain games it works
because it complements the game world
we're
others it doesn't not in a technical
sense but in the creative sense so for
BF 1 the additional information that's
been lifted in the shadows how does that
contribute to a better gaming experience
you know the colors pop more so that's a
nice thing but there is no control on
how HDR looks for games and I will leave
you with one more thought who should we
blame for this whole mess up of HDR I
was expecting the whole experience to be
seamless and pleasant and you know
without any hiccups but it is definitely
not so on Windows in particular so who
should we scapegoat let me know in the
comments below so guys I hope this
experience and sharing has been helpful
let me know if you have an HDR monitor
you know not TV because tv's + consoles
and all that content is totally fine on
that platform because it's kind of like
an enclosed in its own thing whereas
monitors for desktop for PC Windows
that's a totally different ballpark add
to support and you know available
content and all that stuff so guys I'm
Dimitri thank you so much for watching
and coming along this HDR ride and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
