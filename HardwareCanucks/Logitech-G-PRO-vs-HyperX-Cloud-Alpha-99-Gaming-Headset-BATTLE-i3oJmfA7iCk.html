connects and this is Logitech's new g
pro gaming headset it's supposed to
complete the pro series within logitech
gaming division and if you're familiar
with their existing peripherals there is
the g pro gaming keyboard which is one
my personal favorites and my daily
driver
then there's the g pro gaming mouse
which is an absolute steal for the price
and if you're interested in learning
more about the keyboard and the mouse
link I'll review videos in the
description down below so what's the
story with the G pro gaming headset well
it features pro G drivers a pro grade
microphone pro level of comfort all
these pro features that launch tech
advertises and there's a price at ninety
dollars which is pretty competitive if
you think about it I think a few gaming
headsets have come to my mind that
compete or sort of compete within the
sub 1 and 100 our price range is the you
know Sennheiser GSP 300 a steel series
Arctic's 5 a few more and and there is
this popular guy the HyperX cloud alpha
gaming headset I happen to have I still
happen to use one of these up here here
in the office so I decided to put this
guy or both these headsets head-to-head
see what I did there at the head and
find out which one actually offers the
best experience for their money so let's
get into it but first a quick message
from our sponsor the new master keys MK
750 keyboard comes with a comfortable
magnetic wrist rest beautiful RGB light
bar on the perimeter and perky lighting
control with a variety of Cherry MX
switches and the bottom type-c
connection coolermaster doing it right
check it out below okay first up design
and build let's start with the cloud
alpha it's nothing unique to be honest
especially if you compared with previous
cloud gaming headsets you get a robust
aluminum frame that screams quality no
signs of creaking and this can
definitely withstand rough use over time
the red and black accents complements
the HyperX branding which is a nice
touch but I really wished if they
offered an all-black color option
because it goes really well with any
other peripherals the G pro headset on
the other hand is the complete opposite
of the Alpha the design is pretty much
understated it comes in this map
finish which looks simple and
minimalistic there are no aggressive
elements toward the body and that's so
refreshing to see on a gaming headset
you can take this with you whether
traveling or when you're on your subway
or something like that people are going
to notice that you're wearing you know a
gaming headset unless if they you know
peep really close and you know start
googling the logo and the branding and
stuff like that but regardless this can
you know it can comfortably or it goes
really well with outfits which is
awesome and that's one of the cool
things I like about the design is so
simple and like I said I would much
rather go with something like this that
you know blends in with the rest the
environment when compared to this
because the red and black accents is
just I mean it's too overrated at this
point now the build quality is something
that's a little bit and I mean a little
bit behind the cloud alpha you see
Logitech has used a combination of hard
plastic materials along with stainless
steel sliders to create a lightweight
body which feels a bit different when
compared to the aluminum frame on the
Alpha it's put together really well
there are no signs of creaking once
again so that's awesome
and you can comfortably wear this for
longer sessions given the lightweight
construction so if you're looking for a
headset with good build quality that
doesn't weigh too much the G Pro is the
way to go whereas if you're looking for
a headset with something that's a little
bit more robust something that it can
toss in easily without worrying about
handling and whatnot I think the HyperX
can come in or I think the Alpha is
probably a lots of period because these
guys are built like tanks when compared
to the G Pro the headband on both these
headsets aren't self adjustable and I
prefer that over headsets that feature
the opposite with self adjusting metal
frames above the headband which would
then result in reverberations and that
gets annoying that's not the case with
both the G Pro and the cloud alpha which
is awesome and surprisingly both of them
were super comfortable to wear the
clamping force is very minimal but I
will say the G pro is a little bit more
stronger than the Alpha but it's nothing
to be worried about the adjustable
sliders are well defined and tight
enough to prevent slipping and they are
made out of high quality materials the
one thing that I really appreciate about
the G Pro is that you can rotate the ear
cups 90 degrees and they can comfortably
rest around your neck
which is something that you can't do
with the cloud alpha because the ear
cups are held in place
by the metal frame so if you were to
take short breaks during gaming sessions
or whatever you'd have to remove the
headset completely and put them back
again and that could be an annoyance
factor so from a flexibility standpoint
the G pro gets the edge here that being
said I cannot forget to talk about the
signature memory foam on the cloud alpha
this is by far the best implementation
on a headset the ear cups feature plenty
of cushion to prevent your ears from
making contact with the drivers they
provide a good seal and they're very
comfortable to wear the G pro on the
other hand features premium leather at
the air pads which are comfortable there
is good amount of cushion and the
material is pretty nice but there are
nowhere closer to the softness and B
better seal you get around the ears with
the Alpha hyper X just nailed that now
while I do prefer the HyperX cloud alpha
in terms of comfort wise that's not what
Dmitriy thinks so hey guys so this is
the first time I'm trying the the G pro
headset and I actually prefer the G Pro
more than that the cloud alphas even
though that's a really comfortable
headset to hear the padding is thicker
and it's larger so that it kind of
occupies this space around my ear more
versus the cloud alphas the the actual
padding kind of concentrates more and it
feels a little tighter so I prefer these
guys well I prefer this because the
softness and the memory foam material is
just so comfortable
yeah the softness is great but the
padding here is more firm and it's
actually thicker too or potentially
because it's more firm and feels thicker
yeah
so again I personally personal
preference right so G pro mint cloud
flight or alpha I should also mention
that launch tech is included and
additional pair of soft leather at ear
pads which are a little bit of a
different material compared to the
standard leather and earpads that are
found on the or that comes by default on
the G Pro it's I mean I I personally
didn't like it it was a little bit more
on the rougher edge when compared to the
smoothness of the leather earpads but
that comes by default so that's
something to keep in mind okay the next
factor I want to discuss here is
versatility and both the G Pro and the
Alpha take the cream of the crop here
let's start with the G Pro the included
braided cable is 2 metres in length so
you shouldn't have a problem routing it
behind you
see and it's detachable the boom
microphone is also removable and it
plugs into the headset by a 3.5
millimeter connector logitech is also
included a short splitter cable for a
separate headphone and microphone
channels which is welcoming thumbs up
for this modular approach the same story
goes for the cloud alpha both the
braided cable and the boom microphone
are detachable you also get an extension
cable that splits the headphone and
microphone inputs the one major
difference or not sure if it's a major
or minor difference is that the included
cable on Logitech the G Pro headset is 2
metres in length when compared to 1.3
meters on the cloud alpha headset so if
you decide to you you know use the G Pro
while they're traveling on a subway well
that's a lot of cable to manage because
it's it's really long so you might have
to you know get a tie or something
whether traveling whereas with the cloud
flying they're pretty short it's easier
to just you know connect it to your
phone or your mobile device and then not
worry about managing the shorter cable
so it's again it's a minor thing but
that's just something I wanted to
mention I should also point out that the
headphone cable on both headsets come
with inline audio controls which can be
used to adjust a volume and mute the
microphone now the cables by themselves
are relatively thick the G pro is a bit
thinner but both of them are very
flexible so expect minimal kink
formation over time although be aware
that they do cost some reverberations
when they get in contact with anything
also HyperX gets bonus points for
including a carrying bag which can be
used to store the mic and the headset
whereas with the G Pro you kind of have
to find one for yourselves and now onto
the microphone test currently or
listening to the HyperX cloud alpha
gaming headset and I'm recording this
directly to my iPad my voice sounds
clear and pronounced there are no weird
compression artifacts taking place in
the background which is pretty awesome
and the noise actually microphone does
feature noise canceling characteristics
so it does a pretty good job at that I'm
in a pretty quiet space with just my
aircon and my PC running in the
background and just like normal just
like every other microphone test here's
me typing on a mechanical keyboard
featuring Cherry MX blue switches so if
quite loud but it is a really good job
isolating the noise and of course you
can check out how it handles the peas
and you know because it does include an
integrated power filter for the
illuminate
that as well but I'd love to hear your
thoughts on that as well in the comments
so let's switch to the G Pro okay so
this is what the G Pro sounds like and
I'm using the exact same setup with me
recording to the iPad and honestly I
think that the G pro sounds or it adds
more definition to my voice there's a
little bit more bass
trebles of course a little bit more
clear and you know there's less
processing taking place in the
background my voice doesn't sound too
nasally which is awesome it really does
feel natural now the one thing that I
did notice while playing back of the
recordings back and forth between the
cloud alpha and the G pro is that the
noise canceling is just a little bit
better on the cloud alpha than compared
to the G pro but it shouldn't really
it's it's honestly not a big difference
it's not a major one you should be just
fine for your twitch streaming and
casual Skype calls but I'd love to hear
your thoughts on that this microphone
comparison what do you guys think which
one do you prefer the most the cloud
alpha or the G Pro let us know in the
comments down below so the last thing to
discuss here is sound quality and the
experience while gaming and doing other
tasks I'm gonna start with the cloud
alpha and right off the bat this thing
sounds amazing the implementation of
dual chamber drivers provides a good
separation between the base the mint and
the highs you get a balanced sound
signature while listening to music or
just consuming content in general now if
you're looking for a headset with more
emphasis on the lower ends this isn't
necessarily for you but you could push
it further by taking the EQ through
software or something the G pro on the
other hand features launch tanks custom
designed pro G drivers and they sound
good but not as good as the Alpha
because they're emphasized a lot more on
the highs and the mids
giving more life to vocals but it does
lack proper bass response it's certainly
present but it's not as bumi and
powerful as you'd want it to be there's
good stereo separation again it's just
that you might not be as impressed with
the gunshots or explosions when you're
on a game play and I think this is where
I take the HyperX alpha over launched XG
pro so here's the takeaway when it comes
to sound quality on both these headsets
if you're looking for one that has a
balanced sound signature something that
can give you a good differentiation
between highs the mids and the bass
HyperX call alpha is the way to go are
you
definitely feel the gunshots and
explosions and of course your
surroundings within a game play whereas
with the G Pro you can definitely hear
the footsteps and stuff like that I
think you'll get a little bit of a
positional awareness with the G pro it's
just that you know gunshots explosions
won't be as powerful and boomy when
compared to the Alpha but either way I
think you won't regret with either of
these choices because both of them still
sound fantastic in fact they're probably
the best that I've heard or listened to
in a while especially this price point
so you know that's that's pretty awesome
and of course if you get the opportunity
to test out both these headphones before
purchasing I'd highly recommend doing
that so you know we always say that
headphone reviews are subjective well
Demetri has a different opinion so let's
see what is the same so Eber you write
about this having more bass and slightly
more pronounced because the treble here
is quiet not harsh but it's definitely
more pronounced but the G pro headset
has a wider sound stage so the spatial
awareness and spatial separation of not
just your gaming stuff but also
instruments if you listen to music or
movies is wider and in my opinion better
on the G Pro so there's your compromise
the bass is not as pronounced as this
guy which I would say is fine for you
know like a competitive headset that's
targeted for FPS where you don't
necessarily want to feel like really
rumbling stuff it's still present but
not as targeted like a V curve on the
Alpha now if you're looking for RGB
lighting on both these headsets don't
even think about it I personally think
lighting on a headset just is pointless
in the first place you know the cloud
I'll find the G Pro they don't feature
any of those which is awesome I mean it
brings down the price which is great so
a lot of gamers can actually afford
these headsets so yeah no waiting
just just plain old normal headset
that's what we're looking at so to
conclude I'm having a difficult time
picking a winner here guys between the
cloud alpha gaming headset and the G pro
gaming headset both of these have their
own Forte's and their disadvantages
which aren't super major but to break it
down if you're looking for a headset
with a robust build quality something
that you can easily are not worried
about you know you wear or tear in the
long term I think the cloud flight is a
way to go this thing is built like a
tank you won't have a problem tossing it
in your backpack or something like that
if you're looking for something that's
minimum something that can go well with
order that could go really well with the
rest of the peripherals and something
that can you know go up if you mean if
you're traveling or something like that
and if you don't want to stand down with
the crowd if you're looking for
something that's stealth the G Pro is
the way to go because the design is so
minimalistic it's understated I actually
really love what launch like has done
here in terms of the design now when it
comes to comfort I really have to pick
the cloud flying in this case because
again the signature memory foam it's
just amazing I mean once you put this on
it's really hard to take it off because
I mean it's just pure comfortness when
you're wearing the cloud alpha whereas
with the G pearl they're still good I
mean you still get the great you great
materials in sign on I mean on the ear
pads and they had cushion but again it's
nowhere closer to the cloud flying I
mean if you get a chance to try both
these headsets you'll know what I'm
talking about the last thing to discuss
here is of course the sound quality and
of course the microphone quality I still
prefer the micro I prefer the mic
quality coming out of the GPO when
compared to the cloud fly because
there's more definition to my voice with
a G pro the pro G drivers and the G Pro
headset are pretty good
I just wish if it had that extra bass
response which would have just completed
the whole gaming experience but they're
still good I mean you're not gonna go
wrong with this headset especially when
it comes to gaming or just casual music
listening whereas to the cloud flight
they're more balanced they're pronounced
you're definitely going to have a blast
listening to music and for some gaming
on this headset the last thing to
discuss here is the price the cloud
alpha costs $100 versus $90 for the G
pro and I think for the price I think
the G pro is an absolute steal it's a
it's just amazing what Logitech has done
here with the design and of course the
way how it sounds and the microphone
quality and all that kind of stuff but
man I would spend that extra 10 bucks
and get the cloud the cloud alpha if I
were you or again I don't know I mean I
morning I want to hear I want to hear
your thoughts on both these headset what
do you guys think about it would you
prefer the cloud alpha over the G pro or
use someone who's look or are there any
alternatives that you might be
interested in let us know in the
