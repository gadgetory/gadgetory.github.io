welcome to another video review I think
one of the most common methods for
on-the-go audio solutions has in-ear
monitors they're a lot easier to carry
then your conventional headphones
thanks to their small form factor and
low profile today were taking a look at
these beautiful earphones from a company
that blends the warmth of different
woods into extremely elegant products
and I think what better to complement
audio than this beechwood now by the way
this is both for aesthetics and tonal
characteristics so this is the 11 deco
from messin
in hard leather case we also get
additional silicon earpieces and I
usually have issues with ear pieces not
fully sitting in a place but thanks to
the size range I was able to find my
perfect fit and also getting the right
size means better bass response and
proper isolations for your morning
commute the anti tangle core does
incorporate the built in mic along with
a play/pause function the jack at the
end is angled at 45 degrees and I
initially wouldn't think that was a
problem but soon realized it is more
prone to faster wear and after 2 weeks
notice
slight rips in the rubber now moving on
to actual ear pieces the surrounding
beechwood finish looks exceptionally
elegant the lighter wood color combined
with these aluminum accents and meze
logo will sure differentiate these from
the crowd also each set is totally
unique you might get a slightly darker
or lighter finish that will make you
appreciate these even more now Mesa has
included a frequency response graph and
what we see is pretty much what we hear
the bass response is evident and
translates really well into the ear
cushion for a boomy punch no that's
because the 8 millimeter drivers they're
quite small so don't be expecting
amazing deep and tight bass resolution
it is enough to be evident and does
interfere slightly into the mid-range
but overall quite an impressive and full
sound because of the wood casing sound
the smooth and wore without overly
sharpen highs now I do prefer audio on
the brighter side but with the 11 that
goes I've really enjoyed my selection on
classical and vocal heavy tubes would
smooth mid-range that was slightly
distant but with enough detail and more
forward vocals the rolled off treble
doesn't have much brilliance
I think that's partially the way the
driver is tuned and also the Beachwood
casing that smooths out the sound and I
would prefer more Sparkle on the high
end for more detail listening to trance
electronic and house was slightly boo me
throughout the low range plus the slight
depression in the mids doesn't
complement bass heavy songs I did end up
bringing my mid-range slightly forward
and I do encourage EQ tweaking even if
it's just an app through your phone
to fine-tune to your listening style
listening to September from Earth Wind
and Fire some background instruments are
drowned out due to low mid range
depression but with an overall Pleasant
representation while with angel for
mezzanine delivered great upper base and
also sub based response throughout the
track with excellent forward vocals so
overall I found listening to
instrumental and vocal heavy songs more
enjoyable as the booming bass response
for trans electronic wasn't to my liking
I said you love my mid-range detail but
that is not to say that these are not
good for EDM or house they sound quiet
fun and a slight adjustment to the high
end makes them really come alive for
trance music what meze tries to deliver
with deco is an elegant experience with
a smooth and warm sound that compliments
instrumental jazz and vocal Tunes they
also don't fall apart when tweaking with
the EQ and of course that is within
reason the 11 deco are really
comfortable and provided a pretty
excellent isolation without leaking
sound and also without the constraining
the heat so that's excellent news now I
personally wasn't fully satisfied with
the mid-range presence as it is slightly
recessed and this was very evident for
house and trends especially since the
Bumi bass bleeds into the mid-range
detail now having said that I've really
enjoyed the default sound signature of
these earphones for instrumental and
bringing up the high end for excellent
all-around genre who really makes me
like them even more so this concludes
our review of the 11 deco from meze
