another wireless mouse yep it's the best
one so far yeah but you always say that
well see for yourself all right
ha this thing is pretty damn good
let's review right to this the new
fatality h3 70 performance motherboard
is well-equipped for agent processors
with 10 power phase design dual ultra
and a two slots for storage and
fantastic audio interface and dual RGB
headers for addressable and 12 volt
lighting accessories check out the full
asrock 300 series line up down below
alright guys so I'm extremely happy to
see a quality wireless mouse from still
series so they can compete in the
marketplace but mainly to compete with
Logitech who have held this really
dominant position in the wireless space
and so the rival 650 is just basically a
wireless iteration of the rival 600 you
can check out that review over here and
of course because it's wireless
we have a nice price premium that comes
with that at the hundred twenty dollars
compared to $80 for the wired version as
usual I will leave my favorite wireless
and wired mice in the description below
check them out so you can get your game
on now the main competitor to the rival
650 right now I think would be the G Pro
Wireless which cost $150 so it's
slightly more expensive so I can see
where this would tie in but the main
disadvantage with the rival 650 is the
weight at 121 grams it is significantly
heavier than the G Pro Wireless which is
only 80 grams but on top of that this
has actual weight customization in four
gram increments so you can install four
little weights on each side to give you
a total of 153 grams if you prefer a
heavier Mouse and all the unused weights
can be stored inside this rubber housing
that you can wrap around let's say you
keyboard cable so you don't lose it you
could look at it as an advantage versus
the G pro Wireless if you prefer heavier
mice if you play at a really high DPI
and prefer to have the mouse that is
grounded to the mouse mat and to access
that internal weight system you simply
pull off these magnetic side plates and
you need to apply a little bit of force
so don't worry about them popping off
while you're gaming that will never
happen and you simply install the
weights on these little rubber cavities
once you pull off the magnetic plates
usually the weights fall out as well
because while they're pretty secure
inside they they tend to kind of get
loosened up while the mouse is an
and weight wise compared to the rival
600 we have an additional 25 grams here
because of that battery so if you want
even the lighter mouse but prefer the
shape and the customization over here
you can definitely check out the rival
600 in terms of build quality it feels
absolutely identical to the rival 600
super satisfying rubber texture on the
entire body and really grippy sections
on each side to kind of lock your grip
the mouse wheel I would say is best in
the business
super satisfying scroll steps good
texture nice middle click as well that's
light enough to press but that thin
button to change your DPI is still a
little bit too high for me and it's
still slightly higher than the rival 310
which I prefer it's low profile because
every time I press the middle click I
also activate that dpi shift the primary
buttons have that complementing
curvature so if fingers just fall in
place and the actual clicks are
incredible the browser buttons are in
perfect position low profile and nice
depression what that actuation happens
and we have a third button in the front
that the slightly difficult to reach but
you could program a macro in there that
you don't normally use but whenever you
need to
you simply readjust your grip to get to
it and so for my hybrid grip style
absolutely no problem here a super
comfortable Mouse claw grip would work
very well as well and for smaller hands
palm grip will be absolutely no problem
however I do prefer the slightly shorter
body of the rival 310 that has a
slightly more aggressive slant on the
right side versus here but I'm guessing
it just something I've gotten used to
because I've been using that Mouse since
it launched of course we have RGB
illumination over here it's pretty but
for a wireless mouse definitely disable
it to preserve battery life and at the
bottom we have something unique to
SteelSeries two sensors one is for
tracking the other is for lift off
distance so the tracking sensor here is
the same as with the rival 600 the true
move 3 plus amazing tracking over here
true one-to-one performance throughout
the entire CPI range up to 12,000 CPI
and the second sensor detects your
liftoff distance so you can really
adjust that based on your surface level
based on your play style so that you
have absolutely no Mouse you know
judor when the mouse is placed down or
when you lift it it is really cool to
play around with the liftoff distance
setting and see when the sensor stops
tracking on my mouse mat because I've
used that mouse mat for years and there
are certain depressions that I'm
guessing have been made because of my
hand whenever the mouse goes over those
sections there's no tracking or it's
very like kind of jerky and that is
because the sensor is picking up the
unevenness of that really flat mouse mat
and that's pretty incredible of course
that could be seen as a disadvantage as
well so just make sure to fine-tune the
lift up distance for your particular
Mouse man and at the bottom we have a
power button with color coordination
plus a connect toggle so you can sync
that with the USB receiver that this
pretty small has little ridges so you
can pull that out from your computer
easily but there is no way to store the
receiver on the mouse itself unlike with
the G Pro Wireless that has the little
compartment at the bottom of the mouse
which would have been pretty nice to
have with a rival 6:50 and so my gaming
experience with the rival 650 given its
fantastic economics and credible buttons
and an awesome sensor was satisfactory
but remember this is a hundred and
twenty-one grams which is 25 grams
heavier than the rival 600 and I prefer
my mice around 90 gram weights so I've
been kind of spoiled by the G Pro
Wireless which is 80 grams and the rival
310 which is 88 grams I think so
gaming with something slightly heavier
was definitely weird there is that
adjustment period where you kind of get
to know how you have to flick and how
you have to perform in games so that you
can be back to feeling super comfortable
with your crosshair and ignoring exactly
where it will land based on how much
movement you have you know in the
physical world and though you know after
a few gaming sessions I was pretty
comfortable gaming with something that
heavy but without the wire it definitely
gives you that freedom of movement on
the mousepad
first please now in terms of battery
performance you know you can't expect
miracles when you're dealing with
something of this caliber but you can
expect at least 24 hours of continuous
usage so that is what three five days
minimum
of game time and when I plugged it into
my motherboard I charged 14 percent in
15 minutes which is pretty good but if
you plug into a fast charging port on
your motherboard
SteelSeries claims you'll get additional
10 hours of battery life in just 15
minutes and that is where the jeepers
Wireless has an advantage this thing can
last for 60 hours without any
illumination with that constant usage
and 48 hours with some illumination
versus 24 on the arrival 650 and so for
conclusion I want to say that the rival
650 is a needed introduction to the
market to compete with the likes of the
G Pro Wireless because while that has a
spot in the market for really
competitive scenes and for people who
love light or mice like myself the rival
650 is that opposite kind of alternative
to people who want something heavier
with more weight customization and
having that really precise fine tuning
for that depth sensor for that lift off
distance adjustment plus there's that
$30 price advantage with the rival 650
versus the G Pro Wireless and now you've
been wanting to cut the cord and have
that freedom of movement on the mouse
mat the rival 650 is a fantastic
alternative to basically all the
wireless mice that are available right
now for gaming of this caliber and it
deserves the Harbor Canucks they ain't
gotta work as always I will list all my
favorite mice in description below wired
and wireless options in there so you can
