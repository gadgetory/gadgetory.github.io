networks ultimate power uncompromised
speed meet the Linksys wrt54g much and
today we're talking about Maxwell as it
is rolling out for mobile particularly
for the gaming notebook section and that
is exactly why we have this msi ge70
from their patchy series on the table
and we have the little fool of you for
this so make sure to check it out is
gonna be a link in the description and
also if you can click anywhere on the
screen here you will be redirected to
that reviews now we first saw Maxwell
with the gtx 750ti it was an incredible
card because it had low power draw so
power efficient yet very powerful and
that is exactly why maxwell is so
fitting within the notebook scene and
what's better than a powerful GPU that
doesn't require a lot of power for a
notebook scene and NVIDIA definitely has
realized the potential for Maxwell to be
incorporated into the gaming notebook
seem as many gaming notebooks today are
becoming thinner they are becoming
lighter and therefore you know
introducing that appropriate size for
mobile use now the latest Maxwell
offerings are the GTX 850 m and the gtx
860m
they both utilize the GM 107 core with
640 cuda cores 40 texture units up to 2
gigabytes of memory on a 128-bit memory
bus the main difference between the two
cards are the frequency clocks so the
gtx 860m being a more higher-end model
clocked at higher clocks over one
gigahertz to be exact
while the gtx 850 m is more targeted
towards more power conservative yet
productivities use delivering about 20%
less performance at the significantly
lower power draw now aside from what
seems to be like a very complementing
relationship between power efficient GPU
and the notebook seen particularly for
gaming maxwell also is rolling out with
a few awesome features that were
previously only available on
stop Kepler GPUs so we will have game
stream which allows you to stream games
from your notebook directly to your
shield then we also have shadow play
that allows you to record all your
gameplay again from the notebook a
feature that was only available for
Kepler based desktop GPUs is now on
Maxwell for notebooks but to complement
this whole battery improvement there's a
new feature that NVIDIA has up its
sleeve called battery boost and that is
exactly why we have this here DG 70 from
MSI because this was the our test unit
to test out to see how battery boost
worked and how efficient it was really
so battery boost as Nvidia says is a low
level governor so on a driver level that
works with your CPU your GPU and your
memory to adjust both the frequency and
the voltages of all those components to
hit a certain frame target you access
the frame target through GeForce
experience you have the slider between
20 and 50 frames a second that will be a
ceiling frame ceiling battery boost will
work to acquire just enough power from
all your resources in order to hit that
frame target I think this is very
important as one of the main
disadvantages for a majority of gaming
notebooks including this one is battery
life so you can hear gaming while it's
not plugged in it significantly suffers
and it's reducing everything because the
notebook is pushing out pretty much at
maximum capacity that it's capable of
however a battery boost does with a
limits the frame cap and therefore it
will only acquire those resources that
are needed to hit that frame cap and
therefore potentially saving you battery
life and giving you extra game time so
in theory battery boosts that combined
with Maxwell architecture that already
features an extremely powerful core and
yet actually without sacrificing on
performance and so to be your match made
in heaven however in practice while you
still get extra game time there's still
some limitations that we found
particularly with more
this notebook in particular as on
battery it does underclock both the CPU
and the GPU so performance difference
between on battery and plug then is
quite significant and with our unit it
was about 40% difference in performance
while it was plugged in and unplugged
without battery boost now one of the
things that I found interesting while
testing battery boost is that it
actually improved my frame rate so
playing crysis 3 well this is plugged in
we get 57 frames a second on average
unplug your notebook and running the
exactly the same sequence we get 25
frames a second on average with battery
boost off turning on battery boost at
30fps cap and you get that fluid
performance of 30 fps pretty much
consistently throughout the benchmark
which is which is very impressive the
fact that you can still squeeze out a
little bit extra power with battery
boost enabled vs. battery boost off and
just running off the notebook as it's
trying to push out as many frames as
possible I saw exactly the same behavior
in Metro last slide plug then we get 40
FPS on average unplug in notebook with
battery boost off we get 15 FPS and
actually battery booster turning it on
to 30fps cap because it's a demanding
game it does require quite a bit of
power and because of the the under clock
while it's on battery it hits 22 FPS on
average but still tighter than it was
without battery boost and this is pretty
much across the board all the games that
I tried we had higher framerate with
battery boost enabled so in that sense
battery boost actually does give you
better performance wild on battery
however in terms of actually expanding
battery life throughout your gaming
session while Nvidia claims to have in
certain games improved by 200% or
something like that the results that
we've experienced and certain benchmarks
are not as impressive as what they
claimed running the Metro a slight
benchmark on the loop we gained only 5
minutes of extra extra battery life with
30fps cap and actually increasing the
FPS gap to 50
frames/second reduced the battery life
by a minute with games that do not
require as much power when you can set
the FPS limit to 30 and game on battery
you do gain additional game time however
it's not as significant as you know
doubling up the lifetime of the battery
or your game time so battery life does
have its advantages in terms of actually
improving the frame rate from what we've
experienced however not a significant
improvement in battery life as over just
gaming on battery just standard now
overall we've seen that maxwell is very
promising since its early stages with
the gtx 750ti
and finally when it's moved on to the
mobile sector or mobile scene it is also
as impressive for its low power
requirement yet very impressive
performance
now all the features that have been
transferred over from the desktop
counterparts like game stream shadow
play GPU boost 2.0 and very optimized
technology and battery boost all
complement this into a very attractive
package particularly for the mobile
sector particularly for the gaming
sector for that ability to game
on-the-go still gaining a little bit of
extra time while on battery improving
frame rates and while tying this whole
thing together into a very nice package
overall especially when you have to
consider of the competition from Intel
and AMD this seems to be like the
optimal solution at the moment but what
do you guys think of Maxwell GPUs
entering the mobile sector particularly
because the form factor for these types
of notebooks it's quite impressive for
where we've come and we can actually see
a lot of more thin notebooks coming out
rolling out extremely thin profiles that
also feature Maxwell you know is this
perhaps something that you will consider
buying because of Cole factor and
because the performance and perhaps
because of the battery life as well so
let us know how you feel about that in
