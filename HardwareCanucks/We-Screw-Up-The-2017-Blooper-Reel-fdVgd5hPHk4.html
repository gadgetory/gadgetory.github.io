things that we kind of thought about is
you guys see the finished product that
we put out on YouTube that has all the
perfect cuts and everything but what
about all the things that where we mess
up on camera and just like being real in
front of talking to a lens so we decided
to make this compilation the video of
all the bloopers and a little behind the
scenes that really never make it into
the final cut for your enjoyment but
first a message from our sponsor and

answer that question in fact one very
unique point again and so today we
explore why Galaxy Note 8 Galaxy Note it
is really that big of a deal I mean so
many of you guys have watched Galaxy
Note II reviews and so performance wise
don't expand so performance wide and so
