great technology selection and service
hey guys
Eber here with hot rockin accent these
are a few RAM modules from g.skill a
company that is well known for their
range of computer memory for desktops
workstations HTPC as well as laptops the
Taiwanese company is expanding into a
new category now and I think it's about
time for us to check it out this is the
brave jaws km 780 RGB mechanical
keyboard available with a variety of
genuine MX cherry switches it has six
dedicated programmable macro buttons
onboard profile storing options full and
he rollover and 100% anti-ghosting
dedicated media playback buttons RGB
functionality and even a detachable
wrist rest and it costs a hundred and
seventy dollars which is a clear
indication that the keyboard is
competing against the key 70g 9 10 and
the Razer BlackWidow chroma but the
question remains is the km7
80 worthy enough to compete with the
already established players the build
quality of the km7
80 is great the anodized aluminum frame
along with the four millimeter metal
pipe that runs around the edge of the
keyboard
gives it a nice robust feel this is
exactly what I would expect from a
keyboard at this price the design is
nothing too special
yet it's more geared towards convenience
as I mentioned earlier the metal pipe
that runs around the edge of the
keyboard makes it easier to attach the
wrist rest with just a snap and it does
not interfere with handling if the wrist
rest is detached there's also a mouse
cable holder that clips onto the top bar
for organized cable management on your
desk which is an awesome feature to
eliminate annoying Mouse cable travel
the included USB 2.0 pass-through and
audio jacks at the back is a nice
feature although I would have preferred
USB 3 at this day and age the switch
next to the USB pass-through port can be
flipped 2g for full and key rollover or
2's for standard 6 key rollover g.skill
has included a key cap case with the
unique shape key cap polar and some
extra keys for FPS shooters and mobile
players I was not impressed with the
shape nor the plastic construction of
the key caps that feels cheap
and I ended up switching over to the
stop keys the case easily snaps onto the
metal pipe though so gamers don't have
to worry about losing the optional key
caps and could be a cool place to store
little items like USB sticks and such
the soft touch detachable wrist rest is
symmetrical and supports both of my
palms well on top of that it was really
comfortable to type with and a pleasure
for long hours of editing and game
they've also taken the right decision to
include dedicated set of media playback
buttons on the top right hand side along
with a built in volume dial and a cool
led beneath that which adds a nice touch
so you can visualize the volume level
switching over to the top left corner we
find dedicated macro control packed with
on-the-fly macro recordings plus the
ability to switch between three profiles
lock the Windows key and control LED
brightness while all the keys are fully
programmable through their driver
software
the km 780 comes with six dedicated
macro buttons so if you need direct
access to certain functions you're
covered a non RGB version of the
keyboard is available with $40 shade
with your option of MX cherry-red and MX
browns both are great options with this
initial rollout we've got the brown
switch on our model that requires less
actuation force yet they produce
excellent tactile feedback just like MX
red switches and the slightly contour
key caps were comfortable for gaming and
the fast rebounds on the switch is
awesome for first-person shooters the
lighting on the km 780 is a pleasure to
look at all the keys are backlit
individually with sixteen point eight
million colors and can be configured to
your preference through the driver
software
unfortunately the volume indicator
always stays red and so does the backlit
on media playback buttons and the
profile shift kind of ruins the color
customization and now there can be
turned off individually also the color
cycling effects weren't smooth instead
of using a fade the colors rather jump
quickly to the next color it's
unfortunate to see this as many other
RGB keyboards don't have this problem
the drivers software is pretty simple
and easy to navigate there's a physical
layout of the keyboard on the right side
and by clicking on any key you can
assign different functions including
setting up macros towards the left is
where you can add or switch between
profiles
but the built-in profile switch on the
keyboard is a lot more convenient the
setting tab is where you can adjust the
polling rate enable either six or full
and key rollover and a few more settings
including its sleep mode moving on to
the lighting tab there are two options
background lighting is where you can
customize the brightness and the color
of any key either individually or as a
whole now when you switch to effect
lighting you have the option to select
wave Ripple reactive or breathing but
none of these can be applied unless you
create a preset for each of them
individually and so you have to go to
the lighting profiles tab to create a
preset for each effect and you can play
around with the colors in the direction
of them setting but wait you're not done
you have to go back to the lighting tab
select effect lighting and choose two
recent presets that were created you're
still not done the changes won't take
place until you save your current
settings to the device memory let's hope
g.skill can improve with the lighting
customization options with a software
update but for now it's not user
friendly too many steps to go through
you know what I mean despite that we
think g.skill has done an incredible job
with the build quality and design with
this introduction into the peripheral
market and does hold its parts well
despite the strong competition the
premium price may not favour the
popularity aspect especially since this
keyboard doesn't offer anything totally
unique for gamers it feels like a good
reskin of what is already available this
isn't particularly bad but we were
hoping for something extra different as
the gaming keyboard market is already
highly saturated well that concludes our
review what do you think of gee skills
entry into the gaming peripheral market
