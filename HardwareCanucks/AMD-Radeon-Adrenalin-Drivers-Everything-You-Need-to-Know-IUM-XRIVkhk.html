holiday season is upon us and you know
what that means
another major driver lease from AMD
mm-hmm now it may sound like a long time
between drivers but let me explain so
aim DS currently on a cycle of multiple
driver releases throughout the year to
optimize for latest games but every 12
months or so around this time they
released this major driver package that
really pushes their software development
forward so last year around this time we
got the real live Edition which gives us
the ability to record gameplay to stream
gameplay we had new features with
enhanced sync we got radio and chill and
new Walkman settings and so now it's
time for another major step forward
called adrenalin Edition and with it aim
D supposed to has a lot of interesting
new items in there drivers and software
because who doesn't like talking about
drivers and software am i right so let's
get into that right after this get ready
for the holidays with master ups fast
shipping of their gift collection items
they'll get to you before Christmas like
these EMU Purpleheart headphones with
beautiful warm sound and unique wooden
purple housing that are easy to drive
with your phone and come with a fair
price to join a drop link below all
right so let's begin the first thing you
want to make clear is that just like
relive adrenaline isn't meant to add
massive performance boost to your
existing graphics card so if you're a
radiant user who was expecting massive
performance improvements don't get your
hopes up instead these are really meant
to add new features and optimizations
for the user which in my eyes have been
very complimentary to the whole like
you're streaming scene and just being
able to capture things and be able to
display some performance metrics on your
display all done through adrenaline and
with regards to performance AMD showed
us this chart which shows that since
December of 2016 when real live edition
was first launched they've made some
performance improvements in some games
although let's be real nobody plays the
drama 2 anymore and come on you always
got to start the graphs at zero it's
also important to remember that these
numbers were acquired with an Rx 480 and
none of the games aside from overwatch
was actually launched when Reliv was
launched so it's clear that
optimizations were made available when
those games actually were avail
in the market and if you're wondering
about Vega based on our conversation
with AMD it all points towards very
little to no improvements over Reliv
17-point 11.1 moving on to something
that could affect professional gamers
andy has found a way to decrease latency
and increase responsiveness in dx11
titles but AMD did not stop there and
other changes in other areas were made
to like frame rate target control for
example it allows Radian users to select
a specific fps so performance and power
won't be wasted displaying higher than
desired frame rates and this is a great
option for lower paced games that don't
require ultra low frame rates to achieve
proper gameplay speeds and aim these now
making this available for Vulcan titles
so it will work in games like doom and
Wolfenstein new Colossus there's also a
shout out to all the miners who are
driving up all those prices for AMD I
don't know how I feel about that so
there's no specific selectable compute
profile that's actually supposed to
offer up to 15% better hash rates than a
typical gaming setup it will definitely
put the our x-series far ahead of Nvidia
in terms of mining applications but how
will that affect pricing it's kind of
like a preliminary slap in the face that
you know is coming so performance is not
really a priority for adrenaline it's
really the added features that come with
it and while we'd all love to see nice
framerate boost with adrenaline and the
new drivers that's just not gonna happen
in today's environments so one of em
these main goals with adrenaline is to
offer new community features so gamers
can more easily interact with one
another their addition of Walkman allows
for exactly that Walkman is basically
the utility to overclock your graphics
card so now you'll be able to save your
custom profiles and load them into the
cloud for others to actually use or you
can load someone else's settings to see
how they act on your machine it's a
really cool feature but of course
caution will have to be taken into
account I have not talked about Radeon
chill it's still around and some people
getting paid big bucks to say good
things that guys probably like chill bro
if I was in that picture I'd probably be
like just chill so it uses custom
profiles designed by AMD to dynamically
adjust frame rates based on movements in
game so if there's an area without much
detail it
lower the clock speeds on the card and
maintain playable frame rates while also
lowering power consumption and now with
the Adrenaline's going to support even
more games and it would be a very big
deal for Vegas 64 users who are tied to
a very hot very power-hungry graphics
card now past those features aim D will
be improving enhanced sync basically
enhanced sync reduces the amount of
screen tearing when the in-game frame
rate exceeds your displays refresh rate
but before its compatibility was a bit
limited adrenaline opens it to all GCN
based GPUs allows for operation and
games with Vulcan API and will finally
work with multiple GPUs and across
multiple displays a lot of these
features users have been asking for so
long and they're finally here so one of
the major changes with the radio and
Settings app is that aimed he wants it
to become like the hub or where you
control where you can share your
gameplay where you interact with other
members of the community whereas on the
relive it was just offered some basic
control but now with adrenalin you have
a lot more options so in the gallery tab
this is where you can manage modify and
organize and even upload in-game life
captures and screenshots it's pretty
well done and intuitive you can share
them across multiple social platforms
and then flowed multiple files at the
same time in the accounts tab you can
manage your Facebook Twitter YouTube
with all the rest and Twitter now for
our experience on Twitter for example it
would timeout it wouldn't let us connect
to Facebook or YouTube so I'm sure that
aim D will patch it out once it's fully
released but in our early version we
couldn't really test out that streaming
feature just yet
but this will all be complemented by a
very low framerate overhead when video
capture is enabled and interactivity
also takes on a whole new form with the
new radio and overlay which literally
puts all the most important functions
from radion settings onto the screen in
games for example there's performance
monitoring with fps and logging of
overall framerate metrics although the
one-second minimum interval feels kind
of slow especially when displaying frame
range you also cannot adjust the order
on how these metrics are displayed for
example if I want the GPU and CPU
utilization right next to each other you
cannot move them they're gonna kind of
just stuck on where they've been placed
by AMD Radeon relief settings are also
available as an overlay to with
instant replay record and stream and
screenshot functions radio and Chile's
here as an overlay so you can turn that
on and off even modify settings on the
fly and yes free sync is here too for
complete control and don't forget that
the frame rate target control I talked
about earlier is here as well but maybe
one of the most important additions for
me is color overlay that gives you
access to quick and painless color
correction options without having to
actually quit the game it's awesome
stuff to add some saturation and
brightness you can even change the hue
the contrast slider should be renamed to
gamma since that's what it controls but
my favorite is colored temperature so
you can make it extra warm in-game for
Less eye fatigue now these changes are
only visible to the user and do not
affect your own screen capture so if
you're tinkering with the color stuff
that's only for your visual advantage
when you're looking at the monitor and
doesn't actually affect the output file
but I do have a point of feedback and
that is to label the recorded clips not
just by the date but perhaps by
application like we have on GeForce
experience and the last thing to talk
about is aimed the link I'm actually
quite surprised they went the whole
smartphone route and being able to see
performance statistics on your phone iOS
or Android but I guess it kind of makes
sense it ties to the hope you know
peripherals some keyboards have a
smartphone stand so I'm guessing it's
not totally outrageous but it's kind of
cool how you able to actually control
the relief functions being able to start
and share your on-screen gameplay
through your smartphone without I'm
guessing exiting and out tabbing or like
the Auto ring into the relive functions
map is pretty cool the new to Sora grab
SD spectrum is one seriously beautiful
keyboard with perky RGB illumination
macro customization built-in and comes
with to source new removable optical
switches that are dust and water
resistant with linear reds or clicky
blues full details on the SE spectrum
down below and so there you have it aim
these big adrenaline driver launch I'm
pretty excited about the features but of
course we're testing the earlier
software so some things we're not
working like being able to connect to
YouTube or twitch to stream things
regardless of me setting the frame rate
for recording at 60fps all my footage
except one file turned out
to be at 30fps windows decided to revert
to the older driver on AMD because
Microsoft likes to be a nice control
freak but I'm hoping all these things of
course will be cleaned out when the
software launches today now there aren't
really any performance increases with
this driver but they really have
improved on the areas that we live
lacked in terms of capturing your
footage is sharing it and having all
these control but what would you guys
like to see more from AMD in terms of
the drivers software let me know in the
comments below how do you think they did
in terms of connectivity and the whole
user experience I think their UI still
needs a little bit of work the whole
box's approach is great for being able
to expand things and it kind of like
folds into nice little pieces there but
sometimes it's kind of difficult to find
what you're looking for because it's
just like it's very compact but overall
adrenaline is a good step forward I'm
excited to see more so make sure to
