great technology selection and service
what's up guys I'm Dimitri with
hurricane axe welcome to a very special
and interesting video about this little
case here it's got a lot of very unique
functionalities built into it and also
this video is going to be a little bit
unique because we have 1 camera 2 Camera
3 camera hopefully the rx100 is you know
picking up some nice overhead shots and
this is not going to be in a review
video instead this is going to be an
overview video of this case because this
is the servers by Chimaera industries
Sir Bruce case sir Bruce it's very
interesting name for you know a chassis
but I guess it's based off some creature
so it would be very easy for them to you
know label their future releases and
stuff but this case has just launched on
Kickstarter so you are able to you know
if you like the direction the design the
functionality the potential of what you
can do with such an enthusiast case you
can't support them on Kickstarter and
we'll leave the link down the
description below for you so the entire
cool thing about the cerberus case is
the fact that it's super tiny it's only
18 liters in volume on the interior yet
it features so tax basically so much
functionality into it and you can see
design wise it's very reminiscent of the
N case enclosure which was I TX but the
end case you can check it out with the
review over here on description and that
was fantastic super space efficient and
like you can do so much with it well
cami Rhea my spawn Amelia industries is
taking in the whole the design approach
something that was you know very similar
in the what they want to do with space
efficiency and transfer it translated
into something that works a very well in
the compact enclosure but this time with
a micro ATX form factor so that's
awesome because you can see in the back
we have not no not to PCI slots like you
would normally have on my TX enclosure
but
we have five so that's awesome because
if you want to do SLI you know you have
the potential to do so so let's begin by
talking about the exterior this is all
steel with a beautiful powder coat on
top so it's kind of matte black it
doesn't leave much fingerprints now
because it's steel and not aluminum like
on the previous you know like on the end
case competition almost enclosures this
thing is freakin heavy you know just by
itself but it also means that it's very
solid and that I like although I do like
the solidness and the lightness factor
of aluminum so the panels here are all
detachable with clips and they talk
about their sort of philosophy behind
this sort of integration of having these
little clips to let attach into the
panel so you don't have to deal with
thumb screws or just screws in general
and to me that this type of modular
approach up and opens possibilities for
future panels so you can maybe take the
soft paint it modded you know
potentially have different types of
panels in the future and that's so
awesome so everything on this enclosure
is pretty much detachable so the front
panel here the top panel and these clips
are industry like some great industry
grade very quality stuff there's a bit
of stiffness to them sort of that
they're now going to be popping out you
know this is a glass table and Ebers
gonna kill me if I break it but check
this out so normally if you would have a
poor panel that is steel that has quite
a good have to it weight to it you know
it will pop out but check this out this
is actually very difficult maybe a
little bit too difficult to take out but
yeah
so sometimes you just kind of got to get
in there and they're really kind of not
stuck in there but they're very tight
inside their own joints yes here we go
let me just get the bottom of this you
guys got to get the nails in there and
pull but I'm afraid for my nails man
all right good thing this glass is steel
proof but okay at least some panels are
off and I'll show you in a second how
cool these panels are okay this one I
think would be easier to take off but if
they could at least make something some
type of removable process so it's not
super difficult that will be fantastic
but this is actually almost a production
sample so I can assume they they can
take this and refine it now the cool
thing about this panel is you notice
there's only three notches on each side
top and the bottom this means that this
panel is reversible so if you have a
panel with ventilation holes on here you
can position it either you know this way
so that if you have a CPU cooler on the
top part of the the case then it would
intake air here but if you have GPUs
here that need air you can simply flip
the panel and sort of you know work with
that but the cool thing about the top
here so I was looking at this I'm
wondering what the hell is this little
bracket at the top which isn't it
doesn't have any mounting points for a
fan or anything like that but this is
where you would be able to install a
handle so once we install the top panel
you guys can see that these holes align
so you'll be able to mount a handle on
the top without sacrificing anything on
the interior so it doesn't bother any
components on the inside and that's
actually pretty awesome usually with you
know installation of a handle requires
like something inside the frame that you
know may be compromising some interior
clearance and stuff but here it's not
the case you can simply mount the
optional handle on the top and carry the
case to wherever you go so you can
definitely tell that this is a
pre-production sort of non retail park
packaging yet because all the little
accessories or the metal accessories I
arrived in a anti-static anti-static mat
abort bag inside a very fashionable
fantex toolbox
so that's props to them for this type of
implementation but this
handle feels extremely solid like just
it's a simple single piece of steel also
powder-coated and just imagine how much
cool customization you can do because
everything is so modular and removable
just have this handle on top like that
and bam it's not intrusive it's solid
it's attached directly to the frame
because you have that interior
structural support there then we also
find a ATX power supply bracket for
their rear so this is where you'll be
able to install your power suit ATX
power supply in case you have one lying
around and that is one of the reasons
why you may potentially use this if you
don't have the means of acquiring an sfx
power supply but still want to utilize
the case for his system this is awesome
and finally this is what we have this is
your hard drive SSD slash little
brackets so they have little holes on
the side of them and they have little
mounting holes at the bottom which means
you can you know is move them around
anywhere anywhere you want
especially because both the floor and
the front have those flexible mounting
points so you can literally install them
anywhere inside your case modularity
exactly how I like it the entire sort of
grid is modular you can position the
fans in whichever way you want around
where you want so this of course will be
installed on the interior because on the
on the exterior there is no room for a
120mm fan because the the cover would go
on top and obviously because the cables
here so you will be able to install the
fans on the interior anywhere around the
grid and the same goes for the over here
this is a 92 millimeter fan on the on
the outside for the rear also will be
installed on the inside so moving on at
the bottom it also has a very similar
grid you know like ventilation holes as
for the front so you'll be able to
install like different types of
configuration of fans or a hard drive
cage that we don't we then receive but I
know there's going to be like a
duel hard drive cage that you'll be able
to install on the interior with a
similar mounting method where some holes
will align with any of these openings a
nice and simple stuff so very modular on
the back not much clearance at all like
if you were to install a panel here
there is zero clearance and so all the
interior cabling will have to be done
well all the cabling will have to be
done on the interior which is actually
kind of a cool way to approach cable
management and here it can be a fun
challenge and it has been well it can
also be a frustrating challenge as well
power supply support would be s FX + s
FX L which is the new standard from from
silverstone and it would be installed on
the top here so the power supply would
be sort of at the front of the case
occupying the top front portion like
here s FX on s FX l are preferred but
like I said earlier if you want to use
an ATX power supply in here you can get
a separate low piece that would allow in
the ATX power supply to be installed
this way right above the motherboard so
there's a little bit of compatibility
and some compromises to be had with a
larger power supply but of course the
whole idea of this case is to make up
your mind about what type of build you
want to do first and then sort of you
know go ahead and assemble the system so
now when we move on to the interior of
the case this is where things get
interesting
lots of modular options here and
especially of course the the selling
point of this enclosure would be the 5
PCI slots for SLI now the side bracket
is awesome because it's on the hinge so
you can easily mount things outside of
the case sort of and you can easily
access the interior interior once the
system is assembled especially if you
have let's say like an all-in-one cooler
here you can simply open it you don't
have to remove things and it's super
simple and it's attached with two screws
on the side the thing is this side
bracket does not support it to 40 mm in
radiator it does support dual one 120
millimeter fans but for some reason they
don't list compatibility with a 240
member radiator
on the side bracket which was weird to
me because the you'll be able to install
two 120mm fans but I guess maybe some
interior clearance issues might arise
but this is weird because the MKS m1
which is a more compact enclosure does
support a 240 number radiator on the
side bracket so not sure what's going on
there but the fact that you know it's
using similar mounting points over here
so you can move things around you can
you know maybe put a 140 or 120 meter
all in one cooler in here for the CPU
and then the other side of the portion
the other side of the bracket can be
occupied by maybe a drive cage or
something like that so there are some
options in here but I don't know I was a
little bit disappointed the fact that we
cannot mount a 240 ml rad on the side
bracket you can only do that on the
bottom and in the front and that again
comes with its own challenges so you
cannot install an SF X power supply here
if you're installing any radiator in the
front and the same goes for the bottom
if you are installing it 240 ml rather
at the bottom then what's the point of
having you know all the height clearance
because if you're not going to be using
both GPU slots for this enclosure then
you know you might as well go for
something a little bit smaller that can
support a 240 radiator on the side now
the one thing that I really wish that
Camaro industries would realize and you
know maybe solve is the fact that see
all these IO cables why are they so long
the motherboard view will be right here
so it would be fantastic for them to
realize that and give us you know sort
of almost cut to the length cables
because they add eio new is diverse to
USB 3 is very very quality power button
in audio jacks but come on
the cool thing though like I said
earlier is this micro ATX format so the
case is just a tiny bit bigger has 5 PCI
slots and so you can sort of go to town
and how you want to set it things up
inside dual GPUs in this very tiny fact
a form factor that can also support a
hand
that's fantastic I think the enthusiast
community will be very happy with
something like this entering the market
especially because well it's taking a
lot of those same same concepts and same
format ideas as the N case m1 enclosure
but taking a step further with adding to
PCI slots adding three PCI slots
actually and having very similar modular
approach with regards to the power
supply so ATX sfx on sfx l cooler
possibilities you know either with a
radiator or an actual cpu heatsink if
you'd want to do that to go that route
and airflow options seem to be diverse
even though you have some compromises
here and there so if you have a power
supply in the front like an SF X or an F
s FX L then the top portion of your of
this area will be occupied but you still
be able to install a bottom fan here so
it delivers cool air for your graphics
cards and that's awesome and so my ideal
configuration here if this was an SLI
sort of rig would be to so to hook up an
SF X L power supply because it has a
bigger fan and silverstone has released
them super efficient high wattage so you
have no problem powering you know to
graphics cards and you know a very
powerful micro ATX system in here have a
fan here so that delivers cool air for
two graphics cards I would definitely
want to handle for my enclosure the case
side panels also comes with a little
window if you know you want to show off
those graphics cards so that definitely
would want to do that I don't know what
else to say about this case I'm very
happy with this direction I'm sorry
about this rambling type of video
delivery but I hope you guys enjoyed it
and let us know if you know this is
something you guys are interested in
like I said earlier link will be in the
description to their Kickstarter page so
you can check it out for yourself see if
it's something you want to support but
we hope that you know this goes further
into the future right now they have only
a few days left and they're not yet
close to the goal but at least I hope
that you know regardless of what happens
with the outcome of the Kickstarter
campaign that this type of enclosure
nation and the concepts move forward so
we can have better enthusiasts sort of
you know builders out there thinking
about crazy things to do in such compact
packages so guys I hope you enjoy this
video I'm Dimitri with Howard Canucks
thanks so much for watching and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
