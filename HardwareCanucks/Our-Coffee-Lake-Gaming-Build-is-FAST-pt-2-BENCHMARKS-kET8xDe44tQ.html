gaming system and so I realized that
working with an ITX motherboard
regardless of case size I mean this one
is so gigantic is still quite
challenging because of Cale management
and how things are really concentrated
in such tiny spaces I try to make sure
you this space is as clean as possible
but of course the compromise is having
all these cables and just making sure
that they're flat enough so the the side
panel could close just fine and so the
next thing for me would be to figure out
how to position this case inside my
space so it has been a few days I've
made some adjustments I have overclocked
the chip and this I five is impressive
so let's check it out right after this
the master of vast curved gaming monitor
is now available measuring at 35 inches
with 34 40 by 1440 resolution at 100
Hertz and free sink support with nice
stand that can do portrait mode because
why not so join the drop with a link in
the description below to get your game
on
ok so first of all the idea of two pcs
at one desk didn't really take off for
me because the shift X enclosure is just
too different to fit in my space and I
don't want to really hide it under the
desk plus my 4k display isn't exactly
gaming friendly at 60 Hertz so instead
I've decided to have a gaming desk in
the office with the proper 144 Hertz
display and proper gaming audio - so I
used the element amp for my rising
workstation and this new arc headphone
amplifier from Mayflower because it also
has a microphone jack so I can plug in
my headset and not really worry about
reaching into the top section of the
case for that IO so actually since
getting this set up I realize how
perfect and the ITX form factor is for
let's say a secondary gaming system
especially in an office as small as mine
and while the case is super tall and I'm
not really using it to full advantage I
really do appreciate the minimal
footprint the case occupies on my desk
which is about the same as the monitor
and to complete the build inside I
actually removed the whites leaving and
the extensions and the RGB memory
because it added to the bulk of cables
and fantex actually included a thin 8
pin CPU extension that I routed near the
fan to the rear and also this entire
midsection is now a little bit more
under control cable wise without the
stick extensions I have added non RGB
g.skill memory at 3200 megahertz and the
rest of the system has stayed the same
now I couldn't flip the radiator because
the tubing is not long enough and you
can see how unoccupied the bottom
section is so while I appreciate having
the option to install a 280 Milan
radiator to cool my 80 600 k the shift X
is truly designed for a custom heart
tubing water cooling only especially
because the GPU on the other side has no
air to breathe because of that glass
panel and my GTX 1080 is not reaching
the normal 2 gigahertz frequency instead
we're staying around 1700 megahertz
with a side panel closed and that idle
we're also a little bit hot in high 60
degree Celsius so no wonder it is
throttling at load as for CPU
temperatures at stock 4.3 gigahertz it's
kind of hot as well reaching over 70
degrees Celsius and the front panel is
not deep enough to allow airflow to exit
seamlessly so there is a bit of
turbulence going on so we dropped 5
degrees Celsius by removing the front
panel with the fans even a slightly
lower rpm so the system was quieter and
this actually seems to be the common
complaint for a fan --tx paneling it
looks awesome but the case needs to
breathe more and for performance I am
mainly interested in gaming frame rates
but look at how it compares to my rising
machine in Cinebench and then Adobe
Premiere I am quite impressed at the
rendering performance considering its a
6 core 6 thread part that's faster than
my Rison 7 and that overclocked really
helps with rendering performance and by
the way overclocking to 5 gigahertz was
surprisingly simple no issues with
stability but the fans were ramping up
for sure but that additional performance
is quite nice now I do play it 1440p at
maximum settings and performance is
simply awesome you can see that over
here and so the 80 600 K at this $250
price point is actually pretty
incredible for games horizon 7 cannot
touch these averages because the clocks
on the AMD CPU are not high enough now I
have considered to switch to calculate
because of this fantastic Adobe Premiere
performance but I'm going to be sticking
with the risin for now because in
multitasking coffee Lake still does
struggle in terms of
during a video and then me trying to do
something in the foreground so whereas
with Rison I have a little bit more
multitasking ability even though the
render times are slower but that might
change if I get an 8700 K what a
performer this I 5 chip I am honestly
very impressed by the performance in
Adobe Premiere in particularly like the
thing is faster in the rendering videos
than my rise in the machine you know I
love my Rises but Wow calculate damn
you're impressive but if you've been
considering to upgrade perhaps from an
earlier generation Intel processor make
sure to check out our 8700 K versus 2600
K video and to see what the performance
difference is between those two CPUs
because the time gap is quite large but
the performance gap and games isn't now
I'm pretty happy with my case of choice
because it's so tall and allows me to
mount that giant radio and on the front
even though there's a bit of airflow
restriction live here and I'm not
utilizing this case to its full
potential I'm pretty happy with how
little room a footprint that occupies on
a desk so I can take this off hide it
somewhere and then take it out again
when I need the game alright so now I
have two systems one for work one for
play and I realized that I should have
gone the ITX route for my secondary
gaming station a long time ago because
of the convenience of the space of
course but I guess I just didn't have
any coffee so thank you guys so much for
