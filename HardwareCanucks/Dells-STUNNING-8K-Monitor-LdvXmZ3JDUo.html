interesting show and Dell actually had
quite a bit on display maybe the most
interesting thing in their space was
this monitor which really does take
ultra high definition to the next level
so this is the ultra sharp you p32 18k
it is the first 32 inch 8k pc monitor
and it's absolutely stunning to see in
person let me tell you guys pictures
don't do this thing any justice at all
but before we move on click message from
our sponsor the show coverage is
possible thanks to Nvidia gigabyte
fantex and NCIX to put the ultra sharp
into perspective it boasts four times
the resolution of a standard 4k monitor
which tends to result in mind-blowing
sharpness this is 280 PPI of pure
picture goodness backstopped by a pre
calibrated premium color 10 bit panel
which has the capability to hit 1.07
billion colors 100% Adobe RGB and 100%
srgb you have to see this monitor in
action to believe something like this
exists you can literally put your face
up on the screen without seeing
individual pixels it's that good Dell
will show you a number of images on it
during their demo to us and we were able
to take a look at a picture of an
Italian town actually and count the
bricks on every individual building
without zooming in another benefit is
this monitor allows for color profiles
for the 7680 by 1430 screen to be locked
into its memory independently of the GPU
input a factor that is a key selling
point for some professionals as you can
see there are a few limitations a.k
takes a ton of horsepower to drive
properly and Dell was using a high-end
precision workstation to simply display
2d content on it due to the resolution
dual DisplayPort inputs are required and
the panel can't make it over 60 Hertz
due to the displace input bandwidth
limitations now some of you may be
thinking we're just seeing the tip of
the 4k iceberg and it's already been
supplanted by a K but don't be so hasty
even though Dell has begun implementing
this technology into a single monitor it
is still phenomenally expensive
challenging to implement and really
meant for very specific niches like
medical architecture and cartography as
a matter of fact even Windows 10 and
many applications don't even natively
support such a high res
and as a result toolbars and icons
become microscopic on the screen from my
perspective this is a great tool for
presentation purposes but until there is
a wire application support for beyond 4k
formats those 33 million pixels may be
wasted the other interesting display was
the s 27 18 d which uses quad HD
technology on an infinity-edge IPS panel
and HDR support for a great-looking
image with wide viewing angles even
though the panel had one of the best
combinations of color saturation and
black depth we saw in delt display space
the real shocker with this monitor is
how thin it is according to delve this
is overall the fitness monitor on market
today and that's certainly not hard to
believe others may have a slightly
thinner panel but since all of the s
27:18 DS components were moved into its
sleek machined aluminum base plate the
entire profile could have been shrunken
down to the thickness of a few sheets of
paper meanwhile the hinge design allows
for some adjustability and connectivity
can be achieved through either a USBC
connector or HDMI it achieves that HDR
spec not through a standardized HDR 10
but rather Dells own take on the format
which they feel delivers even more
accurate colors this could be a perfect
monitor for a collaborative space since
it looks as good from the front as it
does from the back I'm Eva with Harvard
connects thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next CES video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
