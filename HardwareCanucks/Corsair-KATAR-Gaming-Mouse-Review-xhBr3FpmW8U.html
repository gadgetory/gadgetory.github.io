great technology selection and service
the corsair Kartar is a mouse that goes
after the basics without trying to cover
the entire gaming genre it is an FPS and
MOBA mouse first that satisfies its
purpose really well with a pleasant form
great build quality and nice sensor
priced at $39 the Qatar hits a mid-range
price bracket that looks good for what
it is so let's see if this should be
your next Mouse upgrade so first with
the build quality it is all plastic but
feels so solid and weights only 85 grams
which is feather territory for easy
lifting and covering large movement
areas no problem I love the triangular
side texture that helps with the grip on
both sides the top surface is slightly
rubberized and the shape is actually
pretty good for a hybrid finger grip the
length of the body is significantly
smaller than the rest of the game mice
in my collection
and I have pretty large hands and I was
actually ok with the smaller body it is
an ambidextrous design but supports both
the thumb and ring and pinky fingers on
the other side very well without any
uncomfortable curves was an awesome way
to include left hand gamers into the
equation the primary buttons have a very
satisfying and light click with some
travel distance with the right click
being just as light as the left which is
awesome for mobile titles where the
right click is utilized just as much as
the left click the scroll wheel is good
it's got nice texture on the top for
control but I wish the scroll steps were
a bit more defined but one thing that I
don't understand is why 90% of gaming
mice re-review have an uncomfortably
difficult to press middle click that
when pressed activates scrolling not
only that but the large and easy to
press DPI shift behind the scroll wheel
is right where your middle finger would
fall if you were to press the middle
click that results in unwanted DPI shift
when you try to press the scroll wheel
and this is a big problem because the
absence of site browser buttons means I
want to utilize every single click on
this mouse to its full potential like
mapping press to talk to the middle
but because of this combination of
really hard click and interference with
a dpi shift it's kind of a waste of a
button in that sense also if you're used
to site browser buttons well tough luck
aesthetically I love the simplicity and
the - color tone of the body with the
read-only illuminated coarser logo at
the back and coarser text on the left
click that is conveniently is not
covered by your finger and compliments
and brand recognition
well the cable is non removable but with
an awesome yellow USB for easy
distinction and at the bottom we find
large Teflon feet that are removable but
no replacements are included in the
package and then the start of the show
the optical zero acceleration sensor
firing off a red LED so we recommend the
dark surface nothing too reflective and
this sensor feels really accurate
combined with a comfortable body and
smooth glide for a pleasant gaming
experience
I do miss those side browser buttons
though when browsing the web but some
people prefer to have no side buttons to
avoid accidental presses and then that
is the mouse for you so at its core the
guitar is well suited for gaming with
easy button assignment - lighting modes
either solid or post and up to 5 dpi
profiles with lift height adjustment and
it's pretty cool pro player mode where
the DPI modes mimic that of the
professional players so you can
experiment with how they game and so all
in all the Qatar is this basic no
gimmicky gaming mouse with excellent
sensor great primary buttons and good
body the only fault you'll find here is
they're really difficult to press middle
click and the lack of side buttons but
if you're after precision then this
mouse will not disappoint and in 40
bucks this is a damn good value product
