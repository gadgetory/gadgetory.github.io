great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry and welcome back
to another Harwick NOx review Audio
Technica is one of audio pioneers and
I'm actually using one of their mics to
record this review but I've never had a
chance to enjoy any of their headphones
so today we're going to check out the
ath ad700x which I believe are identical
in their sound properties as the
previous ad700 but with improved
aesthetic design and these will set you
back around $200 so for an entry-level
audiophile headphone this isn't all that
bad
ad stands for air dynamic which means
they're open back headphone and also are
designed with comfort in mind now if
you've never owned a pair of open-back
headphones be prepared to be blown away
by the airy soundstage at compromise of
lack of any sound isolation which means
there's a lot of audio leak and you can
perfectly hear what's happening in your
environment as well which I actually
prefer specs why is this house massive
53 millimeter drivers decent sensitivity
of 100 DB a wide frequency range and
impedance of 38 ohms meaning you'll be
fine running these through a tablet or
smartphone as electrical current
resistance is still quite low but
writing these with an amp or a DAC sure
will push them at higher volumes the 700
X stand behind the air marketing waiting
only at 265 grams which is actually
quite light given these are not that
small aesthetically I'm loving the
design with aluminum honeycomb ear cups
that lets you see the internals plus the
audio technica logo and the large ear
cushions are very comfortable they are
deep and the drivers inside our angled
so your ears do not make any contact
with the inside of the ear cup and while
the ear cups are massive the 700 X makes
up with an interesting headband using
very open design that lets your head
breathe with the help of this 3d wing
design this gets rid of the conventional
over the headband but I find them to be
a little too loose and they don't
particularly seem robust the cabling is
hidden
inside the overhead tubes that are
actually quite flexible and putting them
on notice these are very large over the
ear headphones with the 3d wings
automatically adjust to fit your head
but remember how I said these are
slightly more loose than I'd prefer and
while they can easily slide down or fall
off your head if you shake it vigorously
overall they're very comfortable but
after several hours of use I did notice
my ears were basically supporting the
weight of the headphone and not so much
the headband pieces all right so let's
finally talk audio quality and while the
audio is very subjective experience I do
have a pair of son Heiser's that I sort
of used as a baseline for comparison and
always let the review pair to burn in
over two nights as that does help to
waken up the drivers my first
impressions with the 700x were pleasant
but not completely satisfactory these
scans are quite flat and the bass
response was completely absent I would
say these are overly bright meaning the
highs are more forward and razor-sharp
overall they're very well balanced with
particular attention on the mid-tones
that really bring out the best in audio
layering and vocals i powered these
through a tascam DAC and playing flags
and high bitrate mp3s at higher volumes
was pleasant without distortion still
the treble was a tap too harsh for my
taste but working with some simple magic
and EQ did manage to deliver more
pleasant results raising the bass just a
smidge and the ad700x did come alive
with a bigger punch that's not
overwhelming nor money but certainly not
as deep and did recess the mid-tones so
pushing the bass even further completely
destroyed the audio balance the emphasis
however with these headphones is audio
fidelity with very well default balance
low mids and highs without damaging
enhancements now given these open-back
headphones I was prepared for some crazy
soundstage which is the ability to
pinpoint the direction of audio in a
3-dimensional space while the 700x
provided a much improved soundstage over
say closed back headphones these
definitely shines for instrumental and
classical music where every head of
guitar peg or changing chords are very
distinguishable and the crispy highs and
nicely tuned mid-tones helped
to immerse you in the sound the sound
stage here is very airy and if you
listen to a lot of vocals you'll notice
them to be slightly more distant which
might not necessarily be a good thing
I'm a huge fan of uplifting house and
trance and I always revert to my son
Heiser for more bounce lows and deeper
bass now coming to my favorite part
putting these on for some gameplay was
very satisfying given the large
soundstage and amazingly bounce
mid-tones and sharp highs directionality
with a 7 100x is amazing playing
battlefield 3 which has a very good
multi-layer audio engine you do really
become a lot more aware of your
surroundings hearing distant gunshots
and pinpointing exactly where that came
from is very rewarding when you sneak
around for a knife kill opening up csgo
and listen to an unaware opponent coming
around the corner will score you some
points and for those still deciding what
gaming headsets to purchase for your
hourly sessions I cannot stress enough
of how important roomie soundstage is
and nicely bound mid tones for gameplay
now these do like appropriate punch when
an RPG lands beside you so that was
certainly something that I missed but
where it lacks in bass response and
makes up in mids and the highs so
finally let's summarize this review into
our usual pros and cons and what the 53
millimeter drivers do serve justice for
incredible balance for lows mids and the
highs open bag design allows for years
to breathe so even after an all-nighter
expect to have some sore eyes but happy
ears also thanks to a very light and
comfortable design soundstage for gaming
is perfect with excellent directionality
I do however am NOT completely satisfied
with the wind design instead of the
headband they're just too loose for my
liking
and the bass response is bland and it
needs a little touch of EQ to waking
them up overall this is a very good pair
of open-back headphones if you are
particularly interested in using these
for gaming or instrumental genres as
they deliver an insane amount of clarity
and I'm giving them the Harwick Knox dam
go to word because they deliver to what
they're designed for and that's clear
mid-range and crisp treble
so thanks guys for watching and we'll
see you in the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
