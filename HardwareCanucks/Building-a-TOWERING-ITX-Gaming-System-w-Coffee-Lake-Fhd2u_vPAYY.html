fantastic day so in that little
introductory montage I'm excited to
share this process with you because I'm
about to build an ITX gaming station
with the Z 370 I gaming motherboard for
my soos a coffee League CPU and a
chassis that I've been very excited to
finally open up and build inside of it
if the shift X from fantex so will come
along this should be a fun one let's
begin right after this Wow is this yours
it sure is but how hue hue hue hue hue
hue it pays off to stay loyal
ends xtq plus now available in black or
white lighting up my air RGB fans to
complement the crack and cooler all
inside the beautiful
Mantha ITX NZXT bring all those colorful
dreams together test your own
imagination links for parts in the
description below alright so welcome to
our first coffee like gaming build that
I'm going to try to pimp out as much as
possible and actually give this whole
two systems in one space a shot with my
rising 7 build for video editing and
rendering and this coffee like built
strictly for gaming the case of choice
is the fantasy evolved shift X this
whole vertical structure is still
unusual to me especially because it's 66
centimeters in height and proportions
just look way off
especially when it's standing right next
to the smaller evolve shift and so make
sure to check out that review if you're
interested but what's really cool about
the larger shift X is compatibility of
up to 280 millimeter all-in-one or a
radiator inside the case and that's
going to be needed for best cooling and
silence I am using the kraken X 62
because of the slimmer tubing gorgeous
ring illumination and also adding these
cable male or sleeving
to complement the lighter color scheme
that I'm going for
so I am both excited and kind of nervous
of using the shift X because I've really
never had anything this tall on my desk
and it's also quite slim so it's almost
like a little scratch paper but the
thing is despite the feet being kind of
relatively stable the thing does wobble
a bit and I'm hoping that once I
populate the system in there it will
become heavy enough that you know it
doesn't make me worried of like slightly
tipping it over because like this out
buying very little bit of pressure and
it does wobble no because of the table
but because of the feet and one of the
coolest things about the case in my
opinion would be the whole see-through
nature so glass on both sides that means
that regardless of what you populate in
there you really have to put in the time
and effort to make it look good
otherwise you know regardless of what
you put in there everything is visible
and the glass is not it's tinted but
doesn't have any color cast which is
awesome and it's not like super tinted
so you can actually see through and yeah
it's the incentive for you to do a good
job the case supports ATX power supplies
thanks to that larger bottom chamber but
to keep the shroud to help with kale
management so instead we've got an SFX L
power supply that is fully modular and
I'm using the white sleeved extensions
as well to keep things in character and
to illuminate the interior because this
is a fantasy enclosure it kind of made
sense to use these halos Lux RGB fan
frames that connect directly to the
lighting of the case so no additional
hardware is required for lighting
control and I really like the subtle fan
illumination that should spill some
color onto the rest of the hardware on
the inside now this is an ITX system so
we've got an issue z 370 I giving them
on the board the color scheme here is
perfect but I'm very happy with a
feature set like three four pin fan
headers dual em that two slots one of
which is below this heatsink and the
other is on the backside of the
motherboard there's a front panel USB
3.1 gen2 connector unfortunately I will
not be using since the case does not
have that and the rest of the i/o is
equipped with AC Wi-Fi really good audio
ports a bunch of more USBs and Gigabit
LAN the processor of choice is the i5
8600 k it's a six core six thread cpu so
the lack of multi-threading is not ideal
for video production which is why I'm
allocating this build for gaming only
for memory we've got the new Corsair
Vengeance RGB in white it's only a 16
gigabyte kit but it's super fast at 3600
megahertz and for gaming 16 gigabytes is
plenty and for the graphics card I
actually took out the GTX 980 for the
win Edition out of my Rison workstation
and will use this in a coffee like build
because the color scheme matches
perfectly with the motherboard and I'll
just pop in the gtx 1070 into the
editing build instead so as you can see
all my hardware is laid out over here
very excited to populate it inside the
shift X and see how the keys handles
assembly and see if it's Fred worthy
right now it's on top and one more thing
I forgot to mention are these things
these are silver thumb screws that go
along with my color scheme very well so
excited to populate it not just actually
you can't even do anything on the
exterior but on the interior mainly to
like you know hold down the GPU and like
drives and stuff so we'll see
alright so the assembly is complete but
it wasn't without issues along the way
and so I realized that working with an
ITX motherboard regardless of case size
I mean this one is so gigantic it is
still quite challenging because of Cale
management and how things are really
concentrated in such tiny spaces so for
example here there are a lot of cables
tucked away underneath memory modules
and this USB 3.0 header for the
motherboard sticks out too much so this
magnetic flap on this channel doesn't
even close fully so what's up with that
and for the power supply I actually
could not mount it with a fan facing on
the outside because the extension cable
that is underneath the power supply is
too thick and I couldn't turn it in a
way that allowed me to install the power
supply the way I wanted so right now
it's taking air in from this area and
it's exhausting it from the bottom and
so this fan is here probably taking that
air back inside here so it creates this
little turbulent situation here which is
not ideal but in terms of cable
management so we do have this cable
power supply shroud which is a little
bit pointless it just covers up the exit
area but as you can see all the cables
are located on this side of the case so
actually would not recommend using
extensions because they just add to the
bulk and you know it looks a little bit
messy even with my white extensions I'm
thinking if I went full black it would
help to hide those cables much better
and so I've tried to make them as flat
as possible on this side panel I have
the SSD so they're basically exiting
from this shroud on this side and there
they're entering back into the
midsection so that I could actually
round them into the motherboard and
that's for the graphics card cable it
just sticks out like that and it's
connected right there so yeah it's a
little bit convenient I try to make sure
you this space is as clean as possible
but of course the compromise is having
all these cables and just making sure
that they're flat enough so the the side
panel could close just fine on this side
I think I've done a really good job with
kale management so first of all the GPU
is over here also lit up just as the
rest of my components in this nice blue
for the radiator fans and the Halos RGB
fan frames so I'm routing all these
cables on this edge and basically
stuffing all these cables here
very clean on this side so that when the
glass panel is sits there I mean you're
gonna see all this white space that's
just empty but the rest of the
components look nice and tidy
now we unfortunately encountered
incompatibility with this vengence RGB
LED Ram from Corsair with a Z 370
platform so as you can see I'm right now
on the Corsair link and normally we
would find the LED control right over
here but it's not compatible with the Z
370 yet it's fine on Z 170 C 270 and
raisa motherboards but not on this
platform just yet and one more thing I
will mention is that I'm very happy that
asu's provides this type of network
adapter instead of having dual antennas
on the top because the motherboard is
facing up so all the i/o is this way as
you can see right now I have the USB
plugged in and therefore cannot close
the top panel but of course if this was
removed I can simply close this like
that but if your motherboard ITX
motherboard had those antennas for the
Wi-Fi then you wouldn't actually be able
to use those ports for that so it's
really good that we have this little
antenna that is low-profile I could hide
it somewhere actually maybe even
integrate like as a shark fin somewhere
like that but we'll see we'll see and I
do appreciate how quiet this system is
in total we have 4 140 millimeter fans
one the bottom two over here and one for
the motherboard area plus we have the
GPU with the pump now is the power
supply fan and yeah they're nice and
quiet and so the next thing for me would
be to figure out how to position this
case inside my space just so that it
complements my room and doesn't really
look awkward when the salt also maybe
I'm gonna place it beside my other case
and maybe they just like stand together
as friends but yeah
then all it is to do is test out how
this coffee like machine performs in
games so stay tuned for part 2 coming
soon and so that's it for me for today
if you have any tips or feedback on how
to utilize dual systems in one space
without creating too much clutter let me
know in the comments below I'm a dmitriy
