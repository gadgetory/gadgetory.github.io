Canucks and I say this on every case
review that with any new case release it
is vital for it to be different and
afford to follow market trends so it's
not simply pushed aside by already
established solid competition so EVGA is
releasing their second case ever the DG
8 line let's see if it's any good the
Kraken x61 by NZXT offers fantastic
cooling with up to 180 memory radiator
with long slim tubing for easier
installation and high pressure copper
cold plate you can also customize led
through the cam software so get crackin
and so this is the DG 87 its top of
their line with plenty of interesting
goodies and I love the complete change
of direction compared to their first
enclosure the hadron air which was tiny
now there are many elements on this case
that limit its target reach since the
price is quite high although it does
range depending on the model plus the
design and size may not appeal even to
enthusiasts the shape reminds me of an
IT stella vision combined with a dresser
because of that mirror portion at the
bottom I'm not against mirrors on cases
but it just feels so out of place
perhaps a different shape for that
portion or maybe a tempered glass would
save the visuals on this side the good
thing here is the totally new look to be
different but this armored looking frame
makes the case gigantic and surprisingly
not as comfortable to work in Here I am
next to it with a GPU for scale also you
guys are weird wanted to see a banana
for scale
so anyway this thing is very heavy and
difficult to move around keep that in
mind and the only design element that I
appreciate are the continuous angular
ventilation on the top the front and the
back that unify and otherwise I'm sorry
to say but an ugly case parts of the IO
is at the top with power recent buttons
two USB 2.0 ports and a K button that
I'll describe later and the meet of the
i/o is located in the mirror portion
with audio couple of USB threes power
reset type C and HDMI which is awesome
for Type C accessories and VR
applications for that HDMI plus we have
a built-in fan controller for this
particular model for intake and exhaust
locations that is digital with five
percent speed increments adjustment and
a temperature display in Celsius that is
monitored by this probe that is plenty
long and can be moved around inside the
case now there's no way to turn off the
display
unless power is disconnected and since
we have three digits and temperature
always showing we have the constant zero
in the front unless of course your case
is on fire and so then we have this K
button that changes your windows power
options so it's not like a custom
software with which you tweak CPU and
GPU frequency it's just a simple
shortcut to change from you own your
balanced performance or power savings
and then we have this EVGA DG tuner
which is a software fan control if you
don't want to touch those buttons on the
case so here you can select which power
settings K boost enables and so moving
on behind the front panel is a built in
removable dust filter with three 140 mm
fans that are included 360 and 420
millimeter radiators are supported here
moving to the top we have another 140 mm
er fan with again 360 and 420 millimeter
radiators supported we could potentially
have seen another fan spot at the back
here since this space allows for it but
it doesn't and this is also a good
representation of the extra thickness of
that back portion the top panel does not
have a dust filter which is unfortunate
given the large ventilation mesh and all
the dust will just percolate through the
side panels to us opens with a button
press
to 90 degrees so it is highly
recommended to remove the panel during
assembly and I like this approach
although it could be refined as the
mechanism is extremely stiff so I needed
to use both my hands when I was removing
it and the side panel dropped on my foot
then we have a glossy cover that is
removable with a thumb screw it's
supposed to cover up this right portion
where you'll have all the cables but the
glossy plastic looks terrible doesn't
fit with the material choices of this
case I love the rear side panel though
it's easily accessible and design wise
it does not feel out of place finally
opening the back compartment here we
find two more 140 member fans that are
pre-wired and have fan grills to prevent
any cable death and there's also that
middle divider for airflow channeling
the HDMI pass-through cable is found
here with large openings for the
interior so you could guide exhaust with
those two fans and you could set up
something with water cooling through
these cutouts but given the nature of
how that compartment opens it perhaps
best for fans only also since this
compartment is totally enclosed all the
cables we have to pass through this
large side grommet it's quite
inconvenient for connecting peripherals
and just guiding GPU cables
but the biggest drawback for me is case
orientation because of it since the side
must either face the wall or stay at an
angle to hide this cable exit now the
case is large enough already so having
it stand this way against the wall may
further limit the target audience there
is one more panel behind the power
supply with a small dust filter and I
really like what they've done with the
rear of the case for storage where you
can install eight hard drives or twelve
SSDs with removable dual drive cages
side by side and SSD caddies placed on
the corners with the midsection occupied
by three more caddies the drive cage
utilize a locking mechanism that works
great that's to us plus the metal
caddies are very well designed with
proper mounting locations so SATA
connections align between SSD and HDD
and both drives can be installed facing
the interior of the case which may be
easier for cable routing now I wish
there was an easy way to remove that
entire bottom portion of the plastic
that will help reaching those bottom
drives if they're facing here and
because of that extensive IO there are
so many cables that are already pre
routed and have blacks leaving which is
so appreciated plus we have these cable
rings that are built in to clean
everything up at the back and so after
completing the assembly the system looks
okay ei QX motherboards would look
better filling so much space but there
were a couple of hiccups along the way
first the power supply is installed too
far back in the basement so my 24 pin
cable did not have enough reach unless
it was routed from the front like so now
I did eventually connected the 24 pin
with uncomfortable tension on the cable
but as the saying goes out of sight out
of mind
so this slightly cover is awesome to
hide this section then I just have to
get rid of that glossy plastic piece
that is illuminated by the way with the
white interior LED I'm just not feeling
that color plus EVGA branding and what
it's meant to really hide is the
reservoir bracket which has 70
millimeters of clearance until the frame
it is removable if you're not planning
on using it but if I was water cooling I
would definitely want to show off my
tube and you know ditch that glossy
plastic for the top we have 65
millimeters of height clearance for top
radiators but nothing underneath the ATX
board for discreet cable routing I would
appreciate a few more cable openings
here speaking of cables absolutely no
issues with space at the rear even if
you were to populate all the storage
spots the panel closes just fine and we
can move on on to the conclusion and so
the DG 87 has been sort of a
disappointment despite its uniqueness I
think the major drawback for me would be
the size and the general appearance of
the case the mirror portion the glossy
pieces on the inside just feel out of
place now I can appreciate a vgs
direction to be totally different with
modern inclusion like type-c HDMI
pass-through and really cool fan
controller auto execution again in the
design department could be better the
biggest surprise for me during assembly
was how cramped the case felt despite it
being so large especially if you're
trying to access the bottom front fans
it's super uncomfortable
because you can run through move that
bottom side portion of the plot
stick and also for case of this size
everybody will be complaining of it not
having any five the quarter-inch space
are slots because you can use that for
fan controllers reservoirs etc and for
you know the basement having so much
space so much extra space I feel like it
wasn't utilized properly you could
easily fit a five the quarter inch drive
base somewhere in here without
compromising on any of the hardware
compatibility and so what are your
thoughts on the DG 87 EVGA a second case
have you're happy with it let us know in
the comments down below I hope you guys
enjoy this one then we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
