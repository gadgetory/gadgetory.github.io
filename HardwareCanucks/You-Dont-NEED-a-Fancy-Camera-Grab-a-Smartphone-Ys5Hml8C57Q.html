order to entice your creativity for
video or photography all you need is the
realization that working with what
you've got
well actually get you to the result
better in terms of being satisfied with
your photography or anything capture and
so today's video is about smartphone
photography versus a real camera
photography and why I would say to just
avoid you know the fancy stuff and just
keep shooting with your smartphone now
with my most recent trip to Brazil all
the pictures you're about to see were
captured with the 1+5 with some creative
editing too but still I was blown away
at what this phone was able to capture
and it's not about the 1 plus 5 camera
it's about any camera that is on your
smartphone so start shooting and don't
be thinking about having this around
your neck just don't be missing out of
hardware when you have fantastic tools
at your disposal already
all right so I hope you enjoyed those
pictures but now it's time to see if you
can tell the difference between me 1 + 5
t portrait note vs. something that is
equivalent in focal length and aperture
on the photography side of things so let
me show you some pictures right after
this so it was kind of a love at first
sight you know there's really nothing
like this exterior I love the metallic
color the tinted glass panel the RGB
fans at the front it's basically a
see-through case and who doesn't love
that your graphics card can go vertical
the top is radiator friendly and the
right side is so unique when exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
aged 500 P white Coolermaster check it
out in description below alright so
let's quickly talk about the gear for
the smartphone I'm using the 1 plus 5t
sandstone white edition because it has
this new coating that this far less
slippery versus the aluminum bodies on
early models making it easier to handle
while I'm taking pictures without
needing incase but it's not as textured
as the actual stands don't case and by
the way who doesn't love an accent I
absolutely love this red alert slider
that I'm sure many will appreciate now
for the camera hardware like most
smartphones today we have a dual shooter
so a 16 megapixel and 20 megapixel
sensor and they work together to create
the depth mapping and that whole blur
effect and it's a 27 millimeter lens
with an F 1.7 aperture while for the
fancy camera I decided to go with a few
G X T 20 because it's super compact it's
got a fantastic sensor interchangeable
lenses and the image quality and the
color out it's Fuji is fantastic and for
the lens I have the 23 millimeter F 2.0
lens which is a 35 mm water equivalent
in full-frame and so the Fuji is
slightly more zoomed in versus the
smartphone but I accommodate by stepping
back a little bit to acquire an almost
identical composition so now let's go
outside and take some shots
now obviously portability is kind of
important so with the fancy
you have to keep around your neck you
cannot stuff it in your pants pocket and
you just have to be cautious when using
this thing on the street when this is a
lot more discreet you put it in your
pants pocket forget about it take it out
when you take a shot now the beauty of
smartphone photography is the whole
point and truth approach everything is
simplified your exposure is automatic
tap to focus and all the pictures are
there for you to share immediately so
let's put the fancy camera on automatic
so all the settings are handled by the
camera and they're taken out from the
users experience to see what the JPEG
versus smartphone quality looks like so
let's start with a shot of the sky so
both of them acquire proper exposure but
the Fuji has different character in
their colour rendition while the
smartphone has those nice vibrant blues
of the sky both of them are good very
ready for social media sharing for this
next shot I use the portrait mode on the
5 T and it does a really good job of
making sure that I'm cut out and that
subject isolation and blurring out the
background properly
however the dynamic range is better on
the Fuji and the fine detail is a lot
better on the larger sensor so that is
kind of the the advantage if you want to
really zoom in or like punching
digitally to expand your footage and
maneuver your composition whereas with
the 5 T it really falls apart in the
fine details when you try to get really
close to the image for this next shot
I'm still using the portrait mode on the
5 T and it does a really good job again
and isolating that camera from the
background with little hiccups here and
there so you can you can definitely see
those artifacting around the edges but
if you're sharing this on social media
most likely people are gonna be zooming
in and so you can't really tell the
difference between the two shots aside
from better dynamic range and detail of
the few G for this next shot on my feet
the color and vibrancy is a bit higher
on the 5 T and it's because I'm using
the classic chrome color preset on the
few G because I think it has a lot more
character but as you can see here with
this like boring composition the 5 T
wins for this next shot of the tree bark
the detail is amazing in both but you
can tell which one is the fancy camera
because of that additional depth of
field and character versus the you know
the 5 T just feels like a standard
point-and-shoot although I will say that
the depth of field it creates behind the
tree is very nice and natural this is
not in the portrait mode
and so this is standard lens and because
I'm close to the subject it allows me to
isolate it from the background for this
next shot of the breakfast plate you can
see the Fuji has a lot more color
definition and contrast within its shot
versus the 5 T looks a bit you know kind
of washed out but it's an easy fix with
a little contrast curve now the one
thing that really impressed me was how
is similar the auto white balance was on
both cameras sure we had more contrast
and more detail in a few G but the 5 T
performed very well in its own right in
both portrait mode and standard detail
stuff now obviously the advantage with
the larger sensor is being able to
create that depth of field and subject
isolation especially with the fast lines
like an f2 however
camera is becoming so good in developing
their own portrait mode and using
software to determine what's in focus
and what's in the background
however the fancy camera wins in dynamic
range preserving a lot more information
in those bright areas but of course this
is a tough shot for the smartphone
sensor because I'm in the shade and the
background is super bright so it's
trying to compensate to make sure that
the whole scene is balanced again here
we get more dynamic range and detail
from the fancy camera but it is backlit
with the harsh sunlight and the 5 T does
an okay job with those blur edges while
preserving excellent color for the skin
and the environment now for this next
shot I'm super impressed by the edge
detection on the smartphone around the
furry hood and which is much more
accurate than before and comparing the
side-by-side made me realize just how
natural this artificial blur is on a
smartphone with an appropriate
out-of-focus gradient so it doesn't
simply cut out the subject and blur
everything behind it but we have a more
realistic blurriness with the distance
and I think one of the driving forces
behind people wanting a fancy camera is
because of that optical depth of field
which is created through the glass and
not through AI but portrait mode is
becoming so good that I love shooting
people with it but even shooting is
still subject it turns out to be just as
good so for example in this shot the
photos almost look identical and the 5 T
actually renders those light reflections
beautifully to really sell the effect
you probably cannot tell which is which
if I posted them without telling you but
you have to be careful with reflections
since they're not recognized by the
distance and you can tell this is a
portrait mode photo from the smartphone
but shooting through glass delivers
awesome results because reflections get
blurred out and help to hide any edge
imperfections in portrait mode also
works really well for close-ups actually
better than my fancy camera and
compatible end results in the controlled
environment in terms of color and
exposure when that occasional hiccup
around more complicated areas now the
floor on this one is very similar
between the two but you can tell which
one is the smartphone because of the
blow now at highlights so that seems to
be the major disadvantage the dynamic
range needs to improve to really sell
the effect and the pixel to camera right
now has done this right but with more
aggressive edge detection which is less
natural but we get that beautiful
dynamic range and here are some more
examples of the 5 T in portrait mode I
think this is an outstanding direction
to encourage smartphone photography you
don't need a fancy camera to have a good
time now what about the convenience of
capture - sharing with the smartphone is
instantaneous all your images are here
and all your social platforms are on
there - you want to apply some Instagram
filter be my guest but with the camera
you have to offload the images from the
SD card maybe process them in some way
choose your best one and only then
upload it however majority of cameras
now also have Wi-Fi capability allowing
you to connect the smartphone to the
camera and then instantaneously get all
your photos directly on your smartphone
which makes the whole process from the
fancy camera of capturing and sharing a
lot easier now what if you want to
tinker with all your settings manually
so majority of smartphones have that as
pro mode and of course it's a bit easier
to handle on the fancy camera because
you don't have to it's not software
based it's all just like little dials
and buttons on the body itself and if
you want to take your photography to the
next level you can always edit your
photos I use Snapseed it's free and it's
powerful I generally just do brighten it
up bring out some color with the
vibrancy and contrast sliders I warm it
up so it's a three easy step to really
give your photos a little extra pop and
for people who want to take their fancy
camera photography to the next level
always shooting raw obviously allows you
to capture so much more information and
then edit that in post-production so for
example in these shots I really
overexposed
I seen just to see how much I can push
the raw files and the amount of detail I
was able to recover is just incredible
so that gives you a little indication on
how raw workflow is so much more
powerful but that workflow in Photoshop
or Lightroom or any other software is
intensive on your on your computer and
it's also time consuming
here's a fun fact a single photo out of
this is 50 megabytes in RAW so imagine I
take 20 pictures that's one gigabyte of
storage on my computer and so you can
either shoot in like a smart way where
you delete things you're not going to be
using and so for like everyday life
you're using your smart phone to capture
your stuff and then when you want to
capture like wallpaper printing material
then the fancy camera it might come out
now if you are going the fancy camera
around I will give you one advice and
that is to buy one lens that means you
learn the body you learn the
characteristics of your lens and how far
you have to be away from your subject
and Composition details and all that
stuff that way you can have a good time
and move your feet in order to like
capture your shot kind of like you do
with a smartphone because most of them
have a single camera only then you
coarser avoid pro gaming headset is
comfortable stylish in different colors
delivers fantastic wireless performance
even for competitive gaming with an
all-new microphone for clear
communications check out the void Pro
Wireless or wired in the description
below alright so I would love to see
your favorite smartphone captures share
them on Twitter and Henry Canucks I'm
Dimitri you don't need a fancy camera
take good pictures and enjoy doing so
hopefully this has been the message
across this video thanks so much for
watching we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
