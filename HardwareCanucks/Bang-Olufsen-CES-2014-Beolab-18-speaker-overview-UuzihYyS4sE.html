brought to you by and cix technology
connected alright guys so now I'm here
with John the president of North America
from banging olsen and they're talking
to us about about this very unique and
very popular speaker so this is the bio
lab 18 as you can see it has a very it's
got a vertical design so I guess to be
placed within you know mainly beside TVs
and things so this is a beautiful piece
of manufactured art you can call it art
right so what is why do people divert it
towards this as you said this is one of
the most popular speakers here oh yeah
so so Philip 8-thousand was its
predecessor yeah and it has really
become an iconic baingan Olson loud
speaker yeah actually over 21 years we
have sold almost 650,000 Wow so
obviously over that period of time we
need to continues we upgrade the product
so to speak and this upgrade that we've
done here we were so careful not to you
could say Runa this iconic product so we
really spend a lot of time making sure
not only the technology that we added to
it but also the aesthetics that we
update it would be perfect so some of
the things that we've done to it we've
made it wireless and so we are one of
the first companies in the world to
introduce a Wi-Fi enabled our speaker
which basically is a new wireless
technology as we're the first two
running that out mmm thank you very much
and actually what it what it is in
layman's terms it's basically a new
paint that is in the same frequency
range as aviation and so and it goes
back and forth in terms of creating that
the best and fastest highway to beyond
so to speak right so it means that it is
the pain that is separate from all the
other brands yes since that we have yes
so you can actually play uncompressed 24
and make a bit content on it so better
than CD quality or a wirelessly which is
very unique wise so that's one of the
things that we added to it we changed
the front of it and add it there wood so
this beautiful marriage between aluminum
and wood is very organic
material we also made it high-polished
which basically means that it picks up
the the colors of the background and so
forth it really fits into any decor then
we added the lens technology which we
use in our newer family of loudspeakers
it's also in all the Audis and EMW and
so forth so what is really unique about
it is it plays up into an ellipse form
and fans it out in 180 degrees so really
where before you allow speakers would
have a a beam of you could say 30 degree
angle and then you put your your couch
in the middle right now there's no sweet
spot no sorry there's there is a much
wider sweet spot so basically no cheap
seats in the house anymore
you can place the speaker anywhere you
want and get fantastic stereo image yeah
and now also with it being Wireless all
you need is power so you don't need to
run any other wire so you have
incredible amount of flexibility so what
happened was we launched it in in
December arrived in the stores in
December and we now are up to almost
eight weeks wait time to get it
so really it's really become a popular
seller for social yeah seems like it is
becoming more demand you have to wait
for such a beautiful art to finally get
to you but I do appreciate the
craftsmanship that goes into creating
such amazing time looking speaker not
only amazing looking speaker about Ben
Olsen obviously known for their audience
so we did listen to a demo and they
sound incredible guys what's the price
point and I guess sure that comes in a
couple of different versions so you can
actually match your the front grille to
your decor so it comes in this oak which
is the higher-end version of it and then
you have a black and a white composite
material and the difference is about
eight hundred dollars in price and
depending on what front will you go with
and so they started sixty three hundred
dollars and go up two and seventy
and so this wireless technology I'm glad
that we're finally getting something
some such premium speakers that where
you only need to do that have the power
cable and you can still enjoy your audio
wirelessly so guys this has been our
bang and Olson coverage here at CES 2014
