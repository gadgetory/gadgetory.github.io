that with the magic of choice
all right so over the past year or so my
keyboard collection has grown a little
bit and just as with gaming mice I keep
everything that I like not just in
storage but actually use them in
rotation now I realized my privilege of
like you know going through so many
gaming peripherals but doing videos on
those of course gives me access to
everything like that and so today I want
to share my three favorite tkl keyboards
that you could potentially use in your
gaming space office space or just for
casual use and so if you're urging for a
tkl upgrade for your keyboard make sure
check out description everything is
listed there welcome the entire H series
from NZXT one of the most elegant case
lineups with the premium construction
you'll appreciate and the little details
like purple USB ports perforate shroud
floor and the iconic cable cover we've
got an ITX option the H 200 your
standard ATX mid tower at age 500 and
the big guns the H 700 all available
with a smart device for RGB illumination
and fan control or the standard
variations with a smart interior to
complement an easy assembly the H series
has Hardware connects approved and is
something for everyone check it out
below so here the are my three favorite
tkl keyboards the G Pro from Logitech
it's by far my most used one here it's
been on my desk since launch the master
up control is one of the more premium
and customizable boards that I have with
a fantastic color scheme and a gorgeous
illumination and the most recent edition
is the Tesoro gram spectrum TTL for its
low profile nature and a little
variation of the mechanical switches
form factor wise they all share the same
10 Keeler's design without the number
pad on the side but they all have their
unique characteristics so for example
the gram spectrum TTL has that low
profile frame and the key caps the
angular front section helps to further
minimize the footprint while the keys on
the G Pro are slightly submerged into
the frame with the larger forehead above
the top row and a totally floating key
cap design on the control keyboard with
an elegant symmetrical slab of aluminum
for the mainframe all feature a
removable cable centered on the G Pro
right side on the gram tkl and dual
sided type-c port on the control
keyboard for extra routing flexibility
and that a new sport can be used for
additional type-c accessories which is
pretty cool they all have some four
of RGB elimination that is handled quite
differently for example a G Pro keyboard
has the large Tech's own romaji switches
with a centered led to illuminate the
transparent section of the keys evenly
without any spill below the keys and I
love this look you can do all kind of
effects and perky color customization to
the Graham spectrum tkl uses two source
agile switches with the transparent base
and therefore gives that cool under glow
effect for the entire keyboard and has
an even better light spill on the white
frame we have multiple color effects and
perky color customization as well the
control keyboard can be picked up with
multiple mechanical switches so I have
the halo clear switches and because
they're exposed at the bottom that the
illumination effect is pretty strong
plus we get an additional LED strip
around the bottom of the frame to cast
some more color on the surface it is
definitely one of the prettiest
keyboards I have in my collection
especially with that two-tone gray color
scheme on the keycap layout but I will
say that the uniformity could be
slightly better as individual LEDs on a
light bar are clearly visible and as
usual multiple color effects have built
in with perky color selection available
and so all three keywords are slightly
different and will attract a particular
type of user so for example the control
keyboard from mass drop it's more
targeted for enthusiasts given this
price point and also not full time
availability but we have full
customization with qmk firmware where
you can assign all types of commands and
create layers of key customization and
even these switches are hot swappable -
for those wanting to experiment to
create your like perfect feeling
keyboard and assign multiple switches
throughout the entire board without
soldering anything which is pretty
awesome the key caps are also
high-quality double shot BBT with an
interesting grainy texture and also the
cleanest font especially compared to the
other two keyboards now my gaming
keyboard choice of course has to be the
g pro from large tag it's a tough little
board that has seen a lot of action and
my primary purpose of using this for
games are the roamer g switches and
while I really like the insane variety
of em extra options the Roma G is just
such an awesome combination of a quiet
switch with a slight tactile point that
I'm extremely comfortable with they are
kind of similar to MX browns but I still
prefer the romaji and lastly if I want
to switch things up a bit for a more
minimalist look I
gaud√≠ Tesoro gram spectrum tkl and I
kind of wish I had the white edition of
this keyboard that can blend a bit more
with MySpace but the low profile nature
is pretty unique plus the linear red
agile switches feel smooth and awesome
for typing as the actuation point is
slightly shorter at 1.5 millimeters and
they're also pretty light at 45 grams
and they're also pretty quiet too so
there you have it my three favorite tkl
keyboards in a nutshell if you're
thinking of picking one up everything
will be listed in description below and
I realized my privilege of having these
three models on hand and picking and
choosing whichever I feel like of using
in that particular day if I had to
choose one I would probably stick with
the G Pro by Logitech it really comes
down to three factors the romaji
switches are awesome they're simple
minimalist design plus pretty decent RGB
illumination that isn't too out there
but still allows for a little bit of fun
I will never try to like color match my
peripherals now I've had this keyboard
for almost two years and I read online
based on long-term customer views of two
years plus that some keys stop working
and the main comment for many users is
the LED burning out on certain keys not
displaying any more color so giving you
half two years warranty that's
unfortunate but I haven't had any issues
since that the soraa would be my second
choice simply because the price is good
I love the low profile design I don't
really care about the key switches you
know they've had bad reputation in the
past but since the agile switches I
think are pretty decent feels very nice
and I switch mallets as well when they
need to do some typing I love typing on
the agile red switches and then the
control keyboard that's a particular one
that's so premium and I love the the
switches I love everything about it
delighting in the build quality the the
heaviness of the switch the
customization everything about it but
it's not easy to get a hold of because
it's on mass drops which are not always
present and so that would be my third
choice but still it's a really awesome
free
keyboard for enthusiasts so if you have
to choose between the three which one
would you pick and if you have any
alternative suggestions for a tkl design
let me know I would love to check it out
