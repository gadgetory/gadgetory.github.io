market has proved extremely successful
with the introduction let's meet our
line the graphite series cases combining
all the essential and useful features
into the graphite series the 600 T is
truly one fully loaded enthusiast
chassis the case is to be priced
slightly higher than the original 600 T
and you are to expect to pay a premium
for a new side panel and as you can see
a new paint job on the exterior and here
it is the graphite 600 T special edition
white made from steel and ABS plastic
this case feels solid and is definitely
constructed to coarser standards
starting from the top we have four USB
ports your audio a fan controller knob
which can house up to four fans USB 3.0
and firewire and finally your power and
reset buttons notices the power button
is also eliminated and nice white glow
at the front we have four or five in the
quarter inch drive base which are meshed
and all include the convenient dust
filters courser also includes a
removable dust filter at the front for
convenience for cleaning and below that
is a 200 millimeter white LED intake fan
taking a look at the top we have a
removable top cover under which courser
includes another two 100 millimeter fan
this is also where a security lock is
position to prevent the side panel from
being open this is particularly useful
for land parties and if you want the
case to be locked to protect the
hardware inside you're also able to
mount to 120 millimeter fans at the top
and Corsair provides 8 rubber grommets
for the mounting holes to prevent noise
from vibration there also cutouts for
the fan cables to be placed inside the
case and the top panel fits in just fine
at the back we have an exhaust fan io
area water cooling holes 8 PCI expansion
slots and a bottom mounted power supply
with a conveniently removable dust
filter one of the best features of the
graphite 600 T is the complete Tula's
design inside and out starting with a
side panel which removes with ease
the special edition white can't swap
either transparent acrylic or a meshed
insert for the side panel the swap
requires you to remove several screws
and the meshed insert can house up to
four 120 millimeter fans so now let's
take a look inside here again we see
tools operation with installing your 3.5
inch drives and each insert has mounting
holes for 2.5 inch drives both hard
drive cages can be removed to allow for
better air flow and of course leave more
room for longer video cards either of
the hard drive cages can be mounted at
the bottom of the case if you need to
install additional drives the optical
drives just snap in place without
needing to use any screws removing the
optical drive is simple just with the
push of a knob you're also able to
secure your power supply to the bottom
of the case with an adjustment for
different lengths the cable management
options for this case are simply
brilliant of course their style of using
rubber grommets to hide the cables
behind the motherboard tray will make it
a joy to assemble the old black interior
will come a flash any cables and make
your build looking clean behind the
motherboard tray there are plenty of
cables that must be connected for the
front panel at the top and plenty of
room to hide all your additional cables
now onto the assembly when the first
problems we encountered was the
clearance between the CPU heatsink and
the top 200 millimeter fan we simply
swapped it for two 120 millimeter fans
to allow the heatsink to stay clear the
interior layout allows for extremely
easy cable management with the rubber
grommets helping on the way this way
your bill looks clean and no clutter
will interfere with the airflow and to
no surprise cables at the back are
hidden behind the motherboard tray with
plenty of room for more even if you
install an extreme machine inside the
chassis and you can see the side panel
just pops back in without any
interference with the cables the 600 T
special edition white packs in a lot of
features for an enthusiast builder due
to excellent courser standard and build
quality physical appearance and the
price you now have an option to
customize the side panel to your needs
with either a clear side window or extra
cooling with the mesh insert the tools
design makes installation hassle-free in
all aspects of the build and the roomy
interior allows for long graphics cards
to be installed even with the hard drive
cages in place and the two massive - 100
millimeter fans provide enough cooling
for pretty much any configuration the
best part of the 600 T are the cable
management capabilities and internal
water cooling setup and for the price of
around 180 dollars you really get what
you pay for the graphite 600 T special
edition white truly deserves the
hardware connects damn good word for its
all-in-one solution for any enthusiast
builder and that is it for this episode
