great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Huracan ox and EVGA is entrance into the
peripherals market began with the x10
laser gaming mouse this was a good
learning ground for EVGA but they are
added again with the release of the x3
and the x5 gaming mice with aggressive
pricing and also sensor variants to fit
your preference today were taking a look
at the optical version of the x5 this is
actually 10 dollars cheaper than the
laser alternative and I would recommend
the optical infrared option when
available there's just something about
its tracking it feels like true
one-to-one in sync tracking on screen
and to your hand movement EVGA is
sticking with the symmetry being
inclusive for left-hand users and that's
awesome the top coating is not entirely
white it's got some sparkly grain in
there for this sports car finish it
looks fantastic in my opinion and the
very fine finish is pleasant to the
touch
almost like resting of fingers on the
touchscreen while these signs are not
totally rubberized but there is some
texture that I find satisfactory
although extra grippy surface would have
suited better the mouse is very low
profile the top curvature does not fully
extend to support the palm and this
would mainly be a claw grip Mouse or
some hybrid combination for example
here's how I have to hold the mouse
resting my wrists on the mouse mat and
clawing the fingers around despite the
symmetrical design though I found my
thumb to be perfectly in place along
with the ring and pinky fingers content
as well the curve on the right side
along is just right with the ring finger
and it's clear that EVGA is not messing
around one thing I want to point out is
the off-center braided cable it is now
on the left side it doesn't really make
any difference from mouse handling but
it's still worth mentioning they have
ditched the weight system from the x10
for these new mice and at only 85 grams
the x5 is extremely light I personally
prefer something heavier for higher dpi
levels but fine-tuning the DPI to 800
and our solid with target tracking and
follow-up aiming on primary left and
right click register just
with quick bounce the x5 is equipped
with Omron switches rated at 20 million
clicks but I find the actuation distance
to be less tactile than on my other
gaming mice you can still deliver an
insane clicks per second given the
fairly light nature of each click but I
wish the distance travelled was slightly
higher the scroll wheel is absolutely in
line with what we were hoping for hard
and distinct scroll steps fast and light
enough middle-click to be used in game
without activating any scroll steps plus
the rubber bits to ensure accurate
scrolling every time behind it as a dpi
shift button with three red LEDs to show
the four levels of sensitivity and I
suggest you set your most-used dpi on
every other level with higher dpi in
between to avoid needing to cycle
through to your first dpi the browser
buttons on each side have plenty of
travel distance with great feeling
registration and most importantly
they're not intrusive on the opposite
side which was the case with the x10 for
example I've never accidentally pressed
on the buttons on the right because they
are out of the way the x5 travels smooth
no problems with the feet either and at
the bottom you'll also find a profile
switch button thanks to the onboard
memory you can have five profiles saved
on the mouse so I already mentioned the
sports car coating on the white plate
but EVGA has added extra lighting bling
on each side the rear and the
illuminated logo for extra character the
rear light in particular gives off that
surface illumination and you have seven
color profiles that you can choose from
and while I think that's enough many
people won't like the fact that you
don't get that full color spectrum to
choose from so the most important thing
about the x5 it's using the picsArt 39
88 which is regarded as one of the best
optical sensors on the market and also
found on Razer DeathAdder and asus
Gladius this is very good news for the
x5 to be competing among the ranks of
those two mice just mentioned just keep
in mind the white and glass surfaces are
not compatible but tracking on my
aluminum mat was extremely accurate
showed no signs of artifacts and just
for $50 I am certain this is going
to be a very popular choice for many
gamers quickly let's talk about the
software allow how you can select left
or right hand use right there in front
of you each of the eight buttons can be
set to function differently
I found the sensor on/off feature
hilarious if you want to prank your
roommates and you also have the profiles
like the right at the bottom dpi
settings are adjustable for axis as well
plastic bowling rate I found it odd that
mouse acceleration was on by default
make sure you disable it and here is
very important surface calibration tool
make sure you run that and set your
desired lift height under led settings
nothing out of the ordinary there's a
breathing effect you can do some
brightness control and color selector
and finally you can record some macros
and manage your profiles in here too all
right so now onto some gaming
performance I fired up csgo because you
can't really test out the mouse unless
you play some counter strike and
tracking was outstanding after a few
rounds I was very comfortable with
knowing exactly where my cursor should
go and it was a time to switch it up a
bit by outfit for hardcore mode will
test your aiming skills and reaction
time where each bullet counts and once
again I was able to deliver a precise
aim on target quickly tap fire and the
learning curve on the x5 has been very
short and I really can't say anything
negative on the performance side but
overall EVGA has done an outstanding job
with the x5 everything from the shape to
the materials to all the switches the
lighting is well done but most
importantly sensor selection is right on
point with the picsArt 39 88 and this
for 50 bucks is totally worth
consideration this is a damn good and a
damn good value product so guys thank
you so much for watching our review on
the x5 make sure to subscribe for more
