hurricane axe and the original HyperX
cloud from Kingston really set the
benchmark for a while sounding and a
well-priced gaming headset let's see if
the addition of the HyperX cloud
revolver is a good one at $120 or it
will remain any cloud heaven Toshiba now
offering OCC products that are awesome
and affordable like the RD 400 TR 150
and vt1 80 that are backed by advanced
warranty program now stronger than ever
under Toshiba so the revolver looks like
a gaming headset more so than the
earlier models there's more plastic on
the ear cups the microphone is larger
looks like a boom mic by the headband
and the padding on the ear cups look
very familiar this self adjusting
headband is a safe choice with the new
metal frame that is well designed for
comfort with perfect clamping force plus
it's thin enough to not add much weight
but the support beam inside the padding
itself is plastic it doesn't really feel
like it would take a fall I would take
care of this headset now the good thing
is it does not crack it's pretty
flexible but the metal frame absorbs any
sound that touches it which can be
easily heard inside the ear cuffs it's
not really an issue if you're still but
quite annoying if you're putting the
headset on handling the microphone or
even moving your head so unfortunately
I've never been this displeased with an
otherwise comfortable frame that has
such an annoying element the large ear
cups help to cover the entire ear and
you'll need to vent your ears
occasionally given the closed nature now
what's really cool are the angled
drivers inside that help to channel the
audio something thats Anheuser has been
doing for ages unfortunately no velour
pads included like we saw on their
previous cloud headsets for accessories
we only have a two meter splitter cable
with the volume control and a mic mute
little dongle and has also a shirt clip
it's quite far from the main headset so
I'm not a fan of this implementation the
braided cable is quite thick which is
awesome so the kinks don't form as
easily as on thin braided cables but any
contact with the cable can be heard
inside the ear cup
is inevitable when you move your head
the microphone is so important on a
gaming headset otherwise we'll be all be
playing with our favorite pair of
headphones and an external microphone
the revolver delivers in this regard
it's very clean it's not too nasally it
picks up quite nice voice it's a little
bit boomy it does compress the
background just a little bit but still
picking up quite a lot of things so
especially if you'd be typing on the
keyboard it will be picked up it will be
a little bit muted but overall I think
it's one of the better microphones in
this price range especially when you
compare it to something more expensive
so what you're hearing now is the
sanitizer game one it's over $200 for
this headset but microphone quality
compared to the revolver is almost
identical and now let's test it to be
mod mic 4.0 and so this is the mod
microphone point now it's a little bit
more open compared to the revolver but
still very impressed by the vocal
quality of the revolver microphone
especially compared to something more
expensive or to this external solution
now my preferred sound signature for
games includes a wide soundstage so that
I feel like I'm in a you know a large
audio space a brighter extension because
I love my treble and I want to hear the
little details I don't want to miss the
little details like very important
footsteps somebody going touching
against the wall and right now the sound
engines are picking up on that and
giving us all the little cues for
directional assistance and I also love a
flat based response because most of the
time the bass is muddy and so it kind of
ruins the balance and fortunately the
revolver in my book has a really good
sound signature for a gaming headset so
it does have a brighter extension so
details in the audio are not flat and
don't get lost with a lot of things
going on but instead our you know we're
very well separated the bass is a little
bit too booming which I don't mind which
still gives you that sense of power when
things need to be felt you know when
you're firing a 50 caliber machine gun
in squad which has one of the best
weapon sounds ever
and then when smashing through a wall
with a hammer in Rainbow six siege while
a breach chart goes off next to you it
feels amazing
or just simply blowing up in Dallas for
that also feels very well nothing is
falling apart with the revolver and so
the sound signature is fun exactly how a
gaming headset should sound in my
opinion the bass can be corrected for
the extra boo - extension the headset
does leak a little bit audio if you're
blasting music by the isolate very well
one of the surprising elements for a
closed back design is it's a semi-open
soundstage it's not too wide but you
know it's fine you can definitely hear
how far these are coming from and the
stereo imaging with the revolver is
really good gives you directional cues
and what's happening around you I've
actually been accused of wall hacking
several times while wearing the headset
since I was listening to my environment
and anticipating where the enemy would
come from and so the revolver place nice
for competitive - really the biggest
weakness here lies in the frame and just
how much noise it absorbs plus the
nature of the self adjusting headband
maybe a little bit too loose for a snug
fit but it's definitely worth of the
headset category thanks to a much
improved microphone over the original
clouds and also nicely tuned drivers for
gaming but is it worth the premium price
I would say no the only advantage here
would be the better microphone and a
slightly larger frame in general to
accommodate for bigger heads better but
I feel the HyperX clouds and the clouds
to offer better value simply because of
the additional accessories and the frame
on this headset is just so annoying and
how much sound it translates into the
ear cups not just from the frame itself
but also from the cable something that
wasn't totally of an issue on the
original headset so my recommendation
still lies with the original HyperX
clouds I'm doing three with higher
conducts I hope you guys enjoyed this
review and we'll see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
