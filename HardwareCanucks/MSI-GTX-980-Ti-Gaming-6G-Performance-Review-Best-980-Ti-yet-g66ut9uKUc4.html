great technology selection and service
hey guys Eber here with hurricane axe
and welcome back to another video review
in front of the lens today is yet
another 980ti
and videos board partners are really
saturating our options for the better
with various color designs and clock
speeds the msi gtx 980ti gaming 6g is
one beautiful card incorporating a red
and black color scheme with interesting
elements on the shroud for the car to
stand out from competing t is priced at
680 US dollars this gaming 6g is one of
the best gaming cards you can buy right
now with a fairly higher factory
overclock of 1178 megahertz for the base
and 1279 megahertz for the boost clock
with memory speed of 7000 100 megahertz
as the name implies this is a six
gigabyte card just like the reference
with the same IO that includes triple
DisplayPort single HDMI and DVI output
MSI's outstanding Twin Frozr 5 heatsink
is more than capable of cooling the GPU
to satisfying levels without going
oversized on that heatsink the dual 100
millimeter Torx fans power off when the
GPU is idle creating a completely silent
card plus notice the unique shape of the
blades that maximize static pressure and
improves airflow through the heatsink
underneath or a new pipe layout it helps
to maximize heat dissipation utilizing
four eight millimeter heat pipes this is
one of the quietest cards in our stack
and not far from the EVGA ACX 2.0 but
here the advantage are those powered off
fans during light load and the cooler
does an outstanding job keeping the GPU
at 69 degrees during load the card
measures at 11 inches in length this is
a dual slot card but with cooler
extending a tiny bit wider past the two
slots the backplate is gorgeous this is
an expectation for the high-end market
although it is for aesthetics only as it
does not make contact with the PCB to
power this beast you will need to duel a
pin connectors and its power envelope is
375 Watts peak system what consumption
with the gaming 6g is a bit higher than
the rest but it is right in line with
our expectations based on the clock
speeds so without any further ado let's
jump into the benchmarks and see how
this gaming 6g handles
self across-the-board starting with
1440p benchmarks and the results are
nothing short of amazing the msi
offering fits right in between the crazy
and petition from ZOTAC and the super
clock plus a vga card jumping into 4k
and the story doesn't change at all it
maintains that position among the top
three and if you're considering a 90 vti
then the gaming 6g should definitely be
in your radar we all clocked our cart to
1506 megahertz which is quite a bit high
for 980ti usually they cap out of 14 50
megahertz but look at all these
additional frames we get this is
currently the fastest GPU in our stack
and with the graphs out of the way we
are genuinely impressed at what msi is
offering here without a premium price
over competing TI's if you want the best
performance the msi gaming since one
damn good choice well that concludes our
review thank you so much for watching
