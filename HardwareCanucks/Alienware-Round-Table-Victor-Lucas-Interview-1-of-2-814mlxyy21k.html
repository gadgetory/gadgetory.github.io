and I'm attending a very interesting
event where we have Victor Lucas
alienware and a whole bunch of gaming
folks here that will be in engaging in a
roundtable discussion for sort of the
future of PC gaming interested to hear
what Victor Lucas has to say so the
pioneer in this field of Technology and
video gaming as well and also see
someone alien where's new gaming
machines that they were announced at e3
now finally making their way into Canada
so really excited to see exactly what we
are to expect with their machines and
also to see where the gaming industry is
heading in the future so let's go and
check it out
so hey guys i'm here with victor Lucas
the guy from electric playground and an
excellent show for reviews on the run
which are entertaining high energy and
very informative as well thank you we
were here at the roundtable discussion
talking about the future of PC gaming
yes so you think pc gaming has reached a
peak no not at all no no I think there's
been a bit of a revolution and
acceptance for PC gaming over the last
few years and I think you know we
identified that steam and to some extent
origin we're part of that equation I
think part of the equation is also being
able to plug your computer's so easily
into your television sets and plug in an
hdmi cable and everything's up and
running and running beautifully I think
day and day delivery of a lot of these
console games on PC has really helped
with that as well I think what's
happened is that pc gaming has been
embracing a broader crowd and getting a
broader crowd to get into games and i
think that the part of the you know part
of what happened is that people bought
ps3 and xbox 360's and kind of reached
the end of the life cycle and said I
want better looking stuff than this and
and the buzz took a little long before
the ps4 and xbox one were was really
percolating so I think a lot of people
kind of shifted their their sort of
attention over to pcs there's just so
many solutions now that are much more
affordable and much more I don't know
open-ended they give you a lot more
different kinds of ways in the play
games right now and and I think a large
factor in pc gaming success right now is
also these steam sales and the lower
price point that you get right out of
the gate with a lot of the software
right now I mean you
pick up a game like batman arkham
origins for ten or twenty dollars less
on the pc as a download than you do when
you go to the store to buy it for your
ps3 or xbox 360 and you get a better
looking game you know i think people are
gluing into that right yeah for sure
what do you think is the biggest
challenge right now for PC gaming
industry moving forward I think it's
it's windows i think that people have a
real problem with the finicky nature of
windows as an operating system and I you
know windows is also trying to do a
great many things to for a huge audience
and I think that's a challenge if you
just want to jump in and play games you
know there's security issues there's
confliction issues there's you know some
cards aren't talking to some cards it
depends on rival issues yeah driver
issues and you know some peripherals
don't work some of your legacy stuff
doesn't work if PC gaming is going to
become wider and more accepted for you
know gamers that are even becoming more
sort of invested in mobile gaming or
tablet gaming right now it just needs to
be seamless you need to forget about the
technology there's a lot more elegance
with everything that that's available to
people right now it needs to be even
more so if it's going to be massive
adoption out there you know steam is
kind of throwing down the gauntlet by
having their steam OS on the back of
Linux yeah it wouldn't surprise me to
see alienware come up with the alienware
OS that sort of threads through steam
but I think that there should be just no
barrier to entry from you sitting you
know at your desk or on your couch and
jumping into your game so you think
that's where as steam OS is heading into
I think that's where games are heading
right you know and i think pc games will
adopt some of those things i think the
console games are going to adopt some of
those things people need to plug
something in turn it on and you're going
you know and the pc needs to be like
that too i think what's true today and
maybe won't be true in 10 years from now
is they save your money on buying
software for just one platform and just
pledging allegiance to one thing and
spend a little bit more money to give
you the widest access to the content
that you want you know Sony is investing
in a ton of incredible first-party
titles again and again it again same
with xbox you know same with Nintendo
you know you don't need to just be one
kind of game consumer out there you know
and I I've always kind of lived by that
philosophy I'm hoping for a day where
there's a little more unity and there's
a little bit more collaboration on
getting access to this stuff I think the
idea that we have to join these clubs in
order to have access to some of this
content is is it hurts the industry I
mean it may give the business a little
short term gain in you know you get you
do well one quarter but the next next
quarter you get hammered because
somebody else came out with an exclusive
that you can't play here right I think
in the long run that is a detrimental
thing I don't think we think about books
in that way I don't think we think about
music in that way i'll pick a bug you
know movies in that way but with video
games it's like you have to you have to
root for a team and join a team and you
get a tattoo of a game brand on your arm
and i think that's a little bit silly
because we all just want to be
entertained by awesome games no matter
where they are do you have a favorite
game ah well mice my favorite series now
my favorite game series of the courage
is the Arkham series based on origins
not just went over the top for me it's
an amazing game again and I'm a huge bat
nerd about you my current favorite game
would be Dishonored yeah that's an
amazing game it's so much our game of
that year last year yeah yeah yeah red
dead affected me I finished the game and
I was I was gutted by the game I love
that game you know I loved I didn't know
that I wanted to be a cowboy as much as
I did until I played that game right you
know and it was a profound moving
literate beautiful piece of art you know
it was just an incredible game and it
haunts me I love that game what do you
think of the Nvidia shield I think it's
the tip to the future I think that
portable handhelds state of the art is
coming because it seems like it's the
the concept of what you're talking about
getting something into TV or you know
sitting on the couch having that
wireless streaming capability but yeah
it is i mean it is like the technology
is invisible in a way but except the
shield looks like crap you know it yes
in that case it looks like a big sort of
like like it was made out of wood or
something you know it just doesn't feel
sleek and elegant it doesn't feel like
something Sam Fisher would pack around
with them you know like and that's
that's kind of what we need out of this
stuff he almost seems like bendable
foldable you know you need to be just
making gestures and suddenly it's on a
giant screen like that's where we need
to go with games at me forget the
technology but if we have technology
make it look cool look sony's ps4
controllers is that they look awesome
and incredible you know and connect to
is a huge improve
over connect I don't know I'm still not
convinced about motion gaming but there
is an elegance about the way the xbox
one has been put together for sure
absolutely yeah it seemed where this is
heading yeah okay his sort of has
emerged within last year yeah finally
making appearance the consumer market
yeah when behind this is 4k for 4000
yeah yeah that's 4,000 bucks for the
monitor another 4,000 bucks or they have
shooter to run the 4k resolution on that
yeah so I love good graphics you know i
think that's that's a that's a step
towards are forgetting with playing
games and being lost in these
experiences and i think we need to
constantly reach for that I think engine
design and graphic refinement and
improvement and horsepower then it can
accommodate these grand visions that are
in our minds or you know realizing these
dreams is important and it's a big part
of the maturation of our in medium I
think that we need that but the question
is do we need to spend that much money
up to get them so I think that we need
for K and curb resolutions I think we
need flexibility yeah I mean I think
we're at the beginning of where this is
all going I mean this is a very young
medium and it's technology-based now but
I want that technology to sort of drop
and just become a
you know an invisible sort of access
points of this incredible content
absolutely and I don't want to be
thinking about the fact that i'm playing
I want to just be playing for you know I
want to be lost in experience I've seen
under skin and I don't know when this is
going to era but the movies gray and
they've got some really fascinating tips
to what the future of game design is
going to be like really emergent kind of
technologies and emergent storytelling
that's based on internal biorhythms and
internal I guess analyzation you know
based on psychiatric kind of emotions
yeah I mean that's what the book is all
about that's what's portrayed in the
film and it was kind of wonderful to see
this because that's what you can tell
we're being let I mean even the kinect
sensor with its ability to check your
heart rate and all that stuff it's
pretty freaky but also pretty
unbelievably cool yeah that we're gonna
have this communication with our games
in the future like that absolutely you
know where the algorithms are just
insanely complicated yeah we don't think
about yeah exactly we're lost in this
imaginary okay yeah well thanks so much
with any time talk to us I'm sure our
viewers are going to enjoy all this
commentary predator family yeah
absolutely thanks guys
