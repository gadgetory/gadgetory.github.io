course the show would not be possible
without the support of our sponsors
thanks to its Thermaltake fantex and
Coolermaster for making this trip
possible all right so I'm almost meeting
Eber he's at 78
Michael should be at the lounge let's
see if they actually met up this be the
first time all three of us go to
competence ku-ku-ku-ku so that little
echo chamber of sound is the most fun
you can have at midnight
while your boys are in the lounge and
you cannot get access
I found them
excuse me sir yes we talked everybody
all right so this is what happens when
you try to surprise your boys a little
too loud and got kicked out yeah so even
this all for you that priceless moment
of that surprise I'm just being nice
that I'm walking out with you because I
still have access so I'm just hey you
can go plan back up there you know I'm
just being nice that's all well I
appreciate it buddy I appreciate it
check out Gemma's PJs man you look so um
I got let's have it go to 7-eleven get
the plum chip chips Bieber Hey all right
so Eber this will be our fourth time in
Taipei you excited about Victoria best
you know ever but it is 1:00 a.m. so
let's just go straight to landing in
typing
we're finally in Taipei I tried to visit
you and you wouldn't think I contact
what no you just like into your zone and
Mike here tried to visit us two hours of
sleep tried to visit us in the back of
the plane they didn't let him because
he's too elite for the backside you know
wow it is actually quite lovely to be
content where the temperature is five
o'clock the morning
all right so our first Seminole of
experience in 2018 obviously we got to
get some plumb chips that's become the
traditions ever since me trying them
like four years ago
so our first breakfast in Taipei this is
looking epic let me show you ah so the
first breakfast in Taipei has been had
it was incredible even would you think
fantastic
I love it and now we get a goat the
explore Taipei because we have a bit of
time and yeah let's show you what our
trip in life here
so we just arrived to the young ming
mountain it's about 800 meters above
taipei and we're all right now inside
the clouds yeah let's play a game so
find ebert right I'll go stand somewhere
that's need to close your eyes so all
right and we never saw ever again
yeah
it's a Ghostbuster
guys did you see the bus I didn't see
nobody
so we're discussing just how quiet it is
up here so we can totally do our
voiceovers here so we can just pop into
the mountain record stuff it's also the
most amazing lighting it's just
beautiful ambient white ok so behind me
is boiling water from the hot springs so
it means is above 99 degrees Celsius
very dangerous hot we can cook an egg
down there and you can actually see
bubbling up I've never seen that before
all right so we came down from the
mountain we are at the fisherman sport
and over here at or on the lovers bridge
good
all right yeah it's good either tell us
how many where's your where - got one
we've got another one down there and
Mike you're melting I'm wearing too many
layers when it's too many right now take
hey it up yes
finally let's unload man hey welcome to
our temporary space here copy text so
this is the first time when all of us
all three of us have separate rooms
so Eber you can finally get your own
room and not just like having to snuggle
on the couch and I have a little little
den in there as well we get two
bathrooms we got an awesome balcony you
think well I think this this space
really deserves its own little tea
all right so we finally settled in and
all three of us are hopeful that we're
gonna see a lot of exciting things and
Computex so you guys can see it too
hopefully not too much addressable RGB
goodness because that's getting a little
bit out of control but maybe not so yeah

videos that will be filled in soon and
