coverage and after looking through the
last of the footage the team realized
that there were some really stunning
ASUS motherboards that simply needed to
be covered you see in many ways asus has
been leading the motherboard market when
it comes to innovation with features
like or sync automatic overclocking and
many other items this year they're
really moving things towards the next
level with a whole new class of
motherboards but before we move on quick
shout out from our sponsors the show
coverage is possible thanks to Nvidia
gigabyte fantex and NCIX Asus is
actually introducing a whole new brand
of high-end motherboards which will
eventually sit above the Republic of
gamers extreme series and focus
exclusively on achieving the highest
possible all clocks say hello to the ROG
Maximus 9 apex I mean just look at this
thing asus has been working with case
manufacturers in an effort to think
outside the typical box like ATX form
factor and this is their first attempt
without getting too crazy
basically the apex keeps to a slightly
enlarged ATX size but it's PCB certainly
isn't a square since it has several
areas that just cutout to house
additional components it is an
interesting look that's for sure another
distinguishing feature of this board is
it's three memory slots the first two
are used exclusively for memory and by
eliminating the other two typical slots
asus has been able to cut down on traces
between the CPU and DIMM slots which
should in theory at least boost
potential memory overclocks
past the 4266 megahertz mark supposedly
overclockers have already taken this
board past 4500 makers in dual channel
mode that third slot isn't used for
memory at all rather it's wired directly
to the PCH and it's used for an add-in
card with dual m2 SSD mounts it's really
an interesting design since it moves the
m-dot 2 drives away from the GPM
mounting areas while also allowing for
mounting memory coolers for additional
SSD cooling there are ton of other
overclocking friendly features on this
board but I don't see no other RG boards
are missing there's a ps/2 connector in
place of two USB ports and the onboard
audio is a more cut-down solution when
compared against many of a chooses other
motherboards
this is all done an effort to achieve
overclocking greatness
rather than the mass-market appeal while
the apex main target
cockers asus hasn't forgotten about
their people who want everything but the
kitchen sink common motherboards for
them the rog Maximus extreme 9 may be a
perfect fit
since asus has moved the extreme series
of the market in an effort to make it
appealing for water cooling enthusiasts
with that in mind this boards most
distinctive feature is the massive bitch
power monoblock that incorporates liquid
cooling to the boards PWM and CPU and
even the top m2 SSD along with a healthy
Bills of RGB lighting
hey it's 2017 expect RGB in everything
there's more to this water blog than
what first meets the eye - since the
monoblock
incorporates full-rate water leak and
temperature sensors which communicate
directly with the h2s panic spread
utility this will allow for continual
monitoring of your custom water cooling
loop that's pretty amazing we also
noticed a few other interesting features
here there is an integrated backplate
with hard wire connectors for decreased
interference right-angled USB and ATX
12-volt connectors and even a grouping 4
for fan headers in the upper corner for
convenient connection to radiator and
water cooling pumps the Maximus 9
extreme looks like a very well thought
out board and we can't wait to get one
in hand for testing after those last two
motherboards this one might seem a bit
of a downer but I personally think this
one is a much more realistic purchase
for most of you say hello to the Strix Z
270 a gaming it's small but hugely
capable IX motherboard the amount of
things Asus has managed to cram onto
this little thing boggles my mind it has
features like 5 USB 3.1 gen2 which is a
rarity even our extremely expensive
full-size boards and the ability to
sustain 5 gigahertz on higher overclock
on an i7 77k processor there's also a
reinforced PCIe slot for extra safety if
you transport your system a lot a strip
for RGB on the white side and a 50/50
header that's compatible with the Asus
Ora RGB LED control software if you want
Wireless the z2 7 TI gaming has
recovered - since it incorporates
wireless AC connectivity finally there
are two end or two slots one on the back
of the board and one on the front which
also has a unique test of heatsink that
can be installed
all in all aces showed a ton of
interesting stuff but if you we're
buying a new motherboard which one would
it be
the overclocker
water cooler or the small ITX let us
know in the comments down below
I mean bar with harbor connects thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
