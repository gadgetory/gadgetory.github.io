great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Huracan
accent welcome to another video back in
December we reviewed this guy this the
600 C from Corsair it was an interesting
inverted ATX layout with an awesome
elegant exterior but many of you have
expressed your interest in a smaller
non-inverted standard ATX layout and now
we have 400 C which satisfies those
demands perfectly the Corsair 400 C is a
fantastic addition to the Carbide series
because they brought some needed updates
on the interior to remain competitive
and the $99 price point I feel is
well-placed when you look at coursers
entire catalog but it's when you start
to compare to the price ranges of the
defined tests and the fantex p 400 or
the n3 pro m then the 400 c loses some
competitive points now in terms of size
and design here it is next to the bigger
brother 600 C and the 400 C is both much
smaller and thinner thanks to the
omission of the five and a quarter inch
drive bays and an overall smaller
internal design with seven PCI slots
instead of eight on the bigger guide but
I can definitely appreciate the
consistency in design language with
metal plated front panel that's fully
solid and curves at the top and only has
a small Corsair logo in the bottom
corner and then the large acrylic side
panel that's slightly tinted and is
fairly resilient to scratch marks we
have this handle to open the panel and
it can be removed from the frame
completely if needed on our 600 C sample
the panel came off with ease but here
the hinges are much tighter that
requires upward wiggle motion to get the
hinges released in my opinion the
acrylic is totally fine here at this
price point we cannot expect tempered
glass but at least the nature of the
side panel mount means we could
potentially see different materials in
the future the front panel is well
spaced out to allow unrestrictive intake
and behind it we find the fine mesh dust
filter spending the entire fan area
which can support triple 120 or dual 140
mm
with a single 140 Milner fan included
and I ended up adding a second 120mm fan
for my CPU cooler but notice the
mounting strips running down for
flexible fan installation which is
awesome the i/o includes a power button
dual USB 300 jacks and hard drive
activity LED and a reset switch the top
of the case was fully covered with a
magnetic filter that is coarse enough to
allow proper exhaust but it will prevent
dust from settling through the top here
we get dual 140 and 120mm mounts that
are offset closer to the side panel for
best internal clearance although there
isn't much hight clearance here so your
best bet is to utilize the front of the
case for radiators and top for fans only
the 400 C is very well elevated which
makes it slightly bigger than needed but
at least the feet are rubberized and it
does filter is present under your power
supply speaking of the power supply
corsair is taking a modular approach
towards the shroud which is in two
pieces but still leaving plenty of
clearance from the front panel if you
want to occupy all three fan slots and
pop in a radiator in there removing the
first cover reveals the drive cage that
is very well hidden and you have two
brackets and the drive cage is also
removable and so is the last power
supply cover and you have to remove both
pieces of the shroud in order to install
your power supply and courser makes it
super simple with a few thumb screws
taking a look at the back we find the
tools three slot cage for your SSDs that
is also removable and several cable type
points around key areas particularly
around the large rubber grommets and I
decided to place a micro ATX system
inside the case because this is actually
a hackintosh in these guys so if you
want to see a video on my full
experience in that let us know by
leaving a comment or a like on this
video
so a couple of points to mention the
rubber grommets are a little bit distant
from the motherboard
although standard ATX motherboards would
be slightly wider than what you see here
and thus it would be closer to the
grommets and not a big issue
there are no direct cutouts underneath
the micro ATX board but that's totally
fine as you have plenty of routes to
direct your cables and I really love the
totally unrestricted front intake the
delivers cool air to your GPU and the
general interior the cutout on the power
supply shroud allows you to route PCIe
cables to your GPU but the cut out is a
little further back it's kind of in the
middle of the shroud resulting in curved
cables and not that totally clean exit
coming around - this was no effort at
all aside from needing to do some extra
work around the SSD cage and making sure
that all the cables here are not
sticking out but I'm pretty happy with
the overall cleanliness of the 400 C and
even though I've removed the hard drive
cage you would still have plenty of room
in front of the power supply for excess
cables now there's plenty of width here
to tuck away your cables but you have to
make sure that they're all flat so the
panel can close just fine because there
is no extra you know space once you put
the panel on this is all you have to
deal with so here's the thing about 400
C it's a compact brother - the 600 C
which makes sense for less demanding
configurations and still allow you to
populate radiator at the front and I
love this dual piece shroud design in
terms of features it is competing with
cases that are 20 and 10 dollars cheaper
but it does offer that clean exterior
and full acrylic panel and very
satisfying assembly process and because
of this we're giving it the Haruka Knox
damn good award
and if you can find it on sale it would
definitely be on our recommendation list
because for 2016 release it offers you
everything you'd want it's not too bulky
for ITX
and you can build a satisfying system
around what this case offers so as I
said earlier we are doing a hackintosh
build inside this case with the system
that exact same system so if you want to
see video on that wish me luck
and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
