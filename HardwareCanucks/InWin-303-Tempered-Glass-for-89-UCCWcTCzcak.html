has not always been positive but let's
not continue this negative train because
today the in wind 303 changes the
conversation for the better with an
exciting new mid tower priced at $89
there are elements of new and the old in
here with a perfect balance of what
builders want these days from a modern
enclosure I love the combination of pure
boxy frame with matte metal surface this
very cool ventilation opening on the
right side and a full tempered glass
panel on the left that is tinted and
unlike many other glass panels this
one's very thin which is awesome because
it reduces the weight of the glass to
implement a genius tooless attachment no
screws required just push the lever down
to release the panel it's a little bit
stiff but it's super convenient the
other side panel removes in a similar
way but with two thumb screws that stay
with the panel the front i/o is standard
here power reset audio and four USB
ports that have blue illumination which
looks pretty awesome but perhaps it's a
little bit too bright and for those
wondering what's up with that red handle
on our sample on the side panel that's
actually supposed to be black now just
like the front the top is solid and when
is taking a very different approach here
with air flow inside the 303 with the
power supply installed on the top on its
side followed by an ATX motherboard
layout with seven PCI slots and a rear
120mm fan which should have been
included by the way is just missing from
our sample the interior has a very
different chamber separation main
motherboard area is fully open but
someone should tell in when about a
rubber grommets as all the cable cutouts
are bare plus what's up with the lack of
thumb screws for the PCIe brackets this
is just weird change from what we're
normally used to for airflow you can
populate triple 120mm fans at the bottom
and if using a micro ATX or a mini ITX
motherboard you can fit a 360 rat in
here it does filter spends this entire
area which is removable from the side
thank you for that and it's awesome to
see just a small gap between the filter
and the
frame so it doesn't interfere with any
fans crews but moving to the top fan
mount this one is interesting because
it's a sideways and it's meant to
exhaust air through the backside panel
and it will support triple 120mm fans
and up to a 360 mm radiator it strange
to not see any 140 member fan support
inside the 303 especially since there is
room for them now most people will still
question the functionality of this
sideways exhaust especially since the
power supply will block airflow of one
of the fans but this is best shown with
a full system assembled which no doubt
looks very unique I'm sure that those in
love with the boxy s340 might consider
the 3 or 3/4 it's more interesting but
similar character and overall I'm pretty
happy with the assembly process and
cable management with an ATX board the
bottom fan configuration will restrict
access to all those cables at the bottom
which is why I didn't install any there
are two cutouts right underneath the
power supply for passing cables below
into the main chamber and one larger
main cable opening in the middle of the
motherboard which is little too far away
from the board itself I wish it was a
bit closer there are two SSD drive
caddies that face each other but a third
spot is available for the SSDs to be in
the same orientation so a few things to
keep in mind with such fan configuration
that you see one is it you have no
direct intake unless you install fans at
the bottom and with my system we have a
negative air pressure so more exhaust
than intake actually no intake
whatsoever so that filter at the bottom
will get quiet fool but I love the look
of LED fans that are all populated at
the top plus depending on your lighting
configuration the lighting may just
barely peak through the ventilation on
the other side panel which could look
really cool and something to play around
with now with the power supply sitting
right in front of one of the fans it
will help to cool the power supply which
is good and say you install a 240 member
all in one cooler and a top slot the
power supply fan will be part of this
whole exhaust system from
chamber you have three and a half inches
of width until you hit the side panel at
the top so push-pull is possible but not
with thicker radiators and you could
install fans on the power supply side
you just have to work around the cables
and this entire area in front of the
power supply is most likely to be
underutilized and I find it quite
wasteful this could have been a perfect
spot for an optional five and a quarter
inch drive bay wiring everything with
custom cables was simple but there are
no dedicated cable tie hoops why this N
one chooses to ignore the ease of cable
management especially since this is
their frame design this could have
easily incorporated some type of
built-in hoops but otherwise you can
sort of collect all the cables right
outside the power supply for storage
there are two three and a half inch
drive caddies that support SSDs as well
they are a little bit difficult to wire
and I actually wouldn't mind having the
ability to install them in the main
compartment somewhere around the
motherboard but I also understand the
potential compatibility mess that this
would introduce so if you're sticking
with stock fan configuration the top
area being open like that it's not the
most attractive of presentations on the
interior so fan installation here is
definitely recommended both for airflow
and aesthetics and in my time with the
three or three I've gotten to appreciate
what n wind is trying to achieve here
giving users a gorgeous enclosure with
an interesting sideways airflow approach
the build is solid tempered glass is
awesome but they need to do something
about cable management because it could
be so much better
aside from that the three or three is a
refreshing entry under $100 and deserves
our damn innovative award and that
concludes this review thank you so much
for watching and we'll see you in the
