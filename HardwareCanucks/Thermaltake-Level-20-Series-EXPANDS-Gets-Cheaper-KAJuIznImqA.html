Wow I was expecting that you know I've
done that to him so that was a that was
very nice coffee our guard well done
Eber all right so we're here at thermal
take as usual they have a bunch of
awesome mods builds that we're gonna
show you guys later
but this my friends is the new level 20
family we had a few siblings for their
level 20
ginormous case make sure to check out
the fool little overview that we did at
CES but this thing has now evolved into
these three little guys but before we
tell you about those huge thanks to
Thermaltake fantex and Coolermaster for
making this trip possible alright so
let's start with the level 20 GT so this
thing obviously it carries a similar
design language as the original level 20
very wide body space gray materials this
is all steel and plastic construction
and tempered glass on the top the front
and both sides so for side panel
tempered glass the only thing we need
now later is a tempered glass for the
back I mean who hasn't done yet well we
see that hopefully maybe but here we
have 200 millimeter of aluminum so for
the front we have 200 millimeter fans
that can also be installed at the top
now the tempered glass here obviously is
a little bit of a choking thing but they
have narrow the tempered glass so there
are a little bit spacing here that will
also increase in the final production so
we can get nice air flow intake from the
from the front and the same thing for
the exhausting ones to the top I can
feel a lot of air coming out from from
these tiny little sections surprised but
by that but it will also be slightly
expanded for the final release the i/o
here is separated into two so all power
buttons here and then the USBs are here
with a USB type-c gen 2 at 60
millimeters for the actual length of the
cable which is awesome so you can route
it whatever you want
especially for case that is this large
so that's great now both side panels
feature this swivel mechanism with the
old-school locking mechanism to they are
magnetic they simply just attach to the
side which is awesome and the reason why
this case is so wide is because you can
rotate the GPU section so you can have
you know your standard GPU vertically or
horizontally or you can simply
rotate that GPU bracket and have all
those PCI lanes vertically which is kind
of cool it's definitely an expansion of
this the whole dual slot for the
vertical you know for the frame but now
the whole PCI area can be rotated to
accommodate this direction the power
supply shroud only covers half of the
case the rest of it can be used to
populate water cooling components so
that's obviously thermal takes approach
because the whole thing about this one
is water cooling gigantic radiators lots
of space for all types of stuff and here
we also have the side radiator mount
where you can mount a 420 ml radiator so
lots of options and yeah quite wide let
me know what you guys think about the
level twenty GT so the level twenty GT
price-wise is one eighty nine without
any fans so let me know what you think
about that price point and 289 so $100
more for dual two hundred million fans
and one one forty exhaust so now let's
move on to the level 20 X T so this one
is you know joking around a little fat
uncle going on over here very
unconventional but it is based on the
core x9 frame so if you've been eyeing
the core x9 and actually like the whole
tempered glass approach that has that
characteristics of the level 20
then this my friends is your pic the IO
is filled four years B's one type C
sixty millimeter cable here again these
cases are so wide so we can have two
hundred millimeter fans on the front and
the top the top has a really awesome
bracket but here the front as you can
see we also have these gaps between the
tempered glass so the airflow can enter
you know it is slightly choked off but
potentially they'll open this up a
little bit more for the final release
the pricing is not yet available but the
cool thing about this one is it's an ATX
form factor and the motherboard is not
you know it's not sitting there like
like you would on other cases the
motherboard is staying horizontal which
means you have to have this sort of wide
form factor to accommodate for it EA TX
motherboards and XL ATX motherboards are
supported with additional brackets that
potentially may be included to expand
that model board area and the whole
thing here is like if you want a
ultimate water-cooling build load this
thing with lots of fans and if you have
the space for something like the XT it's
it's a possibility especially because of
that horizontal motherboard location if
you're populating multiple graphics
cards that is a popular spot when the
motherboard is laying flat so there is
no that there's no
you know stress on the on the PCI slots
now behind the glass of the top here is
this giant mesh filter it's not
necessarily for airflow because dust
will still accumulate on top of the
glass but it is to cover up this
interior because otherwise will feel too
open and so this one kind of closes it
off I do like this approach and you can
also remove it and this is how you
access the top filter top fan bracket
excuse me so you can mount all your
types of fans a fourtwenty and even 480
member radiators up top so potentially
you can have two brackets for like an
extreme water cooling system this thing
can accommodate dual power supplies or
you can have a power supply and a giant
radiator at the bottom or a combination
of like a something smaller in front the
power supply so it is tall it is wide it
is big that's the XD alright so the
final sibling of the level 20 family is
the level 20 VT it is based on the core
V 21 enclosure so it is micro ATX based
and so here we have again four panels of
tempered glass and the cool thing about
the three panels here are they're
interchangeable so you can potentially
swap this panel for here because one of
them two of the panels are slightly
spaced out to allow for air flow to
either exit or intake and so here we
have a 240 millimeter radiator right now
set to exhaust and micro ATX motherboard
with a vertical GPU bracket a single 200
millimeter fan a 140 mm exhaust fan
power supply at the bottom you can mount
six hard drives in here with three SSDs
sorry and then three additional hard
drives so if you're potentially looking
again for that horizontal mountable
mount for micro ATX system the VT
obviously it has that same
characteristics similar spacing on the
front panel to allow that front airflow
to enter and the spacing for the other
panels for the air
to exit no type-c at the front however
this VT is a $99 price point with a
single 200 millimeter fan included so
it's nice to have more micro TX options
available on the market and it's kind of
cool to have this like lineup of level
20 family micro TX this gigantic thing
of the XT and then the GT over there
alright good people so that is the new
level 20 line GTX t VT nice little you
know range of enclosures and one thing
that we do have to appreciate with this
naming scheme I mean it's two letters
right so as long as you memorize those
it's not like a gigantic 30 word model
name so thank you that for that
thermaltake alright guys so that's it
let us know what you think of these
three cases in the comments below and
which of these would you like us to
review I'm Dimitri thanks much for
watching check out these other relevant
videos and we'll see you in the next
