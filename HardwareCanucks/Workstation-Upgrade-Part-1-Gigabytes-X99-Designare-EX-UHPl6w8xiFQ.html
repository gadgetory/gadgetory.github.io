reckon ox welcome to another video so
this guy travelled me all the way from
Taipei the core i7 Broadwell e 6800 k
courtesy of gigabyte now I'm hoping this
six core 12 thread CPU will be a
fantastic upgrade over my current 6700 K
so make sure to subscribe to see our
results in my daily workflow between
these two CPUs that video is coming
shortly the Kraken X 61 by NZXT offers
fantastic cooling with the 280 memory
radiator when the long slim tubing for
easier installation and high pressure
copper cold plate you can also customize
led through the cam software so get
crackin and so with the new broad well
eight processors come a few new x99
motherboards and while the x99 chipset
hasn't changed at all between haswell-e
and Broadwell ii and indeed trying to
find differences between most first and
second generation LGA 2011 v3
motherboards is extremely challenging
however the new x99 designee reacts by
gigabyte does things a little bit
differently by introducing a whole new
concept in two gigabytes lineup so it's
part of their ultra durable series and
it's loaded with features and a price to
reflect that at four hundred and
nineteen dollars you can think of it as
direct competition to Asus deluxe series
which is priced similarly now the blue
and white color scheme is very
particular not neutral in any way but
you can add an accent color with RGB
ambient LEDs on the motherboard and
there's also a 4 pin RGB header for
standard LED strips that are all
controlled through the desktop app the
motherboard supports up to 128 gigabytes
of ddr4 Ram and up to 256 gigabytes of
registered memory with overclock speed
of up to 36 hundred megahertz something
that not many lower and priced x99
boards can claim we have 5 PCI Express
slots and one of x99s claims to fame is
support for dual crossfire or SLI at
full PCI Express x16 speed so we have
three slots that operate at x16 mode and
notice the top two slots are spaced out
for extra breathing room for dual GP
configurations
plus it will come
four gigabytes own - in half slot
extreme gaming video cards all the dims
and PCI slots are covered in
stainless-steel shielding it's a popular
trend among today's high-end
motherboards and it's supposed to
prevent any PCB bending or damage of the
slot
due to heavy GPUs it also adds a cool
unique a steel accent to your setup that
would burn beautifully with some
particular components in your system
like I've done here with this be quiet
cooler between those two top PCI Express
slots is a hidden m2 slot that requires
some work to access which I don't like
but furthermore there are a couple of
YouTube connectors for nvme storage and
a total of ten SATA connections at six
cubits per second and one SATA Express
the Riario has many cool features like
dual Gigabit LAN plus Wi-Fi antennas for
dual band 11 AC wireless one USB type-c
with 36 walk pass-through and one USB
3.1 type-a we have five USB ports four
which are USB 3 and the rest is audio
with an optical connector and 7.1
surround sound audio without color
indication so you just have to read the
i/o shield now one really cool connector
here is the DisplayPort in port for
future Thunderbolt firmware update this
is to reroute the DisplayPort from your
graphics card into the motherboard and
use the Thunderbolt 3 Type C out to
connect a Thunderbolt 3 display and this
is a very cool future-proofing feature
as you can use your you know Thunderbolt
3 displays some time in the future plus
the Alpine Ridge controller is built
into the motherboard and the gigabytes
just waiting on their certification from
Intel after which they will roll out
with a BIOS update the PCB on the bottom
is bare there's no armor here and just
reflecting on our visit to the gigabyte
factor tour in Taiwan the amount of
parts that goes into motherboard
production of this caliber must easily
exceed 15,000 components and just little
parts and it gives us a whole new
interesting appreciation for the
designee r-tx
before we move on to the bill that we
also have a couple of internal USB 3 and
USB 2 connectors a total of 5 4 pin fan
headers there are no fan headers on the
entire right side of
motherboard so you'll just need to route
your cables either to the very top or to
the very bottom
and once everything is assembled we can
jump into the BIOS if you've worked with
you'ii fiy BIOS before this will feel
very familiar Mouse navigation here is
very laggy I dislike it we also have
this hidden menu at the bottom to access
easy mode or fan control which displays
things you know more generalistic way
but you can access the classic menu for
all your advanced frequency voltage
controls and etc and if you prefer
control from the desktop you can with
App Center it's like hub for all types
of things like system information
lighting control you even have monitor
color temperature adjustment to perhaps
eliminate blue light for evenings then
there's fan control and an overclocked
tune utility for the CPU and memory I
still prefer to work inside the BIOS to
avoid unnecessary crashes but you know
having all this control to the desktop
app is still quite convenient I was
surprised not to find any issues with
loading you know full 64 gigabytes of
memory on the first boot with Windows
installation everything loaded just fine
and so the x99 the secondary X is a fine
board with future proofing and mind
thanks to that Thunderbolt 3 connector
and 5 PCIe slots and a load of storage
options for that premium price but
unfortunately there are some things that
I don't find completely satisfactory
like we only have 5 USB ports in the
rear i/o
so that's my keyboard mouse webcam card
reader and speakers I don't have no more
space for my microphone interface
external hard drives and like anything
else that I want to plug in via USB we
only have 5 fan headers on the
motherboard which i think is again
lackluster for an enthusiast caliber
like that and no physical buttons on the
board itself to clear CMOS to reboot to
start the motherboard we have a load
clear a clear CMOS jumper but I don't
think that's acceptable on a 400 plus
mother port so stay tuned to see if the
two additional course make a huge
difference in my daily work for versus
the 6700 K I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
