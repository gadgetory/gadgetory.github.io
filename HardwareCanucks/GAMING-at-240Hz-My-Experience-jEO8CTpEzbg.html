1 millisecond response time is this the
ultimate gaming monitor
well that would really depend if that's
all you're doing in this monitor because
the panel is still TN so despite the
incredibly fluid 240 Hertz refresh rate
there is a significant color and
contrast shift at an angle Plus this XG
2530 is expensive for a 1080p monitor at
$450 so then what is all that hype
surrounding really high refresh monitors
let's find out where this creativity is
fueled by the best instruments it
doesn't always come easy and in the
process you often realize how important
quality is the Rd 400 bio CC gives you
quality and speed with M de tu interface
the Shiban and flash and a pci bracket
making it possible to focus on what
matters
investing storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty now I would not consider myself
a pro but I do enjoy the competitive
scene for FBS and csgo and overwatch but
I don't really want to ask if 240 Hertz
is worth it because the refresh rate is
one thing and if you've been training
yourself at the hundred Hertz or 144
Hertz then your muscle memory is already
adjusted to that so if you have an
exclusive gaming station then perhaps
240 Hertz is a good option if you're
just really looking to dominate in the
FPS scene and really want that whole
fluidity aspect and you have the
hardware to match that refresh rate so
I'd like to refresh my monitor history
so I edit my videos on a 4k 60 Hertz
panel which is excellent really good
pixel density everything is super sharp
then I occasionally switch to the ultra
wide curved 34 inch 21 by 9 that one is
75 Hertz monitor it's really good for
content especially if you find 21 by 9
movies it's really good productivity and
then for gaming I've been sort of stuck
to the 144 Hertz monitor from Acer it's
a 27 inch panel at 40
40p resolutions so there's that really
good balance of nice high refresh during
IPS good resolution and good size so
then when I switch to the smaller 25
inch 1080p display it really gets me
thinking that for $450 you are paying
for that 240 Hertz refresh rate so you
got to ask yourself if a gaming station
is all you want because this for other
multi-purpose tasks as a monitor just
doesn't fly now from a physical
perspective the monitor is kind of man
it doesn't have anything striking about
it it does go with that black and red
color scheme which I wish they would
ignore you know we'd love to have
something more simple the base has that
brushed aluminum plastic on it that does
get dirty
it doesn't really hold anything you know
things just kind of slide off it and I
wish it was more utilitarian maybe have
a little little pocket for things to put
in there I do appreciate the built-in
handle at the very top so you can carry
the monitor easily I do like the texture
in the back of the monitor plus we have
this low clip that can be used to hang
your headphones and then there's the
clip for cables that feels kind of off
it doesn't really securely sit on that
stand and the bezels are nice and small
and your roll feeling of the structure
is sturdy but I don't like the bottom
lick that has that curved and it makes
the monitor feel convex like it's
popping out towards you not in a good
curve I'm not sure if that's by design
or not but it's there and I don't really
like it for cables we only have a
display port USB to the monitor and a
power cable I do like that it does not
require separate power bank and
therefore display connectivity we have
dual HDMI a single DisplayPort and dual
USB 3 ports plus a headphone jack and
this monitor also has built-in speakers
the speakers are no we're good I
shouldn't use them you shouldn't use
them and headphone jack is very
underpowered and you have to control the
volume through the built-in buttons on
the monitor that's just big no the free
sync range on this panel is awesome for
48 Hertz to 240 Hertz covering up to
that maximum fresh weight which is so
awesome so if you have a compatible AMD
GPU you can reach that to 240 Hertz with
fluid tear free experience of course
you're going to need a beefy system in
order to utilize all
those hurts and while this freesync
range is really good I don't think it's
necessary here particularly because
you're targeting this for eSports or
really competitive a gamer is seeing so
most gamers want the maximum possible
frame rates don't don't want it capped
at 240fps anyway and also freesync
might introduce some input lag for games
like csgo so you'll turn out off anyway
and I feel like you know it's a it's a
good thing to have but not for the
target audience that they're sort of you
know catering this to so say what you
will about free sync for GN panel the
colors are actually not that bad but
again I would not recommend this as a
multi-purpose display simply because we
have so much contrast and color shift
when viewed from the angles and
especially when then with that vertical
elevation changes the color just get
destroyed for TN panel the blacks are
not best because of that massive
contrast shift however there's very
little back like bleeding only a little
bit on the bottom of the frame but it's
not significant and you know you're not
buying this monitor for color accuracy
or color definition and depth you're
buying it for the Hertz monitor
brightness at 100% is good and I do
appreciate that when you open the OSD we
have a nice indication of the Hertz
displayed on the monitor itself and the
brightness and percentage on a left and
on the topic of color accuracy and all
that stuff I appreciate what the sonic
has done here in terms of providing us
all these gaming profiles that modify
the black levels and sharpen the image
more because for for gaming advantage
you don't care about visual accuracy and
all that you care about minimizing the
shadows and sharpening those pixels so
that you can see things a distance and
things that are normally sort of comma
flashed by in-game graphics so you can
choose which one you like the best per
particular title FPS is my favorite and
color X is really good in overwatch do
one annoying thing about these gaming
profiles is that when you change them
the monitor restarts so in a desktop
that's not really an issue because you
will change it everything will just go
back to normal if you're not doing
anything but in games for example I was
playing csgo and my game crashed when I
changed the gaming profile on the
monitor that shouldn't happen so I wish
that you saw
had some better implementation on
changing the actual picture profile of
the monitor without it needing to be
rebooted for 2017 release the navigation
just feels poor if you're trying to like
reduce brightness and contrast and good
luck trying to rename your profile that
just seems so unintuitive but as far as
choosing your correct gaming profile for
example if you like one or the other we
have a dedicated button for that
so that's appreciate it so the main
advantage with these high refresh rate
monitors is how much faster things just
update on the screen so for example take
a look at these four examples we had
gone from 60 Hertz to 100 Hertz to 144
Hertz and finally to 240 Hertz you can
see that mouse trail is less significant
on the 240 Hertz monitor but still it's
not as noticeable on the 144 Hertz and
of course it's the worst on a 60 Hertz
panel so outside of gaming high refresh
rate monitors are really good for
productivity
everything's just fluid on the screen
it's less you know tiring on your eyes
if you try to like move windows around
the stuff and just really nice I love
the 100 Hertz plus for anything on
desktop and whenever I go back to my 4k
60 Hertz panel it's just so painful I
just want to overclock it or have like
at least 75 Hertz for anything on my
desktop and so then for gaming I tried
my luck in the competitive arena with
csgo and/or watch and the difference
between 144 Hertz and 240 Hertz was not
as noticeable when jumping from 60 to
144 Hertz so the one thing you have to
consider is your frame rate I'm actually
able to reach that maximum Hertz on a
240 Hertz panel in order to utilize the
full benefit of that fast refresh rate
it's very difficult to reach to 140
Hertz basically in any game you have to
lower the resolution you have to lower
the settings and even in my example with
overwatch and csgo it was very difficult
to reach that 240 Hertz mark with my
1700 X and the GTX 1080 and the second
thing to consider is your skill level do
you need a 240 Hertz monitor now of
course checking corners and doing slicks
and everything on the screen is a lot
more fluid so you can observe and you
know in take all that information and
become
but better player but let's say if
you're coming from 1/144 hurts already
then I would say there is no point in
doing that upgrade so my experience with
the monitor has been an absolute blast
and you approach it from two angles one
of them is like you know that the
monitor is 240 Hertz so you do
everything in your power to gain those
200 frames per second plus to take
advantage of all those frames being
updated in sync and the second thing is
you kind of become a better player
because everything you know on the
screen has very little motion blur
everything is just right there with you
it's like one-to-one something that if
you haven't experienced the high refresh
rate monitor in the past then 240 Hertz
will completely blow your way the one
main advantage I see with this panel is
currently the cheapest 240 Hertz Full HD
monitors so if you were looking to get
into the space there is no other
alternative below that $450 price point
and currently it's actually on sale and
I want to recap this video by saying
that people that are looking for 240
Hertz monitors already have maybe
dedicated gaming stations something that
maybe they do a little bit of
productivity on the monitor but the main
thing is competitive gaming so that they
have the best fluid experience they know
their mouse movements like you know it's
stuck in the memory and people that may
be trying to improve their game in the
competitive arena but how many of you
have dedicated gaming stations and on
the sides have like a workstation PC
with a better display high resolution
and all that not many so again the
target audience are those people who
want to improve their game and have the
ability to do own something like this on
the side while also having a better
display for everything else always they
charged with linking power up power
banks house and gorgeous aluminum
enclosure with dual USB and type-c port
with support for quick charge 3.0 to get
two devices recharged fast available up
to twenty thousand one hundred million
power capacities check them out in
description below and so that concludes
my experience with 240 Hertz monitor I
wouldn't say it's for everyone I
wouldn't say it's even for like 90% of
gamers but maybe for a lot 2% who are
really competitive and intense
and want to have the best possible image
and the hardware to support this high
refresh rate so guys thank you so much
for watching make sure to subscribe and
watch the other relevant content and I
you the type of gamer who would want at
240 Hertz display or maybe you think
with that 144 Hertz 27-inch 1440p panel
which are more readily available and I
would say offer better value for your
money but yeah let me know what you can
do you belong to and we'll see you next
