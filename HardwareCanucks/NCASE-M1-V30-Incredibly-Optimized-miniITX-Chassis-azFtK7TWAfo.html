great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Harbor Canucks and I was so excited to
finally receive our n case m1 sample a
crowdfunded project from Kickstarter
that could introduce more exciting ideas
like this one to the market it's a very
challenging process to create something
compact yet without compromises when it
comes to space efficiency and the end
case brings us a step closer to run an
extremely powerful system with these
dimensions and with that said those who
are willing and able to spend this much
on a tiny case will truly be satisfied I
say this because the build quality is
pretty much on par to what you get with
case labs or Lian Li or Silverstone
aluminum quality the entire aluminum
construction is superb the width of all
the side panels is satisfying plus all
the refined and smooth edges is how you
gain consumers trust in quality control
and the frame itself despite being a
superlight exhibited zero flex and I was
trying to find a weak spot this is the
version 3.0 and the beauty of this
project is its ongoing improvements the
list of which is surprisingly long from
the original but the main focus here for
n case is perfection and they are almost
if not already here the subtle audience
at the front highlight the perfect
balance between design and functionality
as this area can be populated either
with a slim slot loading optical drive
with a cutout at the top panel to insert
your discs or be used for an SSD with
rubber mounting cutouts available in the
frame here the front we get our power
button with the dark blue illumination
audio jacks and 2 USB 3.0 ports and I'd
like to note a reset switch is not
available all three side panels are
ventilated with precision holes and
since aluminum is not magnetic for dust
filters are included that they're meant
to be installed on the fans plus for fan
girls are also present to avoid cables
being caught in fan blades while looking
at accessories all the necessary screws
and rubber bits are nicely sorted plus
these four aluminum strips for instant
of dual two-and-a-half inch drives it's
a very clever and space-efficient system
coupling two drives that you slide to
lock type of mount either on the floor
or to the front panel and lastly an ATX
power supply bracket is included to
allow users complete flexibility for
hardware but keep in mind
installation of ATX power supply
introduces limitations for graphics card
length drive gauge and side radiator
clearance so it is strongly recommended
to use an SFX power supply instead to
optimize internal compatibility coming
to the rear of m1 we find an 80 and a 92
member fan holes and three PCI brackets
allowing users to populate all three if
needed but the extra height is also
helpful for drive or fan installation at
the bottom as everything is designed for
a reason for example the floor can be
populated with the combination of an SSD
and a 120mm fan beside it or a three and
a half inch drive with either an eighty
or ninety two millimeter fan beside that
and as you can see installation of both
drives on the floor may bring up
challenges for connecting everything but
not impossible if you rotate the SSD to
face the other way also an offset mount
is available on the inside of the front
panel for an SSD that does not interfere
with radiator and can only be installed
with the drive cage removed so plenty of
options available for multiple build
scenarios all the side panels pop off
easily on secure enough hinges and this
tool system is very well executed
leaving just an empty frame to work with
the side radiator bracket on the m1
houses a removable cage for duo three
and a half inch drives that you mount on
rubber grommets to prevent vibrations
and because they are facing inside using
90-degree SATA cables will tidy things
up and if you decide to keep the drive
cage in place the second 120mm fan spot
on the bracket can still be utilized as
long as the CPU tower is 10 centimeters
in height or shorter or opt in for a
120mm all-in-one cooler but I feel
all-in-one 240 moment radiators would be
a very popular choice among the m1 you
having two fans for intake would create
positive air pressure and thus reducing
dust buildup and optimizing cooling GPU
clearance is impressive with
non-obstructive 12 inches of space given
you use an SFX power supply or a non
modular 140 millimeters or shorter ATX
power supply to keep the same
compatibility so I swap the cooler for
an all-in-one 240mm radiator to see how
that would stack up and the first thing
you lose is that drive gauge however my
system only has an SSD that amounted on
the inside of the front panel and the
three and a half inch drive below the
GPU so this is where a blower style
cooler on the card may be potentially
more beneficial I was expecting some
challenges with the cables especially to
the right of the memory we are using the
600 watt SFX unit from silverstone that
is an outstanding choice for this system
given the black low profile short and
modular cables as you need to bundle
them up as they exit and while it's a
tight fit for tubing on the all-in-one
cooler it is a nonetheless properly
setup to cool our 4690k and this brings
up to temperatures how well does the end
case m1 cool our enthusiast hardware in
such a tiny form factor at low during
gaming the GPU remained at 72 degrees
Celsius and the CPU just skimming close
to 50 degrees Celsius a flowed with real
nice idle temps as well and regarding
the noise while with only two fans and
the GPU the system remained quiet enough
to comfortably sit beside me on the desk
during my tests now despite being the
third revision there are still elements
that I'd like to see changed like an
inclusion of a manual to help Novus
users to navigate all the different
configuration options an inclusion of a
dust filter for the power supply side as
it is positioned for intake would have
been beneficial as well but be fully
aware of what you're getting into with
the m1 as the building process is
actually pretty straightforward with
some planning and we finally have an
outstanding beautiful full aluminum mini
ATX case that reassures my confidence in
what designers at end case can do and
really can't wait to see what they'll do
next because this is a damn good and a
damn innovative case I personally love
what they've done with the size to
design the internal flexibility at this
size and it's clear that functionality
has been prioritized all thanks to the
crowdfunded community that helped bring
this case to life especially since n
case is a two-man collaboration and this
makes the m1 that much more impressive
and for all you're considering this mini
ITX direction do you see value in
dropping this much cash for this tiny
case or do you find this overpriced so
leave your thoughts with the comment
below
but this concludes this review make sure

setup tour coming very soon hit that
