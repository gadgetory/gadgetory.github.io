wait for it double kill Oh
speed kills nice now my good people
we've got a really exciting one for you
today and overwatch theme build should
be fun and this of course revolves
around the NZXT a 500 overwatch special
edition case the regular a 501 my best
value case or 2018 make sure to check
out the awards right over here but the
special edition brings some cool color
combination on the interior and the
exterior and yeah gives us the perfect
opportunity to play around with colors
and for true enthusiasts who love the
game so much this is an awesome way to
show your support and appreciation
they've done things with CS go with pop
G with ninja with many other esports
players and now overwatch and yeah it
should be a fun assembly process with
these beautiful components
the legendary hyper 212 CPU cooler from
coolermaster now comes in this
breathtaking matte black finish the
included Silencio 120 millimeter fan
delivers great airflow and reduced noise
plus you can pick up an RGB version of
this cooler as well learn more about the
hyper 212 Black Edition and its RGB
sibling down below alright so let's
start off with the case and the issue of
hundred special edition overwatch will
set you back a hundred and fifty dollars
that is literally twice the price of the
original H 500 and so you may ask what
is so special about this edition well
the overwatch team here is present but
it's not like overkill so on the right
hand side for example we have the
overwatch text and the logo spans the
entire side panel whereas in the front
it's just the logo and that is
illuminated you can turn off the logo
with a button in the back and they
didn't really go overboard with this
whole overwash theme and the only other
element inside this case would be the
bar on the interior the cable bar that
is orange instead of you know
traditional colors of black red blue and
white so here it's orange themed with
some you know slight logo branding on
the front and the right side however to
be honest I was expecting a little bit
more you know we've seen the hyper beast
eh 440 and that incredible artwork that
span the front and side and here it's a
little bit underwhelming and also the
fact that the logos are different in
size that can be a little bit
off-putting and it would be kind of
amazing if we just had an orange side
panel to match that color of the
internal bar I think that would have
been pretty cool however a hundred and
fifty dollars they're not including the
smart device like we see on the I
editions of the regular hf 100 i that
includes internal illumination and you
can plug in your your fans and stuff
into it so the fact that that's not
included in the $150 enclosure that's
also a little bit off-putting but for
you know true hardcore gaming
enthusiasts for overwatch I would say
they could look beyond that for the fact
that they have
overwatch logo on the front and the side
of the case now keeping up with the NZXT
theme we have something special it's a
little bit an early prototype the n7z
390 motherboard so the reason why we
kind of wanted to experiment with it and
it's like an early prototype the
internals will change it just looks
finished is because it is all matte
black and I feel like it will complement
this whole stealth approach that we're
doing with hardware and only use RGB
illumination and the orange cable bar on
the inside to provide some pop of color
it turns out that's very difficult to
find the monochrome motherboard which is
why the n7 is the perfect candidate with
its entire matte black structure the
PCBs black the you know the covers are
black everything is black it almost
feels like it's part of the enclosure
and not its own piece of hardware which
is actually kind of cool as for the CPU
thanks to Intel we got the core i5 9600
k-6 core processor 6 threads I can
overclock it to 5 gigahertz easy
it's a beastly CPU for any game we throw
at it and while my machine is rendering
on the 9900 K for all the video frames I
can hop on over to this guy and do some
games hey that rhymed totally
unintentional very good good and that's
for cooling we got a 240 ml radiator in
the front the X 52 with Noctua chrome
axe fans so going all black over here
with fantastic CFM and pressure - and
the final piece of the puzzle would be
the Auris extreme RT X 2060 one of the
reasons of course would be the color
coordination so it has RGB lighting so I
can color sync to my other hardware and
also try to master the orange on the
cable bar but also has some orange
accents built into the shroud itself
like the exposed copper backplate for
the GPU that is going to look fantastic
in my entire orange theme plus the whole
triple fan cooler design is going to be
fantastic for temperatures not just an
overwatch but in any game we throw at it
and normally I would avoid such large
almost obnoxious and busy shrouds on
GPUs for something a bit more elegant I
feel like the Auris extreme in this
particular case matches the whole theme
of the build especially or watch as well
so yeah RTX 2060 looks good and so with
the system assembled that final touches
required a little bit of color
coordination between all my components
so that brain elimination on the cooler
for example looks fantastic the trident
z RGB memory with that ambient spill on
each module and the graphics card just
the Auris text is illuminated at the top
with the X illuminated on the shroud but
you can't really see it because it's
facing down and it's not surprising to
see how all these NZXT components
complement each other the motherboard in
particular I love the stealth black and
like I said earlier how it just blends
in inside the case it's almost like it's
part of the enclosure itself the same
thing with the cooler and that the ring
illumination on the pump looks
absolutely gorgeous one of the
best-looking all-in-one coolers out
there for sure and looking over the
entire color coordination on the
interior and exterior I was kind of
hoping that the orange cable bar would
be slightly more vibrant because it is
more muted and when I have all my RGB
illumination on the interior set to
orange it doesn't exactly match and so
changing it to something else like a
complementary blue yeah makes the system
a bit more complete and so my concluding
thoughts for the entire overwatch theme
is that it's really good for n62
really special editions that are game
related and be really good to see that
from other case companies as well but I
was kind of hoping would see something a
bit more out there like having tracer
like we see on the box to be actually on
the case instead of just the logo and
the overwatch text and I guess the
licensing fees are quite expensive
because at $150 and we don't even get
the regular light bar like we have on
the eye Edition enclosure it's kind of
disappointing but we do get the ability
to turn and off the front LED section of
the logo oh I've been logged out yes
oh man I really haven't played this in a
while good well I have seven no
eliminations that's pretty nice all
right so what we're looking at here over
100 frames per second which is awesome
so we're 100 and around 110 120 hovering
around there
the GPU is at 65 degrees right now very
cool
65 degrees and the fans even spinning
god I can't hear anything
one minute left come on we can do this
we can do this my ultimate is ready Oh
22 seconds let's go let's go 22 seconds
over time okay okay well that is how you
