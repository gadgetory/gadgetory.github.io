I'm at AMD Xtravaganza event I'm here to
talk about my computer that I have here
it's a custom computer that I built
myself it has a custom bent 12
millimeter copper pipe that's been
chrome-plated throughout the case I have
both radiators in here they're also been
chrome-plated a sound cars being
chrome-plated I'm running two flagship
vo cards from AMD Club 3d the 295x2 s
I'm running them in quad fire four GPUs
running and running my setup here five
monitors running at 5400 by 1920 right
over here each monitor is 144 Hertz one
millisecond response time in the
computer to power everything I have a
corsair ax 1500 i power supply 1500
watts at folowed this system draws 1400
watts the system also has a remote
control lighting in the case you can
change any color that you want you can
turn off the colors here it's pretty
cool stuff all the water cooling in here
is ek the water blocks and the reservoir
the pump block in here the case itself
is a NASA tech Genesis 9000 in white
also comes in black the RAM in here I
have a crucial 16 gigabytes of tactical
tracer ram in here it's blinking like
crazy right now because that's telling
me that the ram is being used pretty
heavily right now it responds to
activity and it blinks faster the more
processing the computer is doing I also
have two SSDs in the backpack here
they're sitting in raid zero right now a
data SSD is a custom painted custom logo
on the front of the case here I have
AMD's mascot ruby it's the older design
of Ruby but she's been laser etched into
the Plexiglas here I also have some
lights right above here in this chrome
lip to highlight the make her glow when
I turn the computer on
okay so this computer is sponsored by
club 3d with the two video cards in here
to 295x2 s that they have given me I
build these custom computers I'm
considered what you call a computer
monitor I customize computers I take
them to LAN parties throughout North
America
and so all this custom stuff is done by
me all this wires wires leaving and so
it's a hobby of mine I've been doing for
about four or five years now this is my
third computer that I've that I've
finished and just cover actually one two
weeks ago it was CPU mod contest at
Inferno land and at Intel campus in
Dupont Washington so this case will be
on the front cover of CP magazine in
about two or three months from now
elimination of the case like here so we
can show off your best parts and
bragging little bit bad about it so this
is a built I did about two years ago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
