haven't heard of this case before you
need to step out from your fallout
shelter upgrade your Commodore and
continue watching this review the whole
premise of the half design is high
airflow it is intended for serious users
that want to be able to squeeze the most
from their system components without
having to worry about Heat the case
we're looking at today is the half 932
released as a limited edition AMD
version now despite the fact that it's
labeled as a limited special edition the
case rings in at basically the same
price point as the original as is great
news for penny pinchers but it also
tells you there isn't likely to be any
radical changes so to be honest before
we get into things not much has changed
with this revision aside from the
general look of the case but let's dive
in and see if it's all for the better
the case is definitely not small however
as we will say it makes it the perfect
candidate for larger hardware and
despite the fact that it's full of holes
it still weighs 30 pounds the most
striking change is the ATI red front
panel and unfortunately it's little more
than red plastic resembling something
that feels almost like a child's toy at
the bottom a large and very specific AMD
phenom ii x4 case badge which is andy's
current top-end processor line there are
no alternatives or generic case badges
included the front piece comes off for
cleaning but there's no real dust
filters to actually clean up the front 6
external drive bays and the front panel
has a full array with USB ports firewire
eSATA along with audio and LEDs power
and reset buttons are at the top along
with a storage area sort of covered by
the rubber that can be taken off to
reveal a very handy water cooling port
at the back a 230 millimeter red LED fan
which can be replaced with 220
millimeter fans
the side panel is the biggest design
change the original featured an intake
200 millimeter fan with a small end
slightly cheesy security window at the
top they've taken it all out to feature
a full-fledged window that has a unique
graphic featuring AMD's fusion dragon
logo as well as the company symbol at
the back there's space for a top-mounted
power supply with water cooling holes in
the middle i/o where 'ya 140 millimeter
fan with space for 127 PCI expansion
slots more venting and the bottom
mounted power supply area skipping to
the bottom we have 220 millimeter fan
spaces though no dust filters along with
removable feet if you want to attach the
included wheels jumping right into the
case there's plenty of room for bottom
mounted power supplies and it supports
longer PS use with this extendable cage
that keeps it raised there's six
sideways mounted hard drive bays using
cooler masters excellent sled system
then the front another 230 millimeter
red LED intake fan at the back the tool
is PCI Eclipse the 140 millimeter
exhaust fan and at the front the tool is
five on a quarter inch drive bays using
the cooler master button system up at
the very top are second power supply
area but you will have to take out the
top 200 millimeter fan to use it as is
becoming common on the motherboard tray
they've included a CPU backplate opening
and as we'll see with the halves punched
out back there is just about an inch of
room for cables making it very easy for
wiring the motherboard tray includes
plenty of cable management spacing and
supports the standard size boards
including the larger EE ATX form factor
as you can see at the back of the case
right over the tray and cable spaces
they push the back panel out to allow
for more cable wiring and the drive bays
are inset a good inch to allow for cable
storage there shouldn't be any problems
wiring this thing up
and one of the more disappointing
features for this case was despite the
fact that they've added a full side
window supposedly so you can see inside
in your handiwork
the interior is still this very drab
gray we've recently seen the move for a
bunch of cases too well painted black
interiors and even a lot without as we
move on to the installation the half 932
really begins to stand out
cooler masters to list drive caddy
system has always been a personal
favorite it's simple to install and
fairly secure rom drive installation is
again a breeze the covers can be taken
off without removing the whole front
panel and the drive just slides in and
clicks into place with expansion cards
the plastic retention clips do work fine
to hold Hardware in but it's probably
not a bad idea to remove them and use
screws if you want something more secure
and with 13 inches of space for video
cards fitting the ridiculous cards like
the 12 and a half inch or ATI 5970 will
not be a problem one thing to love about
this case is that coolermaster has done
a great job with cable layout nearly
everything can be kept in behind the
motherboard tray with just a little
creative positioning and for us messy
kevlars the back panel has no trouble
fitting back over top of a rat's nest
for the most part this all keeps the
front clear looking very clean and sharp
and perfect for airflow
a quick note as we pass the back on our
particular core i7 motherboard the
mounting holes don't quite line up now
this case was designed before Intel's
Core series went mainstream so the issue
is forgivable but it may cause a bit of
a headache a standout feature of the 932
is it's unprecedented water cooling
options it's large size and wide
interior allow for easy placement of
tubing and extras and as far as
radiators go there's a bunch of
different options you can place a single
radiator at the rear or depending on
your power supply placement you can fit
a dual 120 millimeter rad at the bottom
of the case or have one up at the top
either on the inside or outside now with
the name like half temperatures and
cooling are clearly the focus so we had
to put this case to the test and that
wraps up our look at the cooler master
1/2 932 AMD edition now because nothing
has really changed with a basic layout
of the case all the original pros and
cons still apply the cooling and air
flow is still superb and relatively
quiet even with the loss of a giant fan
the construction is excellent and
Coolermaster has designed an interior
layout that sets the bar for water
cooling and usability and we still
lament the lack of dust filters and
unfortunately the rest of the downsides
all revolve around the look so here's my
take when it comes down to it a limited
edition promotional item should be
something unique something special in
something that offers more than the rest
now I would imagine that someone who
would be interested in purchasing a
limited edition type of case wouldn't be
shy to spend the extra money to get
something special that really shows
itself off a little more time and a
little more investment would have been
well worth it to see some improvements
on things like a black interior and a
better quality and color of front panel
no to their credit the side panel design
is very eye-catching and well done it's
not just some cheap slap on sticker
ultimately I could be completely
off-base because in reality beauty is
all in the eyes of the beholder if you
like what AMD even cooler matte
have done with the case then you get the
almost famous benefits of the half nine
three two in a design that breaks the
mold of the other who knows how many
cases out there so thanks for checking
