connects and I'm here in Mike's house in
Montreal and we're actually working on a
fun little project I mean I really want
to thank him for inviting me over here
to work on it and help him out with that
but as you're probably aware the title
of this video it is build related and
it's an exciting one so why don't we
invite Mike here to talk about a little
bit more about that in this experience
and of course yeah just see how things
are Michael the last time you saw me was
actually probably sleeping on the couch
Computex yes I'll make sure to leave
that or probably the link is up here
somewhere over there but how are you
doing man
I'm very good I'm good we want to get
this build under ways yes so what has
been in your history like for your pc's
like what are you permanent primarily
using as your main system the history of
hardware canucks is that I do a lot of
the testing behind the scenes and then
sometimes I give the results to you
sometimes we give them to Dimitri
that means I have a lot of test systems
here yeah and I'm a practical guy so I
ended up using the test systems as my
own personal assistant okay right work
as an architect on a contract basis as
well so what ends up happening if
something goes wrong with that system I
sometimes lose my project I lose time
that I'm spending on a different
professional career as I do the testing
so I wanted to get away from that but I
also wanted to sort of give us a little
bit of a challenge to see how we could
put together a relatively compact
high-performance system for myself with
components that I want to carry over
from my personal test system yeah and
also make sure that it's high powered
enough that I'm covered for both the
professional and gaming life that I also
lead yeah because he does gain - so just
in case if you didn't know what I have
time when you have the time so why don't
we take a look at the parts in the
components list right after this hello
I'm looking for some fans well are you
married uh yeah I have a ring what is
your favorite number I would say 3 do I
have the perfect fan for you this is the
new thermal tech ring trio 12 fans with
good static pressure for radiators it is
a beautiful frame with double side and
center ring illumination with soft and
super brights bill with razor chrome and
compatibility control it through your
smartphone the RGB plus software on the
PC
or Amazon Alexa well I'm gonna take
these home perhaps you should to check
them out in the description below
okay so let's not go over the components
for this bill starting off with the CPU
so with that we decided to go with the
core I $9.99 ATX II the most expensive
CPU that Intel can offer for the
enthusiast platform so Mike can you can
you explain to me why you decided to go
with this be the CPU well for me the
decision was easy because a we had it on
hand from testing okay let's be honest
we don't recommend this i9 processor for
gamers or even for enthusiasts because
there with the solder Tim it actually
gets hotter under overclocking so the
amount of headroom is really limited but
for my use so where where I need a ton
of threads a ton of cores is in my
rendering so in the professional side so
with that 36 threads I'm ripping through
renders in some cases even faster than
CUDA can accomplish them for example in
v-ray and in blender as well at least in
some areas I'm actually seeing better
performance with this CPU than I am with
an RT x-series car now so the other
thing that I really wanted to do in a
little bit disappointed that I couldn't
is you thread Ripper
I was hoping that asrock at some point
in time nude do something crazy and
release a thread Ripper ITX board yeah
but that's that's not gonna happen
because the socket by itself takes the
entire board so exactly we were looking
into that yeah so I guess that leads us
to the motherboard we decided to go with
as rocks X 299 ITX and this is a really
interesting motherboard just for the
fact that it's ITX and it's extra 9 but
it's the features at this board packs so
for starters it's got three MDOT to nvme
slots which is which are PCI gen3
two of which are located on the back and
then you have another one that's kind of
located it's it's a dim kind of it's
it's a dim slot application right it
looks like it did it looks like a dinner
so you just pops into the motherboard
and you've got six SATA 6 gigabits per
second ports it's got support for
Quantrell memory the only drawback for
that is that it can only support soda
memory and if you look at soda memory
prices it's ridiculous expensive we
didn't really have a choice yeah because
this asrock where is the only X 299
ITX board on the market that's right
that's right so the next thing i want to
talk about is VRMs because obviously we
are planning on doing a little bit of
overclocking to see if it'd be arms are
capable of doing that but it's it's
gonna be interesting to see how cooling
takes place or just how well this board
can handle an 18 core monster now
speaking of memory we chose G skills rib
jaws sodium a quad shell memory kit
clocked at 3800 megahertz it's pretty
fast for its size moving on to the GPU
Auriga x20 atti i know it's an RT x
series card but it is also the fastest
card on the market and from a personal
perspective I have found not only does
it play games at super high frame rates
but it the extra CUDA cores or the GTX
1080 T I really do help with certain
applications that I use on a daily basis
to do rendering not to mention if you're
using programs like octane those those
CUDA cores can come in really beneficial
if you have plans to go with another
r-tx card to compensate for that
green logo so what did you so I really
really wanted to use this so gigabyte
sent this over a couple weeks ago we are
going to do a review on it and this is
the RT X xx atti from Oris its massive I
don't know if this is actually gonna fit
in the case that I chose so speaking of
the case Ebert you like this case I love
this case it's the NZXT CH 200 Mini ITX
case it's it's just compact its
minimalistic its simple is cute a good
word to use I don't think so but there
were a couple of comments that we got
when we posted a picture of this case on
both Twitter and on Instagram yeah it's
it's an m-80 exercise case why are you
using this for an ITX system and the
reason for that is pretty simple we want
to maximize airflow and there's so few
ITX cases on the market right now that
can allow for dual 120 millimeter intake
fans and also 120 millimeter top and
exhaust fans so because of the amount of
power that we're putting into this case
I wanted to make sure that there was
adequate air flow so to balance the size
versus air flow this is what I want was
Plus
it's that really nice black and blue
color that I wanted yeah now you talked
about carrying over some components from
your test bench towards your main
workstation PC yeah
whatever exactly are those so there's a
couple things the the first thing that I
really wanted to look at was storage I
didn't see the need to update my storage
solution I just wanted to bring it over
it's already on annex 299 system right
now so there was the samsung 960 512
gigabyte that i ended up bringing over
and there was also it's a little bit of
an older drive but the Intel 730 series
SSD for 80 gigabytes those are also
probably gonna be the first things that
I'm gonna update not necessarily on the
OS drive but on my Steam library Drive
I'm probably gonna start needing more
space there's also the Corsair ax 1200
watt power supply which I'm not which
I'm not sure is gonna fit in this case
technically according to Adams NXT it
will but it's an extremely large power
supply but it's a thousand Twitter watts
which is a little bit of overkill but I
had it on hand yeah it's 80 plus gold I
didn't see I need to update it so we're
gonna try to make it fit if not we're
sort of screwed because we don't have
another person that's right all right I
think the last thing to cover here is of
course the cooling solution for the
processor so we decided to go with an AI
you quoted from NZXT it's the X 52 to 40
minute cooling solution we're gonna
experiment on this thing so we're gonna
go with an AI of cooler see what the
temperatures I like and if we're not
happy with it
we will definitely switch to an air core
and see if that actually improves which
I'm sure would be interesting to look at
or possibly a custom loop so finally a
custom loop sometime in the future so
let's get to building min let's do it
alright guys so here is the final build
as you can see it looks absolutely
beautiful and cute I mean look at how
small that Bane's it's just I want one
so bad now but but anyways like what do
you what are you thoughts in this build
are you happy with the way it turned out
it was a challenge it was probably the
most challenging build and that's what
we wanted to do right we wanted to give
ourselves a challenge the worst
challenge was actually connecting those
cables because since given how small the
motherboard is and given I mean either
obviously had to make some compromises
when it comes to placing those you know
fan headers and stuff like that it was
really difficult I mean my hands
wouldn't work because I have big hands
but we needed my Pistons reach those
little spots there to connect those
cables so all I wanted was a simple look
with maybe a couple little splashes of
that blue color that I loved so much and
in addition to that we had some problems
with the amount of fans that were
running in here so we're running four
fans that's right and there wasn't
enough headers on the asrock motherboard
for that so we need to use one fan
splitter I know at the beginning of the
video that we actually said that we
would be using the founders Edition
that's right but I did try to fit this
into the case and because of the
proximity between that ITX PCIe slot and
where the power supply shroud is this
thing wouldn't fit because it is higher
than three slots it's almost like 3.25
slot yeah and that's just not gonna cut
it exactly but to mention also on the H
200 case if you want to do a two point
five slot graphics card that causes a
problem to because it's so close to that
shroud it's just gonna completely choke
it out yeah so we end up going at the
founders Edition because from a twenty
eight ETI perspective it's actually the
slimmest card out there it's only two
slots alright umm so should begin to
performance performance and acoustics
and acoustics
now moving on to temperatures we were
both expecting them to be much higher
than this especially during a hybrid CPU
and GPU render in v-ray which really
stresses the entire system even the
acoustics under load were really good at
around 39 decibels of where Mike sits
and as for overclocking we were only
able to achieve around 200 megahertz
higher since the temperatures on the
VRMs and CPU core became a problem
so we reverted back to Intel stock
settings so now that you've taken a look
at the benchmarks okay I think it's time
to wrap up our thoughts on this build so
Michael what are your final thoughts to
me what's the next evolution to this
build so first of all as we were running
the benchmarks and I was using a couple
of programs that are used on a daily
basis and gaming I realized that it's
actually a little bit more than I need
so the the next couple of steps I do
need to upgrade my storage game
especially as we get into 4k more 4k and
8k video rendering I get into high
resolution projects on a rendering basis
and these game files keep on getting
bigger and bigger so I'm gonna start
looking into that I've got a couple of
ideas primarily because we set it up to
look this way but the Intel 730 with the
little skull look on there yeah it I
thought it was gonna look relatively
cool but I think it takes away from the
whole blue and black color scheme
improve your workflow it's stream deck
mini by Elgato giving you six fully
customizable LCD keys for macro commands
hotkeys app launches media control and
the full array customization for OBS
Twitch xsplit and more check out the
stream deck mini down below so that
pretty much wraps up this build hope you
guys enjoyed it let us know in the
comments down below what you think about
this build in fact if you're planning
out an ITX system what will be the
configuration like unlocked in your
thoughts as well
