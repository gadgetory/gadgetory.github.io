back to another heart attacks review the
phantom lineup from NZXT has seen some
major changes and additions for a great
variety of cases to choose from the new
phantom 530 revamps the original design
with a few extra key features that NZXT
has put forward this full towers
extremely competitive pricing at $130
will sure get many enthusiast builders
on board that is if you like the angular
design it still resembles the original
phantom but with a few extra curves and
multiple colors to choose from so let's
begin magnetic door reveals three five
and a quarter inch drive bays with a
very concealed reset button on the top
right the entire panel can easily be
removed to access a very fine dust
filter which is also removable and all
the front intake fans with a 200 Milner
fan included and support for dual 120
and 140 millimeter fans now while the
front mesh is large it's not high enough
and if you have dual 120mm air fans
installed the top fan is practically
blocked by the door this was a major
problem when the Phantom 820 and NZXT
really should reconsider the design for
front intake we do have additional dust
filters at the bottom which is always a
must for dust free interior at the top
left we get a fan controller and the
rear i/o LED switch on the other side
power button two USB 3 ports and audio
jacks the top mesh and design is very
similar to that of the front panel
although it doesn't have a dust filter
it is however very tall allowing you to
install fans above the frame which is
awesome for push and pull water cooling
the position of the rear exhaust fan is
adjustable up and down in case you
require a little extra clearance between
your top rod we also have tubing holes
and eight PCI expansion slots the side
panel has the usual angular side window
and now they've added a mesh for
additional intake to cool your drives
and deliver extra air for your GPU it is
unfiltered and I would have much rather
preferred a clean side panel without any
fans getting inside though we find very
familiar scene to what we've come to
expect from NZXT
they sure know how to design a spacious
interior with many user preferred
options like installing a fan on the
angular bracket for more
direct airflow removing all drive cages
or just the ones that are not used and
the Phantom lineup has particularly been
popular for its water cooling
capabilities as removing the drive cage
base we get clearance for a 240
millimeter radiator just make sure your
power supply is 160 millimeters in
length or shorter
of course repositioning your 240 mm in
rat to the front is also possible but
that of course gets rid of all the drive
cages setting up water cooling at the
top of the case is an option with
support for three sixty millimeter rad
but that means sacrificing the top
optical slot coming around to the back
ends XT has done an excellent job for
cable management with quality rubber
grommets and fan hub for 10 fans and
just so much room to work with that
simplifies your assembly process they've
also reinforced the drive caddies that
no longer just snap and they are too
loose so just pop the drive in place and
you're good to go we have an additional
SSD bracket that is easily removable and
just an excellent spot to mount an extra
SSD so beginning with the assembly it is
- no surprise the Phantom 530 is a
breeze to work in installing our GTX 590
and an ATX motherboard you get an idea
of how much room we have to work with 12
inch cards will fit just fine with the
cage installed and we get about two and
a half inches of clearance between the
top and the memory modules this of
course will vary based on your
motherboard but it is enough spacing for
a push and pull water cooling setup
coming around all the wiring is secured
to the back of the motherboard really no
complaints of working with a phantom 530
so this case is undoubtedly well
designed inside and out with a slight
more elegant appeal yet still
maintaining that angular design that
we've come to expect from NZXT we have
plenty of airflow and water cooling
options that opens up many possibilities
module drive changes and just an
excellent system for cable routing and
the entire package for one hundred and
thirty dollars is a great value for what
you get of course no matter how
enthusiasts prove this case maybe we
think the front mesh and take is a
little bit too small to allow optimal
airflow and you would like that changed
and I'm sure many will agree with us but
the side panel fan mount is going to be
underutilized so having just a simple
panel window would make the case more
aesthetically pleasing also the Phantom
530 is not released until September
which is a long wait for anyone
looking to get the case but it sure is
an all-in-one package and we're giving
in the harbor Canucks damn good and damn
good value or word so thanks guys for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
