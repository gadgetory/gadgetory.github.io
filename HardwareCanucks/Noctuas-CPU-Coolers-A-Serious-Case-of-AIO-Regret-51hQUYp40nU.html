this could be you every time you turn on
your PC super-chill CPU happy you
crackin x61
ye NZXT purchase discount in the
description below a few weeks back I did
a video talking about my experience
upgrading my systems basic air cooler to
an all-in-one liquid cooler it wasn't
really meant to be a real review but
many of you brought some real good
questions for example even though the
$120 master liquid pro tip 40 provided
excellent temperatures and decent
acoustics the price difference compared
to the $40.00 hyper tootle evo had many
wondering about less expensive upgrade
solutions not to us lineup was brought
up again and again based on those
observations I decided to make a
follow-up video and of course I reached
out to Noctua to see what they could
provide a lot of you guys were
suggesting has to compare this AIO to
the knocked or d15 since that would be a
fair comparison when you take the price
to performance ratio into account we
also decided to throw in two more
coolers from Noctua with varying price
points to give a good comparison now
before I move on I need to get this off
my chest the purpose of that video was
to give you a rough idea of whether or
not if it was worth upgrading to an
all-in-one cooling solution generally
speaking newcomers to the high-level PC
cooling tend to go for a IO coolers
these days that may sound odd
considering these cooling solutions do
look a bit intimidating but they have
some notable benefits as well unlike
large air coolers a iOS tend to offer a
broader memory compatibility and don't
have several pounds of heatsink mass
hanging off your motherboard I'll be
covering some of this a bit later a iOS
also provide the best performance which
is why at one point or another in the
past both AMD and Intel we're offering
closed-loop liquid coolers for their
high-end processors trust me when I
started building computers I was always
approaching AIO all the time and
experience has taught me well with that
said let's start with not to us big boy
in the nhd 15 this is one of the largest
coolers on the market includes two NFA
15 fans and retails for around $100 when
it's not on sale when compared to the a
i/o motherboard compatibility will
definitely be harder challenge since the
D 15
is both long and very wide it is also
just as expensive as some dual Bay
liquid coolers that means it will
overhang the memory slots and some
motherboards PWM heat sinks and in some
cases it could even block the top most
PCI slot I'd highly recommend you check
out not to us handy list that shows
which Mobile's it can be used for before
looking at this massive cooler moving on
to the $90 D 15s and I have to say I'm
intrigued this cooler is a high
compatibility version of the D 15 it
uses a unique offset asymmetrical layout
and it's single NF a 15 fan compared to
the dual fan setup found on the D 15 it
is still massive when compared to an AI
a water block but the UMP set design
means that there shouldn't be any
clearance issues with any PCI slots and
the single fan layout means less
problems with memory and motherboard
component clearance do note that you can
mount a second fan but that comes with
an additional cost if you prefer a
relatively small and compact yet still
high performance CPU heatsink the Nhu
14s might be a solid choice priced at
$80 this has become the go-to choice for
premium quiet CPU coolers its design is
a basic tower layout and it comes
equipped with a single and F a 15 fan
though another one can be added
I can't wait to test it out against its
Berg of others and as you can imagine
the u14 SS compatibility with
motherboards is much broader given its
smaller footprint but depending on your
board there may be some RAM height
restrictions since the single fan could
overhang the right-hand slots other than
compatibility another thing that some
people think is that installing an
all-in-one liquid cooler is easier than
most air coolers that may be true in
some cases but not too as mounting
process was by far the easiest I have
seen on any cooler yet this also
includes the a IO coolers I've come
across so far all not two coolers share
the same mounting secure forum mechanism
first used all the IBT two bolts on the
socket 2011 board then put the mounting
bars on them you can align the coolers
either for horizontal or vertical
airflow I decided to opt for horizontal
since that would suit the airflow inside
my case the next step is to apply the
included thermal paste and finally
install the ginormous heatsink onto the
CPU and screw it to the screw hands of
the mounting bars mounting these onto
Intel socket
11:51 boards follow the same process but
you will need to install knock to us
include backplate first I did have some
trouble mounting the second fan on the D
15 due to the height of my ram sticks
but that was expected the other two
coolers installation went off without
any problems so without any further
delay why don't we check out some
numbers and see how these large air
coolers compare to my original hyper 212
evo and the master liquid pro 240 I used
Ida 64 to monitor the CPU Thames and the
sine panel open and closed and the
results were interesting with the side
panel open the a IO outperformed all
during idle situations but the D 15 was
neck to neck with the pro 240 under load
I did set the fan speed profile to
standard but if you blast them off I'm
sure you'll get better temperatures the
D 15s hangs on quite well too which is
great to see given its broader
compatibility what surprised me the most
was the performance from the U 14s and I
can explain that
even with the 49 30 K overclocked at
4.15 Hertz at one point 40 volts the
chip wasn't producing that much heat and
I think that the D 15 is an overkill for
myself now if I were to throw these
coolers on a harder running CPU these
results may take a quick turn and if
you're interested in those results let
us know in the comments down below
switching to the close case scenario the
results shifted a little bit the pro 240
struggled a bit and ended up between the
212 Evo and the u 14 s whereas the D 15
ran four degrees cooler than the e io
with the D 15 s very close behind again
that's amazing the case of choice can
also affect your CPU cooling performance
if you noticed I was using the Enfield
locks case to test the hyper 212 Evo and
the pro 240 in my previous video but
recently I made the switch to the Evolve
ATX tempered glass Edition and apart
from the physical attractiveness of this
case what I appreciate about it is its
massive room inside the chassis for
increased airflow there are no drive
cages restricting the air coming from
the front intake vents which is awesome
so I ended up testing all five coolers
inside this case and the results do
speak for themselves
both the 212 Evo and the pro 2 for you
run a few degrees Celsius cooler when
installed inside the Evolve ATX case
let's move on to acoustics
I actually expected these results some
but not all air coolers can offer better
acoustics since their fans are the only
components making noise whereas
switching to an AI oh you'll have to
consider the pump noise along with the
fans
the Noctor coolers all sounded similar
but they're dead quiet even with their
low nose adapters installed you won't
notice a huge difference between them so
which coolers should you buy it depends
on your current scenario if you're on a
tiny budget and air cooler would be the
best option I would recommend the two
total Evo or even the Nhu 14s
considering their budget-friendly price
points and the fact that they don't have
nearly the same amount of compatibility
constraints as the larger heat sinks the
D 15 and the D 15s are really targeted
towards enthusiasts as viable
alternatives to the a iOS not to mention
they performed outstandingly well but it
also depends on whether or not if you
have the proper space to fit one of
these guys there's also no way you're
going to install these on a micro ATX or
me ITX motherboard this is probably
where the AIO comes into play sure
they're expensive but with a low-profile
CPU pump and a relatively efficient
radiator this could be an alternative
option now as for me am i sorry I chose
the cooler master a IO for my system
instead of one of these Noctua coolers
not at all however I'm really happy
about your comments that open my eyes
towards some of these alternatives these
nocte coolers really are something so
which one of these coolers would you
pick or are there any alternatives that
you might be interested in I'm also
curious to know what CPU coolers you
guys are rocking and if you have any
suggestions definitely leave a comment
