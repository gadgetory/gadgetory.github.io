cables yes you do custom braided cables
just got more custom with the keel mod
configurator first select either the
full power supply cables or custom
extensions your choice of cables leaving
either mod flex or mod mesh with the
latter one using nylon sleeving which is
more vibrant in color but a little bit
more stiff with mod flex being very
flexible but less vibrancy cable mod
supports eight power supply brands then
you find your model then add all the
cables you'd need for your build with
custom links as well and I decided to
stick with the basics and here's the
best part
configure the color per cable so your
color scheme is on point
link in the description to create your
own cable mod custom cables goodbye all
cable hello new cable hello everyone I'm
Dmitry with her rockin axe welcome to
another video review so my excitement
level for the new be quiet enclosure
behind it was a pretty new level since
they're silent base series gave nothing
interesting frame wise and a feel
they've gone back to the drawing board
to release something truly unique this
is the dark base 900
so to start off we have two variants the
dark bass 900 and the pro version with
the $50 price Delta between the two
which gets you one tempered glass side
panel which is almost like a standard
for premium cases now and it's very
happy to see that here then this is the
first time ever that we see a wireless
charger dock or a Qi charger built into
the enclosure this is so awesome place
your compatible smartphone on top of the
case to begin wireless charging and then
the final difference is a small add-on
to the control fan hub plus two solid
LED strips that connect to the hub as
well and we'll cover them later now in
the general scheme of things the price
point is not competitive at all and I
kind of see why since there exists no
direct competition for the dark bass 900
at the moment orange silver and black
are the color options with distinct
accents on the exterior and on the
inside as well and the case form wise to
me feels modern yet still carries sort
of a bit quiet aesthetic but I wish more
companies would choose sandblasted
aluminum surface / brushed aluminum as
that gets slapped with fingerprints
super quickly and it's so annoying to
clean the power button is illuminated
with the same color accent as your
version of the case decided our 4 USB
ports audio and the recent button and
hidden behind the panel is an LED switch
to cycle between five colors this is for
the pro version only they are super easy
to install and plug into the hub this
slider beside it is the fan speed
control that is available on all models
orientation of this front panel can be
switched to open from the other side it
has thick noise dampening layer on the
inside and the entire panel is really
heavy that it doesn't really stay closed
if you swing the case around I know I'm
showing you almost like an extreme
example but just be mindful of that the
dust filter is dense but since you can
mount a triple 140 or 120mm fans at the
front the top portion will be unfiltered
the dual 140 millimeter fans included
here are silent wings 3 their quality
fans and right below is a filter
spanning the entire bottom of the case
no need to reach from the back
everything
accessible and the front now the
interesting part about the frame is it's
fully enclosed so at the bottom with
tall feet lifting in case off the
surface while being carpet friendly
since ventilation is on the sides the
top of the case is also fully enclosed
with small ventilation openings near the
back but it's high enough to let the
side ventilation do the trick as well so
here you can mount for 120 member fans
or 3 140 millimeter fans and up to a 420
millimeter radiator same thing in the
front and I the only thing that I would
complain about here are the centered
mounting positions but that is the only
option while also supporting an inverted
motherboard layout we'll get to that in
a little bit
140 n√∫mero fan is included at the rear
with 8 PCI slots and this interesting
division at the bottom with 3 panels and
you'll be surprised to see what they're
for
later the opposite side panel is solid
not a fan of the text here but the
screws are attached so you don't lose
them and you can mount to 120 member
fans which have their own dust filter by
spacing out the exterior plate while
blocking the noise now fans can only be
installed with this panel when this
panel is on the main motherboard side
otherwise there is no clearance behind
the motherboard tray now before I show
you what's so special about the layout
here is the interior it's a pretty basic
ATX layout notice the bright orange
rubber pieces and an open motherboard
tray below and above there are seven
individual drive cages that are fully
metal they're spaced out from each other
and also have full ventilation through
this is perhaps not the most efficient
use of all this material but the modular
aspect lets you keep and remove whatever
you need and each caddy is secured with
three thumb screws at the back with no
bending visible it can fit doulas as
these or a single hard drive and the
thumb screws to stay out of the way
except for that top SSD if a 90-degree
SATA data cable is used so now on to the
most special characteristics of this
case the modular interior frame now
important screws on the motherboard tray
sit inside these rubber grommets that
prevent vibrations and also
make them easily to find so they're
nicely visible for you you can remove
the drive cage wall the dual optical Bay
and the main hardware board to invert
the system but first the motherboard
tray has three positions top medium and
low to allow extra high clearance for
thicker radiators or push-pull setups at
the top position and this is where those
ventilated pieces are used to fill in
now the open area of the back of the
case it's a pretty brilliant design now
you may be looking at this short area
behind the power supply wondering what
effect it has on the interior and so the
power supply is installed on a bracket
that is spaced out from the back so the
motherboard can fit into that space
there and we have three length positions
available for the power supply with the
motherboard tray in its lowest spot we
lose to bottom PCI slots this is great
for micro ATX boards but even with full
ATX setups spacing between the power
supply and the motherboard is enough to
route your i/o and USB cables for
example the main advantage here is that
height flexibility without compromising
on anything on the interior aside from
losing access to those two PCI slots and
also the second advantage is the option
for an inverted system so you rotate and
flip the motherboard tray and the same
goes for the hard drive wall and here's
where I stumbled into a little bit of a
problem
now since this side originally for the
pro version holds the glass panel
there's a sticker that prevents that
metal to glass contact and behind it are
all the necessary holes for proper
mounting and this kind of sucks because
this sticker is not totally reusable and
no additional pads are included if you
were to mount the window on the other
side so all you do is remove the longer
pegs that hold the glass in this
position and screw them on to the other
side to be able to mount the glass on
the other side it just sucks that you
have no additional pads and so this is
what the finished inverted layout looks
like when the GPUs at the top and the
CPU area at the bottom now having the
power supply stay at the bottom is
awesome to allow full utilization of
that top fan area for cooling so since
the motherboard is flipped we need to
move the
our supply on the opposite side but
notice even with our short 160
millimeter unit
it's almost spilling over into that fan
area and this is because the
pass-through cable is right behind the
power supply and we cannot move it back
even more but a simple rotation of that
modular piece at the bottom to the right
side frees up all that extra clearance
so I can move the unit back some more
and have total access to those bottom
fan slots this is a brilliant idea
however the mounting holes for those
fans are threaded keep that in mind with
no direct access from the bottom unless
you remove that part of the case which
you'll need to do for radiator
installation so moving on mounting the
motherboard outside of the case was nice
a little bit refreshing but
reinstallation of this entire part into
the case was challenging because of the
weight it needed to you know align
screws on both sides so I wouldn't
necessarily recommend it unless you're
inverting the system and finally I put
all my hardware inside decided to stick
to a standard layout because I don't
really like upside down text and here
are a few things that you notice
immediately because the top and bottom
portions are open due to the high
flexibility cables are more visible
meaning extra care is required when
cleaning things up especially around the
power supply area which you could clean
up more and I apologize for the mess but
when the back panel is on it helps to
hide that mess but you know what would
be great here a shroud a power supply
shroud is definitely missing here which
would be sweet one strange inclusion I
found here was this single grommet for
the hard drive area not sure how would
you use that properly but use it your
content and my drives are installed on
the bottom portion for easier cable
management which is definitely a strong
suit for the dark base nine-hundred
looking in the back there's plenty of
width here lots of cutouts and cable tie
hoops all around plus a whole bunch of
velcro straps that are included plus we
have an extra SSD bracket beside the hub
that on the pro version supports eight
fans with a pwm connector so back to the
interior I feel it's a little bit too
exposed if the interior is no
fully populated especially with those
opening rectangles above the drives and
the clearly visible cables around the
power supply and atop the motherboard
it's like a weird mixed feeling between
me wanting to either use all the drive
slots or taking them out completely one
thing you could do is place a reservoir
above the drives that would fill in that
spot and I feel this case has a lot of
potential for water cooling since we
have this new height flexibility and
inverted amount abort option and the
last thing on the agenda is being a be
quiet enclosure a sound test
and so as you heard the machine is
incredibly quiet and I had to boost the
sensitivity on the microphone and in
post-production so you get a reference
between on and off of the case but
remember that quiet comes through a
balance between hardware and case not
case only and so the dark bass 900 is a
true two-in-one enclosure with original
features and a desire to stand out and
we're giving it the higher conducts damn
innovative award now having said that
it's not perfect the user manual has
plenty of errors which are unacceptable
be quiet is aware of that especially
when you have to deal with you know how
to rotate the stuff and I had some
frustrating moments there but as an
overall assembly process I'm a pretty
happy camper this is that next level of
interior flexibility and this is exactly
what needed to be done to set an example
and so that concludes this review I'm
Dimitri with higher connects I hope you
enjoyed it let us know what you think
about the new dark bass 900 from be
quiet stay loud will hear you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
