behind them episode I'm gonna show you
what my office space looks like after a
whole week of production so you give me
an idea of where we started versus where
we'll be in the end this episode just
pre-plea saying that I am sorry about
your eyes and what you'll just see now
so as you can see it's a huge mess so in
this video we'll talk about how to
improve your space seeking off from this
to this or some variation of this ignore
the really messy background but here my
five tips on how you can improve your
space let's talk about that right after
this the Coolermaster m/s 120 brings an
affordable keyboard and mouse combo to
your gaming setup with mechanical like
switches and clicky feedback beautiful
RGB support with plenty of lighting
effects and a gaming mouse that is both
comfortable and has excellent tracking
check it out in the description below
alright so the number 1 is kind of a
given clean your space nobody likes a
dirty surface so get into a habit of
wiping down your desk at the end of each
week give your mouse by the fresh clean
and also don't forget the monitor
this also means putting a crap away
hiding anything that you won't need
immediately at all times and this
especially applies to me after some
major review projects in a week so the
office is like upside down and requires
this assembly and putting things back to
normal it's also very important that I
do this for my small space otherwise it
sucks out all the fun and with a clean
space you get more creative freedom less
irritation and annoyance with yourself
and this way it's totally manageable to
clean once again when it's a huge mess
in just a few days don't eat at your
space it's unhealthy if you have a
kitchen in there and having a beverage
is fine just don't forget coasters and
an old mouse mat works too number two is
decoys everyone needs a plan to fake a
real the add greenery regardless of the
season fake ones don't need to be
watered and therefore can be placed
anywhere you desire you might have
noticed that keep Fred on top of cases
and his bigger cousin Joe somewhere in
sight but more stationary I also collect
toy cars from special places that I
visited just for nice collection of
memories number three is lighting wow
this one's important so positioning you
that
near window if possible is very good
idea natural light is the best they'll
give you something to look into distance
as well which is an important exercise
for your eyes after you've been looking
at the screen for so long for artificial
lighting a desk lamp is a given not only
for ambient illumination but as a unique
piece in your space and I've listed some
of my favorite lamps that I found on
Amazon in the description below as you
can notice I have moved away from RGB
illumination because I perform more
simple setup but RGB light bulbs and RGB
LED strips are awesome to add color that
make everything in your space just pop
and I will link some options below which
leads us to the fourth point is color
coordination now I'm going with a simple
white and black color scheme this is all
IKEA
I know it's common but it's accessible
it's affordable and I like it my Phoenix
speakers are color matched accordingly
they are not gigantic in any way and the
LG monitor comes with a nice handsome
base to add a splash of color I do that
through my wallpaper that I changed from
day to night
so something warm is more pleasing
during the evening and cool during the
day plus my peripherals are set up to
sync to that color as well and number 5
the last thing on the list is cable
management
I'm actually pretty terrible with this
but of course we have wireless
peripherals there are plenty of good
mice out there wireless keyboards are
also becoming more available so aside
from stuffing everything into the Signum
underneath the desk you can use the
monitor to hold the keyboard cable you
can use a bungee for your mouse and
route little things under the case let's
not forget the magnetic NZXT puck that
is absolutely awesome for headphones as
long as you have in metal side panel on
your case and some form of sleeping to
collect everything behind the PC out of
sight is very helpful and if you're like
me and have a ton of little things
everywhere then enclosed surface area is
your friend I find these cupboards to be
more effective for storage than large
shelving units always stay charged with
linky power up power banks houston
gorgeous aluminum enclosure with dual
USB and type-c port with support to a
quick charge 3.0 to get two devices
recharged fast available up to twenty
thousand one hundred million power
capacities check them out in the
description below and all right so
another week starts on Monday and I'm
about to embark on building something
really
this be quite dark waste Pro 900 wide
edition because it fits perfectly with
the color scheme that I've settled here
so I'm very excited my unit is 1844 the
limited edition nice so subscribe to not
miss that and let me know how you keep
your own space good some what are some
of your main tips that you give to other
people who are about to build their own
setups or maybe you want to revamp
something hope this video has been
helpful I'm Dimitri and we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
