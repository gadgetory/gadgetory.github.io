taking a look at the Mini ITX version of
the very elegant 900 series from in win
this is the 901 and considering how
popular Mini ITX systems are becoming in
win is right in line with such offerings
Auto price it just under two hundred
dollars this is definitely a luxurious
buy now there's no denying this case is
gorgeous built out of full aluminum and
tempered tinted glass this is a perfect
fit with the contemporary space and
quality wise this is the closest thing
you can get to case labs the exterior
aluminum frame is all in one piece I
definitely would love to see more case
manufacturers pursuing this type of
emphasis of clean and modern designs now
we don't usually show the packaging but
because of the glass careful
consideration was given to preserve this
in one piece when it arrives to you with
thick padding and the protective curtain
over the case so damaging during
shipment is unlikely and yes you get a
grumpy mailman now like I said earlier
this is a mini ITX of vision of the 904
it looks practically identical but in a
smaller form and they have made some
changes to the internal layout for the
better because of the one-piece aluminum
the neither one has two rubber pads at
the bottom and thanks to very precise
build quality the chassis is very stable
the front element is completely solid
with only the logo peeking through so
all the connections have been moved to
the side with a pair of USB 3 ports
audio jacks and the power switch only so
no reset button here this open space
also serves as an intake where the
magnetic filter included the fan is
conveniently installed to a removable
bracket and while the design isn't the
most optimal for air flow you know don't
be expecting enthusiast level of cooling
here but I think in with managed to make
it work with the design the 901 does
support a slim optical drive and based
on users feedback they have modified
this chamber to be more open so you see
multiple cutouts and they have also
pre-installed the SATA cable onto this
chamber so it's just plug-and-play
without uncomfortable routing as we saw
on the nine
for anyone has also expanded the power
supply chamber for longer unit
compatibility and because of the
orientation that will actually help with
internal exhaust our 170 millimeter
power supply slides in no problem with
clearance to spare even at the top so
the fan isn't totally choked coming to
the rear this is by far the most
questionable design layout because
there's over two inches of clearance
between the IO panel and the exterior
aluminum but because there are no fan
mounts up top and only a 90 millimeter
rear fan slot this exterior aluminum
piece would allow for 120 millimeter
all-in-one water cooler to be installed
there are appropriate cutouts for tube
routing and while you still will have to
take off the cover every time you need
to plug something in or out you can
still have decent cooling as for CPU
tower clearance only 130 millimeters is
available so this external rear i/o is a
welcome feature the tinted glass panels
are only slightly see-through so I
definitely encourage some LED
installation they sit on rubber
standoffs and held in with low profile
thumb screws so it's very simple to take
off and get inside the case dry storage
is all located in one spot with two hot
swappable brackets plus two dedicated
two and a half inch brackets on either
side of the drive cage at the back you
can see appropriate cutouts for the two
SSDs although they could be slightly
larger for easier SATA connection the
hotspot wall carries do support either
drive but one annoying aspect of this
retractable hinge you can hear it
rattling and any vibration of the case
will be audible you can remove it but it
does help with extraction of the drives
I wish there were some rubber grommets
or something to prevent these things
from rattling the case will support 12
inch GPU so that's very appealing for
enthusiasts and I do appreciate sleeping
in all of the cables and turning the
case around it does show that England
has thought about cable management as we
have all the appropriate cable cutouts
and a very large CPU catalyst wall plus
there are holes for cable ties and a
pair of adhesive clamps that are
included with the accessories now
speaking of accessories there's also a
cleaning cloth for the glass so that's
always appreciated now while there's
only half an inch of clearance the
there is a hinge to tack away cables and
a fairly large opening throughout all
your power supply cables from the bottom
chamber and so here is the built
surprisingly it one's really well the
space and from the power supply allows
this type of cable concentration to
avoid spreading the cables too much
behind the motherboard and everything
connected just fine except the power and
the hard drive activity light cable it
wasn't long enough to be routed through
the top so it had to cross the
motherboard internally the GPU has some
clearance so it's not completely choked
but I did have issues with closing the
glass panel do to those sticking out
power cables luckily the power cables we
have here are low profile but that's
certainly something you have to take
into account if you consider this build
and looking in the back the case cleaned
up very well and I had no issues with
any routing plus everything is very
flushed of the case so there's no issues
with closing the panel and to finish up
the 9:01 follows the very same elegant
and clean design as it's bigger
counterpart without standing build
quality the power supply chamber has
been redesigned for better compatibility
and the included SATA cable for the
optical drive is a very welcome feature
I love the hot swappable drive base plus
the simple SSD brackets around there's
ample room for enthusiasts GPUs and
cable management poses are pretty
straightforward while cooling is limited
I still think they did a pretty good job
with what they got the bottom intake
will help GPU cooling and due to limited
CPU tower clearance and external 120
millimeter all-in-one is a decent option
now what I dislike under rattling hinges
on the hotspot hole drive caddies
they're an excellent consideration but
they've missed out to include the rubber
padding to avoid audible vibrations
which for $190 is a bit disappointing
overall though the 901 feels like a much
more polished enclosure compared to the
904 and a huge props to in wind for
listening to our concerns and modifying
the layout to be more functional I feel
it is much more space efficient and
although cooling water cooling are still
limited I think it achieves what it is
designed for perfectly and if you can
afford this damn good
art piece you won't be disappointed now
we know the price may seem inflated for
a mini ITX enclosure but you really get
what you pay for for just under $200 so
what do you think of the 901 putting
pricing aside when you consider building
one of these
