great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm doing tree with Hydra
Canucks and if you're looking to pimp
out your PC you've definitely come to
the right place so what you've got here
today to spice up your case or build as
a very convenient and simple to install
and control lighting system from NZXT
this is the hue plus it retails for 60
bucks which for a computer accessory may
seem a lot considering you can pick up a
full case for that much money but
looking at it from a different
perspective for any system which you
want to light up the hue plus offers
amazing customization so let's begin
physical tour first the hub is pretty
unique with half angular glossy plastic
very NZXT like to reflect lights and
other matte black side with the hue plus
text you would want to keep the glossy
part clean after installation as it
easily picks up all the handling marks
there's an ambient white LED that's only
visible in certain orientations which is
a good indication that the hub is
receiving power so if any of the lights
are not working it's a good starting
point to see if any of the cables have
popped out and zig ste has cleverly
designed the hue plus to be mounting
friendly so it's the same length and
width as a 2.5 inch drive with mounting
holes only in the bottom and it's
important to notice as some SSD brackets
only have side mounting screws so keep
that in mind but it will fit on pretty
much all hard drive caddies the hub is
also significantly thicker than a
standard SSD at about 23 millimeters
which means it will not fit in confined
spaces like side mounted SSD brackets or
even rear mounted brackets due to
thickness limitations of a case but
where it mounts beautifully is on the
power supply shroud like on this s3 40
which is clearly designed for it looks
fantastic
and given the 2 in half-inch form
I'm pretty sure you can figure out a
creative way to stash the hue plus
somewhere without interfering with any
of your drive slots for example if you
have a space on the side of the power
supply it is an awesome spot the i/o
consists of power in micro USB and dual
connection ports that will route the LED
strips in the package we receive four
LED strips plus all the needed cables
and accessories the LED strip itself is
colored in white it is 30 centimeters in
length and has 10 LEDs on each with the
NZXT logo in the center to help with
orientation on one of the ends we have a
four pin male connector and on the other
a four pin female connector with rubber
caps on each end there are a total of
four magnets on each strip they are
these silver rectangles and are pretty
strong with an added adhesive strip for
extra mounting strength which is more
permanent for cables we receive two of
50 centimeter connection cables that
connects to the hub one molex power one
internal microUSB that plugs into your
motherboard and grants you control of
the hue plus a set of extension cables
with various sizes and finally mounting
screws with cable ties now each of the
connection ends has an arrow assigned
for proper mounting orientation where
the white arrow must align with the
black edge line on the LED strip it's an
easy way to see and the physical
connection it's pretty strong but be
careful with the four pin ends as they
might Bend which can be gently pushed
back into place but thing is they're not
flexible and can easily be broken so
installation is next with a lighting
demo now keep in mind the added cable
management that comes with the hue plus
given the four cables that you have to
take care of
I found the cables to be adequate in
length you know they're long enough to
route anywhere on your case and also
short enough for the molix cable to not
add that much work to your cable work
already and even when mounted on the
side of my power supply if you simply
fold the unused lengths of the cables it
will look just fine the magnets on the
LED strips are fine they're pretty
strong but neither of the extension
cables are magnetic which will have been
great to minimize the cable work the
light itself though is fantastic it's
bright it's vibra
you can connect the strips to each other
directly or with the help of extensions
if you need that extra length but the
fun part begins when we enter the driver
software to really customize the
lighting effect that you want okay so
now on to the customization which I
think is the best part so it is
beautifully integrated into the camp
software you enter that through the camp
software click on dashboard to bring
down the drop-down menu into hue plus
entering that you are greeted with two
channels I'm pretty sure that maybe
further on will get more channels as the
hue plus evolves but here you can enable
or disable each channel which is pretty
cool if you want to highlight just one
side of the case and you have the visual
representation of how many LED strips
are attached to each Channel so
configuring LEDs this is my favorite
part
and I think NZXT has done a fantastic
job with making sure that you are have
the most customization with all these
presets so first the colors you have the
default colors and you can create
different profiles and you can rename
them to whatever you want
now I found that the colors within the
Box are not exactly accurate so for
example if I select something in the
middle here and I say click Save look
what popped up it's kind of a I don't
know it's more pink but it's not this
color so if you want the most accurate
colors go into the very corner of the
box and actually move the slider over
here so this way this is actually one
almost 100% color accuracy for example
right now Save Changes you see it's
fully red if you want more yellowish and
orange BAM it's very accurate something
more on the green side as you can see it
is very accurate to what you see on the
screen and what is actually displayed on
the LED so the next mode is breathing
which is pretty cool and I am happy to
say that it is actually a very smooth
transition and you can select the
different speeds as to which the
breathing won't go so fast this is this
and it's going to the slowest and just
notice the transition it's very smooth
there's no janky type of brightness
variance next is fading this is cool
because so let me show you what that
looks like so it fades from one color to
the next to the next you can add more
colors if you wish or you can remove
them by these X's and you can also move
them up and down depending on kind of
what type of color cycle you want and
this is very cool because you don't need
to remove it and add it you can simply
just move these added colors already and
it's pretty awesome so let's save
changes let me show you enough looks
like and you can notice the transition
is very smooth goes from one color to
the other and in colors kind of changes
the color in between and you know you
can create really cool effects in doing
so the next mode is mark U and this is
very cool so first of all you have mark
you color which is the movement color
and the background color right now it's
in black so you cannot see the
background color but if I change it to
something like white you can notice that
now the LEDs are lit up in white and
mark you color is the movement color and
let's see I want a nice red movement and
maybe let's do a blue so as you can see
it looks very cool you can select group
size of how many LEDs you can select the
speed and the direction so if you want
to be going forward it's gonna go like
that then looks very unique covering
mark you is next Save Changes so you can
see what that looks like so basically
more like a snake mode which is very
cool pulse is really awesome check this
out so kind of representing a heartbeat
of some sort you can change the color
obviously spectrum wave get ready and
here again you can change the speed and
the direction which is pretty cool and
you know if you are looking for this
total RGB sort of rainbow effect this is
included and next one or so the last one
is alternating Save Changes and you can
also select it too moving so that it
actually looks like the led
or in motion some other effects here is
smart so you can actually determine the
temperature of the GPU the CPU
temperature and also FPS mode just
pretty cool so for example my CPU
temperature right now is looks like in
the blue so below 40 s and you can also
change the color as you T CPU
temperatures rise custom profile is you
know you can select different ones you
can rename it so that there be included
if you have a preset created you can
select that and audio just uh so let me
save this and let me open up a video
file so you can see what that looks like
alright so this is cool because we have
an audio file playing and the color
cycle as you can see it's you can also
configure that but it's just a big party
going on inside your case which is
determined by the audio so right now
have a music track playing and it will
also do the same if regardless of
whatever audio that comes through if
it's a your playing game or music so I
hope you enjoyed this review as much as
I enjoyed making it and integrating it
into our sky like machine behind me
which you can watch in the description
below all the bed locks to parts very
awesome stuff but the NZXT Q+ really is
a fantastic entry into making sure that
it's as easy as possible and as easy to
configure so that you can make it true
truly your own I'm doing tree with hair
conducts thanks so much for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
