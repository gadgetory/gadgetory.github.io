hurricane axe CES is continuing and we
stopped at the HyperX suite to see some
impressive gaming headsets in their new
cloud orbit series there are supposed to
bring gaming audio to the next level but
speaking of next-level stuff razor
thermaltake fantex MSI and Corsair all
gums up for sponsoring this CES trip
without them we would not have been able
to bring you all this content
now while HyperX has been mainly focused
on delivering affordable headsets that
provide awesome value along with good
performance the cloud orbit series is
very different these are premium
products that incorporate advanced audio
features to deliver a more immersive
gaming experience at least that's what
HyperX claims we're all used to HyperX
handsets going for between 75 to about
$150 but the basic cloud orbit will be
going for around 300 dollars while the
more advanced orbit s costs 330 dollars
so a $30 premium you heard that right
these are two of the most expensive
gaming headsets on the market right now
but why does HyperX even think that they
can charge this much when even premium
gaming headsets from sennheiser go for
much less let's look at the orbit to put
things into perspective it's based on
the high end audism mobius which is
widely regarded as one of the best
sounding headsets around it uses 100
millimeter plain our magnetic drivers
and clothes backs to deliver an
incredibly realistic soundstage with a
frequency response of 10 Hertz to fifty
thousand Hertz in our short time
listening to them I can honestly say
that there are the moong the best
especially when it comes to
three-dimensional audio but I'm still
not sure about the price point the
microphone being used here is pretty
impressive too it is an electric
condenser mic with noise cancelling
capabilities which can be completely
detached in case you only want to use
the headset for listening to music
luckily the design doesn't scream gamer
either since the orbit series is wired
HyperX has made sure that they have all
the necessary detachable cables too so
there's a 1.2 meter 3.5 million cord and
since they use a standard USB type-c
connection both USB C 2 type A and C 2 C
cables are included which is nice but
what makes the orbit s $30 more
expensive well it incorporates something
called waves NX technology that supposed
to track your head movements to deliver
better positional audio that sounds
better than reality though
but you know from our experience it was
certainly interesting so for example I
got to try out the Senate channel mode
or Center 3d mode that basically you
know emulates a center channel speaker
in front of you and then as you move
your head towards the left and right
that position speaker at the center
would stay exactly where it is so you
get a nice dynamic shift between you
know moving your head around which is
actually quite an interesting experience
it doesn't replicate virtual 7.1
surround sound but it takes positional
awareness to a whole new level
I certainly have to spend some more time
with his headset so definitely stay
tuned for my full review it's more than
obvious that Odysseys partnership with
hyperox will get their technology into
more people's hands but the orbits price
point is just way too high we'll have to
see what happens I mean I might end up
comparing it to the actual Mobius so who
knows definitely stay tuned for that
another thing that HyperX showed was
their new quad cast standalone mic for
streamers on PC Xbox ps4 and Mac it
seems like everyone is releasing their
mics lately and it will be tough for
this one to distinguish itself although
I like a few features I'll get to in a
moment
the Quantcast does have anti vibration
shock mount and it also comes with an
adapter so if you were to buy a third
party arm that extends towards your
that's a little bit more flexible you
can just adapt this you can use this
adapter and mount it easily which is
pretty awesome it also comes with gain
control and a tap to mute function which
is pretty awesome and it actually lights
up in whren as soon as you hit the untap
button because it gives you a I guess a
realistic scenario as to whether or not
you're actually recording anything or
what people are hearing you so that's
pretty nice and of course there are four
selectable polar patterns I'm gonna
chime in Dimitri to test out the
microphone quality so you guys can get a
good idea of how this thing sounds so
let's go in here
alright guys so now let's actually hear
what the HyperX quad cast sounds like we
have on the bio directional pattern
recording so it's recording everything
from the front and the back isolating
things on the sides and yeah let me
press record so what you're hearing now
is that recorded by the HyperX quad cast
I'm in the very low sensitivity so let
me yeah boost that up a little bit and
so the gain on a microphone is very
helpful so you can come a bit closer if
you like to speak a bit quieter and go
the whole thing or you can move back a
bit to have a little bit distance
between microphone so it's
picks up your volume now it has noise
cancellation applied directly into the
microphone
it is driverless so it's plug-and-play
but the noise cancellation it's not too
aggressive but it's definitely audible
and so yeah let me know what you would
you think what sounds like I think it
sounds great has great condenser quality
to the microphone yeah the HyperX quad
caste lastly there's a price so the quad
caste microphone will go for around one
hundred and forty dollars so there you
guys have it a couple of interesting
things from HyperX what do you guys
think about both the orbit the orbit s
and of course the quad caste standalone
microphone from HyperX I'd love to know
your thoughts in the comments down below
stay tuned for more coverage from CES
2019 I mean or with Hydra connects thank
you so much watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
