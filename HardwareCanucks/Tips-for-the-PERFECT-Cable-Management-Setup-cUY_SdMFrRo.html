we're talking about my for easy cable
management tips so you can have your
system in nice and cool because remember
having good cable management don't only
will make your system look better for
when the ladies come over or the
gentlemen but you also have a cooler
system because there's no interference
on the interior with airflow and it also
allows for easier upgrades down the line
if you have to replace a drive or if you
have to swap out some cables having
things organized will make your life
easier down the road now I'm no master
but I've done my fair share of systems
so I applied the same techniques over
and over and they seem to work well for
me and they're not like the pristine
kind where each cable is individually
has its own channel but this is
primarily for to make sure that the
interior is looking fine and the back
panel can close without any force fred
is coming along for the entire ride so
let's begin right after this hi I'm
looking for a case well look no further
I got this beauty the H 700 by NZXT with
all steel premium frame with a side of
tempered glass - beautifully showcase
any cooling adventure you might pursue
and cable management system that you
wish you had earlier all this lit up
with integrated RGB lighting and
built-in fan control the Aged 700 I this
one's for you I'll take it all right so
let's begin by the way if you have not
seen our 15 tips on building computer
video make sure to check it out over
there
but first step for cable management
comes using your motherboard to conceal
cables this is something that I've been
doing for a while but now as
motherboards get a little bit more
complex in terms of their design and
like they have a lot more things kind of
on top of them it actually helps with
cable management so you can normally do
this with fan cables you can wrap them
around Ram slots cooler mounting the
heatsink and use the case cavities to
hold excess cables normally for the fan
cables and you can route smaller cables
below the larger ones to hide them and
to also hold them and some motherboard
components can also be good to route
cables around them to create this nice
controlled path this is superb and this
is super beneficial for like all the
coolers that have a thousand cables
purring out from the pump area and you
can easily route everything and I'll be
kind of worried about where all those
cables will go tip number two is to
route all your case default cables first
and this simplifies your cable work
afterwards so you basically want to
separate the USB versus the front IO
cables and working them individually so
the i/o cables because they're
individual little tiny cables it really
helps when they're contained first the
USB three below it's a super thick cable
I hate it and for it to stay flat at the
bottom you need to extend it a little
bit so that the cable can actually
create that nice seamless Bend the audio
cable can be channeled right across the
bottom of the motherboard so it doesn't
interfere with anything else and it can
be slightly tucked away underneath the
motherboard too and this way everything
is cleaned up and ready to go before the
big cables come in now one little trick
I do to compress all these front IO
cables which are individual and very
annoying the lazy way is to just
compress them with the slightly thicker
cable so I normally do it with a 24 pin
cable it saves you time and in the end
it looks just fine but the slightly less
lazy way is to simply just tuck them
underneath the slightly thicker cable
already before you populate all the
other power supply cables and this way
the thicker cables are on top so the
little ones are kind of you know
controlled and everything is already
flat before you populate other cables on
top of it
and I have done exactly that with my fan
cables for the AIO so there are three
fan cables coming underneath this
bracket and I think it's a really good
way to just hide them so nothing is
overshadowing here and the little
thicker cables for the four pins are
kind of underneath all the other thick
stuff and ya are being secured with the
velcros but normally you just have a
standard cable tie holding this entire
cable mess point number three are power
supplies and don't be afraid if you have
non modular power supplies because those
are just as easy to route in terms of
cables as modular units now for modular
units a self-explanatory you leave only
the needed cables and this way you
minimize the entire cable clutter but
for non modular units bunch up the
cables you know you will not be using so
there's less clutter when the key was
actually exit and this way it allows
that concentration of unused cables to
be contained with the power supply so
once the power supply is inserted it can
look intimidating with so many cables to
work on but working them one by one
first I route with my 8 pin and I hug
the side of the case and exit through
the cutout at the top sometimes I leave
the cable hugging the case throughout
the you know once it's going up but in
this case I decide to route it through
the center just to see if I can break up
the cable clutter and actually make it
look better the 24 pin cable is next
it's the biggest cable so you exit it
through the grommet that's closest to
the 24 pin connector you plug that in
and then pull back any unused length so
the interior is cleaner
of course the priority for us is the
interior and on majority of cases you
have this bottom lip beside the power
supply which usually gives you like at
least one or two fingers of clearance so
you can stuff anything unused in that
cavity and the GPU cable I don't mind
that we have no opening in the bottom so
sometimes you can route it from the
power supply shroud but it means that
the cables kind of sticking out from the
GPU like this sometimes looks good but I
actually preferred this whole side exit
and you just kind of have to make sure
to tighten it in the back so the cable
doesn't droop and doesn't reveal too
much of it on the interior because
priority is the cleanliness on the
interior and you can stash away and hide
things
behind the case so something something
like this is what I would set along and
now to tie the whole thing together we
need to secure those cables so majority
of cases arrive with at least a few zip
ties and these are awesome for larger
cables but you can also use standard
metal strings to hold the smaller cables
and they're also reusable so that's a
benefit but of course they don't look as
good as it's a time if your case has
velcro straps that's even better because
they are reusable and I secure cables
based on how they're routed and if I
have any zip tie points around so my 24
pin cable is kind of this anchor behind
the motherboard so I secure and route
many other cables underneath it so
they're held in place by the 24 pin
cable and then route the SATA power
underneath it and because it's flat I
just have to find the flat area around
the case so it's not going to be on an
angle that will prevent the side panel
from closing and also the SATA data
cable is very thin so you can easily
route that underneath any of the cables
for it to be kind of secured evenly in
that entire mess of or not mess but the
entire flock of cables now when using
zip ties sometimes you want to leave a
little bit of area in case you want to
pass maybe something else through it
before actually fully securing it to the
chassis and so my entire approach is
kind of having this big supporting 24
pin cable that holds everything in place
because I secure the 24 pin cable at the
bottom and at least at one point at the
top before it exits on to the interior
but of course you can take some more
time and route each cable individually
and seeing like if you place them beside
each other on how they fit within how
much space you have on enclosure but
majority of cases follow the structure
that I've been using on this new course
there are 500 D so it will apply to
basically any other modern case - and
one of the reasons why power supply
shrouds are so popular is because they
do have the job for you look at this
they cover up the entire cable exit from
the power supply and all you have to
worry about is the re-entry of cables
into the interior so what happens if
your power supply child is a bit more
exposed or you don't have one at all so
check it out the back I've used the
velcro strap that arrived with the power
supply and I collected all the cables so
that hole exit
doesn't look you know as cluttered and
so then I can do my standard cable work
around the back here but the most
important thing here because that's the
part that will be also visible is to
make sure that that stuff is under
control - also don't forget about the
rubber grommets because you can see
they're multi-layered part allowing you
to pass certain cables and so don't
forget to kind of cover up the little
rubber pieces on where the cable exits
so that we don't see what's behind the
cable sometimes you can reveal a little
bit too much so just make sure that all
the you know all the rubber flaps are
flat with the cable also most of the
time the power supply has a little gap
above it which is perfect for routing
USB cables from my all-in-one cooler
that are out from the top or if you have
an audio cable that you want to pass to
let's say a cutout that's near this side
of the case you can use that little area
to pass it so it doesn't have to occupy
anything over there now with examples
like these where we have so many
additional IO cables because this case
has a fan controller that needs power
that needs motherboard connector so all
these additional wires that can be
really frustrating to like you know
initially handle especially even if you
insert the power supply beforehand so
one thing to do is you can go step by
step by isolating make sure that your
routing just the i/o cables first then
your fan controller then your audio and
stuff of that and if you really get
frustrated getting sleeving
to kind of put it all into one and hide
it will definitely simplify that entire
queue of cables and make it look a lot
more appealing and while cases are
getting bigger and we have more area to
work with more case manufacturers need
to do what NZXT is doing in terms of
creating these plastic channel guides so
you can seamlessly you know route your
cables this way and nothing is kind of
like in the center everything has its
own dedicated channel and I think that's
brilliant and so that's my approach to
cable management I know it's kind of you
know simplified because I don't spend
too much time on it but I find that
having that anchor 24 pin cable holding
all the cables underneath it means that
if I have to swap out any hard
or replace the power supply it's the
actual replacement process is simplified
because only one cable has to be kind of
you know unsecured and you take
everything out now you may be thinking
that doing cable management and any
modern enclosure right now is simple and
yes you're right so I bought a 40 dollar
gaming case which has terrible cable
management and we'll go step-by-step on
how to deal with some challenging spaces
instead with both modular and non
modular power supplies for system so
stay tuned for that but I am no cable
management guru so let me know how you
do care management in the comments below

thanks much for watching I'm Dmitry and
will cable management you in the next
review totally did not mean for that to
rhyme alright see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
