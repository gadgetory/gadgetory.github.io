to another heart next review so as
tablets laptops and other portable
devices saturate the market it becomes
clear that too much choice is sometimes
overwhelming so in the past six months
we've seen this merge between your
conventional tablets and conventional
laptops to complement this desire for a
touch interface with this form factor
that we're so used to so today we're
looking at the series 5 Ultrabook from
Samsung it's light it portable it's
compact and it's also touch now the
series 5 is priced around $1,100
so it's not your most budget-friendly
product but considering this is an
ultrabook it is priced competitively
based on what's out there on the market
so the Ola loom instruction feels
extremely sturdy there's absolutely no
flex in the frame and you'll definitely
appreciate the craftsmanship on this
laptop so the samsung series 5 is not
your lightest giving the block waiting
about 3.8 pounds but it is definitely
thinner and lighter than your
conventional laptops and apparently it's
also thinner than my phone that's
embarrassing
so the samsung series 5 comes in gray
which is an excellent color because it
actually conceals all your fingerprints
on this aluminum casing now on the left
side is the power plug ethernet port USB
3 full size HDMI port combined audio
jack and a VGA port on the other side
two more USB ports and SD card slot so
the samsung series 5 is not a weak link
nor is it a desktop replacement it does
feature a third gen dual core i5 a gigs
of RAM and 128 gigabyte SSD now it does
provide a good balance between
performance and battery life which is
exactly what we want to see in an
ultrabook
now this isn't a gaming laptop so don't
be expecting miracles out of the HD 4000
graphics card but hey I know for 1080p
playback for video and desktop
experience is pretty flawless now we
also have a tube remote enabled for the
CPU where it is only allowed for high
performance mode while it is plugged in
for charging which boosts your CPU from
1.7 to 2.6 gigahertz so you get a nice
little boost for
all your multitasking and things like
that so the Ultrabook is actually very
silent even at high performance mode you
practically don't hear anything coming
out of this which is an excellent thing
now our ultrabook came with 94 gigabyte
SSD now we know that the real drive
capacity is always going to be lower
than advertised
so the advertiser is 128 so where did 30
gigabytes go no user is going to be
happy about losing 30 gigabytes just
like that
considering Windows 8 takes up 20% of
the drive capacity that's included with
the Ultrabook now what differentiates
this series 5 Ultrabook is the fact that
you can replace your SSD and memory
without voiding your warranty it's super
easy to do as well simple screw lift up
the cover and you're good to go
now given the SanDisk SSD that arrives
here is slightly lower capacity and
perhaps not as fast as you'd like giving
us this option for upgrade ability in
the future is an excellent excellent
choice so now notice there's not much
exhaust for this Ultrabook the only
exhaust is at the bottom here which is
good will keep you warm during winter
but during the summer it's not a very
good idea here and this being on your
lap it will get quite warm now because
the laptop gets quite warm you have to
think of creative ways of holding the
laptop so one of them is you know like
this exercising your fingers or the
other one you know going for the typical
touch screen experience now all your LED
indicators are located here at the front
notice there is no caps lock indicator
so you'll definitely be frustrated in
case you cannot login into anything and
get blocked out of your bank account
because you cannot remember or cannot
type in the correct password so this is
a major drawback for for them to exclude
such minor detail now notice when we
open the Ultrabook first thing you see
is a very tiny bezel which is excellent
to see on a small form-factor like this
it's also touchscreen and the resolution
isn't all is a bit on the low end but
the 1080p ultrabooks go for quite a bit
more cache we also have a 1.3 megapixel
camera up above here and this is a very
much touchscreen display supports 10
fingers simultaneously and it has a nice
touch feel so there's no stuttering even
if you have slightly
fingers when comes to viewing angles the
screen holds up pretty strong throughout
the entire range it's only when you look
at from the bottom the contrast drops
significantly so you can't see much but
looking at from above and from the sides
it is actually a really good screen now
the Dutch interface for the most part
works really well it's actually a pretty
interesting experience having your
trackpad and the touch screen as well to
complement your work while you're go
about your business on the desktop for
example closing windows moving the
windows around clicking on apps is
extremely easy however we did experience
unresponsive touch screen after wakeup
and that's completely unacceptable for a
product this caliber
now complementing this touch interface
is the trackpad we have physical left
and right clicks a very smooth cursor
navigation however the only thing that
we really don't like about trackpad is
that Windows eight fingers gestures so
like two fingers scrolling revealing the
clock never works but luckily we have a
touch screen for that now of course
because it is touchscreen you will have
to clean the screen multiple times
because finger prints and will get dirty
now when it comes to the keyboard the
series 5 features an impressive set of
keys first they have very responsive
bounce
they have really tactile feedback as
well and they actually feel a little bit
mechanical the only downside to this
keyboard is that there's no backlight so
it makes working in darker environments
really difficult so the samsung series 5
comes with a pretty impressive set of
speakers these are 4 watt speakers
stereo the speaker is located right
underneath the screen so audio
projection is good none of that stuff at
the bottom which muffles the sound once
it's on your lap they are a little flat
though from the very beginning from the
default but don't be afraid to play
around with the equalizer to boost up
your settings and to improve your audio
quality and what comes to battery life
we're able to get about 5 and a half
hours of battery life for regular
browsing this is a balanced mode at full
brightness with only 2 to 3 hours during
generic benchmarks some performance wise
running 3dmark
PC mark are quite low as the series 5
does not have a dedicated GPU but yet
again this is not gaming Ultrabook but
designed for portable productivity and
multi
so the series 5 is a very compact system
with a solid build quality where touch
interface complements the overall user
experience with an excellent keyboard
and trackpad the ability to swap the SSD
and RAM without voiding your warranty
and a decent battery life that makes the
series v worthy of a consideration
however unresponsive touchscreen issues
with the trackpad gestures missing caps
lock indicator no backlight for the
keyboard and for exhaust placement make
the series v a bit of a disappointment
just too many small things that add up
that make you question the price and
perhaps make you look elsewhere so
