for you here today at CES 2017 and I
want to get right into it this is razors
project Valerie and like all of razors
innovations from the last few years it
may be way out of there in terms of
presentation but man does it ever look
cool I remember the switchblade project
Fiona and the edge once again blazer is
taking things to the next level with
something that has been under
development for almost two years the
show coverage is possible thanks to
Nvidia gigabyte phanteks and NCIX this
is actually the world's first laptop
with not one not two but three built-in
screens now remember this is just a
demonstration prototype but Valerie may
end up ushering in a new era of
on-the-go productivity Valerie started
off as a regular high-end blade pro
professional 17 inch laptop Razer then
added a proprietary automatic deployment
mechanism that allows each of these side
panels to gracefully slide out of its
housing onto an open position these
hinges are industrial design brought to
the next level they deploy on an
automatic mechanism that will likely be
software-controlled so the angles can be
modified meanwhile if you are in a space
constrained area like an airplane or in
a classroom the single monitor will
function perfectly by itself without the
others opening like flanking parachutes
now taking a look at those monitors wait
till you hear what they are packing each
uses a 17.3 inch 4k int'l panel with
100-percent RGB color spectrum
reproduction and 180 degree viewing
angle not only that but the entire setup
is back stop by nvidia surround
technology and support 4g sync even
though project Valerie uses a thin blade
pro as its starting platform some weight
and size sacrifices had to be made for
those three pancakes 17 inch screens it
still has a beautiful unibody CNC milled
chassis but it's a one and a half inches
thick and weighs at just under 12 pounds
actually if you compare those specs to
some higher in gaming notebooks razor
has managed to cramped an insane amount
of tech into a pretty compact footprint
beyond the exterior aspects erasers
interior is just as impressive project
valerie has razors ultra low profile
mechanical keyboard switches in which
each switch features a true actuation
and we set point key presses are
registered with 65 grams of force
mimicking the feel of
full size of mechanical keyboards
there's also an integrated GTX 1080 GPU
which likely won't be enough to properly
power all three 4k screens in most games
but remember this is a proof of concept
above all else even though Valerie is a
proof of concept right now we'd love to
see something like this in the future it
combines a space for productivity among
sign high-end specs in the ultimate
mobile workstation is it convenient that
depends on what you really need it for
if attending a show like CES or you
travel a lot it is plain overkill
however if you're someone that works out
of multiple offices and want to ensure
your setup and its settings are
transportable this may be of some
interest so what do you guys think about
project Valerie does it fit an
undeserved market niche is it just going
to be an expensive toy or would you buy
it let us know in the comments down
below I'm Eber with hurricane axe thank
you so much watching and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
