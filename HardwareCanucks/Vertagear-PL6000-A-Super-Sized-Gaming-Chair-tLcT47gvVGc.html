anxious to view in the comments section
that's because there are a highly
subjective topic to discuss since
everyone has their own taste when it
comes to comfort aesthetics price and
reliability
some people prefer those thirty dollar
office chairs from Ikea while others
feel more comfortable with a high-end
Herman Miller chair or Steelcase office
chair every human body is made
differently and because of that finding
a one design fits all chair is
impossible I was perfectly happy with my
previous office chair and a sudden shift
towards a gaming chair made me realize
that there was a lot more flexibility to
this and I got used to it almost
instantaneously to be honest with you I
have never reviewed a gaming chair
before but my good old friend Dimitri
has been through a lot of them he
concluded that the industry was
constantly doing something wrong with
the lateral support of the backrest and
I think vertigo might have addressed
that issue and much more but before we
talk about that quick message from our
sponsor the new NZXT s340 elite what
makes it so elite we've got a gorgeous
tempered glass panel extra vr ports
improved tail management and an awesome
magnetic buck the name is fitting elite
features at the good price s340 elite
check out our description below
what you're looking at here is a new
gaming chair from vortigese pline series
called EPL 6000 priced a little under
$450 this is targeted towards a certain
type of audience who prefer more space
for movement and also better ergonomics
I'll admit there are a variety of gaming
chairs available in the market today
with varying price points but how does
the pl 6000 stack up we'll find out
voted gear is pushing the boundaries
when it comes to the assembly process
normally assembling a chair requires an
extra set of hands but I found it to be
very simple this time around first you
have to insert the wheels into the
aluminum star-shaped base then you
attach the metal base frame underneath
the seat with the included pre-mounted
screws note that there's a certain
direction to mount this so look for that
particular portion in the instruction
manual at this point you also have to
make sure not to adjust the lever as
this would complicate the process the
backrest assembly was just as simple as
sliding it into the brackets on the seat
and installing the two custom m8 screws
on each side there are no plastic covers
to hide the bracket on the back
because everything is integrated inside
this part it adds an extra bit of
character to the aesthetics and I quite
like it quick mention on my sample I had
to wiggle the backrest a little bit for
the custom screws to pass through but
that issue has been corrected on recent
shipments I happen to have the red and
black variant of this chair but you can
choose for other options that consists
of black blue green and white accents
the color scheme continues it's trended
through the included lumbar cushion and
the neck pillow you will definitely get
a sense that this is a gaming chair and
that may or may not be appealing to some
buyers the casters also feature color
matching rings which is a nice touch and
they're built pretty well my office is
covered in carpets the friction is a lot
higher than using this chair on a wooden
floor vert agir is working on an auto
break version of these casters so I'm
looking forward to that in the future
the material choice here is PVC leather
which is easier to clean and maintain
due to its stain resistant and water
resistant characteristics the downside
to this type of material is the heat
concentration levels something I
experienced with the SL 5000 - now what
verdaguer has done to combat this issue
is implement tiny open-celled spots on
the scene and backrest to give a little
bit of breathing room for your body over
my usage I noticed a slight amount of
heat buildup and that should be obvious
given the almost dangerous amount of
time I spent at my desk writing scripts
and editing videos if you live in a
country like Canada it might be an
advantage during the cold winter days
seat adjusting capabilities are also a
very crucial aspect of a gaming chair
and the pl 6000 delivers everything I've
ever wanted there's a good range of
height adjustment the backrest can be
adjusted from 80 degrees all the way up
to 140 degrees and I've started to lean
all the way back occasionally to take
short breaks and sometimes it's the
perfect setting to zone out listening to
my favorite tunes the armrest provides
four directional settings so in this
case you can push the on most forward
and backwards as well as pull it towards
you there's plenty of room for height
adjustment and finally you'll have the
option to angle the rests I was able to
find the right position within a short
amount of time but if you prefer to
eliminate the armrest all you have to do
is remove these screws holding these
parts underneath the seat with the
included allen key the tilt lock
mechanism can be used in five different
positions to better suit your comfort
level
all right so welcoming change over the
traditional adjusting knob plus I uses
every single day to lock my position for
a straight posture during editing
sessions and now on to the critical part
of reviewing a gaming chair comfort I
have to admit I enjoyed my time sitting
on this chair there's plenty of room for
maneuverability and that's exactly what
the pl 6000 was designed for I'm 6 foot
tall and have broad shoulders and the
backrest seemed perfect for my size the
sides are not too edgy or high so the
tension is very minimal and that's a
thumbs up the main portion of the
backrest is mostly flat which might be a
problem for some especially if you want
to achieve a straight posture normally a
human beings bat consists of a gentle
curve and I found myself slouching
forward due to this flat design on the
backrest and I don't think it would
serve the purpose of an office chair now
this is where the lumbar cushion comes
into play but honestly there lies a
problem first of all there's no way to
permanently fix this on the chair and
second the padding was a little too
thick for me and I tried to find the
perfect sweet spot for it and
unfortunately no luck on the other hand
if you prefer to lean all the way back
in other words up for the maximum
tilting position it's a comforting
experience sitting on the PL 6000 adjust
the lever a little backward and casually
just take short breaks or zone out
listening to music the seat was
comfortable to the padding is a little
too far on the stiffer side which might
not be your cup of tea but I found it to
be very relaxing the sights are slightly
angled higher but that doesn't disrupt
thigh movement and there's plenty of
room for that if you're that guy who
likes to place one leg under the other
this chair it's definitely worth taking
a look remember opinions can vary
depending on your taste but all I can
tell you is this if you're a user design
for more space and comfort especially
for your backrest verdaguer might have
delivered one of the best in that
category with VPL 6000 lb the flat
design on the backrest could be a
problem if you're trying to achieve a
straight posture for office and such but
if you prefer a more relaxed position
like leaning all the way backward while
gaming it's a comforting experience on
the PL 6000 the assembly process was
simpler than the SL 5000 and the seating
is comfortable plus the chair is built
really well the material choice is
something I'm interested
especially when summer hits here in
Canada and considering the price I would
recommend this to anyone looking for a
proper gaming chair like all peripherals
I do however recommend you try it out
before you buy it so what are your
thoughts on the new PL 6000 a gaming
chair from verdaguer would you consider
upgrading your existing normal chairs or
even your gaming chair and for those of
you own an actual gaming chair I'd like
to start an open discussion with you
guys regarding your experience and
concerns plus if you have any
suggestions leave them in the comment
section down below i'm eber with
hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
