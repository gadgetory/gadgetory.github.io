light up your build with hue plus by NZ
XD it fits into two and a half inch
drive slots comes with four individually
controlled RGB strips with plenty of
connection cables for best routing and
is wonderfully controlled through the
camp software get 10% off at NZXT comm
link in description when people think of
mirrorless cameras things like the
Panasonic gh4 Sony's a6000 series or
canons m5 just come into our minds
however Fuji film is making a huge
stride in the area with some of their
newest cameras those shots were
beautiful when they you just watched a
short little montage fully shot on the
XT - like it's bigger brother the X Pro
- this is one of fuji films flagship
mirrorless cameras and it's also the
successor to the very popular XT one
even though Fuji film may be one of the
less popular Melies camera brands the
body alone runs for around $1,600 but if
you add the 18 to 35 millimeter F 2.8 to
four lens with oh is you will need to
add an extra $300 to your budget for the
time being there is one loan optional
accessory that you can add onto the
camera it's the vertical power booster
grip that costs three hundred and thirty
dollars and it enables Fuji films new
feature called boost mode this maximizes
performance by slight margin and can
also boost battery life for example you
get 11 frames per second of high
continue shooting vs. 8 the EVF refresh
rate boosts to 100 frames per second
from 60 the camera autofocus is a lot
quicker you'll also be able to record 4k
video of up to 30 minutes versus 10
minutes without the grip
there's also improved performance for
shooting interval shutter time lag and
blackout time there is a reason why I'm
mentioning this grips so early in the
video - I'll be sharing my thoughts
about this camera with the grip on
because I'll be honest this is a great
add-on for the XT - first of all I have
large hands and the grip complements my
pinky fingers very well which makes it
super comfortable to hold a camera in
the first place second if you are into
portrait photography you love taking
pictures with the grip on when you're
composing shots vertically the shutter
down the shutter button access to quick
settings are right there at your
fingertips the grip can also hold up to
two batteries but they have to be
purchased separately and without them
you'll lose the performance mode feature
if you have two extra batteries
charging them is as simple as plugging
in the included power cable to the DC
connector unfortunately it doesn't
charge the battery inside the camera so
you'll have to detach the grip remove
the internal battery and go through the
whole process of reattaching glue grip
so be mindful of that on a positive note
all the buttons on the grip function as
they're supposed to without the
batteries if you decide to shoot video
on the X t2 you should consider the grip
because it's the only accessory that
comes with a headphone jack which the
body lacks let's move on to the camera
now and right off the bat I can tell you
this thing is built like a tank thanks
to its magnesium alloy body it's solid
and weather sealed I also appreciate the
compact design plus the whole setup
including the kit lens and the grip
weighs less than four pounds so it isn't
too difficult to lug around at least for
me speaking of lenses take note that the
X t2 uses an X mount system and there
are no electronic adapters in the market
now so if you intend to use your Nikon
Canon or Sigma glass you'll be
disappointed taking a physical toward
the XT to the power switch is wrapped
around the shutter button and I enjoy
the convenience of turning on the camera
and capturing the shot within just a few
seconds there are five mechanical dials
on the top and these will be hugely
appreciated since you won't have to run
through menus to change many key
functions you can adjust ISO sensitivity
of up to 50 1200 the drive down switches
between movie mode bracketing high speed
burst low speed burst single frame
multiple exposures advanced filters and
panorama which is a pretty cool feature
and judging by these shots each of them
obviously performs exceedingly well
moving on there's a shutter speed dial
and right beneath you'll find the
metering dial next to it there's an
exposure compensation dial lots of dots
that you can play around with and I
think it's more practical to have these
right at your fingertips
you also have the ability to lock the
sensitivity and shutter speed dial by
pressing the dialogue button this can
come in very useful for certain
situations if you prefer an alternative
option to adjusting the shutter speed
you can program that function to either
the front or the rear command dial the
scroll steps are well defined plus you
can cycle through pictures during
playback I have the shutter speed
adjustment program to the rear dial and
if I press it I can punch in to check
focus which can be very useful when
shooting video and
what's amazing is that the exact same
settings is replicated to the dials down
on the grip excellent job guys
as for ports you'll find a 3.5
millimeter microphone input a micro USB
3.0 slash 2.0 connector micro HDMI port
and a remote release connector there are
dual SD card slots that can be set up as
a backup raw JPEG or sequential
configuration the menu system wasn't too
difficult to navigate around thanks to
the omnidirectional stick on the back
which can also be used to shift focus
points if you're coming from a DSLR
you'll easily get used to the menus
quickly the electronic viewfinder is
excellent on the XT 2 and provides
spot-on color reproduction it replicates
the exact same information from the LCD
screen and I ended it using it all the
time especially in broad daylight
conditions being able to assign frame
guidelines electronic levels and
adjusting settings within the EVF is
always appreciated the only time I never
really use it is when shooting video and
that's where I take advantage of the
3-inch LCD screen that can be tilted in
three directions to be honest I would
have preferred an articulating screen
like something found on the gh4 that
would have made my life a lot easier
shooting video and photos perhaps we
could expect this in the next revision
that being said the screen is sharp and
bright colors just pop and I can tell
it's a lot better than my c100 the xt 2
packs a twenty four point three
megapixel aps-c trans CMOS three sensor
coupled with the X processor Pro Engine
which helps achieve faster autofocus and
continuous shooting of up to 14 frames
per second in boost mode
speaking of autofocus eights fast I mean
really fast judging by these results you
can tell tracking is excellent to run
the sequence it brought back memories of
me using the 5d Mark 3 and I'm surprised
at how mirrorless cameras have come
along especially considering this
compact form factor picture quality was
just stunning with great dynamic range
and vibrant colors what you're seeing
here is coming straight out of the
camera unedited the F 2.8 aperture on
the kit lens at 18 millimeters resulted
in some beautiful shots with a shallower
depth of field the sensor can also
handle higher ISOs without a problem I
was able to push it to twelve thousand
eight hundred and still achieve great
imagery
this is the first mirrorless camera from
Fujifilm to support 4k video recording
of up to 30 frames per second the HDMI
port on the left side of the camera
outputs a clean uncompressed 8-bit 42
signal which can be paired with an
external recorder that supports 4k
there's also the option to output Fuji
films new f1 color profile which should
result in a much flatter image and
better dynamic range this can only be
done externally but unfortunately I
wasn't able to test out this feature
since I don't own an external recorder
the lack of recording Full HD at higher
framerate is also limited as it goes
only up to 60 frames per second so
prepare to say goodbye to slow-motion
video I can go on and talk about the
downsides of the XC 2 when it comes to
video like the lack of built-in image
stabilization a limited amount of
picture profiles to choose from and I
wish they had the F lock profile built
into the camera that being said the
footage that comes out of sensor is
incredible I've never owned a 4k camera
before but just judging by these shots
there is a great amount of detail and
excellent dynamic range given the
bitrate is at a hundred megabits per
second this is an excellent start for
Fuji foam into the video game and I'm
genuinely looking towards future Fuji
film cameras it's not a low IDs by any
stretch of the imagination compared to
the ACMs
2 or the a 6300 but the footage is
totally usable and I wouldn't hesitate
using this as a B cam complementing my C
100 now to answer your question should
you buy this camera it really depends on
the type of work you do I'm not an
expert in cameras nor am i professional
camera or viewer but I can tell you this
the XC 2 is a solid camera for
photography in general especially if you
want a compact set up to lug around that
can get the job done really well the
mechanical dials are hands down the best
part about this camera and given the
outstanding ebf this is definitely worth
checking out if you're strictly looking
for a video camera this might not make
the top of the list compared to
competing mirrorless cameras like the
gh4 or the upcoming GH 5 or even Sony's
latest offerings there's also the price
and the ecosystem to take into account
if you're trying to switch from Canon or
Nikon you're only limited to mounting
Fuji lenses so that my
end up being an additional cost but if
you've owned a Fuji camera and if you're
looking for robust upgrade you should
seriously consider this it's that good
and so that concludes my experience
using the XT - for the past few weeks I
hope you enjoyed this video and I'll
admit I still haven't covered every bit
of this camera so please don't consider
this to be a full dedicated review video
I'm sure there'll be so many
professional photographers out there
testing out the XT - to its absolute
best but judging by the results I've
shown what do you guys think about this
camera let us know in the comments down
below i'm Ebro with hurricane axe thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
