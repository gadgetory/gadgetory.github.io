we're here at Computex 2017 and this
time around we're checking out the msi
booth while they have a lot of things on
display a few systems really sit out and
we just had to cover them but first a
quick message from our sponsor because
without them this coverage wouldn't be
possible our coffee leg strip is brought
to you by fan tech school master and msi
so let's start with the smallest system
we've seen so far
the vortex g25 VR yeah I know we have
had all that enough of the whole VR
branding thing but what counts is this
little TC specifications and what MSI
has been able to cram into it using
components that were originally
miniaturized for the notebook space the
model they have on display featured a
7th generation Core i7 desktop class CPU
but I was told that the production model
would feature the upcoming coffee like
CPU yeah that's right my friends coffee
like it also features a gtx 1070
graphics card which should make it just
as powerful as some of today's better
gaming laptops that's pretty amazing
because look at how small it is I mean
the g27 VR is only two and a half liters
in volume making it half the size of the
MSI's at 23 which I just took a look at
last week the overall look is pretty
sleek and stealthy too with MSI's
trademark black with red accents this
isn't the only G Series desktop either
since MSI also has the higher-end g65 VR
you remember that one it looks like a
Mac Pro but how did MSI actually achieve
this design without sacrificing on the
specs
well they once again look towards a
small form-factor market and thin and
light notebooks for inspiration
that means a compressed heatsink layout
that still has eight independent heat
pipes and two small blood quiet fans
it's also important to mention that
MSI's incorporated a high-end audio
codec to ensure you get the best
possible sound from their small machine
next up is this the g63 VR stealth pro
now I know I mentioned that we'd be
focusing on compact designs in this
video and this notebook isn't exactly
Ultrabook sized
since it will only be available in a 15
inch form factor but
it's chassis is actually ultra-thin for
the horsepower below the frame there's a
GTX 970 and i7 7700 HQ CPU along with 32
gigabytes of memory despite all of those
facts the G 60 TVR is just seventeen
point seven millimeters at its thickest
point and it only weighs around two
kilograms that's pretty awesome
this ultra slim notebook also comes with
an RGB keyboard designed by SteelSeries
and you know my love towards steel
series keyboards especially in a
notebook form factor I thought it also
comes with advanced ESS saber high five
back with 24 bit 192 kilohertz high res
audio honestly this might be one of the
best numbers we've seen at the show okay
that's pretty basic stuff for today's
notebooks but the real star of this show
is the display MSI decided to use it's a
1080p 120 Hertz TN panel with a fast
three millisecond response time but the
user can also opt for a 4k HDR IPS
display even though there isn't all that
much HDR content right now it still
looks amazing and we'll have to cover
that for the future as well so that
wraps up our quick tour of some of MSI's
equipment and while there will be
showing a lot more desktops and
notebooks we just didn't have the time
to cover them all so stay tuned for a
lot more coverage from Computex 2017 let
us know your thoughts about the g25 VR
slim tower desktop pc and the stealth
pro gaming notebook
I mean Berto connects thank you so much
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
