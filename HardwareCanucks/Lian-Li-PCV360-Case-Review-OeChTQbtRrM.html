back to another hurricane axe review
leonie as you know specialize in
aluminum cases and I think three words
summarize their direction simplicity
quality and premium you'd never see a
spaceship style case from Lindley and if
you would it would be elegant the
aluminum craftsmanship is something I've
missed over my last several reviews as
really getting your hands on this full
aluminum frame is very satisfying and of
course you gotta pay the premium for Lee
and Lee as they still keep production in
Taiwan and do not outsource now we're
going to take a look at the PCV 368 this
is the silver version and it also
available in black this is a micro ATX
chassis with an unappealing price of
$140 which may turn you off right away
but let's see if Leonie managed to pack
enough functionality into this case to
justify its price
first thing anodized black aluminum
always leaves fingerprints and requires
maintenance for it to look decent but
that's not the case in its natural state
as fingerprints really don't show the
chassis is quite small and certainly
fits the micro ATX form factor and it's
very simple with clean edges and settle
aesthetics like the front panel only has
the logo at the bottom power button and
an optical slot you see the front panel
is not perforated so ventilation is
available on both sides of panel which
isn't ideal and you'll see why later on
the right side of the case we have two
USB 3 ports and two audio jacks this
does help to keep the front panel a
clean but it also will limit the
orientation of your chassis the left
side panel has a dual fan mesh
unfortunately not filtered which doesn't
make sense given the high price and
missing out on such details we'll lose
them customers taking a look at the back
the power supply mounts at the top we
have four PCI slots and ventilation area
that can also house on 80 millimeter fan
because the chassis is quite thin CPU
towers up to only 120 millimetres are
supported but because of the sight
bracket this really is targeted towards
this all-in-one water cooling systems at
the top we find a single 120 millimeter
exhaust fan also without a dust filter
but with the same mesh as decide it will
prevent against settling
but still would have preferred a filter
instead the front and rear frame do
elevate the chassis quite a bit with
rubber inserts to prevent noise or just
scratching the surface there's also a
bottom dust filter which is removable
and given you graphics cards we'll need
to breathe this ventilation is very much
needed but it is quite small and
slightly too far back I would have much
rather preferred to see a fully meshed
bottom panel with large dust filter and
perhaps a fan mount to intake cool air
to help out with your graphics card one
of the cool things about the V 360
however are the tula side panels they
are nicely secured to the frame but
giving them a little tuck from below the
side panel comes off just fine I like
this mechanism it simplifies getting
inside the case and seems your bust on
the inside we have to drive cages one
for mechanical drives and the bottom one
for SSDs next is this will a bracket
given we have top power supply mount
this is a very good utilization of a fan
mount that can house dual 120mm fans and
that's perfect for AIO water cooling
systems it can easily be removed during
installation and mounts securely back
over the CPU and memory area turn in the
case around we do have some cable
management system in place with these
plastic hinges to hold the cables and
you can even double them up for the
beastie 24 pin cable now there isn't a
ton of room to work with but surely
enough for a micro ATX system plus you
can talk to cables which is always
helpful so the power supply mounts at
the top and we also have the top exhaust
fan which will limit the size of the
unit to 180 millimetres which is
perfectly reasonable and we have a power
supply bracket that allows convenient
installation from the outside as long as
the cables aren't coming out from the
very top the power supply you won't have
any clearance issues the drives are
installed using rubber grommets and
screws which is a very simple system so
you don't need to use drive caddies both
the mechanical and this as these are
mounted through the same system where
you slide the drive in place and lowered
the lock bar so they don't fall out the
top hard drive cage can also mount a
single SSD in case you need to remove
the bottom cage but this will definitely
make it a bit more difficult
we're outing as the drive is a little
further back now I'm liking how modular
the V 360 is very easy to remove both
drive cages so just with five thumb
screws which allows access to the front
intake fan the fan simply slides out as
well no need for screws and has a
removable twist on dust filter so the
entire process of getting to the fan is
extremely simple my complaint here is
the lack of appropriate spacing between
the fan and the front panel I mean sure
site ventilation cutouts will work but
perhaps I've perforated that front panel
will be more ideal for intake and before
getting on with the assembly two things
I'd like to mention Leonie is still one
of the only few companies that include
the USB 3 2 USB 2 adapter which is
always useful for all the motherboards
and given the frame is made entirely of
aluminum some engines weren't exactly
smooth so you really have to be careful
not to get any cuts while working with a
chassis and it would be a lot nicer for
nearly to take that into account moving
forward and finally mounting our
motherboard and starting out with cable
management it is slightly unconventional
given we don't have on all black
interior but it doesn't send the mises
you for a little extra effort to clean
things up and to no surprise it looks
very presentable the pci brackets are
secured by an additional piece which has
to be removed prior installation on your
GPU not a big deal and actually might be
useful for land events considering
getting inside the case is hassle free
space wise we have just under 12 inches
of clearance until we hit the SSD cage
which is absolutely acceptable given
powerful cards are getting smaller and
taking a look at the finished build the
V 360 really does handle hardware
without compromise and turning the case
around some work was needed to secure
those cables but the clamps really do
help I was disappointed to not see any
cable tie notches which will allow more
flexibility in terms of routing but the
panel calls is just fine and since it's
not attached with screws you really do
have to make sure that no cables are
popping out that would not allow the
panel to close putting back dual fan
bracket it really does serve an
excellent purpose for extra fans or an
all-in-one what cooling
and also an excellent way to utilize the
side panel properly just really wish
there was a dust filter included also I
wish Lee and Lee would have made small
cutouts underneath the motherboard as
there is enough room that would allow
you to route your front panel audio or
USB ports and make the build looking
even more Pro and in conclusion the PCV
360 a is a well-designed elegant chassis
with great aluminum craftsmanship all
the way from Taiwan with various storage
options and modular drive cages stock
support for long graphics cards is
always a bonus plus the swivel radiator
or fan bracket is very innovative and
utilizes the space for better cooling
cable management in this chassis is a
piece of cake but I sure missed those
cable tight mounts however I think lien
Li is still quite behind on a few basic
details like missing dust filters at the
top or the side restrictive front
airflow despite the small ventilation
cutouts and two small ventilation at the
bottom which should have been extended
and lastly well the price given this is
a micro ATX chassis it is not very
appealing regardless of the features and
the B 360 really is for those craning
that aluminum feel and simple design now
this was a very close to being a damn
good case but I still cannot overlook
the fact that 140 dollars does not get
you a dust proof enclosure but what do
you guys think of the PCV 360 would this
be your next micro ATX case or not leave
a comment down below and we'll see you
in the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
