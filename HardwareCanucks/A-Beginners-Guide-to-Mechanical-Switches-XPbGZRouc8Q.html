Dimitri with Huracan accent in the past
few months I've been really trying to
explore all types of different
mechanical keyboards so I could give you
a little bit of a guide on what you
should be potentially looking out for if
you're thinking of buying a mechanical
keyboard the z9 neo by Zalman brings all
the right features on a budget with a
large windowed side panel five included
fans and the excellent interior layout
with super simple cable management get
it now link in the description below but
before we begin I want to say that I
mean keyboard does not make you a better
gamer and in our previous what to
upgrade first for your gaming setup
I put the keyboard in the last possible
category because it feels nice to type
on the mechanical switches but it's not
necessarily essential like you would
have liked with the aim with the mouse
or having proper positional audio if I
let's say you are into competitive
gaming and when choosing what mechanical
switch is best for you you have to
consider three things the first is
actuation force or how much your finger
has to press on the key for it to go
down so that means for a light key like
at forty five grams or less you can
almost lightly tap on the key for them
to start registering and it takes some
time to get used to but it's a really
awesome technique for fast typing once
you get to learn all your keys and how
the switch operates for heavier switches
like 50 grams plus because you need to
have a little bit extra more force for
the key to actuate I tend to bottom out
more on heavier switches like MX blues
and MX blacks as well now when we talk
about the actuation force the
conversation sometimes derails
into discussion about a lighter switches
giving you less thing you're fatigued
heavier ones giving you having your hand
more tired after prolonged periods of
time and there is some merit to that you
know if you're playing FPS games for ten
hours straight and you're constantly in
the WASD zone having a lighter switch
helps because your hand won't be as
tired after you know 10 hours but for
typing heavy or light switch really
doesn't make a difference it's all about
how you interact with it whether you
like to bottom out
or whether you prefer to train your
hands so that you're typing quite fast
but without fully touching the bottom of
the board the second thing to think
about is tactile point do you want the
key that is linear so the key simply
travels down without giving you any
physical feedback on when that key is
registered or do you want something that
has an actual tactile point built in so
that you are given physical feedback on
when that key is registered now one
never-ending the bag between keyboard
enthusiasts and that is whether or not
tactile switches like the MX blues are
better for gaming versus something like
a linear switch for me
linear switches is best across the board
however I've been using the MX blue for
last week just trying to get into the
mindset of people that love the switch
and cannot go back to anything else and
for me for typing it's a fantastic
experience just really satisfying in
terms of the actuation force the
actuation point the travel distance
everything about the switch is perfect
however playing games like csgo I cannot
use this as this keyboard or the switch
because when I need to reload the weapon
and have to switch back to my primary
weapon to skip the reload animation you
guys know that if you are csgo player I
cannot do that with this keyboard
because I have to lift a finger off the
key completely for the key to reset
something that slows me down I cannot do
such a fast finger movement with a blue
like I can do with a red or another
linear switch and this is where the MX
cherry brown switch comes into play I've
really come to love this switch because
it's a still light actuation at 45 grams
of force it still has it only tiny bit
of a tactile bump so you know when the
key is registered but it doesn't give
you that audible tactile response like
like the greens or like the blues which
greens are based on
and the third thing to think about is
actuation distance so when exactly is
the key being registered on its way down
so we're going from two millimeters
which is sort of the standard actuation
point and to something slightly higher
to like one point two millimeter
actuation point on something like the MX
speed giving you a very light and fast
key but not necessarily for everyone now
I want to make it clear that shoulder
actuation distance doesn't actually make
you better gamer in fact you may
potentially have more keyboard mistakes
where the finger weight as you rest your
hand on the keyboard might accidentally
activate the switch because it's life
and the actuation distance is so short I
would say sound is an important factor
in every keyboard and interestingly if
you take the same switch and put it on
different keyboards they might sound
slightly different and all keyboards
have their own unique sound signature
the Blues however are the loudest in my
collection they're quiet loud if you're
really going at it
but all linear switches are pretty much
dead quiet because you cannot hear the
spring depression it's only if you
bottomed out
or if you release the key one that's
been depressed they can actually hear
what's happening in the keyboard the top
row switches have very unique sound
signature the Blues are the loudest and
the still series sq1 switch is
definitely the quietest now what's
really interesting about mechanical
switches is that keyboards have a way of
placing in certain switches and they're
almost intended you use your scenario so
let's say MX cherry Reds are to be
considered one most popular at gaming
switches you can find a lot of
mechanical boards within the MX cherry
red switch MX blues are also considered
to be quite excellent or gaming but it's
all about personal preference I would
definitely recommend you try before you
buy and that was do a general overview
of all these switches starting with a
basic rubber tone
keyboard now the Archaea getting quite
good with some useful features like
spill resistance on this large thick
board and a very familiar feel to a
mechanical switch but obviously not as
smooth however they are quieter when you
bottom out and that might be a positive
for you
moving on to MX cherry Reds I would call
it a good all-around uses it's very
light and it's linear switch with a very
nice crispy rebound
it's good for typing it's good for
gaming I would definitely recommend it
to any first mechanical keyboard user
the sorrows agile of red switches are
also linear and having shorter actuation
point but the rebounds compared to
cherry Reds feel a bit muddy and not as
smooth when the keys coming up back up
which is the major difference between
kale and cherry variant the MX cherry
blues are the next community favorite
because of their clicking nature and
being a heavier switch so you don't have
to worry about accidental presses by you
know wrestling your fingers on the keys
it is an awesome switch but I cannot
perform multiple key strokes on the same
key because of that high reset point
although the recent bump is very
pronounced so there's no mistaking when
the key is ready to be pressed again
then there's the tessaro's
agile blues that offer shorter actuation
there since compared to cherry blues but
the recent bump when the key is coming
up is not as pronounced as on the cherry
blues that might give you a false
impression that the key has come back up
when in fact it might not have passed
that recent point yet which is also the
consequence of having shorter actuation
distance MX cherry Browns are light just
like Reds but with a slight tactile bump
built-in although it is very faint I
would consider Browns to be my favorite
tactile switch because it's not as loud
as blues yet still offer you know a
balance of lightness and bump feedback
during actuation I would definitely
recommend Browns as my tactile switch of
choice Cherry MX speed switches are
currently my favorite that are light
linear with very low actuation point at
one point two millimeters making this an
ideal switch for fps
if you require to keep your fingers on
certain set of keys constantly that you
constantly have to also click they have
very smooth and fast rebounds I would
highly recommend this for competitive
long gaming sessions the Razer greens
are also quite nice for a tactile switch
that feel almost identical to blues but
with a somewhat softer bottoming out
effect cherry blues feel crisper but I
prefer Razer greens for typing then we
have the top row capacitive switch that
with a new real force RGB keyboard
allows you to change the actual
actuation distance which is pretty
incredible for two years I exclusively
used the Nova touch tkl keyboard from
Coolermaster because of its hybrid
capacitor switches and now with their
real force RGB this might become my new
favorite keyboard with a linear switch
the rebalance is very sharp the linear
nature is quite different from red
switches but it's fused to offer the
most premium this up-and-down movement
of the switch which I love the Roma G
from Logitech is a combined effort with
Emraan switches and it's like a hybrid
between a rubber dome and the brown
switch having a light tactile bump at
one point five millimeter actuation with
the distinct reset bump as well I can
easily play competitive seers go with
the Roma G switches but they do feel
less smooth compared to Browns and the
last switch to discuss is the qs1 from
steel series they feel like a little bit
combination between MX speed because of
their low actuation point then MX browns
and they're a little bit too giving you
linear or travel for most of the way
down that gets slightly harder in the
last millimeter or so resulting in
slightly noticeable smoothness
difference when the switch is coming
back up and also it kind of feels like a
rubber dome because it is the quietest
keyboard in my collection and you know
what's interesting how all these
mechanical switches have their own
unique characteristics I love gaming on
MX speeds and MX browns
I love typing on top or capacitive and
Razer greens and I still stand by what I
said about having MX reds blues or
as your first mechanical switch
experience because every other switch
you will try later will feel different
so try before you buy
oh hey there NC XCOM it's Canada's
leading eat tailor for anything your
mind desires just keep within those
categories which are plenty and get
tempted by the weekly deals visit ncx
dot-com for all them sweet deals so I
hope this video has been helpful in
trying to establish sort of the general
guidelines around mechanical switches if
you're looking to get a mechanical
keyboard what is your favorite switch
for gaming typing or for everything in
between let us know in the comments down
below I'm going to beat you with our
Canucks we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
