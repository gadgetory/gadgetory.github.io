connection fan sex is not forgetting the
budget-conscious buyers they're not
forgetting about tempered glass and
they're not forgetting about you know
some water cooling support in it because
this is the Neo fan --tx it could speed
300 following a very similar you know
structural nature of the P 400 which you
can check out reviews of below but this
is the P 300 at $59 tempered glass
enclosure let's check it out our complex
trip is brought to you by fan tech
schoolmaster and MSI alright so there
are several reasons why this case is so
cheap the primary one being the power
supply chamber that is actually the
bottom part of the case so that reduces
the material use internally and
externally as the glass panel is much
smaller than normal full sized panels
because it doesn't cover that power
supply chamber area the glass mount here
however is still pretty solid with
rubber inserts thumb screws and tinted
perimeter on the glass to hide the edges
the i/o is pretty standard dual USB 3
and chrome plated audio jacks the front
panel is only ventilated at the top and
bottom that are covered with a dust
filter behind which there are dual 120
and 140 million mounts so you could go
with a 280 millimeter all-in-one here
and they did manage to reduce the width
of the case too by rotating the drive
cage towards the front with an
appropriate cutouts for SATA cables on
the right of them and there's also an
SSD caddy behind the motherboard tray
the interior is very very basic but
seems to be functional with built-in
cable management channel that it's part
of the frame with several cutouts on it
to pass the cables so this is actually
quite similar to the layout we've seen
on the s3 40 by NZXT there's even a 140
mm or fan mount at the top with a dust
filter and at 59 bucks you can overlook
the lack of rubber grommets but to flare
up a little bit there is a very thin
power LED right above the Centex logo on
the left side that is also RGB alright
so another cool thing we saw here antics
are the Halos RGB fan frames adding
really cool and ambient lighting to your
non lit up fans it's finally possibility
with 120 140 millimeter frames they just
simply have
are inserted on top of them and the
illumination is actually quite nice it's
ambient it's not harsh in any way and we
have both halos and halos lux so that's
kind of two versions the halos is more
plastic frame but the halos blocks is an
actual aluminum frame so this is what we
have here and it's quite beautiful it's
going to be anodized in black
sandblasted color so the material is
awesome and it will have a little bit of
a shine and have a mirror finish on the
inside to give us a little bit more of a
reflective nature and stuff and so when
things are showing them inside the new
n2 Pro special edition and so pro M so
it's got the white interior tempered
glass Edition black exterior and yeah so
what you see here at the top are black
blades and white blades for the bottom
row to demonstrate how these brackets
light up different colors of the fan
blades and the profile of the bracket is
actually pretty thin and the color is
nicely ambient and it's also uniformed
you can still make out a little bit of
the lighter spots where the LEDs are but
they're not harsh so that's good and the
brackets can be daisy chained together
and connected to either the fantex case
lighting and be controlled that way or
you can connect them to an RGB header on
your motherboard and have full lighting
control that way two sets of screws are
provided to either attach the frame to
the fan only or longer screws to attach
the frame to the fan and then to the
case so price-wise it's $10 for the
Halos plastic frame for both 120 and 140
millimeter sizes while the aluminum luxe
version is $18 and $20 for those sizes
respectively so it's a bit on the
expensive side but you know maybe the
$10 frames sound like a good way to
light up your interior of a case without
adding LED strips while still keeping
your favorite fans and finally this
little water cooling part got our
attention it's a thin in a small
reservoir pump combo that attaches to
either a 120 or 140 mm fans and can fit
in spaces a bit more comfortably versus
more common tube reservoirs so here at
the back there is an aluminum heatsink
that helps to cool the liquid plus if
you install a pump inside the bracket
itself the heatsink portion can be
relocated to cool the pump also so for
anyone experienced with water cooling
let us know what you think of this
prototype
I think the attachment mechanism is
pretty good as you can installed
horizontally or vertically on one of
your fans and that seems pretty
convenient so guys that's it for the
p300 coverage let us know what you think
of it and the fans as shown in this
video thanks for watching we'll see you
in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
