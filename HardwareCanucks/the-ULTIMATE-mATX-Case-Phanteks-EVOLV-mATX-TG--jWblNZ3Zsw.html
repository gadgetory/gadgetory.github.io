axe and I'm super excited to work inside
the new fantasy evolve micro ATX GG
Edition case because this micro ATX
trend is quite hot for 2017 so let's see
if it's all worth it for $130 and
obviously as I say the peeling off on
camera nice introducing the new OC CVX
500 all state drives from Toshiba it
offers great well balanced speed build
with mlc nand flash for superior
endurance and is also backed by five
year advanced warranty program learn
more about the VX 500 at ocz calm now
the first thing I want to cover is the
color because the sandblasted aluminum
exterior comes in silver dark grey and
matte black colors so three versions in
total and the black one I have here is
the only one that I haven't really
worked in the past so it feels like a
new experience the color is very similar
to the matte black iPhone but picks up
finger oils that are a lot more visible
compared to the silver or gray models
and you know if you have a microfiber
cloth
it's simple wipe than the trick
size-wise it's a bit on the bigger side
for a micro ATX category just slightly
shorter and slimmer compared to the
Evolve ATX power you know it's the
middle sibling and your whole family and
it's also the largest one compared to
define mini C or the in win 301 the way
I see it people who buy this most likely
are taking advantage of its size for
water cooling you know it's not super
space efficient as a prioritizes
compatibility over size I really love
the swivel mount on the side panels
which is excellent for accessing the
interior or simply removing the panel
and you can even open the doors for
extra cooling if needed the magnetic
attachment is just okay it's not too
strong and so you know they might like
slip out if you're carrying the case in
the wrong way but there is soft padding
around the panel to avoid this harsh
contact and create a tighter seal for
airflow purposes the reflective nature
of the tempered glass is absolutely
gorgeous
something you start to appreciate more
as it doesn't scratch and add
this new feel to your case but keep in
mind dust accumulation is a thing and
needs to be cleaned once in a while
the included stickers are a nice
reminder of a quality panel they are
removable but will leave residue but it
can be easily wiped off so don't worry
and I do love how the front of the glass
panel follows the contours of the front
of the case for design cohesion and this
merger of color aluminum and glass has a
really fine sense of premium that always
lives with the evolve line the blackout
perimeter on the glass is something of a
staple but what's really new is the
silkscreen on the rear side panel that
camouflages most of this area but
exposes those dual SSD caddies to show
off your drives it's a gorgeous way to
incorporate the glass reflection without
compromising the reveal of all the
cables underneath it plus showing off
the right amount of SSDs and it's a
truly nice touch for extra design points
the IO is hidden behind the aluminum
cover at the front with USB 3 and audio
jacks plus a button to cycle color for
built-in lighting and there is something
same things have been doing right for so
long you know it's not flashy and you
can also add this LED strip that will
sync up to the case lighting for
best-in-class case illumination the
front is covered with a fine dust filter
with dual 120 and 140 member fans
supported by default with 240 member
fans included on the inside the floor
the power supply chamber can be removed
for either installation of a pump
bracket which is included in this
scenario you lose out on those dual
drive caddies for three or two and a
half inch drives and you can remove the
walls completely to expand the front
radiator support to 360 millimeters but
only if the thickness of the rod is
somewhere around the 120 millimeter mark
there's nothing thicker with fit the
topper air flow is pretty much
completely closed off which is nice for
visuals you know from the top but
there's a bit of a compromise here
ventilation is available on both sides
that looks pretty cool you know if you
have illumination from interior plus the
panels has a little bit of height to it
for air to exit through the back but
ultimately this top airflow exhaust is
meant to be enough for maybe a very low
rpm
as it would otherwise introduce
turbulent rebounds back into the chassis
and here you can go with dual 120 or 140
millimeter fans which are properly
offset on mounting strips and the top
panel sits securely on this push to
secure prints along with the thumb screw
as part of accessories we get the comm
bracket if you zip ties I absolutely
love this organization box four screws
along with this adhesive fantex logo
that is up to you for application is
there's only other one fantex logo on
the side of the shroud keeping things
minimal the interior is very open
follows the same footsteps of the mid
tower with that open power supply
chamber so you can show off the unit but
keep in mind for short units like I have
here which is 140 millimeters this
cougar power supply you can see where it
ends and mixed up it will not be pretty
I do not like how the frame around the
PCI slots is closed off it is very
difficult to get the screwdriver in
there and especially annoying trying to
secure thumb screws with really tall
graphics cards and why do they tighten
and the thumb screws are so hard in
factory just really difficult to remove
them in the first place a removable
power supply this filter is here at the
back along with pre-installed
motherboard standoffs and here is the
finished system so the first thing you
might notice is how large this space
seems for a micro ATX motherboard and I
would agree fan --tx went for a more
spacious layout to allow for more
comfortable assembly but this case is
really targeted for custom water cooling
so for example they've improved on the
front intake to be less restrictive
there's a lot of headroom above the
motherboard for fan and radiator
installation which if not populate seems
a little bit wasteful and not exactly
efficient and I would rather see them
lower the height of the case and stick
to horizontal airflow only now seeing
the top panel is pretty closed off
anyway cable management is excellent as
usual rubber grommets and all the right
places to not interfere with anything of
the cooling appropriate cutouts
underneath the motherboard for i/o and
USB and really nothing to complain about
on the interior and this being a mini
version of the evolved ATX we see many
similar approaches to KL management
room in the back there's velcro straps
all around the rubber grommet and also
on top of the motherboard area which is
incredibly helpful with any AAA or setup
making things flats makes no effort at
all so the panel closes just fine and
you can enjoy this very unique visual
that you probably have never seen on the
PC enclosure before and so this is a
very nice upgrade in the Evolve family
catching up with the swivel TG panels
and joining the micro ATX bandwagon for
2017 it is a bit expensive though for
market competition since other options
are under $100 within the micro ATX
space and it seems that sentence is not
really afraid to step up the quality
game and target committed enthusiasts
who either appreciate the design or want
to take advantage of all that spacious
water-cooling support and room or both
design and water cooling and so the
evolve micro ATX DG is not going to be
popular among the mainstream but it sure
is a nice treat for the emerging micro
ATX community and we're giving them the
Harbor Canucks damn good award because
it doesn't get better than this so
