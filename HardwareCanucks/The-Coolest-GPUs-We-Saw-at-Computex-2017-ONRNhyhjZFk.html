takes cover egde it's time for a little
roundup while neither AMD or nvidia
launched a new graphics card or graphics
architecture at the show that didn't
stop a bunch of bored partners from
showing off their latest designs since
it is the newest GPU on the market many
of those focused on the gtx 980ti with
what they consider 2nd generation
products to fill in some niches within
their lives the end result is some very
unique looking designs with some pretty
interesting features but before we get
into those a quick message from our
sponsor this year is complex coverage is
brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
and msi so let's kick things off for the
zotac and unlike many other board
partners they aren't focused on building
bigger and faster cards this time around
for the ultra high end of the market
they have the amp extreme editions but
rather this time things that the booth
were going small and I mean really small
this is the gtx 980ti mini what is
labeled as the world's smallest 1080i
that's right after shrinking the GTX 970
and a 1080 ZOTAC is now going to launch
AGP 102 based graphics card that's
designed specifically for small
form-factor systems it measures just 8.3
inches long runs at stocks beans and
even packs the dual 8 pin power
connectors from the reference card
according to ZOTAC they've been able to
achieve this miracle by carefully
selecting which course they use and
installing one of those best compact
coolers on the market that's the eye
stone cooler which comes with a pure
copper contact plate five millimeter
heat pipes any massive aluminum Finnair
a right now pricing hasn't been
announced but if we were to go past the
mini series launches I don't expect so
tractor prices too much higher than the
reference cards but there's one more
tiny card here say hello to the GTX
1080p an Arctic storm mini which is
actually the world's smallest
water-cooled graphics card it also
happens to be one of the lightest weight
GPUs with a pre-installed block to
basically what so tucked in here is take
the mini that I talked about just a few
seconds ago and attach a slim
full-coverage water block to it
unfortunately they weren't able to
provide pricing for this one either but
doesn't it look great moving on to MSI
and we go from mini-me graphics cards to
supersize ones that
overcome to the limit this is the
lightning Z and if our history with
previous lightning cards is any
indication this will be among the
fastest gtx 980ti cards on the market it
comes with three modes where the boost
clock is 1582 megahertz in solid mode
which is also nvidia stock clock and
1695 megahertz in gaming mode but if you
want to throw a caution into the wind
there's also lightning mode which goes
even further with a 1721 Beggar's boost
clock I'm actually quite sure that the
final clock speeds when the Lightning Z
is running in your system may be even
higher even the memory speed to get on
action with a slight bump to 11,000 112
megahertz those frequencies are made
possible due to a massive triple slot
cooler that features three of MSI's
custom torques fans and a massive fin
area below the shroud feeding this
monster isn't the usual duel apron
either because this card goes in is a
crazy territory by needing three eight
pin inputs to function that may be
overkill in the extreme but when talking
about lightning why not this edition of
the lightnings we won't come cheap
either
but MSI wasn't quite ready to discuss
pricing just expect it to be well above
the gtx 980ti is $650 price tag but
moving from the utterly bonkers to
something that's actually useful
there's the MSI GTX 1080i gaming X 11g
just by looking at this card you won't
see anything particularly interesting
since it uses twin 405 heatsink that's
so many MSI cards have been known for
however in this situation it has been
massively expanded so it takes up three
slots that's a bit of a disappointment
since the last generation of this tape
tank was pretty compact and it only
ended up using two slots being a gaming
extraversion expects higher clock speeds
and the ability to overclock with an
invidious prescribed limits the
interesting part about the gaming X 11g
is on the rear i/o panel there's
actually a USB C port here but don't go
far to assume that you'll be able to
plug in an external drive or anything
other than a monitor to do it
basically what MSI is doing here is
provided native compatibility with
future monitors that utilize USB sees
DisplayPort alternative mode to run a
video signal through a universal USBC
cable let's come this as a novel
addition to a
API card right now its users are a bit
limited but from the pretty normal we
had to go find some more wild things and
that's when we stumbled upon colorful
are you tired of the usual RGB lighting
on a graphics card and want something
different visible through a case window
well then this gtx 980ti vulcan expo c
has you covered since it has a full LCD
embedded into the fan shroud that
displays information like GPU usage
clock speeds and temperatures it looks
absolutely spectacular and it also
happens to be one of the fastest GTA X
1080 eyes on the planet with a boost
clock of 1730 megahertz hopefully we'll
be able to get one of these can enhance
very quickly and what roundup of the
greatest GPS wouldn't be complete
without EVGA well they certainly brought
their a-game to the table because this
is the GTX 1080p on kingpin addition
according to EVGA this was designed to
be the best gtx 980ti in the world for
overclocking and it is actually
guaranteed to hit a consistent core
clock speed of at least 2025 megahertz
it comes with an updated version of the
ICS cooler which is now made of 100%
copper fence and the end result is
pretty striking to the eyes and it only
takes up two slots EVGA knows that
excess power input connectors are simply
marketing BS and they decided to show
their middle fingers to card like the
lightning lee by including a pair of
eight pin inputs honestly guys the water
is provided by to a pin connectors along
with the PCI slot is more than enough
for any gtx 980ti
including this one with its guaranteed
overclocking Headroom the kingpin has
also been designed with cable management
and control in mind both aping
connectors one from the cards back and
next to them is an input for each is
handy evbot controller there's also nine
thermal sensors and completely
asynchronous fan control for the
position X obviously software the 1080i
kingpin will be the fastest graphics
card on the planet when it's overclocked
but what happens if you're looking for
something a bit more compact this
happens to be one of the only single
slot graphics cards we've seen in a long
time and it's called the gtx 1070 katana
not only does it have a small PCB but
that cut down length allows for a thin
blower soft fan so that that pushes air
through an advanced compare heatsink
that means clock speeds remain exactly
the same as the reference version and
while you may think
Tana will be loud gal exclaims that will
run quietly even under load it really
does look cool and a lot of people tend
to ask for single slug graphics card but
I'm interested in seeing how many people
will actually buy this honestly I think
this will be an awesome conversation
piece at LAN parties so that wraps up
our walkthrough of some of the more
interesting graphics card designs we saw
at copy Tex 2017 if you're wondering
about where AMD cards are well the last
radeon gpus was launched almost a year
ago and many of their board partners are
looking forward towards Vega
unfortunately that meant a lack of
unique models and hopefully that will
change as their next architecture
reaches maturity so thank you guys for
watching this video make sure to let us
know which of the GPUs you ended up
liking the most amiibo with hurricane
axe thank you so much for watching don't
forget to subscribe for more similar
content and we'll see you in the next
