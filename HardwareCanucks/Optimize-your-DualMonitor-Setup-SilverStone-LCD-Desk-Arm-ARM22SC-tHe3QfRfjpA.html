great technology selection and service
hey guys
Ibrahim with hurricane axe and if you
had the means to get yourself set up
with a multi-monitor array for extra
productivity and pixels you'd know the
challenges that may arise of having
large monitor stands in a confined desk
space especially if you need to fit two
or three monitors on the desk the
solution of the problem is mounting two
monitors onto a single monitor arm that
features a dual arm flexible system so
today we're taking a look at the
Silverstone AR m 22 SC dual interactive
arm stand that comes into the market at
around 220 dollars I have to mention the
packaging of the arm stand is
outstanding with organized layout of
each part to assemble the arm
silverstone also included some
accessories like two allen keys and
different sized and length screws this
is a clamp type mount meaning if you
have been looking for space saving
methods this is it measuring at about 6
inches wide and 4 inches in depth here's
a comparison between the clamp and my
HTC One it is using couple of heavy-duty
knobs that are large enough for manual
adjustment and all you have to do is
tighten it according to the thickness of
the desk and the clamp support steps
from 8 millimeters all the way up to 50
millimeters this is an excellent range
for a variety of desk types the bottom
of the steel clan comes with a nice
layer of foam to avoid unnecessary marks
on the desk which is good to see the
build quality of the LCD arm screams
quality the aluminum frame comes with an
appealing shiny coating along with the
Silverstone logo that really defines the
true craftsmanship that was put into
building this arm I have to mention the
assembly process was a total breeze
first there's a support a bracket that
comes with the dual knobs that are
attached to the base we have four hex
screws then I screwed the large black
pole into the insert that's on the base
clamp and use a 2.5 millimeter allen key
to secure the pole the wire management
adaptor is attached to the pole along
with the arm secure block which is
secured by a 2.5 millimeter hex screw
this gives users the flexibility when it
comes to cable management and height
adjustment but a cable channel is built
into the LCD arms for stealth routing
and that
is a very important element to keep the
entire system clutter-free the vase
amount on each arm supports both 175
millimeter mounting options with a
swivel adjust of plus or minus 90
degrees tilt adjust has a maximum of
plus 90 degrees and minus 20 degrees
this model can support dual panels up to
24 inches only at 2 to 10 kilograms on
each arm however with many 27 inch
monitors weighing less than 10 kilos the
arm would technically support dual
27-inch panels as long as you remain
within the weight limit you might
encounter positional limitations with
larger displays but the structure is
meant to support it but since I used 2
24 inch panels compatibility was not a
problem there is a built-in resistance
adjustment behind the base amount on the
secondary arm to help you either loosen
the spring for easier movement or
tighten it for heavier panels the
included screws inside the monitor
mounts were used to secure the LCD arms
on silverstone includes extra screws
just in cakes I did the same on my other
monitor and last step was to carefully
place them on the rotational arm the
built-in 5 millimeter hex screw was used
to secure the entire construction I took
some time to adjust to my eye level for
comfort and the final result is an
outstanding spacing saving solution that
now offers significantly better movement
flexibility plus 90 degree rotation is
possible on your vase amounts for
portrait viewing a few things to keep in
mind is the distance from the wall if
you plan to rotate the main arm around
the pole and once everything is set up
the entire system is very heavy
and repositioning the base clamp will
require you to take off the monitors so
in conclusion silverstone has crafted an
outstanding product integration of steel
and aluminum and the elegant black
silver color scheme should suit office
or home use no problem the setup was not
complicated monitor size and weight
compatibility should suit most needs
although official support for larger
panels would have been nice positional
and rotational movements is where the
product shines not only this is a
space-saving tool for dual display setup
but tilt swivel and height adjustment
are all awesome and
right cable routing implementations are
welcome and while the price is a bit
high it's still competitive to other
clamp style dual monitor arm solutions
and we're giving it the harbor connects
