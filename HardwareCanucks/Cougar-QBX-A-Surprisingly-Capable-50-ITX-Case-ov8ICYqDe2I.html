higher conducts and what we've got today
on the review table is a $50 enclosure
that's the Cougar qvx making it one the
most affordable in its class and it's
exactly how it should be now of course
some corners have to be cut but it's a
nice departure from more expensive ITX
cases so let's see if this should house
your components in the future build
after this check this out the fans XP
400s which is one of the best mid towers
on the market get a sexy upgrade now
with the tempered glass side panel with
a comfortable rubberized mount to show
off your gorgeous system with an RGB LED
strip included get your glass on the
fans XP 400s plants not included so
starting with the size it's not the most
compact ITX case out there just be aware
of that plus it's not that sim either it
is quite long because of excellent GPU
support and in comparison the define
mini C which is a micro ATX closure and
the SD 40 elite you're actually looking
at a capable mini case the exterior top
and front panels look much better than
they feel they are plastic with this
aluminum processor and nice dark grey
color to create a little bit of
separation from the black steel frame
the side panels are perforated but
without any dust filtration this might
be on purpose to eliminate resistance
for passive airflow at least the mesh
here will stop some of the dust and the
only filter is found on the bottom that
slides out from the back the i/o is kind
of hidden on the right side with power
button USB in audio and being somewhat
crammed in there in between this frame I
was surprised to not have any issues
with thicker USB devices they just don't
look that great sticking out from the
side but regardless of the plastic
exterior and the thin wavy metal panels
the qbx looks premium which is a nice
balance at such a low price I also
appreciate the text branding on the
front panel instead of having their full
logo displayed there at the back there
are two PCI slots and 92 millimeter fan
included plus the power extension at the
top now to have a rear saucepan is quite
nice
there isn't much volume of air to move
anyway I wish the power extension was
somewhere near at the bottom or like
tucked away to the left side as it
doesn't look good
being right in the middle with the stick
cable at the top but as far as the GPU
support goes it's quite standard with
two PCI slots and some additional
spacing below it and you can install
dual 120 member fans at the bottom but
only slim fans with a dual slot card
installed the top panel has an
interesting mechanism to slide out to
reveal a slot loading optical drive
mount something I wouldn't say is
necessary but it goes right at the front
for optimal utilization of that space
and removing the panel we see dual 120mm
fan mounts you probably will not need
high rpm here given how close the top
plastic panel is and you want to avoid
rebound off that airflow on the inside
the first thing we notice is a
multi-purpose bracket that is meant to
house a 120mm fan or an a IO with two
mounting locations which is awesome so
you can offset them based on your needs
second the bracket has some swivel
action which makes removal and
reinstallation with hardware very simple
with this locking mechanism built in on
the opposite side of the bracket we have
a drive cage for two of these and a
single hard drive it's a nice compact
storage area that can be removed if
needed and what we're left with is an
open frame and I love how many cable
cutouts there are all around a tiny 18
or a fan can be installed at the front I
would skip that and you know some low
cost elements pop out here like the
ketchup master cables on a fan a pretty
visible green PCB for the front IO and
no thumb screws for the PCI slot the
only time screws are for the side panels
and I feel like that's totally fine for
a budget case just have your
expectations in line behind the
motherboard tray we get the single SS
the amount that can be oriented
differently I put mine to guide a 90
degree SATA cable directly into the main
chamber with purpose cable cutouts on
either side so as far as the field goes
the interior supports the full-size ATX
power supply you can see occupies a good
half of the interior but only up to 140
member units in length because of that
built-in support platform that won't
allow bigger units to fit although if
you have a bigger power supply you can
always bend it if you need that extra
room
also keep in mind the orientation of the
AC socket on the power supply as one
format is not compatible since the
extension cable is quite bulky and will
interfere with the frame in that
position now I decide to use a non
modular power supply which is a surprise
for you know an ITX tight compact case
just to see how the case would handle
those extra cables and as long as
they're bunched up and close to the
power supply you would have no problem
with long GPU support 11 inch cards will
fit just fine even with this front cable
concentration so cable routing in
general was fine utilizing all the
cutouts underneath and on top of the
board plus the extra openings above the
power supply which you can see from this
shot works really well to guide that fab
24 pin cable and you can work creatively
in securing all the cables which is my
main point criticism the lack of cable
tight hoops anywhere on the frame is
really disappointing especially at the
back here where there is a little bit of
space between that side panel but also
just a fairly large surface area to
spread your cables to make everything as
flat as possible they just need to make
it just one tiny bit better because kale
management is not super easy and so here
is the finish system with a GPU in place
I can see what cougar was trying to
achieve here the qvx is a good option
for an ITX system with existing hardware
ITA not needing to buy an XFX power
supply and I would definitely utilize a
120 millimeter all-in-one cooler for the
CPU and maybe one additional fan above
the motherboard area for exhaust but the
bottom intake is kind of awkward because
the ventilation strip doesn't span the
full 120 millimeter width and I feel the
case doesn't have that much height for
ventilation from the bottom also I do
appreciate everything the qvx stands for
and the school package at only $50 that
comes with a surprising amount of
options it looks modern and I can
totally look past the drawbacks which is
why we're giving it the Harbor Canucks
standard value award and you cannot
consider in icx bills that realistically
fits into your load budget and so that
is it for the Cougar qbx review thanks
for watching we'll see you in the next
