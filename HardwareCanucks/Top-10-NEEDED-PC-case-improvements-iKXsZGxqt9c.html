another her next video now given our
review history we've taking a look at
the power of cases everything from
extremely space efficient compact
chassis is two gigantic monstrosities
and this is the reason for why we're
making this video now it's certainly
true that the chassis industry has moved
forward with cable management of air
flow incorporate things like rubber
grommets and old black exteriors that
have sort of become the standard but
there are so many other things that I
think are still missing that could and
should become the industry standard when
it comes to chassis so this is my top 10
list of things that I would love to see
on every single case starting with
number 10 removable and modular five in
the quarter inch drive cage now it's
true that optical drives are still
heavily used today for data backup and
media playback but most mid towers and
fourth hours have at least three optical
drive slots which means that they might
come underutilized if you only have one
slot populated so being able to remove
the two on the utilized slots or empty
slots for perhaps an additional intake
fan for the front makes sense
number nine rear-facing drives we've
seen this on a lot of cases from NZXT
Corsair Coolermaster fractal design all
are facing the back especially where the
cables are coming from but why not
making accessing these drives
exclusively from the rear that way you
only have to remove one side panel the
rear side panel in order to swap remove
or access the drives so number eight
getting rid of airflow barriers
especially for the front intake fans now
I see this all the time as the front
intake fans are blocked off by your hard
drive gauge and by the frame itself all
we need is four contacts for the fans to
be sitting on the frame and leave the
middle open to allow a much improved air
flow which brings me to number seven is
much improved design for the hard drive
cage itself as it's not very open and it
blocks a lot of the air flow we just
need something innovative something
sturdy that's not too wobbly that can
house the drives but still allow a lot
more airflow to penetrate into your main
section on the case number six this is
particularly useful for windows cases as
please leave the acrylic side panel
clean without any fan grilles most of
the time they come under utilized and
they just disturb the overall look of
the case and you can't show off your
sexy components and your amazing cable
management job and most of the time
whenever a fan side panel is included
there's no dust filter which brings me
to number five
dust filters now sure you have to
maintain cleanliness of your computer
but there's nothing worse than thick
dust inside your case that shortens the
lifespan of your components now it's not
a simple matter of having the dust
filters but they have to be easily
accessible and removable it really pains
me to see companies cheap out on this
convenience like the cool master half XM
and the stupid power supply filter
underneath the power supply that is
extremely inconvenient to remove or the
lack of it on coarser air 5:40 we need
to see full dustproof covers from now on
at the front the side the bottom and the
top as well number four I would love to
see case manufacturers focus on space
efficiency now we do have gigantic
monstrosity is like the courser 900 d
and cool mask the cosmos too for example
but in all these gigantic monstrosity
we need something smaller and
space-efficient like the cool master n
series they're focusing on compacting
everything in a very nice and compact
package so having the ability to still
install enthusiast
system with great airflow but without
sacrificing your entire space underneath
the desk would be nice number three
focus on tools assembly with
particularly interests for SSDs I still
haven't seen cases that have this
feature and they always require screws
it's about time that we get to loose
assembly forces these particularly
because there's becoming so popular
becoming a lot more affordable in just
about time and makes sense to have two
less SSD brackets number two module
drive cages now to some degree we've
seen this sort of become the standard
but we still see a lot of cases that
have regular to wall cages where we
slide the drives in that are not
removable
now this complement is number four of
space efficiency as
removing sort of like the middle portion
of drive cage allows you to install high
high-end graphics cars long in graphics
cards and also allows you to better
direct airflow towards you main
components to weight towards the
graphics cards you just make sense to
have that as an option in case you need
to remove it if you don't need the
drives in case you have a long graphics
card in a very compact case and coming
to number one this is my most thing that
would love to see you in every single
case and this more of a suggestion
moving forward for the hole in chassis
industry is perhaps we need to see more
innovation preferably to hook the kind
that drives the prices down imagine 50
or $70 cases that need the entire
criteria I've just described to you guys
now that would be one awesome killer
case so these are my top 10 things I
would love to see change within the
chassis industry what do you guys think
leave me comments down below perhaps you
have an idea that I have not mentioned
or perhaps that's been bothering you
when you're building a computer so leave
your comments down below don't forget to
like this video and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
