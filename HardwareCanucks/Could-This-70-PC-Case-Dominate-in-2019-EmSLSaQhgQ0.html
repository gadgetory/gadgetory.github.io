clap the hands it's like a fish fish
tail get out of here get out of my shot
I'm kidding you're always welcome in my
shot all right our first meeting of the
day we'll just arrived to Taipei
let's go see what be quiet has to offer
it's not very quiet in here now before
we begin talking about the new pure base
500 from be quiet I'd like to thank our
sponsors Phanteks and SteelSeries for
making cosmetics possible so the pure
base 500 is all about expanding that
pure base family delivering something
slightly more compact versus the pure
base 600 we have three color options
white black and gray the white one looks
fantastic it is full white on the
interior and exterior with some black
accents here and there the black one is
full matte black usually we would find
some orange accents in the black version
but not here and the gray one that one's
not finalized yet but I'm hoping to see
it being like dark Space Gray that has a
lot of character now price wise tempered
glass Edition versus solid side panel
are different so for the black one it is
69 and 79 dollars for non TG and TG
respectively while the color options the
white one and gray are a 5 dollar extra
so the competition here would be the H500 in terms of air cooling and size and
I really like this approach I want to
see more mid towers that are compact
that can fit large CPU coolers and the
fact that the pure base 500 is slightly
wider SAS accommodating a hundred and
forty member fans at the back and two of
them are included the pure rings - so
that's pretty nice and it can support
CPU towers up to 180 three millimeters
so the latest dark rock pro 4 will fit
and here no problem now the included
fans spin at 900 rpm and these being a
pure wings - fans means they deliver a
lot of airflow and are incredibly silent
and based on their internal testing
temperatures seem to be very very
promising and I'm also excited to test
out myself their sound dampening
material applied to the front and side
panels in terms of dust filtration so
there is a giant dust filter at the
bottom that you remove from the front
and the top one you can remove the top
plate and
- that with a dust filter nice easy
approach if you're looking for a little
bit more airflow and if you're mounting
anything up there for exhaust as for the
interior only up to ATX motherboards are
supported I do like the cable cover it's
become kind of standard we're moving
away from rubber grommets and I'm
thinking that's for a positive thing to
reduce the cost and also give you a
little bit more flexibility on actually
where you can exit those cables beside
the motherboard now for the white model
I don't like that the motherboard tray
is completely white because it will
reveal all your cables while on the
black version because it is full matte
black I think you look amazing with a
CPU cooler from be quiet that there's
also black and if you're going for the
whole stealth approach it will look
pretty sweet
the only branding on the interior is
that be quiet plate that sits in between
two SSD mounts the thing is they're
facing each other so you do if you're
amounting to assess these then one of
them will be upside down as for
additional storage options we have a
dual SSD bracket behind the motherboard
tray and also a hard drive cage in front
of the PSU that you can move slightly
inwards to clear up some space for the
front where you can install a 360 rad
and also you can install dual hard
drives in there or a single SSD and
finally for the top you can mount up to
a 240 rad but given how close the
mounting locations are to the rear
exhaust fan I feel like doing any
radiator up here would be challenging so
perhaps sticking to airflow only for the
top would be my choice and given how Y
the enclosure is it is definitely
targeted towards mounting a nice large
CPU cooler so that would be my round now
the cool thing about the Pure Base 500
is that it's still in the development
stages so the tooling is not finalized
which means any feedback you can provide
in the comments about it will
potentially make its way into the final
release
so one thing we noticed is that in the
front panel the bottom section was not
dust proof while the sides were so they
will address that in the final release
nice little you know touch that we found
after working with the case for 30
minutes or so but based on the footage
what are your thoughts let us know in
the comments all right good people so
that is the pure base 500 and you be
quiet enclosure let us know what you
think for the price point and for the
feature
said the color options really hoping to
see the great version finalized and
hoping it's like that space gray color
but yeah thanks so much for watching
make sure to check out other relevant
content here and that stay tuned for
more complex videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
