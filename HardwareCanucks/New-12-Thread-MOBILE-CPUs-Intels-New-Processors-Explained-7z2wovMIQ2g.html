what's up he looking good my frame which
they opening likewise I'm actually
setting up for a video right now no I'm
actually working on on something what do
you what are you working on
basically working on an explained video
for Intel's new eighth generation mobile
CPUs so yeah a generation feels like
feels like we've already done this video
ok let me explain back then
I talked about what Intel's a generation
processors were able to offer on both
the mobile and desktop sites in that
video a lot of you abroad the fact that
you weren't able to tell the difference
between KB Lake refresh and coffee Lake
processors because they're technically
part of the Intel 8 generation Core
series but the situation's about to get
even more confusing because in this
video I'll be going over even some more
processors that are gonna live right
alongside the originals and hopefully
I'll be able to give you some insight as
to what's really going on here because
there's some really cool stuff coming
down the pipeline so let's get into it
but first a quick message from our
sponsor then you and their Mac slick
fusion is their first addressable RGB
all-in-one cooler with a standard 240 ml
rad and absolutely beautiful RGB ring
elimination on the fans and the pump to
highlight that unique flow indicator
through the transparent top check out
the lake fusion down below okay so with
that out of the way let's get to the
interesting parts in order to understand
what Intel's trying to accomplish here
we have to look at what AMD is doing
first an announcement like this from
Intel was pretty much expected
that's because AMD is due to launch
their rice into CPU sometime this month
until needed a response and introducing
new processors into segments that they
weren't serving is the first step to
compete against Raven Ridge and the new
rise in CPUs but let me set the stage
for you first when the newest KP like
our CPUs came out remember R stands for
refresh and when they entered the mobile
market they were eventually used to
create some amazing thin and light
notebooks for example I have this Dell
XPS 13 and this HP Spectre x-360 both
them feature a thread or quad core a
third
processors yet they're able to deliver
excellent all-day battery life which is
astounding considering their form factor
if you think about a previous six
generation or seven generation CPUs
weren't able to deliver that kind of
power and efficiency and if you're
interested we've actually done a lot of
content based around these notebooks
featuring a generation CPU so if you're
interested I'll leave the links down
below or you can check them out right
over here so with no books on mind let's
talk with some brand new mobile CPUs but
there's something that needs to be
discussed first the newcomers in this
chart I'm about to show you aren't meant
to replace processors like the IEEE
78550 you and the i5 8250 you that were
both in the XPS 13 and the HP spectre
x360 remember these CPUs operated at
just 15 watts and prioritized battery
life over performance whereas the new
CPUs will operate at up to 28 watts so
let's check them out right away you will
see why things might get a little
confusing for buyers
since the 28 want processors have
virtually the same names as lower
performance models the only thing to
distinguish them will be the 9 instead
of v-0 for example the 15 watt I 7 8550
u operates at a base clock of 1.8
gigahertz while the 28 watt I 785 59u
you see here will move along to 2.7
gigahertz the rest of the new lineup is
similar when compared to the lower
wattage alternatives not only that but
all the processors you see here will
also have upgraded graphics with intel's
iris plus and up to 128 megabytes of
integrated edie ram of course there will
also be support for obtain memory now at
this point I'm sure you're thinking
about where we're likely gonna see these
higher performance processors and I
think there are a few possibilities for
that we could see them potentially
included in reasonably thin and
professional-grade notebooks like the
XPS 15 for content creators like myself
while I appreciate the form factor of
the XPS 13 and the spectre x360 I'm
actually willing to sacrifice a little
bit on the weight and the thickness if
these new processors could offer better
performance in apps like Adobe Premiere
hopefully that's what we'll be able to
see with these new processors
considering their power efficiency as
well but what if you're looking for
something even more like this gaming
notebook well until now high performance
notebooks have still been using the old
generation KB Lake 7000 series CPUs but
Intel has decided to find
we phase those out the replacements are
fast and they're getting a ton of course
while their new 300 series platform is
impressive too so starting at the top of
the lineup is Intel's first six core 12
threaded mobile processor the eye 989 50
HK which is supposed to take over the i7
79 20 HK the cool thing about this
processor is that it has two extra cores
more cache and runs at a much higher
turbo frequency but it is rated at the
same 45 watt TDP as the older i7 that's
pretty impressive and it's also unlocked
for notebook manufacturers so they can
build overclocking tools into their
systems so people can squeeze even more
performance out of it I'm gonna skip the
mobile xeon processors for now since
they mostly target mobile workstations
in the professional market but the rest
of the refreshed high-end mobile cpu
lineup follows the same path as the i9
8950 HK vs. c9 79 20 HK story basically
they all offer more threats and overall
much higher performance specs than their
predecessors
unfortunately the i9 is the only one
that's completely unlocked the i7 8850 H
does have some overclocking capabilities
but those will be strictly limited
another thing that you'll notice is the
lack of HQ branding on these new CPUs
that's because it's accused to that four
quad core and since every one of these
new CPUs have four or more cores the
additional letter really wasn't
necessary I should also mention there's
an important distinction to make between
the you brand processors and the H
vendor processors so for example if you
take the i7 8559 you CPU and compared to
something like the i7 8850 H CPU
they're both different in terms of
architecture so the you better processor
is still cabling refresh whereas the H
brand processor is Intel's very first
coffee Lake mobile CPU so that's
something to keep in mind dell and
alienware have a total of six new gaming
notebooks with the a generation H series
processors starting off with Alienware
there is a refresh for the 17 inch and
15 inch notebook lineups with the i9 i7
+ i5 CPU s alongside the potential to
overclock some models to 5 gigahertz
other than the new processors not much
has changed though the exterior chasse
remains pretty much the same and they're
still availability for higher
trait panels with g-sync technology
meanwhile graphics will come from an
overclocked version of the gtx 960 1070
or age 10 and gtx 980 while Alienware
will provide higher-end solution I'm
more excited about the new Dells G
series of gaming notebooks since they
have something to fit literally
everyone's budget
the g3 15 inch and the g3 17 inch
started just 749 while being just 22
millimeters thick and including a
generation isone processors
alongside with a gtx 950 or gtx 1016
max-q graphics then the g5 15 steps
things up a bit at $7.99 or above by
offering configurations that are pretty
much similar to the g3 series by
offering the exact same four core
processors and better storage options
you may actually recognize this chassis
from last year since we actually
reviewed the in spawn gaming 15 notebook
which was used as a starting point for
this new design finally there's the g7
15 which will start at 849 USD and will
be the highest end non-alien web branded
no book series from Dell it comes with
up to six core processors new advanced
chassis upgraded cooling more i/o than
the g5 15 and can be configured with up
to 4k IPS display which is awesome well
there's everything that you need to know
about Intel's new eighth generation
coffee-mate mobile CPUs but that's not
the end of this video because there have
been a couple more interesting
developments I want to kick things off
by announcing a couple more
announcements in the desktop coffee lake
lineup but also intel's octane
technology is receiving some interesting
updates that might be worth a while
notice I just mentioned might so yeah
he's opting let's get to the desktop
just like I said on the mobile side the
87 and other CPUs have delivered great
performance at low TDP levels even
though they offered more threads than
their processors we did a full review of
coffee Lake which you can check it out
right over here but the new lineup was
lacking a free products to properly
compete with Amy's Rison that's going to
change now since three more processors
are being launched let's start with the
three CPUs at the start of this chart
since they're just meant to close gaps
in intel's current lineup for example
the i5 8600 is simply a lot slower and
less expensive version of the 8600 k the
same story goes for the i5 85
100 and the i3 8300 which cost less than
the k-series chips but also offer lower
clock speeds and can't be overclocked
this isn't big news at all since Intel's
just following the natural progression
of their lineup by finally offering more
options as for those new t-series chips
we probably won't see them in many
custom systems but the higher core
counts and load 35 RT DPS mean they
could be great options for all-in-one
desktop computers and high-performance
ultra small form-factor species grabbing
one of those and sticking it into
something like the asrock decima new GTX
would make for an awesome little
powerhouse so the last thing I want to
discuss are some revisions to octane
memory you might remember the original
opt-in video where Demetri explained the
technology and how it really failed to
do anything different when compared to
intel's older SSD caching technology all
team modules were expensive they had
limited capacity and since the
ultra-fast 3d crosspoint memory could
only be used to accelerate your primary
boot drive its users were limited but
now my friends that's about to change
because intel is finally allowing us to
do more with octane instead of just
accelerating your primary C Drive octane
can now also be directed towards caching
data for quick access to data drives as
well let me get this straight for you
guys if you're already running an SSD
for your OS install and a large capacity
hard drive for something like steam game
library the opt-in memory module can be
used to accelerate game loads through
the HDD according to Intel you may even
see benefits if your secondary drive is
a standard SATA base SSD since the write
caching of octane is so fast it could
speed up slower solid-state drives too
personally I think this gives a whole
new perspective for octane and I
actually can't wait to test it in real
life so that pretty much wraps up all
the major announcements from Intel today
I hope you're caught up with everything
that you need to know from Intel's new
copulating mobile processors to the new
enhancements with octane you know it's
really interesting because Intel's
trying to step up their game right
before aim the hits them back with Rison
- so the next few months are definitely
going to be interesting and I can't wait
to get my hands on these new products so
definitely looking forward to it but I'd
love to hear your thoughts on Intel's
announcement are you excited about
anything I mean do you see core I nine
CPUs on notebooks exciting I mean what
are your thoughts on that leave a
comment down below also don't forget to
subscribe as we'll have content from
both Intel and AMD in the upcoming weeks
so Dimitri what do you think I mean
sounds pretty exciting to have so much
additional power being delivered to the
notebook space thanks for sharing
e not a problem man now I gotta go edit
this video so I'll catch you all in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
