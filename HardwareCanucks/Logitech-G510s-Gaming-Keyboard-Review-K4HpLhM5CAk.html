popular within the gaming community
particularly due to the integration of
the LCD screen that can showcase various
useful information for gaming but also
desktop use so we are checking out the
g5 10s which retails for $120 which is
the same price tag as the original g5 10
so let's check out exactly what has
changed on this new keyboard so the g5
10s features a new coating on the
keyboard which is supposed to make the
keyboard more durable the keys now
feature double UV coating so generally
prolonging the top surface of the keys
Logitech also says they've added a
fingerprint resistant coating on the
frame which is the darker blue portion
but it is highly reflective in a huge
fingerprint magnet so keeping the
keyboard clean will require and wipe
here and there the keyboards physical
characteristics haven't changed from the
original g5 10 we still get a built in
LCD display with the 18 programmable G
keys but one main disappointment and I'm
sure many will agree are the keys are
non mechanical so we do have this
general membrane switches and
considering the direction of most gaming
keyboards today a mechanical version of
the g5 10 would be a complete knockout
the keyboard however has a solid build
quality no complaints there and comes
with a very nice palm rest that simply
attaches to the bottom of the keyboard
it's not exactly rubberized but it does
elevate your palm for a more comfortable
typing experience so starting off with
some of the gaming features the WASD
Keys are of different color but that's
about it they have the exact same
surface as the rest of the keys so in
terms of functionality the gray color is
simply for aesthetics now the 18
programmable keys is one of the main
highlights of this keyboard so for
strategy gaming mmo's RPGs and also for
simulators this would be ideal
they're very easy to program with a
macro record button you choose your G
key type in your desired commands
and you're all set to go now not only is
this very useful for gaming but for
editing in the other application as well
just have to remember what key does what
now we do have three different modes
choose from so each profile can register
up to 54 different functions for the G
keys now it may be a little overkill but
for those who can use it right it will
do the job well now each mode also comes
with its own color customization for
differentiation the windows key can be
disabled with a dedicated switch to
avoid accidental disturbance during
gaming on the keyboard despite
connecting through a single USB port
supports headphones and a microphone
jack so an internal sound card is
installed inside the g510 S and it
wasn't actually half bad for regular
music and entertainment purposes for
gaming and directionality of course the
dedicated sound card is more suited but
it's a very welcome feature for just
regular desktop use also these can be
individually muted which makes
monitoring your audio a little easier
and the internal sound card is only
activated once you populate the 3.5
milimeter jacks so it will not interfere
with other audio devices now moving on
to sort of the main highlight of the ski
board is the LCD screen this is a
monochrome display that has some
versatile functionalities not only for
gaming but for productivity as well we
get things like performance monitor
profile switch in even a news feed and
countdown stopwatch and the regular
clock as well we do get a whole bunch of
gaming profiles from the software menu
that you can add to the keyboard and it
shows all the game specific functions
that you can assign to your G keys
simply by dropping them onto the button
grid it's very intuitive and works very
well the keyboards built-in memory
allows you to store 13 different
profiles so if you rely heavily on those
G Keys for gaming and also for other
applications all of your profiles stay
with the keyboard and not the software
the moving on the turning off the
backlight is also an option and we get
plenty of colors to choose from along
with the brightness adjustments this is
an excellent way to match the lighting
of your keyboard to the rest of your
gaming peripherals and we also get the
usual media controls with a nice volume
knob and the large mute button and it's
also nice that these are separate
buttons and not integrated into your F
keys the keyboard can slightly be angled
and elevated with these retractable feet
at the bottom but notice there's only
two anti gliding pads so the keyboard is
prone to sliding with or without the
feet and sexually quite frustrating
having the keyboard dance on the table
while you're gaming now my overall
impression with using the keyboard has
been satisfactory the backlit keys are
really awesome in dark environments and
everything function like it should the
18 G keys with the three modes turn this
into 54 different programmable functions
which is a bit overkill but nevertheless
it's there for our use the included palm
breast is very comfortable for typing
and the LCD display provides us with a
few extra goodies for in-game statistics
and some other functions and also the
built-in audio jacks while may not be
comparable to a dedicated sound card
provide a decent quality audio for
desktop use and lastly the number of
different gaming profiles that are
compatible the keyboard really make this
an attractive gaming keyboard however
the new anti fingerprint coding is kind
of a fail this piano gloss finish on the
faceplate is a huge fingerprint magnet
now it doesn't disturb the function of
the keyboard but the S within the name
stands for surface and it just feels
like the dropped ball in the slight
exterior renovation and they should
really focus on the internals by giving
us the mechanical switches and also
aside from the features the price is a
bit on the steep side compared to some
of the mechanical competition but
regardless of the new glossy coating in
the g5 10s
still serves as a great gaming keyboard
just with a disappointing upgrade but
nevertheless we're giving in the
hardwood Canucks damn quitter word so
thanks guys for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
