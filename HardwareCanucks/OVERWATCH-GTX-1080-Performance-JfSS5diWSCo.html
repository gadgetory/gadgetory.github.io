welcome to another video with
uninterrupted gameplay as I was heavily
requested overwatch is all my monitors
I'm using the GTX 1080 which I have
overclocked to 2 gigahertz awesome on
the founders edition set the custom fan
profile on here as well and you'll be
seeing all the behavior of the GPU while
in-game enjoy and as usual settings come
first so here we are running 2560 by
1440 P resolution turned off vsync and
gsync off now we are running the epic
graphics quality which is the maximum I
double-checked learn from our doom
experience doom opening is Advanced tab
here everything is maxed out I left the
render scale to 100% because I noticed
that if I put it to 150 my framerate
drops to like below 60 and here I'm
going through every single setting to
show you that everything has been maxed
out in its proper settings and this is
the 5x resolution if I take screenshots
don't confuse that with 5x resolution of
the game so let's jump in and let's play
one falter now and we will succumb to
know what
defensively Oh
disquiet in your soul
race
I am on fire
Oh
stabbed me
whose mind is all
experience tranquility
hi
Photography
know what
the photo stop them now clear the voice
Oh
I'll see you thank you see that which is
unseen push y'all strike
Oh
Happy Trails
hollar inside
but reply enemy turrets great job
Oh
my
three-two-one attackers income
know what
behind
my sights
three
so I hope you guys enjoyed that
uninterrupted gameplay now the GPU
behaved very really well stated 80
degrees Celsius throughout the entire
gameplay time I was averaging around 120
FPS for all the maps and that's a good
thing consistent FPS across all maps the
lowest FPS that I noticed was 94 frames
per second during the exiting sequence
when all the heroes are on screen which
is strange
while in gameplay 100 FPS was my minimum
so I hope you guys enjoy this overwatch
+ GT X 1080 gameplay let us know which
game you'd like us to try next with this
type of series and we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
