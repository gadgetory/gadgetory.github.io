brought to you by and say XCOM
technology connected we are here at the
nvidia booth at CES 2014 and they're
showcasing some very impressive things
we have covered a little bit of what
they are showcasing here at CES based on
their press conference but there's
something that we haven't seen there and
that's right behind me so Vijay what is
this beautiful incredible piece of setup
we have here behind us this is a
fantastic set up it's 365 inch 4k
displays in surround mode playing
project cars a game that will be
released later this year it's absolutely
fantastic what's driving it is for GTX
Titans in an Origin PC liquid-cooled
maxed out and it's delivering the most
immersive real experience that you can
ever have in a car game how many pixels
per second are we seeing here these four
K 3 65 inch monitors are producing 1.5
billion pixels every second that's a lot
of pixels guys a lot of pixels and it's
running smoothly project cars is going
to be released later on the year so it's
a racing game and you know this is just
to show off that 4k is becoming a lot
more more consumer-oriented so this
setup is going to be you know it's going
to be very performance enthusiasts level
but Nvidia is also aside from their
g-sync demos are doing a 4k g-sync demo
so let's go ahead and check that out so
we've seen g-sync demos and a lot of
people wanted larger monitors right so
we saw 24 inch demos and when g-sync was
first announced now remember he's hyped
up with 27 inch I finally asus has just
released their rog monitor their first
rog monitor that is g-sync ready but
what is even more interesting moving to
that next level is what's behind this so
what's behind us is a 4k display with
g-sync enables so they're doing a live
demo here g-sync on and so g-sync off
and there you can
see the difference between what we sink
doesn't know what type of issues we sink
and no no vsync produce a lot of people
are asking for larger monitor G sinks
which we finally have so the 4k monitor
here this is just a sort of engineering
sample really right so there's no g-sync
available for 4k monitors yet the g-sync
can be applied to monitor as long as
this monitor is able to his ray is able
to be fast response rate so why haven't
we not seen IPS panels adapt g-sync yet
so right now monitor manufacturers when
they build a monitor for gaming they
want the highest possible refresh rate
and so on TN panels there are 120 Hertz
at 144 Gertz TN panels and that's what
the monitor manufacturers have chosen to
build with for their gaming monitors
yeah typically IPS today there aren't
many panels available that are faster
than 60 Hertz so what's what's that
refresh rate increases the modern
manufacturers can choose to use IPS
panels too yeah so just shows that
g-sync is not the limitation in this
monitor technology that's the IPS
technology that's not fast enough to
sort of follow up with g-sync and it's I
guess like I said earlier it's cool to
see 4k being implemented for g-sync and
the fact that it is going to be
available sometime in the future because
like we see here it is possible right so
now let's go ahead and check out
different type of monitor manufacturers
that are jumping on this g-sync wagon
and producing a bunch of their monitors
alright guys so with g-sync becoming one
of the newest and biggest movements in
gaming a lot of panel manufacturers are
jumping into this will I want to equate
it to the arms race and the pleura for a
shin of this technology so they want to
push it out as quick as humanly possible
and we're expecting some in q2 now some
of the panels that were taking a look at
today
starting off with the Asus panel it's a
1440p panels to rog monitor that we saw
at their press conference but it's not
just limited to a sous as the only
branch there are multiple other brands
including philips benq AOC hbu sonic and
there is an acer panel but it's not here
today unfortunately because they were
just signed on but expect these
jaw-dropping and completely
life-changing technologies and panels to
be out as soon as q2 alright guys so
this concludes our booth tour for NVIDIA
at CES 2014 and just a quick little
recap we saw three monitors featuring 4k
and surround 4k g-sync technology as
well as multiple g-sync panels that are
be coming out in q2 and guys if you like
our coverage make sure to subscribe and
like the video below and you know what
guys there's so much more to see here at
CES 2014 so make sure you keep on
checking back at our channel and take a
look at our Twitter and Facebook pages
as well guys will see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
