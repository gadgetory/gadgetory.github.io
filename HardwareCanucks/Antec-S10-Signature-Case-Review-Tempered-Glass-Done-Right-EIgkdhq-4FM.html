great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Harbor
Canucks and today we're taking a look at
the unique signature chassis from an
tech they wanted to do something that
would introduce a new way of thinking
about an tech and I certainly think that
this will put them back into the
conversation let's just hope that it
will be the positive light conversation
the s10 is a stunner probably one of the
best-looking cases to come out of
Computex but regardless of the looks
alone at $499 Antec is approaching a
totally different type of crowd and
let's hope that this new chamber layout
delivers on being a functional case
first and not just a pretty box
you
first thing first our tempered glass
model arrived safe without any damage
you could also get the aluminum side
panel version thick foam protected it
from any harmful impact and there's
quite a bit to the design of the
exterior the tempered glass panel look
gorgeous this is a modern and urban
feeling chassis the slight angular form
of the mainframe and this really
interesting elevated design at the
bottom is not only for looks but allows
for proper ventilation for the above
chambers the rest of the exterior is
plastic like the perforated top panel
and the curved front piece and while I
don't mind the way it looks I wish that
we saw more premium materials used to
complement the half G price point they I
always located at the top with 4 USB 3
ports headphone and microphone jacks
that little power button in the centre
there's no reset guy switch here only
five and a quarter inch drive bay that
when removed you can see that it will
only accommodate for short accessories
like a short fan controller you won't be
able to populate it with any optical
drives and from this chamber we also
have the large cutout leading into the
main compartment for any cable routing
and also this is where you'll find the
top dust filter for this front chamber
now the most interesting part about the
s10 is this new chamber Division with
their own side panels that's will open
utilizing this look clip that pushes out
each panel it's a really simple way to
get inside which I like is each panel is
equipped with a magnetic strip that
holds them tight to the case now on one
hand it's a beautiful execution for the
side panels but there is no way to
securely attach them to the chassis
the panels can be taken off the hinges
as they don't swivel wide enough and can
become really uncomfortable to work with
if they're open but for a quick check
it's convenient and I appreciate the
rubber pad installed to absorb the
contact with the tempered glass for the
aluminum version
if you have that the front panel opens
at 90 degrees providing just enough
access for your drives plus there's a
potential to set up some really cool
showcases of the build with the side
panels fully open like you see here
which would be quite the sight with a
full system installed and fortunately
taking off these panels at the front is
not as simple as the bigger ones the
hinges here are different they're curved
so once you take off the panel you need
to spend some time finding the actual
hinge inside the case that they're not
easily visible and I had some
frustrating times trying to properly
reattach these front side panels now
back to the chamber layout what ntek has
done here is fully isolate the front
drive chamber which creates this gap so
instead of going the traditional route
of having the front airflow blast
through the drive cage this gap allows
unrestrictive intake for the main
chamber and this also allows the front
of the case to look the way it does
because there is no ventilation so this
dedicated chamber for all your storage
is unique in the way that it's separated
but I feel an Tek did not fully utilize
the height of the chassis
so the drives are installed vertically
instead of horizontally this is to allow
for gaps between the drives for air flow
as one exhaust fan is installed at the
bottom however I feel the top mounted
fan would be more effective at removing
hot air from this chamber we have a
total of six three and a half inch drive
spots that can be installed here and
three two and a half inch drives on the
side but SSDs just slide in and wobble
around a bit as there is no way to
secure them inside aside from the little
swivel door and instead of having these
dedicated SSD spots I would have loved
to see standard backwards compatible
Drive brackets and three drive spots on
each level that would still allow gaps
for airflow and I feel it would be a
better utilization of this chamber also
because there is already a dedicated SSD
cage for five drives in the power supply
chamber that was bent by the way on our
sample even though this big Quality
Assurance sticker was intact
luckily it didn't affect amount and I
like the smaller gauge implementation
but why is it not made removable the
entire assembly is riveted this could be
an awesome potential spot for water
cooling hardware like a pump or a hidden
reservoir beside the cage there is a
120mm fan bracket that is pretty
difficult to install when to start with
all the wiring however it is nice to
have airflow for the bottom chamber for
the rest of the intake Antec includes
three 120mm fans that are mounted on a
removable bracket allowing for
convenient fan or radiator installation
outside of the case supporting dual 140
Miller fans as mounting strips are
present for flexible positioning the
front intake is also dust proof as this
massive filter slides out with quite a
coarse mesh I was hoping to see
something more finer maybe and I also
noticed that the ventilation cutout does
not cover all three fan spots half of
the top fan is blocked by the frame
which might not drastically impact
cooling overall but come on this should
not have been overlooked on the topic of
dust filters one is present for the
power supply at the bottom removed from
the back the power supply sits on this
elevated foam platform and since the
floor is slightly angled that foam helps
to straighten out your power supply unit
this is what the base of the s10 looks
like just a massive plastic piece that
stabilizes the case well but there are
no rubber pads anywhere just a word of
caution to avoid any scratching on the
surface taking a look at the interior it
looks strangely familiar and frankly
it's stale which is a big letdown for me
because at $4.99 I was expecting to be
blown away at some new and innovative
features obviously aside from the
separated drive cage there are a big
flaws here like the incredibly loose
rubber grommets that fall out with the
width of air and they're incredibly
irritating to attach back the location
of the cable cutouts is way too far out
to the sides of the motherboard for
standard ATX build even and while you
could put an E
DX motherboard in there and populated
with four-way GPU array because of 10
PCI slots there's very little
flexibility here for cable management
for smaller motherboards and that's a
big problem for 2015 for top airflow I'm
glad to see dual 140 member fans
included and they're also attached on a
conveniently removable bracket that can
support dual 120mm fans as well however
there is no dust filter but notice the
ventilation cutout is perfectly aligned
to the dual fans so you shouldn't worry
about settling dust however the biggest
complaint here is top radiator support
because I mounted the corsair h 105
which is a 240 nominal radiator and it
simply would not fit at first i was a
bit confused because how would in such a
tall case accommodate for one of the
most common cooler setups but i realized
that the fan bracket is dead center on
the case and is not offset closer to the
panel for better clearance which means
it's aligned with a motherboard directly
and it's making contact with the
motherboard and the only way I could
make this fit if I remove that 8 pin
cable that was making contact with the
radiator however I couldn't even reroute
the 8 pin cable because I didn't have
enough reach left on the cable and
that's because the cutout that leads
from the power supply chamber into the
main chamber is all the way at the front
you can't route it over the bar because
the side panel has to stay flush to the
case so this means the a pin cable has
to travel all the way to the front of
the case first before making its way
into that corner on the opposite side
it's a really frustrating flaw and an
additional cutout near the power supply
would have made a lot more sense and so
this is the system that I settled on
mounting the radiator to the front of
the case which in turn actually worked
out great to hide the big mess of cables
coming from the distance from grommets I
put the stock fins back inside because
the radiator sits right in front of the
cable cut outs
I had to pre route everything beforehand
because the bottom chamber is very open
there isn't much
do with the cables unless you opt out
for a full extension skit and with our
40 member of radiator plus the 25 min
they're fans you still have about 12
inches of clearance for the GPU and with
any push-pull setups on the radiator
well good luck with any of the cable
routing coming to the back we find a fan
hub for 10 fans that would be powered by
a molex connector it's just a strange to
not see any fan controller abilities and
this price point but finishing up the
build it's easy to talk things away you
just have to keep in mind
routing into the drive chamber will take
some long SATA cables especially for the
top spots but I had no problem with that
especially because antec includes four
SATA cables and check out that accessory
box let's just say we've seen better for
a fraction of the price and so in the
end I had some exciting moments when I
first unbox the s10 and followed by some
frustrating ones with the assembly but
as soon as I close the windows
you really cannot deny the exterior is
just beautiful despite how is the
perfect element to camouflage the flawed
interior and the s10 is one of those
cases that has potential if placed in
the right hands of a moderate but in
reality so does any case this was a true
chance for an tech to return to
spotlight within the chasis market
unfortunately the light here is mainly
on criticizing the lack of innovation
because it's not as functional and not
as user flexible as it should have been
the signature s10 may have just signed
out itself at a commission and so this
concludes our review of the antics
signature s10 let us know what you think
of this case in the comments below
