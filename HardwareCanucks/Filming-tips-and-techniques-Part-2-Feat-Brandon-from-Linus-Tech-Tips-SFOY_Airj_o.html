attacks welcome to the part 2 of our
b-roll tips and techniques filming
styles explaining some of the cool ways
to get unique shots and I'm very happy
to announce that we have a very special
guest I'm super excited to share what he
has in store Brandon from line Neysa
text episode's gonna be joining us in
this episode sharing some of the kiss
styles sharing some of his techniques
and tips on lighting and how he is
lighting to his advantage to achieve
some the most beautiful b-roll on
YouTube now I've been filming sort of
little tips here and there as I go
throughout the week so it's a little bit
inconsistent is what I'm wearing but
with the awesome editing of patek I can
piece it together so it looks maybe more
consistent I always love to experiment
with height either from a really high
angle so it creates a very nice unique
type of look or even from blowing go so
don't be afraid to move the tripod
around even if it takes just to set up
one single shot for maybe three seconds
or whatever it's still totally worth it
and you'll be happy with yourself so a
lot of people ask of how we get our
slider shots and with that slight
rotation that creates a really cool like
effect like this the slide and rotate
that's all manual I set my slider it's
all level so the carriage is actually
it's not going anywhere as you can see
it's not like slightly slanted this way
because it will make my job with the
slide and rotation more difficult and
also another thing is I have an X on the
screen to indicate the middle of the
frame and I try to keep that X upon
whatever part of the subject that I want
to be sort of highlighted and it gives
it gives me a good reference in terms of
if I'm sliding up too fast if I'm not
rotating it fast enough and stuff like
that so let's do this live recording
one of my new favorite techniques in
terms of getting a unique movement shot
within money with my videos is utilizing
the height adjustment tool so if you
tripod has that way where you can adjust
the extra height for the tripods we
don't need to do anything with your legs
this is a very cool way to utilize this
thing on the tripod get a very unique
shot so I basically loosen it up and
then hold it at the base and then push
it down with my you know from this
assistant above so it's a controlled
slide coming down all the way up and I
refocus and I'm pre focused and I pre
compose everything in the frame so
everything is perfect and everything is
just smoothly in shot and I can do it so
smoothly now with this with my system
because I know exactly how much pressure
to apply when it's coming down then I
don't even need to warp it in that most
production however if the tripod that
you're using does not utilize the height
adjustment or in simply not available
for the purposes of what I just show you
you can use this technique to help you
create very dynamic shot something that
I don't see on many tech youtubers now
this does require a bit of practice
again this is all manual it's all about
speed and consistency and fluid motion
so let me show you what that is so what
I'm talking about here is actually using
the tripod legs may be lowering on the
legs so it slightly shorter than the
other two and having the emotion of
leaning the tripod into your subject I
saw something like this
you can either come come into or come
out of it which I would create different
environment or whatever you trying to do
and also try to play with the focus if
you can pull focus while you are trying
to do this movement it'd be it'd be
become an amazing shot and obviously
takes practice most likely will take you
a couple of once a couple of tries to
get it perfect but at least now we have
sort of the arsenal of things to do in
the back of your mind when you do your
people so right now I'm working with
this Leonie PC 0 a cube case and it's
one of the most beautiful enclosures
that I've ever reviewed one of the
interesting parts about filming
something like this aside from it
looking super sweet and you know I get
the very awesome machine setup in there
but you can throw us the glass panels
and you can notice they are reflective
so you can play around with lighting in
your environment not just soft boxes
that are lighting up sort of the ambient
you know white around the case but
notice what happens when I turn my
bathroom light on so the lights coming
from over there and check out what
happens with the case the case glass
panels are reflective obviously so we
have this very nice orange element
throughout the glass panel now it could
be added and it could be removed based
on angle of the camera right and I can
also turn that off or close that door or
something to make the shot a little bit
more interesting as this looks awesome
to reveal the lighting on the case to
reveal the different options for what is
available but as you can see in this
shot it looks absolutely magnificent to
showcase the beauty of the glass high
panels so try to use the environment
that you're in - you don't give your
subject a bit extra character one of the
most interesting and oldest techniques
in the book on how to create a very
interesting shot based on movement is
reverse so right now I can achieve a
very smooth slide coming down with the
tripod as I just showed you so take a
look at it now
and it looks like a great shot right
we're coming down we're revealing some
of the hardware but what if we reverse
that so this is a very cool technique
because it allows you to capture the
shots that you would otherwise need
better tools for in my example I can
only do a smooth glide down I cannot do
the same going up reversing the shot of
people moving is really cool to see
people walking back in Reverse and can
you apply to anything so it's a very
simple method to create different shots
and also if you're trying to if you're
recycling some of the footage that you
already used inside your video it's a
good way to reverse the shot so it
doesn't look identical throughout the
entire scene one of the easiest ways to
show color is well obviously it's not
remove just focusing on certain lighting
LEDs and whatever but what if you go out
in focus so going out of focus creates
this really cool worry bokeh that
reveals color very well and there is
definitely no mistaking I want color
you're seeing so in this review I
actually just pulled the camera lens out
of focus so that I'm comfortable with
the Polka ball so they're not too big
and they're not too too blurry and
change the color of this case so that
you the viewers skin notice that the
color change is actually happening
without me having to actually force tip
number one window light if you do not
have access to lights or you are short
on set-up time find the largest window
available to you and use it as your key
light windows are a great way to get a
very pleasing natural look like in this
shot here your shadows can fall off
softly for a very pleasing image and
it's free tip number two bouncing light
for product mural I generally do not
like direct hard light just because it
feels a bit too unnatural and harsh so
instead you can bounce light this makes
your light softer and gives it a much
more gradual shadow like in this shot
here this leads me in to tip number
three add in color while this shot is
better than it was before it could still
use another layer for that blank white
wall so I've added a light directly on
the ground with a purple gel now you
don't have to use this kind of light or
even this kind of gel your local
hardware store will likely sell colored
bulbs to allow
a similar effect on the chief just pick
up a couple work lights and some colored
bulbs and you're good to go
thanks to Dimitri and hardware Canucks
for having me I hope you guys have found

techniques series leave it in the
