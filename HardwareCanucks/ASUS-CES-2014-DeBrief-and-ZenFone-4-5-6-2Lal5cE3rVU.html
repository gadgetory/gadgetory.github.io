is brought to you by and see IX
technology connected hey guys so we here
at the asus 2014 CS press conference and
we just wrapped up and saw some
incredible new devices some new
technology and for us gamers we saw one
badass 2014 it's a 1440p modern now just
to give you guys a little bit of a
rundown is exactly what we saw today we
saw some incredible new phones with
submit an amazing price points this end
phone you're going to see four different
versions of it from the side phone mini
to the four five and six starting at $99
that's without a contracts that's
incredible incredible pricing for some
brand new phones we also saw that
they're gonna be bringing the PadFone to
North America so that's a huge huge
thing for us here in North America that
haven't really had the chance to get our
hands on it now most importantly for us
here at hardware Canucks they also
announced the new ROG 1440p g-sync
monitor now you guys already know what I
think about this technology it is life
changing and I have a very strong
feeling that this seven hundred dollar
panel will be even more life-changing
than anything else that I've seen in
this technology let's go and take a look
all right starting with the lowest or
the lower model on the zenfone this is
the zenfone 4 it's ninety nine dollars
so how about you go get get in a little
bit closer shot and let's talk about
what this phone features so there's a
4-inch display resolution is you
probably can't tell but you know it's a
little bit more pix elated than what
we're used to but this is 800 x 480 wvga
TN panels so actually viewing angles for
TN panel are very impressive i'm very
happy remember this is ninety nine
dollars so quite an impressive piece of
tech from a su is definitely going to be
very popular in third third markets
where the price is a significant factor
so we have five megapixel camera in the
back along with a speaker and it is
powered by the int'l processor so until
Adam z250 at one point two gigahertz I
guess for no regular Android tasks this
is running Android 4.3 so employee will
see
point for upgrade sometime in the future
it's got a 4 gigabyte built-in memory
with a 1 gigabytes of RAM and the micro
SD card support I think the cover will
be removed is removable because the
battery in here is also removable so the
battery is eleven thousand seven hundred
million of hours so that we are told
that will provide about six hours of
talk time so actually pretty good then
half worth of talking the capacitive
buttons here are not illuminated there a
little bit hard to see in darkened
conditions but i guess as you get used
to where they are you will sort of it's
not it's not really a big issue
especially four hundred bucks as you can
see where you have the speaker their
front facing camera the actual
construction is fairly nice actually the
there's a bit of it looks like yeah this
looks like a brushed aluminum piece you
have a rubberized back and obviously
this is white I'm sure there's gonna be
a lot of tons of colors and accessories
and we get power and the raw oh so power
and volume rocker on the side there and
let's see what else in a headphone jack
up above so for a hundred dollars guys
the zenfone 4 may be very attractive
solution for those looking for the
basics of and George like probably just
getting into it and it's very nice to
see excuse humping on this mobile market
so let's go ahead and check out the
zenfone 5 all right guys let's take a
look at the zenfone 5 so this thing
right here it's zenfone 5 specifically
because it has a 5-inch screen now like
what we saw with the four is that there
are going to be multiple different color
options as well and it is running the
Intel Atom z2580 processor now one of
the really great things about this phone
is the fact that it does have
considerable battery life Harry so much
of the four it's going to have that six
hour talk time and it could actually end
up being a full day and a half standby
if you needed to now it does have gsm
and all the
connections like LTE HTTPS a and stuff
like that now the resolution is a 720p
screen so at the price point I believe
that this one is going for it was like
149 that resolution is actually pretty
darn good for the price you're paying
for the phone now it does run Zen UI
which is basically just a UI over
android and does run 4.3 and it is going
to be upgraded to 4.4 at a later date so
one of the really great things about
this phone guys is that it is a great
price it's a pretty solid device packs a
powerful processor and it does have a
lot of customizability let's take a look
at the sex alright guys so on to the
zenfone 6 which is a monstrous device if
you actually take a look at the 6 inch
720p screen now one of the biggest
selling features besides the actual size
of the device which is completely huge I
can barely fit my hand around it is the
fact that it is going to have a 13
megapixel camera and the exact same
connectivities that you'd expect with
the gsm phone so it does have LTE a
bunch of different upgradeable options
in regards to your storage space and
everything but what I can tell you right
now is that the screen is monstrous and
it is absolutely beautiful at the price
point of 199
