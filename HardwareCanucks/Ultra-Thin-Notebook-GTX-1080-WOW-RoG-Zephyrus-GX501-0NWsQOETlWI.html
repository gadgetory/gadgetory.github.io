the new hotness at Cod rejects this year
since everywhere we look there's new one
a lot of this is due to invidious new
max-q technology which effectively
combines efficient GPU design with
cutting-edge thermal engineering to
create high end laptops that are thinner
lighter and more powerful than ever one
of the best examples of this is the Asus
new rog zephyrus GX 501 and we'll be
looking at it right after a message from
our sponsor our coffee tech strip is
brought to you by fan tech schoolmaster
and MSI now just by looking at the
Zephyrs you wouldn't be mistaken to
think it resembles an ultrabook
from last year it's razor thin just
seventeen point nine millimeters high
and it weighs just two point two four
kilograms it actually makes the razor
blade we're using for editing during the
show look massive by comparison this is
actually the thinnest rog notebook Asus
has ever created but it's also one of
the most powerful there will be multiple
different configurations available but
in its highest and form factor there
will be an intel core i7 77 an HQ
processor and a gtx 1080 graphics cards
housed within asus told me that i was
going to be priced around 26 99 USD
there's also a 1070 option that's going
to be priced at 2219 9 the differences
between the two are obviously the GPU
and storage configurations they'll also
be up to 24 gigabytes of ddr4 24 hundred
megahertz memory and an insanely fast
nvme SSD like I mentioned above capable
of pushing speeds up to 3.5 gigabytes
per second fully insane in my opinion
now these components power a 15.6 inch
1080p display with an optional juicing
module and a refresh rate of up to 120
Hertz I've been told that the panel uses
an h vh panel that's similar to an IPS
offering but we really have to test it
out when we get one of these in the
studio now at first this may seem to be
impossible or at least possible but with
fans running louder than waste car
that's not what's happening here
instead asus engineers have created
something called the active aerodynamic
system or AAS to keep all the components
cool basically when you lift the lid a
small bottom panel open ups which allows
the fans to breathe in fresh
it's a brilliant design that works
alongside interior air ramps that ensure
cool air is always circulating through
the heat things meanwhile the CPU has a
dedicated blower fan radiator and heat
pipe array while the GPU uses a same
design but adds a second heat sink for a
good measure supposedly all these
innovations allow the Zephyrs GX 501 to
achieve a noise level of just 40
decibels alongside a complete lack of
throttling when gaming asus is also
promising lower surface temperatures
than competing solutions and thank
goodness for that since the last thing
anyone wants is a burn on their lap
while gaming will have to put that to
the test once we receive a sample since
it's a pretty substantial claim okay
about that odd keyboard positioning that
I'm sure you are all asking yourselves
about it's odd to say the least
supposedly the keys are moved closer to
the front edge to attain a more desktop
like hand positioning and we can believe
that since your wrists won't have to sit
on top of a notebooks edge it is also
pushed forward since Asus needs to
maximize the depth above critical
components to maximize heat sink size
and airport potential meanwhile the
pinholes above the area where the normal
keyboard would be located are used for
additional fan intakes the keyboard is
something to behold - since it boasts
full RGB lighting 30 key anti-ghosting
technology and key switches that have
been fine-tuned to give you optimal
feedback during my time with the Zephyrs
the keyboard feels surprisingly good but
there's a bit of steep learning curve
when trying to type quickly on it
there's another cool surprise on the
trackpad - with a press of a button it
transforms from your regular trackpad
into an illuminated numpad and that's
just brilliant even though the ology
suffers GX 501 is razor thin it doesn't
skimp on connectivity either there's a
reversible USB 3.1 gen2 type-c port that
pushes up to 40 gigabits per second for
terrible devices and the ability to run
a DisplayPort 2.0 signal through the
type C port HDMI 2.0 makes the
appearance as well for legacy devices
asus is also included for USB 3.1
genuine ports as well so that rest of
our hands-on time with this amazing new
gaming notebook what do you guys think
of these zephyrus RG notebook from asus
do you guys appreciate the design plus
what do you think about the price tag
