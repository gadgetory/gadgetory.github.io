possible by our partner nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to corsair
phanteks and NCIX without them we
wouldn't be here well let me tell you
starting the day with a bunch of VR
stuff was incredibly exciting but first
there are few updates to the Nvidia
android TV ecosystem starting with the
marshmallow 6 10 update which brings new
UI elements and a few things in the
background that simplifies using the
device for example now you can customize
what type of apps show up in the
recommended section whereas before it
was a bit more random there's a new
voice search system which shows up
everything relevant to what you're
trying to find including apps and videos
from the web and it has been vastly
improved for relevancy + metal gear
rising revengeance is coming to the
shield android TV which is like the
older 2013 title but it's got all the
same assets as from the consoles for no
compromise graphics and for the demo
that we played it was smooth plus
running off the shield itself quite
impressive next we had a chance to try
out some incredible VR demos starting
with the bullet train it is based off
the Unreal Engine utilizing the consumer
edition of the oculus where their touch
controllers and if you ever wanted to
experience what it's like to slow down
time literally catch bullets out of the
air and direct them back at your enemies
plus integrating a unique movement
through teleportation this is an amazing
experience this brings a whole new level
of vr gaming where you literally need to
perform the pickup action in order to
hold the weapon plus the entire aim
system is reliant on your literal aim
these demos were running on the Titan X
with really high frame rate but with the
consumer edition oculus had the
fantastic resolution with very low
latency we also had a chance to play the
new title adrift that will have full
oculus support and the concept behind
this game is that you're in a spaceship
something that looks very similar to the
International Space Station and there
something goes wrong on that station so
you maneuver through weightlessness on
the ship need to pick up oxygen as you
use it up and you can fully exit the
station to enjoy an incredibly real view
of
station in space orbiting earth this was
again showcased on the consumer edition
of the oculus which had a wider field of
view than the previous iterations
extremely high frame rate 90 plus all
the way up to 140 frames per second
thanks to that nvidia GPU and just super
responsive head tracking as well if
there's a reason to buy the oculus I
think the adrift game is definitely on
the main list and we finally got a
chance to experience the HTC vive which
was a totally different VR experience
thanks to these dual sensors positioned
on each corner of the room so you get to
be placed inside the fully virtual world
where you can walk around all of your
movement is registered and one of the
creative applications we got to try was
3d art that uses one of your hands as a
brush while the other is your palette so
you can choose a bunch of different
brush styles and sizes choose new colors
have unique elements like creating
leaves and snow and plasma and rainbow
glow but you're literally creating these
in a 3d space environment so it's almost
like 3d printing in the virtual world so
you can walk inside the art to make sure
a fantastic piece was made and the
joysticks were one-to-one responsive
which made the whole experience extra
real and then we also get to try out the
Mount Everest simulation where you're
interacting inside the virtual world
with your mind thinking it is super real
so when you have to cross a small ladder
between two pieces of ice on the glace
here my knees get weak for real it felt
so real especially if you're afraid of
the heights it was so immersive even
though I knew I was just you know in a
room with a bunch of sensors but it's
still incredibly impressive so what does
Nvidia have to do with VR while their VR
game works aims to improve performance
and optimization with hardware is
running both left and right eyes at high
frame rate is extremely demanding so
utilizing things like multi rest shading
which reduces the demand on the graphics
resources by rendering out the edge
Warped pixels of each eye at the low
resolution to improve performance so we
are gaming looks better than ever it's
an awesome to have nvidia as one of the
main
hardware and software supporters for
developers will have more VR coverage
with the launch of the oculus very soon
so make sure to subscribe thanks for
watching our CES store of the nvidia
sweet and we'll see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
