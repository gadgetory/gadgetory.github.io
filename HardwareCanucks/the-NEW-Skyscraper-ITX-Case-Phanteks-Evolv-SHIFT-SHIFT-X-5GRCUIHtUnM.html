Canucks and one of our first trips for
Computex we are stopping here at fantex
come along as we show you a bunch of
very exciting parts that they're showing
off here say hello to the fan --tx team
right here waiting for you guys here so
if you guys recall this is the project
2:17 back from CES and we've seen some
glimpses of it from context of last year
but the 2:17 project has evolved and now
has a name is the evolved shift X so the
slightly bigger one and the evolve shift
it's like a smaller one they're really
cool this has got this skyscraper look
so let's talk about why they're
important on this market right after
this Computex 2017 is possible thanks to
fan tax Coolermaster and msi alright so
the concept behind the name shift is to
move it anywhere or lay it flat so the
shift X is costing $159 and to the shift
the normal one is a hundred and nine
dollars the main difference between the
two aside from the size would be the
aluminum top cover on the shift X so
it's a little bit more premium while
it's plastic on the shift and the taller
body on the X allows for better water
cooling support and more storage options
so the focus for both enclosures is sort
of minimizing the footprint and
expansion of ease of use for ITX more
enthusiast level or building so the
taller frame saves desk space but
horizontal orientation is also possible
as the case feet are removable and the
rubber feet are provided for this layout
and then you'll have to decide if you
want to show off the GPU side or the CPU
side if the case is horizontal so one of
the unique aspects about the shift X and
the shift is its footprint so if they've
expanded the case vertically and they've
kept the horizontal footprint quite low
it's 17 by 27 centimeters in sort of the
perimeter and in comparison this is a
GPU nice water block there this is a
1080i and size-wise as you can see here
it's lengthwise it's practically
identical as the GPU a little bit
slightly wider so it's quite a cool
you can have this on your desk not
occupying too much space same thing with
this guy if you can deal with a little
bit of extra height they're taking off
all the side panels gives you access to
four sides you can literally just walk
around and maneuver the case however you
want during assembly which is super
convenient plus all the panels that sit
on captive thumb screws on the main side
we have the motherboard area and
underneath it is the power supply area
and I love that middle cable management
shaft that has a magnetic door to access
your cables and they're also rubber
grommets on the bottom I was concerned
with the thick cables maybe opening the
magnetic door if you have too many
cables bunched up in one area but the
magnet is pretty strong so I wouldn't
worry the smaller shift can house s FX
or s FX L power supplies and does not
come with a shroud while the shift X
comes with a shroud to hide the cable
exit plus accommodate a full-size ATX
power supply but then you'll have to
remove the shroud on the opposite side
we have the GPU chamber with a riser
cable included so here the GPU bracket
is totally flexible so you can move it
left and right which gives you a little
bit of maneuverability if depending on
how tall your GPU is and you can also
rotate the bracket so the main side of
the GPU is either facing the glass for
showcase and if your water cooling or
you can face it on the interior for
better airflow for cooling the small
shift is more focused for 120mm later
all in one use and you can install to
120-million radiators one at the bottom
and one in the front or a single 140
million radiator and for the motherboard
area we have a 140 ml exhaust fan that I
feel is a little bit too close to your
motherboard area and that cables so they
might need to put a grille on here the
front panel even has a middle divider in
case one of your fans for example the
bottom is taking air in and the one at
the top is exhausting air so they don't
mix and there are dust filters at the
bottom the side and the top as for the
shift X because of that expanded power
supply area you can add a two eighty
moment radiator at the front while still
accommodating an ATX power supply or you
can do like a combination of a 120 and
140 million radiators for that bottom
chamber both cases have an RGB power LED
at the top it's kind of hidden but you
can still kind of see it too and you can
also add an RGB strip for the interior
and it
a refreshing take on expanding the frame
vertically while keeping the main
footprint pretty small so the shift X is
30 liters and the small one is 22 I do
like the cable management approach as
they are all hidden behind the back side
panels and even the i/o is kind of
hidden but only dual USB 3 ports at the
back with no headphone jack so that kind
of sad but they do say it was an
intentional omission as the motherboard
area is facing up so you do have full
access to those ports and all of them
will be routed through the rear cut out
or you can even run them through the
bottom of the panel and so the ITX
family is growing and the verticality is
pretty unique for showcased on your desk
or in the living room and having these
chambers to divide your components as
great and cable management seems to
offer a decent building experience
alright guys so that's it for our look
on the shift X and the shift I'm
actually super excited to build in these
cases and you know this may be the shift
next maybe my first water-cooling
adventure in the ITX format because it
seems to be very accommodating so let us
know what you think about these two
enclosures in the comments I'm very
interested to hear your opinion about
this skyscraper effect you know
minimizing the footprint while still
going vertically I like him what about
you let us know in the comments down
below I'm going to meet you with her our
Canucks thanks for watching we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
