with shaking buddy curved tempered glass
panels so let's see if this thing is
awesome as I remember it that's cool
right after this check this out the fans
XP 400s which is one of the best mint
hours on the market got a sexy upgrade
now with the tempered glass side panel
with a comfortable rubberized mount to
show off your gorgeous system with an
RGB LED strip included get your glass on
with the Fant XP 400s plans not included
so guys this is the beautiful cosmos 2
anniversary edition ultra tower to
celebrate cooler masters 25 years of
existence and the original cosmos 2
dates back to 720p days of 2012 and I am
genuinely excited to see how a five-year
old case stacked up today so cool
laughter I appreciate the pretty silver
envelope with the world thank you note
to show that this is handcrafted curved
tempered glass panels but a stamp which
makes this a lot more authentic and so
it's an epic piece from the past with
relevant marketing points to sell in
2017 but it really does not align with
cooler masters most recent case
direction with the naked yours mentality
the body has been kept in this
traditional style with beautiful curves
the handles are iconic for the cosmos
line after they're both functional to
tear your system and really challenge
any other enclosure for the best-looking
handlebars ever made and then the side
panels the wingspan alone on this thing
reminds me of like some type of
satellite that's a curved tempered glass
panels and this sure is a signature
element for this celebratory release the
executions here for the mouth is OK you
can take the panels off the hinges of
which feels secure but the rear mount
that actually holds the metal pegs is
not really future proof for instance the
right panel is already rattling as one
of the techs building sits fully secured
so sounds like it's the top tech that's
not fully secured and anytime there's
any commotion within the
you can see and you can hear the town
moving the exterior is not all aluminum
for example these sliding doors have
aluminum plating but the rest of the
body is plastic that's visually blends
in perfectly with all the other accents
but reduces the weight of this heavy
case now the i/o for 2012 was totally
unique looking a bit like the Motorola
interface and it's sad not to see this
updated the rift surface for example
just soaks up in your oils and the
buttons are hard to press but at least
functionally it's good with scent
control and lighting on/off button USB
type-c port is nowhere to be found and
that in my eyes makes this refresh a bit
disappointing especially since nothing
on the interior is different the layout
and the modular options remain identical
to that of 2012 with really heavy focus
on all three and a half inch drive
storage capacity I mean there's 11 Drive
calories that's 7 too many plus 2 hot
swappable mounts at the front that you
can block I do like the basement layout
that has its own cooling and can be
removed to accommodate it 240 ml
radiator here but with the fully closed
nature of the glass panels cooling here
kind of is irrelevant and at the front
of the case it doesn't even allow you to
mount the radiator you just have a
single 200 millimeter intake BAM and the
only thing different is the aluminum
model plate that ties in with this
exterior element and also pays the
tribute to one of the first aluminum
cases coolermaster has made in the atcs
line-up back in 2009 and this aluminum
is modern friendly but it's used to
familiar to like aluminum soda cans and
it'd be nice if the surface was treated
somehow I don't know maybe the outdated
interior is there on purpose to
potentially cater to an older audience
but the inclusion of this cable is just
simply unacceptable
you're sobering 25 years of the company
and this is what you include in your
accessory pouch I wonder why so much
emphasis has been placed on the exterior
only making it look pretty tempered
glass panels and go in the silver route
that's beautiful but why no emphasis on
changing up the interior opening up the
entire front section so you can place
radios and stuff there I mean who needs
so much hard drive storage you know you
buy this to moderate so maybe cater to
that moderate community and cater to the
enthusiast and this is not what
coolermaster has done it's just a pretty
simple shell with an outdated 2012
interior design and I'm sorry being so
critical in coolermaster but their own
marketing material really prides on this
case to follow the latest and greatest
features for 2017 but simply adding
tempered glass panels on a 2012 case
does not raise the bar and it's done
incorrectly as with this example it
actually lowers the bar because we
expect more you know it's been five
years after all also coolermaster span
selection has improved drastically so
why not include their premium fans
inside the case to highlight what
they're capable of and merge the old
with the new but nope same old stock
fans are included here for airflow the
top can house triple 120 millimeter fans
that overlapped a little bit at the
front portion or dual 140mm fans back
here too that can be placed above the
frame for the build I decided to go with
the horizon system as that's going to be
my new editing platform and even still
for a workstation all this drive
capacity inside the cosmos is totally
wasteful and I went full air cooling
here replaced these stock fans with deke
wired fans and added the included blue
LED strip for extra color and the system
actually looks pretty decent but there
are a ton of cables coming from the i/o
it's like routing a whole separate power
supply and I'm not happy with the cable
cutouts and how there none directly
underneath the motherboard so you have
to pass everything from the right side
or from the bottom for the very bottom
they have to kind of cross that little
portion there there are no dedicated SSD
CAD is either to show off your drives on
the rear side despite this area being
totally visible because of that tempered
glass panel and they don't really make
it easy for cable management I mean
there are no hidden channels so you're
left to put in the time for it to appear
organized and look this enclosure from
the very beginning was a good foundation
for modders and I would
expecting them to keep the iconic shell
of the cosmos but with a totally
revamped interior but it's the same old
thing with the curved tempered glass
panels that are not in the courage to be
this revolutionary 2017 release but I
don't know what do you guys think is 13
hard drive slots enough do you care
about front radiator support are you
willing to put in the time to
potentially mod the cosmos to be your
perfect case let me know in the comments
