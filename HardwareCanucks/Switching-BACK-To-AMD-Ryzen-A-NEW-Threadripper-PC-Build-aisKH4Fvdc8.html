well then you really are going to have
to hold my beer
so this my friends is going to be the
most powerful system probably I've ever
built revolving around the ROG eco
systems we have the motherboard the
power supplied the cooler the graphics
card the case some LED accessories and
peripherals so full out ASUS ROG
fanboying over here and at the core we
have the threadRipper 2950X as 16
core 32 thread part whoo that should be
fun the lick tech 2 360 air cooler from
Animax now comes in this gorgeous white
finish to give your PC a bit of
character
the EF one pump delivers superior
cooling performance it's both Intel and
AMD socket compatible and it features
RGB lighting learn more about it down
below well well look how tables have
turned huh
not long ago I made a video about
ditching Ryzen going back to Intel and
that solely was because of Intel Quick
Sync support that was added into Adobe
Premiere so you could utilize the Intel
graphics cards on the CPU to accelerate
your render times and that was like a 2x
performance increase in Adobe Premiere
which made total sense for me but my
friends this is my first threadRipper
system Eber has built a few and now I'm
kind of happy to be back into the AMD
world especially because they're gaining
so much hype and I'm excited for the
3000 series and this would be a really
good starting point to just see how
their third or the 3000 series performs
in comparison to this 2950x it should
be fun now I want to be clear that while
this system is insanely powerful for
Adobe Premiere it is not my razor blade
15 renders video faster than this beast
and that just shows you that Intel CPUs
are still far ahead for Adobe
applications but Premiere has not been
really friendly to us and lots of
crashes just all the updates break
things you're not getting the things
that we want to get for an annual
subscription fee or monthly subscription
fee which is why I'm moving into DaVinci
Resolve 16 studio and that's been just
such a pleasure to use such refreshing
program that actually utilizes the
hardware and you're not you know bald
down to using Intel CPUs only and before
we do the parts breakdown which are all
listed in the description below by the
way thank you very much
let's do
I'm not gonna lie to you guys this is
the most expensive build I've ever done
and just looking over the price list for
each of those components it's just so
intimidating like the motherboard the
Asus Zenith Xtreme alpha it's over $600
it's ehx it is the heaviest motherboard
I've ever held in my hands it's got all
types of overclocking features it's
built super well I won't be able to
utilize it because it was built to
support the 32 core thread referred to
2990WX but I have the 2950X in there
I just enabled the precision boost
overdrive tweak a few things here and
there enable my RAM profile the XMP but
for new AMD side and just be on my way
now for memory juice kill hooked us up
with 128 gigabyte kit this is my first
so thank you very much it's got
beautiful RGB ambient illumination that
I can sync up to the entire system
unfortunately the ryo gene 360 Miller
all-in-one cooler
do not allow the all dims to be
populated because the actual base plate
and the little plastic cover that goes
over top of the pump it blocked the two
closest slots which means that I was
only able to populate 64 gigabytes in
there but with a cooler swap that I'm
expecting from Noctua for future use I
will have 128 gigabytes in total a
little bit later now for the graphics
card we got the ROG Strix gaming rtx 2080 TI and that thing is absolutely insane
it comes factory overclocked those
triple fans and the massive heat sink
and the RGB illumination everything is
like a nice complete package I can
overclock it to 2.1 gigahertz easy and
the 2.1 gigahertz an RTX 2080 TI
absolutely flies through anything
now I initially mounted the GPU in the
vertical orientation using the included
case bracket but as I'm adding more GPUs
down line to help with the rendering
performance I did swap it out to have an
this default horizontal orientation as
for power we got the rog thor 1200 watt
platinum efficiency power supply and
that thing is insane it's got a screen
on the side that shows you power
consumption it has addressable RGB
illumination that you can connect to the
motherboard and have all that synced up
very well it's got also braided cake
that I found a really cool way to
integrate around my little ROG character
so they span and they kind of wrap
around him and into the graphics card
and I found that a really good
integration to not only populate that
sort of empty space in an otherwise
really giant case but also really cool
aesthetic that highlights the cables and
secures the character in the case too
and since we weren't so over killed the
last piece of the puzzle was more
lighting I installed the RG or a
terminal beside the motherboard on that
cable cover routed an additional
addressable RGB strip on top to
highlight the cooler and give the
internal space a bit more ambient
lighting
now one unique element about this whole
build are the three screens that are
inside the one on the a a pump that you
can customize to show your CPU voltage
your temperature is your fan speeds
whatever you want you can show different
graphics as well there's the motherboard
screen that shows you different codes
different temperature you can also
customize that and the power supply
screen that shows you only the draw
power the issue however is the lack of
cohesion between all three screens in
terms of font size in terms of
animations in terms of link refresh rate
even so that kind of sucks but that is a
minor complaint on an otherwise beastly
rig and performance wise I'm very happy
with my DaVinci Resolve studio 16 public
beta for performance wise the numbers
really do speak for themselves this is
the fastest machine I've ever built
however it is not for premiere like I
said earlier my razor blade exports
videos faster because of Intel Quick
Sync but it looks like I'm back on Ryzen
and it wasn't that long ago when I was
ditching rising going to Intel flip-flop
flip-flop but the threadRipper system
is an absolute beast I feel like it's
still way too overkill for my needs even
in video production yet it is faster for
DaVinci Resolve than my 9900K machine
and I'm moving away from Adobe
applications because I feel like they're
just slugging around their low back in
my day this is how it used to be done
the venture is all feels fresh it feels
young optimization is there and that is
what I want to support so what is the
future of the system you may
ask well I want to downsize the
Arrowwood G Helius case for me is that a
bit too large but I've done a fool of
you you can check it out over here
I want to swap out the cooler so that I
can have space for 128 gigabytes of RAM
in here and really want to explore
overclocking maybe 4.2 maybe higher on 8
cores and beyond motherboard definitely
allows it and the vrm cooling here is
fantastic and I also want to bring this
into a research center and see what the
spreader per CPU can do in terms of
compute and applications outside of the
traditional video production and I'm not
going to be gaming on this thing this is
not our gaming machine despite it
looking like this get a good sense of
grip with Corsairs iron claw RGB Gaming
Mouse featuring a lightweight design
ultra durable Emraan switches paired
with Pixar's 33 91 optical sensor and
some RGB lining for some extra Flair the
iron claw ensures gaming at its best
check it out down below so big thanks to
a soos for providing the parts this is
not a sponsored video this is just us
having fun and experimenting and me
really wanting a threadripper system so
that we can move on with our lives to
explore other avenues in terms of
hardware optimizations for particular
applications in our video production now
if you have any suggestions on how we
can utilize the CPU properly for other
interesting tasks let us know in the
comments
big thanks to Wendell from level one
text for optimization troubleshooting
Talk always appreciated and yeah I'll
talk to you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
