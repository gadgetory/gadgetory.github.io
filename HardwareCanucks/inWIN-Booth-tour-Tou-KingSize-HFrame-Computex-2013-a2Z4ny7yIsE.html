we are here with the third edition this
is the D frame quite a unique case very
open design this is a very limited
edition only only thousand cases so 500
cases per color so this one you can see
here is the red one there's also an
orange another home display but it's a
it's a very unique case as you can see
it's very open nice cool acrylic glass
on the here and on the other side as
well
it's an ATX design we have three 120mm
fans at the bottom there's there's
spacing in there so unfortunately can't
mount a bottom triple radiator but if
you are looking for 120 millimeter
radiator that would work as well we are
three 3.5 inch drives over here and 2.5
inch drives for two which are mounted on
the frame at the back here there is
plenty of space in the back for cable
management there is some cable
management grommets already already
attached at the back so you can route
your cables without any problems as you
can see the power supply is attached in
the back although all the cables go in
the back and everything is assembled the
way it is so everything all the airflow
is upwards movement sort of what we've
seen on Silverstone cases it's a very
good design for airflow for passive
airflow as you can see you can install
three fans everything is going to be
pushed sort of upwards and it's a it's a
really cool case let's go check out what
else England has to offer
alright so continuing on with some of
the England products here and this is a
sort of a unique one this is the H frame
goes for four hundred US dollars again
not for everywhere it's pocket but it's
something unique we want to show you
guys so this is eleven pieces of
aluminium here quite unique again open
design we have two USB 3 ports audio
jacks on and off button you kind of
standard EI TX sorry ATX motherboard so
again North where everyone's pocket but
if you want something unique this is way
to go also moving on to here if you want
the big the big brother this is the king
size H frame goes for a hefty price tag
of 1400 US dollars so again North Rim is
pocket but coming onto the side again
this is tempered glass or not your
typical acrylic window this can also be
substituted with aluminum
side panel which is also an option so we
have to 140 Miller millimeter fans also
can be installed for 120 millimeter fans
we have 6 3.5 inch drives to SSDs
two extra fans they have this custom GPU
holder which you can unclip and also
change up based on where your graphics
card is this supports hptx and EXL ATX
motherboard so pretty good variety in
terms of motherboard specifications
again exhaust fan and doesn't seem like
there's anything on the top here but it
is quite a unique product from in win
well for everybody but you know if you
do really want to stand out $1400 this
way this might be the way to go
alright so continue on with the England
booth we have another unique case here
retails for $7.99 as you can see it's a
it's a fairly unique case it's made of
full tempered glass now what's cool
about it is that it has LED lighting
inside so when the LED lighting light up
you can see inside of the case when the
LED lights go off it's a complete mirror
so you can't see anything inside you can
obviously configure the lighting you can
the internet completely off completely
on there you can leave it on auto so
that I basically isolates between back
and forth so again this is an ATX design
we have a DVD drive at the bottom power
supply in the back kind of standard we
have a triple rad support so 360 rad
support on the top with fans being being
able to mount it inside the frame but
looks like there's enough spacing for
the ATX motherboard to be in place
without interfering with anything any of
the motherboard components now their
case is off I can't see inside but yes
so three 3.5 inch drives can be
installed in a single SSD so not the
best in terms of storage but again this
is a unique product you're not getting
this for sort of your gaming setup this
is more of an enthusiast save your case
collector if that exists but you also
have handles on the top here to carry
the case around and it's a fully
tempered glass so very sturdy it's not
acrylic and
two three USB ports headphone jacks
of course power button and a DVD drive
on the front</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
