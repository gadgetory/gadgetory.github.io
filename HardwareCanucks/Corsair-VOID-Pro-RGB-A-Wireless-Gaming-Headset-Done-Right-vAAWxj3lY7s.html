wireless headset it specifically targets
for gaming with a new improved
microphone but exactly how Pro is it
let's find out right after this
cool master master keys keyboard lineup
is now available and three sizes to fit
within your space with large medium and
small boards with either beautiful RGB
or pure white LED illumination it little
something for everyone make it yours
with the master keys Pro by Cooler
Master alright so the new avoid pros
come in various price points from $79
for the USB or the analog versions to
the $99 price point or the $129 for this
plus tradition for the wireless Edition
I find these price points actually
pretty competitive because even though
if the sound quality is not amazing the
wireless factor is valuable so what
exactly is new you might ask between the
avoid Pro and the original voids not
much has changed
so what Corsair has added now is a new
flexible arm for the microphone so it's
just generally sturdy or build but
unfortunately it still feels kind of
weak and that rotation point just like
the original void alright so this is
what the microphone sounds like on the
new void pros they have added a mic
beautification alley by simply pulling
the mic up but I find it weird that we
still have a mic mute button on the side
that you still have to go in and make
sure not to press the on button instead
I do like that there's a red LED on the
tip of the microphone to indicate when
the mic is muted in terms of the actual
sound quality of the microphone it's
only okay it's passable for game chat
but it's nowhere near the depth or the
quality of like wired gaming headsets in
a similar price range
like the GSP 300 or the HyperX clouds in
terms of noise cancellation there is
background compression I am typing on
very loud MX blue switches right now you
can still pick them up but they are
muted and what you're hearing now is the
microphone from the original void RGB
the thing is this microphone
very flimsy it doesn't have any
flexibility in terms of where you want
in position and around your mouth but in
terms of sound quality to me
they sound identical to devoid prose and
finally for comparison this is the son
Heiser game one which I think has the
best microphone on the gaming headset it
doesn't have as much noise cancellation
as the other two but it has a lot more
body to the sound it's very rich and
detailed in the vocals so if you want to
have priority and the microphone quality
then perhaps a wild connection is better
choice for you we do still have all the
same controls on the left ear cup so you
can turn the headphone on you can mic
mute here as well and there's that one
joystick that can increase the volume or
decrease the volume you can change the
EQ profiles by signal pressing it or
long pressing it enables Dolby Surround
I do like that we can switch within five
EQ profiles and you get an audible
notification and letting you know which
profile you're on and you can play
around with the you know the EQ
equalizer stuff so that you can sort of
fine tune and how exactly you like each
preset to sound it's a nice
implementation and the software overall
is very simple to use so it's good
they've also added an LED near the mic
USB port to indicate battery level and
charging the one thing that I don't like
though is it's constantly flashing so
I'm not sure exactly how much battery
it's consuming but there are levels so
green means you know it's good orange
means you should probably check out your
battery and red means recharge is needed
so the one thing Corsair definitely
needs to improve is letting users know
and how much charge they have left on
their void Pro headsets you can check
that in the software it gives you a
little percentage but they don't give
you how many hours is left so that's a
little bit unfortunate and I wish that
we had a little button combination that
we could press on these buttons so that
a voice prompt would say like 10 hours
remaining on a charge or something like
that so that it's a little bit more
clear on how many more hours you can use
this headset you know before recharging
but the battery life on this thing with
RGB enabled is actually pretty terrible
I lost 30% of my charge in just one hour
that's unacceptable so you definitely
want to disable this if you don't want
to be constantly struggling to recharge
the headset because these RGB LEDs on
both sides consume a lot
of power and in comparison you lose
about 15% of the charge in three hours
of game time so RGB by default should be
disabled and really does not make any
sense on this wireless pair a few more
things that I don't like are the glossy
parts on both sides which are gross they
just get covered in finger marks these
size adjustable headband is actually
quite good for bigger heads but it's not
as tight as I would like and they can
fall off easily with just a swift head
movement the thing is they switched out
the foam for memory foam which is now
you can conform to your head size but
because of this because it's not as
thick anymore it doesn't sit as snug on
your head however they have improved the
rotation cuffs mechanism which feels a
lot more sturdy and not as loose as only
original and can sit on your neck like
this so you don't have to take them off
now each avoid pro while this headset
comes with this USB transmitter but
unfortunately you cannot use the headset
without the dongle plugged in for
example if I was to charge the headset
put the included USB cable I needed to
have the USB dongle also plugged in in
order to use this thing so this USB
microUSB at the bottom is only for
charging it does not pass any data so
this if you go for the wireless version
is a wireless headset only now there is
an auto shutdown feature built into the
headset which is great to preserve
battery life but unfortunately it
doesn't initiate when I shut down my
computer so we went from 17% to 4% in
the morning which is kind of ridiculous
the PC was off but somehow the headset
was still pulling power
why so you either have to turn off your
headset during the night or get
accustomed to plugging it in so you have
enough charge for the next day and for
wireless headset you kind of lose the
novelty of it being Wireless if you have
to constantly think about the battery
life have to constantly think about
turning it off during the evening or
having to recharge it everyday in half
in order to have any power come next day
so if you can overlook the battery
status which I think is the major sort
of downfall of this headset the arrange
and the sound quality are actually
pretty good so in the range they
advertise forty feet in my example I
could easily go six meters with multiple
walls in between without any
interference to my sound quality so you
know if my speakers die and I
to walk around with a wireless headset
with streaming audio from my computer
that is absolutely no issues here with
the signal so the 2.4 gigahertz band is
doing its job very well and as for the
sound signature for a wireless pair
these are not terrible
they look amazing by any means like my
game one that have very good bass
response and fantastic clarity for an
open-style headset the Void pros have
very good clarity nice detail and a lot
of power at seventy percent volume I was
listening to things comfortably and
gives you a little bit extra juice in
there if you want to really blast your
ears and surprisingly without distortion
if you go to like 100 percent volume and
cs:go my map awareness through audio
cues was very familiar so if you want to
use this in better scene without the
cord that works and for more immersion
and lots of layered audio cues with bass
field chaos like bf1 still delivered
very nice mid-range stones without the
bass overpowering all the the other
frequencies so if you want good audio
without the cord the Void pros are way
to go and that's what the surround sound
itself it's using the Dolby surround
sound and it's actually not terrible all
it does is just widen the soundstage a
little bit so things feel a little bit
distant stereo imaging becomes like
you're trying to hear something from
speakers right in front of you instead
of hearing something really close in
your headset things become a little bit
more booming so the bass is a bit
extended and it extends into the
mid-range so it's not too Pleasant but
for you know for gaming it doesn't fully
destroy the layering so the positional
awareness that you normally get with
stereo is not totally compromised in the
Dolby surround sound and I normally
don't recommend surround sound but here
it's actually not too bad but I still
would recommend going with stereo if you
want to get full positional accuracy
because again with Dolby surround sound
that positional accuracy is coloured and
there is some unpleasant bass happening
as it extends it in the mid-range so I'm
happy that Corsair has developed a good
wireless pair that looks good it's
comfortable and performs very well at
range and audio signature is actually
pretty decent but I think they've really
kind of failed in the RGB Department not
in the implementation but
how it effects battery life if he have a
gaming headset that can only last for
like six hours with the RGB enabled
that's really no point in having a
wireless pair at all and you know and
the disabling RGB definitely gives us
more more time but I feel like they if
they put a slightly larger battery in
there so that you can game at long hours
and not having to recharge this thing
every like day in half then it'd have
been a lot more appealing for the
wireless consumer
I also wish that these USB transmitters
were labeled so for example if you have
two voids and one Pro and one the
original you'll be able to see exactly
what USB transmitter is related to what
because they are not unifying you cannot
use them across your devices you have to
use them with a particular device they
come with which is a little bit
unfortunate you know I wish they took
the large tech approach and having one
USB and a transmitter that unifies all
of their peripherals also the microphone
here is actually pretty bad I wish that
they have done some more working here so
that the microphone was more clear but
again at $99 price point you cannot
compare that to other $99 wired headsets
because you know the convenience of
having no wire here is that selling
point so they're compromising other
features like the microphone in here so
that you can have no wire or so you
kinda have to look at it from both sides
and see what you prioritize more having
a wire and better microphone or having a
wireless integration that is more
convenient but having worser audio and
having a worse microphone always stay
charged with linky power up power banks
houston gorgeous aluminum enclosure with
dual USB and type-c port with support
for quick charge 3.0 to get two devices
recharged fast available up to twenty
thousand one hundred million power
capacities check them out in the
description below and so that's my take
for the Corsair void pros RGB I like the
headset but again the battery status and
the battery life is the most
disappointing on this thing the wireless
convenience of course is a huge benefit
and you know it's gonna stay at my desk
or when I need the audio and have to
move around the office if I don't want
to use my speakers and also you know for
Gaming situation if you're going the
fool wrong a wireless gaming setup that
perhaps look at these as well so guys
