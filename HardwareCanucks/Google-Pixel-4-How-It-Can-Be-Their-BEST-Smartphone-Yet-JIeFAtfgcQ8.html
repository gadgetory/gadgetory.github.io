acts and just a few hours ago Google
tweeted a picture of supposedly what the
pixel 4 would look like at least the
backside of the device
mentioning that there seems to be some
interest around this phone as well as
creating some excitement as to what it
can do now they're having a lot of
rumors as to what the pixel 4 and the 4
XL would look like I mean I've been
reading a lot of articles with regards
to what we could expect from these
devices because the pixel 4 is probably
one of the most anticipated phones that
I'm looking forward to in 2019 just
because I am curious to see what Google
can come out with this device especially
since you know I've reviewed the pixel 3
in the past and I've had a lot of
concerns or I've experienced a lot of
the issues that a lot of users have also
been experiencing potentially with you
know software bugs that just performance
issues were also present with the pixel
3 so here's what I'd like to see when
these phones get announced officially
now just a quick disclaimer these are
just rumors and speculations on the
pixel 4 and the 4 XL
none of this is guaranteed to be true in
fact part of me things that Google is
sort of trolling us with that picture
that they tweeted I don't know I mean I
want to believe it I'm on a neutral
stand right now so let's just go buy
some of the things that we know so far
just go buy some of the rumors that we
are aware of that could potentially show
up on the pixel for now just by taking a
look at the official photo that Google
tweeted it looks like the pixel 4 is
gonna come with an all-glass back so
it's not gonna feature the two-tone
finish like what's plan on the pixel 3
and the pixel 2 I personally like the
one on the pixel 3 especially the
frosted texture it was a glass back but
the frosted texture on top of that
definitely added a sense of grip when
you know holding the device but given
that this is an all glass bag design I
know for a fact that it's gonna be you
know a fingerprint magnet just like the
s10 so there's that but interesting
enough there wasn't any sign of a
fingerprint scanner on the back so it
looks like Google is ditching that and
they might end up going for an in
display fingerprint scanner just like
the galaxy has 10 and so the other
smartphones that we're seeing in 2019
now taking a look at this other sample
render by on leaks it looks very similar
to the picture that Google tweeted
especially if you compare the backs
to the pixel for but if you look at the
front side of the device I can't really
tell if the display is gonna be you know
bezel if it's gonna be a larger display
I mean I know for a fact that Google
won't make the same mistake or be the
same mistake like the pixel 3 Excel with
that ridiculous notch so I hope it's
either gonna be an all display or they
might end up leaving some dazzles on the
top to accommodate the cameras I'm just
I'm just really curious at this point
now according to Pocket lint the pixel 4
and the pixel 4 Excel might have dual
sim support but I'd actually much rather
see expandable storage instead of the
dual sim support because that way it
would sort of compete with what
Samsung's offering with the s tens
because those devices have support for
expandable storage so yeah it would be
cool to have that on the pixel 4 and the
4 Excel now Pocket lint also suggests
that Google might go with capacitive
buttons instead of physical buttons on
the pixel 4 and the 4 Excel I'm not
exactly sure if that's 100% true but if
it is it's certainly gonna be an
interesting experience just getting used
to that whole set up but what really
caught my attention was this article by
95 Google essentially the pixel 4 might
come with radar Cheshire sensors that
essentially allows the user to basically
use our hands to adjust certain controls
so if you want adjust your volume or
skip tracks or perhaps copy or paste
certain things just do multiple things
just using your hand gestures it's
something that we saw with the LG G 8
thank you but I'm not sure if that's
gonna translate really well into the
pixel 495 Google did link to a video
called project soli which was debuted
back at Google i/o 2016 so really a long
time ago and it looks like the R&amp;amp;D team
was more focused on developing a hand or
a radar sensor at a relatively compact
form factor and that way they could
implement them in future products that
could potentially take advantage of
those hand gestures now recently FCC did
grant Google the permission to implement
them in future products but if it makes
its way to the pixel 4 and the 4 Excel
I'm not really sure how people could
actually take advantage of those hand
gestures maybe Google is thinking of
some some smart things or smite ideas or
smart gestures that could be
revolutionary but
at this point these are just rumors
we'll just have to wait and see now it
also looks like Google might be working
on its own version of face ID and I'm
actually not surprised about that
because if you look at the current state
of fingerprint scanners especially the
ones that have been integrated
underneath the display most of them are
perfect whereas others are just not that
great it's pretty terrible the whole
experience is terrible it's not super
fast and reliable so if they could come
up with something that almost matches or
perhaps even exceeds the level of face
ID that'd be great we have to talk about
the cameras and if you look at the
picture once again that Google tweeted
it looks like there are two rear-facing
sensors and I hope that one of them is
an ultra wide-angle lens and I don't
think the addition of a telephoto lens
would be van handy I mean I personally
don't really take advantage of that
telephoto lens at least on most cameras
but it looks like they're only two
sensors at the back but camera quality I
think it's gonna be superior I don't
think I'm gonna have anything to
complain about it but we'll just wait
and see what they can come up with last
but at least I do want to comment on the
square camera design if you take a close
look at it it almost looks like a droid
face with a really interesting
expression so yeah that's something that
I can't unsee now and hopefully I didn't
spoil you guys as well but yeah there's
that and finally to wrap things up I'd
love to see Google address some of the
issues that we had with the pixel 3
specifically on the performance side of
things I'd like to see it being more
consistent on the pixel 4 and the 4
Excel
perhaps the extra RAM might be handy in
this case but we also know for a fact
that it's kind of gonna come with the
latest SOC and all the other kind of
stuff also a better battery life on both
these devices would be highly
appreciated and finally most importantly
I want to see a better microphone
integrated on these smartphones because
on the pixel 3 it was pretty terrible so
I'd love to see Google improve on that
part especially when you shoot video on
the pixel 3 the quality is just pretty
terrible especially really compared to
the flagship offerings from Samsung and
the rest so Google you know if you're
gonna be pricing this thing more than
800 900 dollars it better be on par with
the rest of the competition so that
about wraps up my expectations for the
pixel 4 and the 4 Excel I'm sure
you might have a list as well so
definitely let us know in the comments
down below
I'm sure you guys at least one of you
would be like bringing back the
headphone jack
come to think of it if they do that
would be revolutionary so yeah anyways
