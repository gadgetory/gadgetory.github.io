Canucks and this is my helper in a bar
today we're going to be doing another
behind the scenes of shooting another
commercial this time for Harry so
Harry's is our recent sponsor and then
we figured out a way to make something
just as fun as previous commercials so
here is all you need to know of how we
shoot that spot in particular enjoyed
the lighting scene is very simple we
have a softbox so are firing off at me
there's nothing on this side of the
camera because I don't we have plenty of
light coming from the window anyway and
the screen is on we have our script in
here so that we know exactly what we
need to do in terms of which scene we
have to film and which one has already
been filled and that's firing off some
light onto me and I will trust the handy
one light with that key lamp always
comes in handy and gives us very warm
feeling I mean you can't see this right
now but as we are shooting the
commercial it's supposed to be an
evening scene I'm getting ready I'm
working I'm in the zone and we set up
very nice warm scene so let me show you
what that looks like
so this commercial or this pre-roll is
about Harry's and we're trying to create
something cinematic well I'm looking
forward to filming the shots of the
product itself with the razor and work
with lighting especially somewhat
similar to what we had with the fractal
design Detroit fans when we had the
whole sort of setup in the bathroom and
we're sort of applying that same you
know idea with the shaving set but this
time Dimitri won't be taking a shower
you'll just be shaving that's very true
so we won't do anything crazy although
this should be very interesting because
it's more real-life related because you
know
one needs to shame but yeah that's that
so I'm looking forward to this pre-roll
or filming of this mural
let's get with it yeah ma'am ma'am so we
need a pre-roll you will be mainly
looking at my face really close up some
macro shots and coming your way I'm
wearing my favorite blue shirt you've
seen this in plenty of videos before but
surprise surprise pajama pants you don't
will be proud of me right now
barnacle YZ you'd be very proud really
oh yeah
all right
how are you both in focus we're in shot
right all right all right let's so this
is how we
all right first shot is ready let's move
on to the second shot
so right now we're setting up the shot
where I received a text
did I say is that sharing up the
show oh my god
in order for this to be a controlled
shoot I set up to Eber as my girlfriend
contact that is supposed to text me just
now so let's see let's see how that
works
that's my poster you can't see the whole
phone is in the shop
I want like just the text so let's redo
that all right it's in the camera and I
can do many like I can do this to the
face I can do the face because the what
I'm supposed to do is be surprised when
receiving the text it's exactly we're
going to try to do and then I turn it
off and then you do focusable like kind
of different approach place to make
no that's not my place to provide space
did you get I hope your focus back
because sometimes you're not focusing
sure guys we got the shot who
so we even just came up with a brilliant
idea of not recording audio on-site as
in for this next scene why I turned
around to say stuff to the camera but
instead I'll just make a face towards
the camera implying what I'm about to
say and then using our professional
microphones to record the audio so you
have to clean up audio and well don't
have to record the kids outside right
now yeah so we just finished inside the
office now let's go to the bathroom
that's up here yeah well the next scene
is in the bathroom this guy so this
would be the second time we're using my
bathroom here for a commercial and this
is the final shot that we're trying to
prepare for the reveal of all Harry's
products and obviously that comes with a
price of actually having to clean the
space that you're in and well it works
out for me because I live here what
we're gonna try to do is set up the rest
of the pipes and so here we have the
camera sort of on the same a little
angle we have the shaving cream sorry
the foam gel the shave cream and the
opera sheet all together but having
difficulty finding out where to put the
the actual razor the blade because it
doesn't it's not really highlighted if
it just underneath the bottles but we're
just trying to see if we can figure out
the optimal way to show off everything
now same shaft and obviously
a little bit of a pitch line coming from
here and so basically wish us luck
all right and that is a wrap nice we
just finished the Pierrot for Harry's it
was a quite a fun shoot but it was not
the first weird thing I've done the
front of Eber it was weird but I'll be
honest the finish was great
no incredibly awkward stuff showering in
front of Beamer but this time it was
just just the facial stuff so it wasn't
so bad so now check out the full Harry's
Pierrot that we made today thank you so
much for watching don't forget to
subscribe every for every but behind the
scenes and how-to videos every Friday
and so enjoy the harry's people Ibrahim
any last words no no I'm looking forward
to the actual edit right after this yeah
I know you guys are probably don't watch
the beer all right after this
CDM so enjoy that and yeah we'll see you
next one beautiful so this commercial is
about
pre-roll for Harry's she said we wanted
to create something that write him and
that would be new you have to say that's
a wrap
have no fear Harry Street

quality blades and I won't have to worry
about chopping for shaving products
