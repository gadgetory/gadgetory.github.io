new risin second generation processors
and a couple of X 470 motherboards
unfortunately I can't get into the
performance results and talk about a
little bit about the architecture and
stuff for these new CPUs because AMD has
given us an embargo for that and they
have only given us actually they'd be
missed to embargoes this is an
interesting thing so they've given us an
embargo for today which is the Friday
April the 12th and it is an unboxing
embargo so we're supposed to or we're
allowed to reveal the pricing in specs
of these new rising processors we can't
really talk about we can't really get
into the depth of the platform the
architecture what are some of the tweaks
with this new platform and something
stuff like that so it's gonna be a
pretty short video but I would recommend
preparing your sub boxes for next week
April a 19-foot that on your calendars
because rise in to coverage is gonna be
everywhere I guess reviews and all that
kind of stuff so yeah you can thank me
for that in the comments anyways what I
can talk about today are the newly
announced rise in second generation
processors and their respective
specifications along with pricing and
availability
along with the new x4 7e platform and
some of the features that brings to the
table so without any further ado let's
get right into it but first a quick
message from our sponsor the new OC CTR
200 from Toshiba is a great value SSD if
you're considering upgrading a hard
drive and get a nice boost in
performance with cutting-edge 3d flash
memory and ultra reliable controller
with built-in power management available
in different capacities check it out
below alright so what exactly can we
expect from these new Rison processors
well first and foremost the obvious more
performance this is Amy's first line of
CPUs on the new 12 nanometer technology
using these n+ architecture it isn't
necessarily Zen to but rather a minor
optimization of from the original Zen
architecture they've also made some
improvements to the soldered HS by using
premium indium alloy solder they've
claimed to reduce Die temps by 10 degree
Celsius which is pretty amazing also say
hello to aim DS x4 70 chipset this is
their updated platform that supports
these new rising CPUs and they come with
a few enhancements that I'll get to
shortly ok so let's get to the new CPUs
meet the Rison 720 700 X it's an 8 core
processor which 16 threads comes with 20
megabytes of cache a baseball Cup
seven gigahertz and a boost up to 4.3 it
also comes with Amy's new wraith prison
cooler which we'll get to shortly and
it's priced at $329 by the way all of
these new processors will be available
for pre-order globally on April the 19th
next up we have the risin 7 2700 it
features the same number of cores and
threads as the 2700 X except it runs at
lower clock speeds out of the box and
its TDP is set to 65 watts when compared
to 105 on the 2700 X and it's priced at
299 that's just incredible considering
the performance it's packing moving on
we have the risin 5 2600 X it's a 6 core
processor with 12 threads comes with a
base clock of 3.6 gigahertz and a boost
up to 4.2
and it's TDP rating is set to 95 watts
what's even exciting is it's priced at
229 and I can't wait to test out its
performance compared to Intel's
offerings lastly we have the r5 2600
features the same number of cores and
thread count as the 2600 X except
slightly lower clock speeds out of the
box when compared to its bigger brother
but check out that price $200 guys $200
for a 6 core 12 thread processor really
exciting stuff now with the introduction
of these new processors and new platform
Rises and in this case it's X 470 it is
a successor to X 370 from last year and
it brings some improvements in the power
infrastructure in order to support
second generation rising CPUs especially
since they can achieve higher clock
speeds you can also expect a lot of new
motherboard designs from Asus or as MSI
X arow + AMD has announced store mi
technology with this platform consider
this as a response to what Intel does
with their rapid storage technology
it's basically a storage software that
fuses two or more storage devices so in
this case it could be your SSD and hard
drive plus your RAM into a single
virtual disk so the operating system
reads it as a single Drive I can only
get to the specifics next week when the
review embargo lifts plus I'd like to
spend some time validating this
technology to see if it's actually worth
upgrading because it's only compatible
with x4 70 motherboards and not X 370
quick note and compatibility if you own
an existing Rison system so say for
example you have an extra
70 motherboard with a first-generation
rise in CPU you can just purchase one of
these new processors and do a drop-in
upgrade and it'll just work right away
as long as you've updated the BIOS
beforehand so it is backwards compatible
the only thing to keep in mind is that
store mi technology isn't compatible
with x3 70 plus I think overclocking
there are some overclocking limitations
with the new Rison processor if you
install it into in if you install it to
an x3 70 motherboard so I'd recommend if
you are thinking about upgrading from
say a 5 or maybe like a relatively older
system and if you're considering making
the switch to rise in you should
definitely pick up an X 470 motherboard
and one of these new horizon processors
just sort of take full advantage of the
new overclocking capabilities and just
just the storage the story in my
technology that I talked about earlier
another thing that I need to mention is
that I've not had the best experience
when it comes to overclocking on Rison
processors especially with the 1700 X I
wasn't able to get a consistent 4
gigahertz overclock on my CP or on my
sample but I'm hoping to achieve even a
lot higher on the new rise in CPUs so
let's just hope that overclocking would
turn out pretty well on these new
systems because 4.3 gigahertz or let's
say roughly 4.2 gigahertz on all eight
cores would be pretty amazing and I'm
hoping to I'm hoping to achieve that
hopefully when I put together the rise
into system so stay tuned for our
performance result or a performance
build video next week so that concludes
this video I hope you're excited for
rising to just like I am but most
importantly I'm really excited about
what kind of performance it will bring
to the table when compared to 1st
generation horizon processors because
I'll be testing out the 2700 X and I'll
be comparing to the 1700 X that's on my
editing PC right behind me so can't wait
to can't wait to test that out but I'd
love to hear your thoughts on Rison -
are you excited let me know in the
comments down below
I need more with Harvard connects thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
