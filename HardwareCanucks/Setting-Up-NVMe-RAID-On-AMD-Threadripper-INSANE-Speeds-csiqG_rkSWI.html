X and if you would call about a month
ago I put together an awesome kick-ass
threat repair gaming slash workstation
PC if you haven't watched that video you
can check it out right over here but to
sum it up the build featured Indies
flagship 1950 x16 core 32 threaded CPU
which was cooled by the NZXT X 62 a i/o
cooler 64 gigabytes of G skills glorious
RGB transient a strict gtx 980ti from
asus all housed inside this beautiful
Corsair air 540 chassis now for storage
I was rocking two samsung 960 pro SSDs
one as my primary boot drive along with
storing a few of my recently obsessed
titles and other being a scratch disk
for adobe premiere I was amazed by the
read and write performance on these
drives we're talking roughly 3.5
gigabytes per second on read speeds and
2.1 gigabytes per second on writes but
it was right around the time and AMD
announced their nvme write support on X
399 platform and I was anticipating that
update ever since that announcement and
now I'm here to walk you through the
setup and some of the results that I was
able to achieve after creating the raid
array so that me further ado let's get
into it to quickly refresh your memory
the 960 pro is one of the fastest SSDs
on the market that comes in an m2 form
factor its high level of Nan endurance
is a great feature to embrace especially
for professional applications that
heavily rely on reading and writing huge
data sets and they're backed by a
five-year warranty so that's awesome now
setting up a raid array involves some
serious precautionary steps and let's
address the obvious and that's backing
up your existing data it is crucial that
you complete this step as creating a
raid array would completely erase the
data on your existing drives and it's
pretty hard to recover that if you have
an existing SATA raid configuration AMD
recommends that you back up that arrays
data and break down the current array
before proceeding with the driver
install and BIOS upgrade
speaking in which most motherboard
manufacturers should have rolled out a
BIOS update for their ex 399 boards that
basically adds support for nvme raid in
my case I'm using the rog Zenith extreme
x-29 and motherboard and I have a data
the BIOS to version 701 as I'm making
this video this board features a single
- connector right underneath the PCH
that comes with a thermal pad and
there's this a dim dot - card it plugs
into the slot right next to the memory
modules and it can have two additional
MD two drives installed each of which
has access to four dedicated PCI lanes
and this is what we'll be using to mount
the SSDs initially I was thinking of
doing a bootable r8 setup but I thought
to myself that I might complicate things
down the road so I decided to stick with
a non bootable array and use my
three-year-old Samsung 840 pro SSD as my
primary OS drive that's right my friends
I will be using this three-year-old SSD
and believe it or not it's still staying
strong
now the raid array is gonna be used to
store creative applications like
Premiere Pro After Effects Photoshop and
some games so that should contribute
towards a much faster workflow okay so
with that out of the way let's move on
to the setup process after updating the
BIOS I put it into Windows and
downloaded the care package containing
the AMD's raid expert to utility and the
standalone nvme raid driver for Windows
10 directly from a DS website I'll link
that down below I should also mention
that you should be running build 1703 of
Windows as that's what's currently
supported for this setup now the raid
driver is technically embedded within
the executable file ie the utility file
which needs to be extracted I said the
extract destination to the desktop once
the software version was updated I then
rebooted the system and proceeded to
install the expert 2 utility which
annoyingly was deeply hidden within
AMD's root files after installing that I
ran into a problem where the web GUI
didn't allow me to login now by default
the username and password was admin
admin but oddly the submit button wasn't
functioning after spending countless
hours of troubleshooting I finally
figured out the problem
huge shout-out to Wendell from level one
texts who helped me figure out what went
wrong so as you can see with the expert
2 utility the raid level is sent as zero
and that means that the nvme raid
drivers aren't being detected so the
next step was to check out device
manager and see if the drivers were
installed properly now nvme SSDs
required two parts on the software side
to function properly the disk driver and
the nvme controller driver if the UEFI
BIOS is up to date then its device
manager related in this case I was using
Samsung's nvme driver that was
and installed directly from Samsung's
website but in order for raid to
function we have to upgrade that to
AMD's nvme driver so what you want to do
is head over to storage controllers and
select the Samsung and mimic controller
we have two nvme SSDs in this case so we
have to update both of them manually you
then locate the standalone and me me
rate driver zip file that you downloaded
from AMD's website extract that and
locate the RC bottom file within the RS
2 x64 folder repeat that step for the
other controller then navigate down to
system devices find the AMD rate config
device and update that with the RC CFG
file within the RS 2 x64 folder
finally restart services for the rate
expert 2 utility and login once it
create your username and password you'll
be directed to the main menu here we can
see the two 964 SSDs we'll first have to
initialize both drives upon completion
we are ready to create the new raid
array select the two drives name the
array and hit create last thing you want
to do is initialize the disks within the
disk management inside device manager
and you're done now what kind of
performance came expecting when you
decide to put two of these SSDs in raid
0 let's start with Crystal dis Marc we
averaged reach speeds around 6 gigabytes
per second and writes around 4 gigabytes
per second guys that's just that's just
insane I really don't want to what to
say yeah
next up running the a todas benchmark
results in a 3.9 gigabytes per second on
read speeds and three point eight
gigabytes per second on writes a schultz
mentioned that my CPU and memory were
running at stock settings so what
happens when you overclock both of them
would that impact our raid arrays
performance indeed I ran the crystal dis
mark one more time after overclocking
the CPU to 4 gigahertz and the memory to
26 66 megahertz and damn check out those
read speeds just a tad above 7 gigabytes
per second on the read side and 4
gigabytes per second on the write speeds
I ran the a todas benchmark again and
noticed a significant increase in we
performance we're talking an extra
gigabyte per second so to me that was
just phenomenal and this makes sense
because the processor houses the piece
necessary for nvme raid so the faster
the processor the higher the i/o
throughput
I also transferred a 20 gigabyte folder
packed with 4k videos a few game folders
and Excel files and it took roughly 25
seconds to transfer from the desktop to
the 960 pros rate a raid that's pretty
fast but as you can see the speeds are
hitting roughly 1.6 to 1.7 gigabytes per
second on the read side of things and I
guess primary bottleneck here is
obviously the 840 pro SSD performing
that backwards took roughly a minute so
once again this is heavily due to the
bottleneck or the 840 pro SSD being the
bottleneck so I'm going to leave you
guys on that note I definitely like to
hear your thoughts on nvm support for
thread Ripper
especially professionals out there who
have already hopped on to X to $8.99 do
you syrup if you you know currently have
a 964 SSD do you see yourself you know
picking up another drive and configuring
them in raid so get those blazing fast
read and write speeds and of course what
do you think of what kind of
applications do you think might take
advantage of this setup definitely me
know in the comments down below a huge
shout-out to Samsung for sponsoring this
video by the way stay tuned for the full
performance segments of this build it's
still in the works I'm still you know
pulling up putting them together a set
of benchmarks I'd like to run and yeah
stay tuned for the next video until then
