great technology selections and service
all right so the steam castle from deep
cool looks like something out of a Star
Wars themed bought competition I mean
look at those glassy round edges and
overall totally bizarre aesthetics if it
wasn't for that windowed side panel you
definitely think this was some type of
an appliance and we would totally agree
with these exhaust like for circular
vents up top that they're actually
lighting additions and we also have
these radiator like plastic pieces on
each side of the front and to be honest
I kind of liked what they were going for
here but is it functional and obviously
that's the more important thing then the
looks considering this is priced at $100
and given what you can get for $100
today in today's case market we have a
lot of options so you really must be in
love with a design to drop that much
cash into the steam castle
now one disappointing thing right from
the start was the bent frame it looks
like the foam packaging wasn't enough to
withstand the gentle handling of
delivery personnel now in a better note
though the paint job here is done well
with uniform white tones between the
plastic and steel panels that are
somewhat glossy so well done there are a
few ventilation ports at the front like
these radiator looking things without
any dust filtration for some reason plus
some extra venting up top and at the
bottom of the case removing the panel we
find a 200 millimeter fan with really
thin blades that I doubt will do much
for airflow plus a heavily restricted
frame that will reduce the cooling
potential there's a single optical Bay
and a three and a half inch internal bay
only as the front panel doesn't have an
appropriate cutout for the latter all
the connections are on the opposite side
of the window that includes this wheel
for faint speed adjustment for up to
three fans that are SATA powered PR
buttons for USB ports and audio jacks
and I think all these are out of reach
and top placement is more functional
even if it means
find locks also the incredibly
inconvenient process of needing to wire
everything once you close the panel is
just such a pain and it takes away from
the otherwise user-friendly design now
this wheel is also in charge of top LEDs
with three colors available so green red
and blue with brightness control and as
you can see it looks pretty unique they
did really a good job with this type of
lighting implementation the side panel
is large and revealing the back side
includes an exhaust fan for PCI slots as
this does support micro ATX and mini ATX
motherboards a removable dust filter for
your power supply and a little
ventilation behind which a two and a
half inch drive gauge is located at the
bottom we find a few rubber pads along
with indent and ventilation for your
power supply debris removing the top
panel we get centered dual 120 and 140
in amounts but internal mounting only as
there's not enough clearance above the
frame and this very reminiscent of beech
Phenix prodigy and freedom cases as the
internal layout is almost identical
inside we find full twelve inches of
clearance for your graphics card until
you hit the intake fan but the three the
half inch bay does interfere with the
first pci bracket luckily it is
removable also be mindful of the optical
bay above for cable clearance for those
PCI Express cables power supplies up to
170 millimeters are supported but as you
can see it can get really tight given
how little room we have and I would have
liked to see the rear installation
instead of mounting from the side just
to ease the process of assembly as for
storage there only two brackets for
mechanical drives they do widen for
installation so no need to flex the
caddy and they also have centered SSD
mounts and speaking of us is these there
are two dedicated slots or right beside
the power supply that are well utilized
although a third slot would have fit no
problem there are easy to install and
route as all the cabling is right there
plus we have appropriate cutouts on the
motherboard tray for routing everything
into the main chamber now this front
portion is removable or a potential
installation of a front
but this gets rid of all your mechanical
storage and some additional standards
for micro-atx boards and this process is
not made entirely easy at first needing
to peel the rubber at the bottom to
access the screws to remove the bottom
panel one of the screws had a worn
thread that was a slight pick up and the
entire disassembly but luckily I managed
to get it out so with that out of the
way plus the three and a half inch and
the optical base removed you can fit a
240 Milner radiator but it's right in
the center so it is on the way for the
first pci bracket plus limiting GPU
clearance to 11 inches for the set of
fans so if you're considering water
cooling I would suggest utilizing the
top slot for your radiator but still be
mindful of your other options and with
the build complete the internal
structure makes total sense for cable
management with great compartment
separation and appropriate cable routes
for example all the cables are nicely
contained at the bottom and routed
through the cutout for the GPU and a 24
pin cable we used an all-in-one cooler
that fit well with the build and
assembly process to the most part was
smooth without any problems that is
until you have to put on that side panel
and magically become the cable
management master and so the steam
castle does a lot of things well
starting with the exterior looks that
are unique and well not for everyone of
course the implementation of LED
lighting really makes this stand out the
internal structure is well put together
with enough storage potential modular
design to cater to your hardware and the
appropriate cable routing with chamber
separation if you think stowe we would
love to see changed is to relocate that
three and a half inch bracket off center
so you can still utilize it without
compromising or GPU clearance a
rear-mounted power supply would be more
ideal and side ports and buttons need to
be moved somewhere to the front or the
top to avoid the hassle of dealing with
all those cables also the process of
removing the support frame for
installation of a front radiator
definitely needs to be simplified but
what do you guys think of this approach
from deep cool with the steampunk style
chassis as aside from mostly functional
in turn
you've really gotta love the exterior
looks for this to house your next build
