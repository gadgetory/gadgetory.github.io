great technology selections and service
what's up guys I'm Dimitri with Harbor
Canucks and I think we can all agree
that the phablet as a category is quite
risky as it combines the form factor of
a tablet with functionality of a
smartphone and if any of the score
elements of those two devices if any of
those core elements are not done
properly then what is the point
the Acer s1 is almost a year old that
has just been released in Canada it is
unlocked and goes for a whopping 300 $79
off contract and right away you can
think of many smartphones within this
price range that offer better specs
better screens like the Nexus 5 so let's
see whether or not the s1 is just way
too late into the game with its outdated
specs low performance and realistically
really low res display for 2014 whoa
it's rocking immediate a quad core ARM
chip at 1.5 gigahertz with only one gig
of ram 8 gigabytes of storage and
running mostly stock android jelly bean
4.2 it features Bluetooth 4.0
accelerometer g-sensor
cellular bands do not include LTE or 4G
there's no landscape mode on the front
page and the 5.7 inch screen is IPS
however with only 720p resolution that
scales everything way too large for this
size so there's obvious color shifting
with the display especially the viewing
anything in vertical the greys become
yellow which is unpleasant specifically
for email and unless you're looking
directly at the phone your viewing
angles and your viewing experience will
suffer now the phablet is large as
expected - in operation as needed the
physical characteristics are not
impressive or just ok plastic housing
then better curve for the speaker that
collected dust really quickly the
built-in capacitive buttons actually
like that somewhat resemble Android L
design direction the two aluminum strips
running in each side
adds a bit to the design but both the
power button on the left
the volume rocker on the right are
completely horrendous and I don't use
that word often so they offer very
little if any feedback the power button
is actually very loose another sample
you can actually hear it rattling and
the same goes for the volume rocker they
don't provide any tactile response and
they squish in instead of actually
clicking in and also notice the power
button and the volume rocker right
across from each other which means that
accidental turning off the phone as
you're trying to adjust the volume was
very common and vice versa the headphone
jack is up top and the microUSB port at
the bottom the back cover is somewhat
rubberized with curvy sides for better
handling you can see the protruding
camera lens along with complementing
flash the camera is 8 megapixels and
takes a less than average pictures but I
do have to praise them for really quick
autofocus and firing something that I'm
not used to on my Nexus 4 we do have
1080p recording as you can see right now
we're recording with image stabilization
on which is digital so it does zoom in
on the image slightly but we do have all
the controls for the exposure so it's
awesome to see if to really fine-tune
how you want the image to look and so
this is the sample looks pretty good
behind the removable cover we find a
2400 milliamp hour battery with a micro
SD card slot and the SIM slot and
battery life with Wi-Fi and 3G
connectivity certainly well into two
days which is refreshing again there's
my Nexus 4 barely lasts a full day
anymore
so one very important element missing
from the s1 is a notification indicator
you know that thing that blinks to
indicate if you have an unread mail
missed a phone call or you have some
pending text messages well the s-1
doesn't have that you have to physically
turn on device and that's very
unpleasant considering the power button
is garbage now you do have third-party
apps to you know for this type of
notification stuff but the fact that the
score feature is missing from the phone
is disappointing
now the rear-facing speaker isn't that
great that's right here it's very tiny
regardless of the DTS studio sound
certification it's not very good I've
missed a lot of phone calls while being
outdoors
simply because I cannot hear the the
sound on this phone
but maybe the vibration of the phone
you might detect that
something-something is incoming but
that's on the case the vibration is very
weak and like I think you can't feel it
once inside my pants and also when it's
on the surface you can actually hear the
vibrating which is a big which is a big
mistake
and actually getting a phone call right
now and I wouldn't have known unless you
know we said this out but this is a
phone call from Eber and as you can hear
it's actually not very loud and being
outside being in a loud environment you
would have missed this important call
phone call from potentially an very
important person to now speaking of
sound quality call reception and call
quality has been pretty good however the
actual speakerphone here on top which
from which you hear the other person on
the other line is very quiet even at
100% volume and you also have to
position it in a very strange way in
order to sort of get it inside your ear
for you to hear what's what's incoming
and I think for a sir to mess up this
very important element and a smart phone
is a very disappointing for this price
bracket so the s-1 is mainly running
stock Android 4.2 without any annoying
Acer skin which I'm really happy about
but let's be realistic Android 4.2 is
outdated it's inefficient
we are already introducing androids l2
devices so asa really should check
themselves and push these updates
towards these smart phones that are only
now launching in Canada second the
phablet experience is sluggish and I
don't mean clicking the icon tray button
to see the stutter I mean really laggy
Google Hangouts where the animation
takes forever to process when you send a
message or when turning on the phone and
the clock widget needs to update to the
latest time with a clearly visible lag
or when hitting into any of the four
apps from the shortcuts on a lock screen
and this is just not on par to what
we've come to expect for a smart phone
in this price bracket
and running a few benchmarks and the
results really solidify poor Android
performance as the hardware is well
below average so there's the benchmarks
right there you have three phones you
know because we set up the shop like
this for productivity acer includes a
few float apps present hold the
multitask button to access a row that
allows multi window overlay but due to
such low resolution it's almost
impractical to have them open at the
same time and I found them completely
useless and the only float application I
appreciate is incoming phone call that
doesn't occupy the whole screen so
there's no interruptions on what you're
doing and after using the S one for
three weeks I was very happy to switch
back to my Nexus 4 as it features the
same resolution it's much more
appropriate form factor for that
resolution it's much faster in all
fronts and it's also cheaper so there
was a no-brainer for me
so the acer liquid s1 is well behind the
times to be considered worthy and while
I can appreciate the expandable storage
with a microSD slot and mainly stock UI
I think it's fails in many core
categories for both as a smartphone and
the tablet first the outdated version of
Android followed by the low res display
for this fight when seven inch form
factor poorly designed known tactile
buttons and uncomfortable placement of
them really weak rear facing speaker and
almost unnoticeable vibration koval U is
not loud enough and in loud environments
is really difficult to hear the person
on the other line
and finally the performance is really
poor and constantly noticed laggy
animations and for the price it is
really difficult to recommend the s1 but
what do you think of the phablet
category in general the LG g3 for
example and the note 3 seem to hit every
element right with regards to user
experience for the splurge form factor
of course they're twice the price of the
s1 but still the s1 for the price is
uncompetitive in today's market alright
guys thanks for watching our view of the
s-1 phablets from Acer make sure you

we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
