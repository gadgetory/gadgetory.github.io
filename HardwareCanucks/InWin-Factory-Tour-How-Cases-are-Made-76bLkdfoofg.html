Dax and I'm Eva with hurricane axe you
guys probably realized that already but
today is the official launch of Computex
2016 and we start off this show with a
little trip for a factory tour within
win huge thanks to our Computex sponsors
for sending us out here
shout out to nvidia fantex NCIX and msi
so the first thing we did when we got to
the factory was visit their power supply
testing room which had a bunch of rocks
and they hook up the power supplies in
there to test how the power supply
behaves they go through three different
temperatures trip temperature modes but
the boom doesn't have any AC it smelled
a little strange I'm happy there was a
fan inside but then we got to visit a
really cool electromagnetic interference
room so apparently they put a case in
there and they test out how much
emissions interference there is from the
Box the antenna or whatever device that
was pointing at your source that looked
pretty intimidating it was fairly large
and then we moved on to the semi
anechoic chamber and this is where they
tested the noise levels of cases for and
they had different settings and of
course when we walked in we were able to
like hear our own blood flow after a few
minutes and then I was able to hear my
camera which was kind of weird the thing
is with a/c 100 it has an actual fan in
there but you never hear it because in a
normal environment that fan is very very
quiet and the ambient noise even if
you're in a silent environment drowns
out any noise of the electronics so for
example that the camera was all you
could hear that you could hear things
from the phones and then we moved into
the best part of the factory that was
how they actually is they had these
separate molding parts and once they
installed the molding parts inside the
actual manufacturing
mean they were able to mold certain
parts of the case and we were able to
see how the actual plastic parts were
coming out from the actual machine and
they had different textures so I was
actually told that they set it to
different temperatures for different
textures and that was really interesting
well just being able to see the molding
for like a power button really opens
your mind that how much goes into
production of an enclosure regardless of
how simple or advanced it is you always
it's something that you never see we
were also interested to see just how a
sheet of metal just transformed into a
side panel with all the details of
course the logo so in this case we were
able to see how they were able to
engrave the asu's logo on one of the
side panels and those really cool to
actually see it in person they have a
really cool laser cutting machine that
was producing not many sparks but the
noise oh my god because they have the it
was an aluminium piece and the aluminum
piece is covered in a blue film and the
blue films supposed to protect any burns
or like anything that would defect the
aluminum itself but also they had plenty
of almost conveyor belts in terms of
like you said taking a piece of metal
cutting it up to to whatever size to
whatever thing and then you can they
were bending it so the machine it was a
conveyor belt of carrying all these
parts and was very interesting to see
the behind-the-scenes of how case is
made we were also able to see how the
cases were painted so it actually goes
through a real cool process of just
having a little thin blade and it just
goes up and down so it just finishes
that nice it gives you a nice paint job
on the actual case and that was also
really cool to see inside the factory
yeah I was surprised to find out that
the smell of paint wasn't as strong as I
was expecting to be because you're
literally the next room which is open
and there's fans everywhere I asked them
what they do with this water because it
looked quite gross yeah so we're told
that they dry the water
and then whatever's left is a solid and
they discard the solid so aside from all
the production things that we're seeing
it in the in the factories we also got
the little sneak peek in their design
facility so we actually met when they're
in when designers in their in-house
designers and their new product with the
LED fans that have a detachable cable
and they have a LED system that's built
into it that is cohesive with an
addition of LED strips so you can add
LED strips to the same daisy chain
between LED fans and other other LED
strips and they will all be controlled
it with individual LED control through
this hub and that's one of the that's
going to be the next level of
customization for computer builds
because right now we have the hue plus
which is awesome but it's only LED
strips you can't connect the fans here
so they're taking the next step further
we'll see how it plays out but the cool
thing is because the cable from the fan
is removable what your end up left with
is so you can put three fans by the
radiator and instead of each fan having
their own connector you can have these
little interconnectors between the fans
that connect each other and therefore in
the end you are left with one single
cable that you connect to the hub and
then from the hub you can control the
fan speed and there's a remote and
there's multiple lighting modes I am
actually very excited to see this
product come to market because that's
like the dream come true in terms of
customization for LED lighting for your
case you know having cohesive lighting
between fans and LED strips so we were
told that there are a total of 600
employees working in the factory and the
manufacturing is actually taken by order
so they had we were able to actually see
basically from start to finish of how
every individual was doing something
with the case and then it eventually
gets into the packaging and it's yeah
shipped and it says that it chips in
about one to two days after the orders
actually been made so that's pretty fast
let's bring it variable imagine like or
you're in the issues and you order 300
cases and then within two days all that
is being sure
- yeah so one of the cool things we were
able to take a look at the factory was
the quality control center and they had
this 3d analyzing machine where when you
place a part computer part onto the
machine it detects the dimensions of
that part and I was told that the
dimensions were measured in micrometers
so it's very precise and that was really
cool to actually you know witness and
that concludes our debrief on the
factory tour with in win fantastic
experience be able to see how products
made behind the scenes before things get
too in our reviewer hands you know for
the retail product this was your first
time with a factory tour of this caliber
what are your impressions in three words
it was amazing all right all right so
guys make sure to check out our in win
three or three case review actually the
coincidence that they kind of aligned
with this coverage of that you're
watching now thanks so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
