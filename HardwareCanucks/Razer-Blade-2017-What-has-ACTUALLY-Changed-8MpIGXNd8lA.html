axe and welcome back to another video a
few months ago we took a look at the
2016 razor blade 14 notebook I really
enjoyed my experience with that machine
because for its price it obviously was a
little expensive but the performance
packed under the hood really impressed
me in the first place and I have a few
concerns with the 2016 notebook or the
model and it was something that could
have been addressed with the 2017
version and that's what I have right
here it's the 2017 razor blade notebook
it looks exactly the same
I was expecting something different but
unfortunately they haven't really
changed anything from a design
perspective so let's take a look at what
razor has changed right after this
introducing the new OC CVX 500
solid-state drives from Toshiba
it offers great well balanced speeds
build with MOC NAND flash for superior
endurance and is also backed by five
year advanced warranty program learn
more about the VX 500 at OCC comm so
from my physical standpoint you really
can't tell the difference between the
2016 model and the 2017 model everything
from the design to the build quality to
the keyboard layout to the trackpad to
the display looks exactly the same
in fact the they do have an option for a
4k uhd touch panel which is a pretty
interesting variant because I think
you'll be pushing it to the gtx 960 a
lot higher but if you want to absolute
best of the best you have that option
but do note that it's going to cost you
a fortune what has changed in the 2017
model is the processor so in this case
we have a core i7 7700 HQ cpu clocked at
2.8 gigahertz that can trigger boost up
to 3.8 gigahertz whereas the 2016 model
featured a 6700 HQ CPU clocked at 2.6
key words that could turbo boost up to
3.5 years so there's a little bit of
variance II between the base and boost
clock frequencies so perhaps that could
affect gaming frame rates you never know
we'll find out in the benchmarks and now
let's start pricing because the 2017
model the one I have right here is the
base configuration so it has a 256
gigabyte SSD and it costs $1,900 that's
a steep price to pay for a gaming
notebook in 2017 in my opinion because
there
a much better alternatives like the Dell
XPS 15 that does have option for Sorge
expansion which the 2017 model lacks so
that is a deal-breaker to me personally
do note that wages still sells B 2016
models at discounted prices with higher
storage configurations but you have to
keep in mind that you are paying for a
slightly outdated sixth generation
processor razor I understand that you're
trying to market the blade 14 as the
perfect portable companion for gamers on
the go but personally I think that the
256 kilobyte option is pointless and
guys there's a reason for that think
about it this way when you opt for the
256 gigabyte base model and if you're
planning on using the blade 14 solely
for gaming you won't be able to load up
your entire game library onto the SSD in
my case I was only able to load a
battlefield 1 doom overwatch and a few
benchmarks and I was already running out
of space in my and in my case I only had
20 gigabytes left which is kind of
ridiculous but razored has an option to
upgrade the storage game to 1 terabytes
but they're going to charge you $600 and
to me that's ridiculous I think you'll
be much better off upgrading the SSD by
yourself for a lot less I had a few
concerns with the 2016 model that I did
mention in my full review but one of
them was obviously the lack of backlit
on these secondary keys unfortunately
Razer has not addressed that in the 2017
model which is disappointing and the
second thing is the lack of an SD card
reader because as a content creator it
is an important factor for me personally
especially when I'm traveling I don't
like to carry around third-party
adapters and if I look at id competitors
like the XPS 15 it has one and I think
the Razer Blade should - and look I love
the design of the Razer Blade 14 and I
appreciate racer for cramming in a GTX
1060 and a quad core i7 processor but it
does come with its own compromises and
one of them is obviously temperatures
and fan noise
the 2017 model is still loud under load
so I would highly recommend headphones
if you're planning on using this thing
for gaming but during idle it's actually
a lot quieter than the 2016 model and
the reason behind that is because they
managed to tune down the fan RPMs so it
runs a lot quieter but there are a few
negatives to that which I'll talk about
soon the display hasn't changed
whatsoever you're still getting the same
14 inch matte 1080p display which is the
base model but now with the 2017 model
you do have the option to opt for a 4k
uhd touch display versus the 2016 model
had the option for a qHD touch display
with a resolution of 3200 by 1800 versus
3840 by 2160 honestly I think you'll end
up pushing the gtx 1060 a lot more than
you'd normally do and don't expect
acceptable frame rates playing games at
Ultra settings with a 10 60 at 4k and
with such a high resolution expect
shorter battery life in this case with
if you opt for a 4k UHD display Windows
is a little finicky with scaling but I
think 1080p makes more sense and check
out these bezels
I mean I'm spoiled by the thin and low
profile designs found in the XPS 15 and
LG Graham but its 2017 so I'm hoping I'm
expecting razor to provide a thinner
bezels in their next revision so the
only differences between the 2016 model
and the 2017 model being the CPU the
processors what kind of a performance
gain would you or would you be able to
get with the newer models let's take a
look starting with battlefield 1 at
1080p set to high settings you can see
that there's a 6 frames per second boost
on the 2017 played compared to the 2016
variant featuring the skylake processor
moving on to overwatch well the results
were a bit odd especially since this
game has received a lot of patches ever
since I tested the 2016 blade
nonetheless both these models were
averaging well over 90 frames per second
and our last test is due at 1080p set to
high settings and interestingly enough
both models performed similarly
averaging over 130 pins per second
taking a look at CPU temperatures the
2017 blade ran about 10 degrees hotter
than the 2016 model and while that might
seem a little misleading I think I might
have the answer to that you see in my
2016 blade review I mentioned how the
fans
a little bit louder than expected during
health situations the 2017 model is a
lot quieter given that the fans are
spinning a lot slower which would then
yield higher temperatures under load the
2017 blade ran a lot cooler than the
previous model thanks to the much
efficient cable a chip the same story
applies for the GPU temperatures during
idle the GTX 1060 ran a lot hotter than
last year's model once again due to the
slower spinning fans although the low
temperatures remained identical and here
are some synthetic benchmarks for future
reference including W prime sky diver in
Cinebench r15 so guys there you have it
a quick look at the 2017 razor blade
notebook I honestly wish Razer had
addressed the issues that I had with the
2016 model on the 2017 model but
unfortunately we only get a updated a
cable ache processor I also hope Razer
could include flexible pricing options
in their next revision of the blade 14
notebook for example they can include a
Core i5 processor with a gtx 750 or 1050
TI that way you can expect lower
temperatures quieter operation and
better battery life and I think that
would make a lot more sense in such a
thin chassis and that concludes my
experience using the 2017 razor blade
notebook for the past few weeks I want
to hear your thoughts about this what do
you think razor could have done to
revamp their current razor blade
notebook let us know in the comments
down below
I'm your with Harken axe thank you so
much and I'm Dimitri do it seriously you
ruin my conclusion man I'm Evo retard
okay next thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
