when you hear the term RGB because it's
everywhere people love RGB for some
reasons some people hate it for other
reasons and if you were to take a few
steps back a few years ago gaming
companies started implementing VAR gb in
their gaming peripherals gaming
keyboards had that he might hide that
and now we're slowly starting to see
gaming headset adapting that feature
which i think is pointless because when
you're wearing an RGB gaming headset
you're really not noticing what's going
on because you're so focused on gameplay
but I think in my opinion that's just a
marketing strategy but why is it so
important why are people embracing RGB
why is it a must-have feature in a
gaming peripheral or gaming mouse or
perhaps even a GP or a motherboard it's
pretty straightforward because people
want to color coordinate their setup to
a particular color scheme so in my case
I love the color blue I'd love to have a
blue team set up but sometimes I'd like
to change things here and there
depending on my mood and I want to set
it with my own color schemes so there
are few lighting effects that you can
take advantage of with RGB if you have
that implementation now we're slowly
starting to see case manufacturers take
advantage of that and that's awesome
because when you have case lighting
inside built into the case you can take
advantage of its lighting effects
through software and you can control the
lighting effects through software I'm so
excited to show you guys what I've been
working with the past few days and you
can sort of take a look at it behind me
right there this is the novice 450 ROG
from the folks over at NZXT now I know
what you're thinking it wasn't this case
around a few years back yes you are
right
and in fact Dimitri has taken an
in-depth look at the case so I'll leave
a link in the description if you're
interested in the full review this case
is a little different from its older
brother because NZXT has collaborated
with ROG to emphasize the RGB lighting
compatibility with a chooses or a sink
and I'll get to that shortly it's also
geared towards users who are picked up
in ROG motherboard in our og GPU
build and rog based gaming PC and I just
can't believe I said ROG more than two
times but regardless let's dive in right
after this
creativity is fueled by the best
instruments it doesn't always come easy
and in the process you often realize how
important quality is the Rd 400 by OCC
gives you quality and speed with M de to
interface the schieben and flash and a
PCI bracket making it possible to focus
on what matters
investing storage that makes a
difference with a five-year advance
warranty
alright let's address the price point of
the Knox's 450 ROG because it does not
come cheap price at $180 it competes
against the Atlantic's evolved 80 xt g
the 570 hex from corsair the master case
maker 5 from Coolermaster and a few more
so what makes this case stand out from
the competition well there's the ROG
branding with the subtle aggressive
design elements on the side panels the
exterior has received a gun great finish
complimenting a gun great paint
motherboard and I'll admit the analysis
for 50 was originally designed to go
hand in hand as an ROG exclusive gaming
PC I mean just look at it
everything from the angular front and
top panels to the aggressive vents for
proper air flow
describes NZXT slub 4 ROG now the make
things even better this case features or
a sync RGB lighting technology what that
means is that there's basically RGB
lighting everywhere and I mean
everywhere and that is software
controllable including the under glow
the 2 LED strips can say - I see one at
the top and one at the bottom the logo
engraved into the power supply shroud
and the power button has also received
this treatment I have to admit the
attention to detail in terms of lighting
has not been compromised and I
appreciate MCHC for setting that
standard and that's the main selling
point for the Noctis 450 ROG or a sync
allows all the LEDs display the exact
same color
literally exact color coordination since
it comes from one source which is a
motherboard
there is something that I'd love in
Dixie to address in their next revision
and that is the GPU compatibility for
example I used the Strix Arts 480 to
test the aura compatibility and to my
surprise the included hardware bracket
got in the way when mounting this card
obviously eliminating that solved the
issue if you're planning to take
advantage of all six drive bays you
might be disappointed the rest of the
components were thrown in for aesthetic
purposes for example the mighty Kraken X
62 was mounted on top of the 1700 X the
showcase that gorgeous infinity edge
display
speaking of these 1700 X I'm currently
in the process of switching over to it
as my primary rendering workhorse so I'm
super excited for that and stay tuned
for that video for the benchmarks the
rog crosshair 6 here on motherboard was
an excellent fit for the case because it
features two 12-volt RGB headers one of
which gets populated by the four pin RGB
cable for the case lining and it works
fantastic the dominators special edition
memory kit from Corsair adds a little
bit of character to the build showcasing
the white LEDs but if you're serious
about color coordination G skills tried
and Zr GB memory would be an excellent
fit as not only it looks sexy AF but
it's orison compatible as well taking a
look at the software it's fairly simple
and intuitive to control lighting in my
case I'm greeted with various lighting
effects tabs like static breathing color
cycle rainbow comment flash and - which
sounds ridiculous strobing option for
the LEDs to react according to system
temperature and music each can be set to
either synchronized across components or
set individually including the PCH
districts and the GPU I wish there was
brightness control options to slightly
tone down the color but perhaps we could
expect that in a firmer update well guys
there you have it a simple and short
showcase video featuring the NZXT Noctis
450 ROG I was definitely excited when
this case showed up in the studio
because I had the right components lying
around to take advantage of the lying
capabilities with Aurra
the ROG crosshair 60 or motherboard was
a beast and it's a great foundation if
you're looking to build an X 370 based
high-end
rising gaming system the other
components were sort of hand-picked the
memory was just lying around but it
looks pretty cool the Corsair memory
just
fantastic and also blends in really well
with the set but I did have a small wish
I did wish for something that NTC could
work on the future and that is support
for their new a aya coolers to take
advantage of the Orlan capabilities
because I've used the X 62 or I've
currently used the X 62 to cool these
1,700 x inside that case and the only
way to control lighting is through a cam
software but maybe a Susan NZXT can work
some way to sort of link both those
software so we can synchronize lighting
effects throughout the entire systems or
components so I think they'll be pretty
awesome but it's also challenging but I
want to hear your guys or I want to hear
your thoughts about this build or this
case what do you guys think about it
are you sold on the whole RGB thing plus
what are your thoughts on or
capabilities leave a comment down below
I'm evil with hurricane X thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one oh hey there NCI XCOM is
Canada's leading a tailor for anything
your mind desires just keep within those
categories which are plenty and get
tempted by the weekly deals visit ncx
calm for all those sweet deals</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
