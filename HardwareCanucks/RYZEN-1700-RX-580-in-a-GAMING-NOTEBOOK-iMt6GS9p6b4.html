axe and there's a cool notebook that we
have to check out now i know there's a
lot of hype regarding the cyprus
notebook from asus the gtx 1080 and the
cool ventilation features but this is an
awesome notebook
it's a rise in notebook so let's check
it out right after this our complex trip
is brought to you by fan tech
schoolmaster and msi alright guys i know
it might seem a bit odd that we're
excited about a true AMD gaming notebook
but that's because we haven't seen one
in years
you see AMD just hasn't been competitive
in the gaming laptop market because
they're a pues it just went up for the
task and their mobile GPUs table has
been remarkably empty that's all about
to change
but for the time being asus has decided
to mix the desktop and noble components
for these tricks gl7 or 2zc from all the
outward appearances it doesn't look any
different from a normal slim gaming
notebook actually it's just one point
three inches thick and weighs less than
seven pounds asus is also given it a
high-end look with a brushed metal
chassis and a few splashes of red to
even things out seeing a good connector
layout and a full sized SD card slot is
always good too now in the demo that was
showcased at Computex there was a rising
70 70 100 a Radeon Arc's 580 GPU 16
gigabytes of memory and a one terabyte
sshd when this eventually launches into
retail channels there will also be a
horizon 5 1600 and rising 3 1200
processors available in some
configurations ironically this is the
first time we've seen official
confirmation of the existence of a
rising 3 1200 as you also mention that
there are full desktop CPUs operating at
slightly lower voltages rather than
being processors specifically designed
for notebooks
this is because Amy's Raven Ridge
platforms which is more targeted towards
mainstream desktops and notebooks isn't
out yet those processor options will be
available alongside a number of storage
options like one terabyte SSH DS and
nvme SSDs in capacities up to 512
gigabytes asus is also providing quick
access for storage and memory upgrades
so you can always add more if necessary
these 17.3 inch screen means the Strix
GL 7 or 2 isn't exactly a compact gaming
notebook either but
we'll be a number of contesting panel
options all of which support freesync
there will be a 4k 60 Hertz 1080p 75
Hertz and 1080p 120 Hertz variations
after seeing it in action we still have
some questions mostly about battery life
the 11 7 1700 is a 65 watt processor and
if Asus is using a full arcs 580 that's
another 150 watts provided that they're
using a standard version so either there
will need to be a huge battery in this
thing or it won't last all that long
away from a power source I'm sure we'll
have all the information about
configurations and pricing when this
notebook becomes available sometime in
August or September I really can't wait
to get my hands on one but until then
you can dream about having all of these
rising goodness in a portable form
factor so I want to know your thoughts
about the Strix GL 702 arisin notebook
what do you guys think about it
do you think $1400 for an 8 core CPU and
an Rx 580 it's worth it let us know in
the comments down below
stay tuned for more complex coverage I'm
you bars heart connectors thank you so
much for watching I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
