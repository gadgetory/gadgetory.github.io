showcase we're taking a look at the
Silverstone Raven our vo to the second
case the silver stones unique Raven
series now like the original the O two
features a unique design that carries
some similar aspects to its sibling but
really it's a whole new breed of case
they've continued to use the innovative
stack cooling effect which has the
motherboard rotated on a 90 degree angle
however as you'll see they've also made
some major design changes that hopefully
are for the best the case currently
retails for just under the $200 price
tag and that lumps it in with some very
popular competition so what exactly does
the Raven are vo to offer that sets it
apart well let's take a look one thing
you notice right off the bat is that the
Raven is a bit of a funky shape
it's rectangle as opposed to the usual
square it measures 19 point 8 inches
high 8.3 inches wide and 25 point 3
inches long body is constructed out of a
very solid steel and accented with
plastic for the top and front panels
weighs a hefty 27.6 pounds first on the
list is the top panel we have our power
and reset buttons along with just a
simple two USB and audio jacks
like the rvo one there is an angled blue
LED bar along the top and the front face
has a uniform angle design jumping to
the bottom we have three major air
intake ports this is the source of the
Ravens cooling and then at the very
bottom we have holes for water coolant
tubes now because of the relined
motherboard some things really aren't
where they should be at the back we have
just a removable dust filter over top of
the power supply so where your
connections go well up back to the top
removing a portion of the panel it gives
you your typical layout at the back the
power supply area along with three fan
controls 120 millimeter exhaust fan io
area and eight PCI expansion slots along
with plenty of venting so if you weren't
already a bit confused silverstone has
also swapped the access side panel over
to the right side of the case release a
few thousands
and it easily pulls off revealing a well
painted black interior at the bottom is
one of the literally big features of the
case it's completely taken up by three
massive 180 millimeter fans and they all
include easy to remove dust filters
focusing on the motherboard tray the
case supports SSI CEB ATX and M ATX form
factors and there are plenty of spaces
around the motherboard tray in order to
run wires from behind they've also
included a heatsink backplate opening
everything's a bit flipped around but
it's all going to make sense when fully
assembled on the bottom at the right we
have the hard drive bays and then for
five and a quarter inch ROM bays with
the familiar looking screwless system
the drive bay cage is actually held in
by four thumb screws on each side of the
case and there is no screwless or rack
style setup in order to easily swap the
drives the cage has rubber grommets in
order to reduce the noise and as you can
see supports only three yes three hard
drives now before we get started on the
build let's take a quick look at the
accessories they've included an SSD
bracket which won't eat up a hard drive
space 3.5 inch drive Bay brackets along
with a three by three pin molex adapter
in order to plug in those 180 millimeter
fans there is also radiator brackets a
power supply tie-down strap and a front
3.5 inch cover so when fully assembled
you get a better understanding of the
reason for the rotation hot air rises
the power hosts of fans at the bottom
are there to keep things cool and the
sideways angle of the board means that
you won't have the hot air from the
video card going up into the CPU like
you would with more traditional
alignment now despite the fact that the
Raven RV o2 is a full tower with the
giant fans at the bottom and the
rectangle design it really doesn't feel
like it has a lot of room inside and we
found the process of actually assembling
the unit a little bit tricky
installing the cd-rom drive actually
required us to bust out the installation
manual in order to find out how it's
done
apparently the trick is to find a
screwdriver thin enough to fit into
these little oval holes along the side
and push the front cover out from there
however the screwless locking system is
really simple
also while the case has no trouble
fitting longer cards if you intend on
filling your bottom PCI Express slot
you're going to have to be prepared to
fight for room with your hard drives in
our case the issue actually prevented
our video card from installing it all
now Silverstone has included a good
number of cable spacing options in the
motherboard tray in order to run wires
up the back and then out the front in
order to keep things relatively clean
however there isn't a lot of room
between the back panel and the tray so
you're not going to be able to store any
wires there and you're likely going to
have to spend extra time making sure
that thicker cables aren't clumped up or
crossing each other in order to be able
to fit the back panel on now the major
attraction to the Raven rvo 2 is that
it's unique design promises to deliver
some exceptional cooling so of course we
had to put it to the test
the rvo 2 really pulled it off it
literally forces all of the warm air out
at the top and then brings in the cool
air from the bottom and because of its
orientation
none of this hot air passes over the
other components it's relatively simple
but it's an incredibly effective design
and that wraps up our look at the
silverstone Raven rvo 2 the company has
done an excellent job in taking their
original concept with the RV o1 and
revamping it into a case that
aesthetically is likely to appeal to a
larger audience it's a great looking
case that has a lot to offer with its
unique concept and best of all they're
innovative stack cooling effect really
works
it's a chassis to consider for those who
may be having airflow problems on the
flip side it has its fair share of
nagging issues for starters space for
only three hard drives is definitely too
few and then on top of this they've made
the process of installing devices fairly
complicated having to juggle dozens of
screws completely opposite to the
simplified clean and screwless direction
that a majority of manufacturers are
going I hope you enjoyed our product
