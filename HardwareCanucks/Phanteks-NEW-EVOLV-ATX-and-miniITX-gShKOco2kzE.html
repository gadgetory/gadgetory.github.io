award-winning fan tax and our trusted
memory partner Corsair visiting fan
Texas wheat was plenty exciting as we've
got to see the progression of the evolve
line and they sure do not disappoint
first the original enthu evolve now
comes in this beautiful sandblasted
metallic gray that now actually looks
like aluminum whereas with the white or
black versions the glossy finish took
away from that aluminum aesthetic so
fantex definitely took the hint they are
expanding the line in both directions
satisfying builders on to more fronts
now with a mini ITX Edition and an ATX
addition as people have been asking for
it the evolved mini isn't the final name
yet but the goal here is to keep the
price down as they're trying to reach
that $69 mark there are physical
similarities with the external frame
although now with the plastic and steel
construction and not aluminum the
internals are fully ready for an
enthusiast mini ITX water cooling system
as the top fan mount actually slides out
for easier installation this is
brilliant front intake is adequate
you've got flexible rear exhaust
potential with flexible strips and one
cool element is this a swivel panel on
the additional brackets for easier
installation and removal of the GPU
coming around to the back an SSD bracket
is included plus the bottom drive cage
is completely removable for installation
of larger power supply units moving on
to the ATX version of the Evolve
it also carries several similar features
of the original like the swivel side
door panel an internal layout to
accommodate for work willing no problem
the top fan bracket also pulls out for
easier installation outside of the case
for this awesome direct airflow delivery
for the main components and that single
SSD bracket in the front to show off
your speedy drive now if you've also
listened to our feedback about the i/o
placement and it is now at the front
where it should be with the top power
button of course behind the motherboard
tray it looks very familiar from what
we've seen already from them with a
single SSD bracket
hub and fantex velcro straps for some
awesome cable management and so the
evolve line has definitely managed to
grow significantly to cover a larger
market share so make sure you subscribe
for one our full reviews of these cases
came out thanks for watching and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
