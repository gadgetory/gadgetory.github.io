reckon acts and recently we got our
participate in a fantastic collaboration
featuring some of the tech tubers from
canada from the GTA toronto area which
was so awesome and tell us to experience
the new Samsung Galaxy s7 phone as an
entertainment device given it's too
fantastic elements of beautiful screen
and it's water resistant features so
make sure to stay until the end of the
video to learn how you can win a brand
new Galaxy s7 and so we get to hang out
with Carl coonrod Matt Moniz can nuptse
and Patrick from mobile syrup and just
the you're there an awesome bunch and
Eva was there and with me to participate
in the s7 showdown and capture our angle
of the entire adventure and so we were
first inside the telus store and Eaton
Centre Toronto to shoot the introduction
for the main video where all of us were
encouraged to bash on other contestants
to create this competitive atmosphere
and it was really awesome to see
everyone in their element with creating
this video I do not win today's
challenge Ivan be sorely disappointed
with myself everyone's looking pretty
soft so I better come out on top I'd
need breakfast I normally don't eat
breakfast so what I do and I like to
think that I'm known for fighting
wasting integrate my cat into my reviews
today we're here I'm gonna crush these
guys in our major competition I've been
training my whole entire life for this
day he jumps I'm going down and so after
we were done inside the telus store in
Toronto it was time to hit the streets
and then over to the headquarters of
tellus which was just a few a few blocks
away and this is where things get a bit
interesting where we get to take out the
s7s shoot our journey on our walk
experience slow-mo and hyperlapse
and at one point during our walk there
was a beautiful view of the CN Tower
we're just passing by was Front Street
and I started recording in slow motion
trying to reach for the CN Tower and
this is what happened
to this batch is a little bit hot there
you see it yeah yeah and then right over
here as a scuff so once we get inside
the tower this is where the elevator of
youtubers looks like close walk over
there is also me around hiding before
talking to a camera so you just pray
that up in this video now so the first
challenge but the s7 showdown is
navigating the oily with the s7 which
was actually a lot of fun and you have
to go through an obstacle course as you
get water gun by three other people so
we were outside of this challenge which
proved to test our Canadian business
because it was cold and we were
eventually about to get wet but that is
the track behind this I'm going to try
to use the oly is the finish line which
is right behind me here remember those
the fastest get the old
look he is wet so now I'm wet but I'm
the only one that got it through that
ramp into the pit that's right so after
we were done there we went up to the
30th for which had such an awesome view
and holy crap the auto focus on the s7
is absolutely amazing it literally just
snaps and focus not just for pictures
but for video as well so the next
challenge for us is to wear the gear VR
play some creepy VR demo walk through
this little obstacle course with the
desks as our teammates helped out with
directions on where to move and how to
navigate across these tables which will
be changed for with every new run and in
the very end look what we got we got a
nice friendly panda you can give it a
hug whatever else
villa
and so that is a wrap until tomorrow
morning and so after we're finished with
the first two challenges the next
morning we got to do a little bit of
work out bright and early 7am we want to
pursuit OCR which is a fantastic adult
obstacle course so there's a bunch of
ropes lots of bars you can climb on and
everything and a really good way to test
out to see if you know you think you're
out of shape which I thought I wasn't
but it turns out I am you know maybe
perhaps it's because Carl standing there
and just looking really buff and you
know maybe me standing right next to
Carl may not be so good for consonants
so much movement yeah but you look good
you've got a good shoes and a nice shirt
yes and so after we completed all of our
runs I came in third which is not bad
you know right in the middle there I'm
the median in this group but it was
awesome for tells to encourage this type
of athletic involvement and throw a
little bit physical reality into my face
which was needed who's definitely needed
