and it's that time of the year again
another big processes are launched from
AMD now if you recall the last processor
focus video that we did on the channel
was around the second generation rise in
two CPUs which are quite fascinating by
the way because they use an enhanced Zen
plus architecture and if you're
interested in learning more about those
CPUs you can check it out right over
here but now it's time for these
emphasis architecture to make its way
into the high-end desktop platform
meaning we're talking about the launch
of thread Ripper - now just to clear
this out you could refer this as second
generation thread Ripper or thread
Ripper - doesn't really matter because
the nomenclature does feature the second
generation branding so you could refer
to this the way you want it doesn't
really matter at this point but what
does this really mean for scholar X or
what kind of competition can we expect
for Team Blue in fact what kind of
performance benefits or differences that
we're gonna see with this new processor
launch from AMD we'll find that out but
I also wanted to talk about a very
special processor that aim DS launching
that has the highest number of course
that can be available for the desktop
platform ever yet because it is really
it's just amazing and how far we've come
in terms of technology and what's what
it's offering for its values so let's
get into the juicy details but first a
quick message from our sponsor the new
t46 caliber ddr4 memory is one unique
RGB kit with awesome light spill from
each module and the special edition has
a cool totem design on the light bar you
get lifetime warranty up to 4,000
megahertz speeds and full lighting
control through the software check out
the t4 6 caliber ram down below alright
so before I get too far into this video
I just want to quickly clear up a few
things around these new processor launch
so first and foremost it is quite
interesting because today is the
unboxing embargo day which means that we
are only allowed to share a few details
regarding these processors but I'll try
my best to not make this just an
unboxing video but rather share as much
information as I can regarding you know
the specs on these new processors along
with the you know pricing and
availability as well now you could
pre-order some of these CPUs today but I
would highly recommend you wait for the
performance analysis of these new
processors and
and take the plunge because they're not
cheap so let's start off with a little
bit of a history lesson if you remember
the original Zen architecture launched
Broadus risin processors and those were
followed up by thread Ripper for the
high-end desktop market now we're seeing
pretty much the same thing all over
again
Rison - and the twelve nanometer as n +
architecture got into our hands in april
and a third of our - will be available
starting this month while the second
generation thread repair lineup will
consist of four new processors the big
boy this time around is the amazing
twenty nine ninety WX and with it aimed
ease throwing a massive and I mean a
massive rock at in Tulsa last this thing
has a thirty-two physical cores and
sixty four threads which happens to
destroy what Intel offers with the 18
core 36 threaded I 979 ATX II not only
that but this CPU costs about $200 less
and also operates at higher base clock
speeds so yeah that's a direct slap in
the face for Intel obviously the 2990 WX
is aiming for a market that Intel can't
match but the 24 Core 48 threaded 2970
WX may be the final nail in the 79-80
axis coffin it potentially offers more
overall monetary performance but costs
thirteen hundred US dollars well that
certainly isn't cheap it's a great value
for an ultra high in performance part
aim D did provide a number of internal
benchmarks and they certainly show
promise for the twenty nine ninety WX it
absolutely destroys Intel's leading hdt
offering in multi-turreted workloads but
this chart also highlights something
that AMD wants us to make very clear to
you guys the W x-series chips is
genuinely a poor value for gamers if
that's something that you're looking
into you should be maximizing your GPU
investment while buying a risin or
coffee-like CPU even if you're someone
who does video or photo editing while
streaming a game the lower price to
thread report processors I'll go over
and a few seconds will be in much better
fit the 2990 WX and the 2970 WX are
tailor-made for high level
virtualization pure content creation
production studio levels of video
processing or other areas where such a
huge number of course
be put to good use I think core affinity
would be a great option here and just
take that very honest advice from AMT
into account before you put down a ton
of money one thing that you will want to
take into account is that these WX th
CPUs have a huge TDP of 250 watts but
they should still be able to overclock
by a small amount
speaking of those more affordable
processors let me introduce you to the
threader / 2950 X + e 2920 X basically
these will be replacing the 1950 X and
the 1920 X it would CPUs that deliver
higher clock speeds and the enhanced
features we saw on rise in two
processors like precision boost to
higher memory speeds and xfr - basically
the 2150 X's boost clock is 400
megahertz higher and the 2920 X's is 300
megahertz higher than their predecessors
which could make a pretty big difference
in games and other lightly threaded
applications that's great news since
India expects these to appeal to
enthusiasts and gamers who need the
ability to run parallel workloads what
hasn't changed is the core counts from
last generation since these parts have
16 and 12 course along with identical
caching structures aim DS also be very
aggressive on pricing as well while the
1950 X in the 1920 X were launched at
$9.99 and 799 respectively these new
CPUs shave off between a hundred and
$150 from that I'm hoping this will
force Intel to lower their skylight X
prices by a bit but somehow I don't
think that's gonna happen since that
could make it look like they're giving
in to AMD's pressure what you won't see
here is a replacement for the 1900 X and
that won't likely happen according to
AMD I suppose it makes sense since the
2700 X already performs really well with
its 8 cores and 16 threads while the x4
70 platform has plenty of features don't
forget that the 2800 X may still be
waiting in the wings - aimed he simply
didn't want to put too much of an
overlap between their different lineups
and the 29:20 axis $150 price will
really help bridge the gap between
thread Ripper and the higher-end Rison
CPUs so overall aim D expects we'll see
a four to eight percent improvement over
the original thread repair results which
is good for multi tiered workloads but
these CPUs will still trail a bit behind
Scala X and gaming performance
however that 6% shortfall is at 1080p
and once a high resolution is used we've
seen the playing field become pretty
level click the link above to check out
a video that we did with an older Sandy
Bridge system using newer games it
actually ended up giving almost the same
gaming results as an 8700 K with the GTX
1080i so trust me if you game at high
resolutions a thread Ripper system will
likely align perfectly with Scylla X
okay so with that out of the way let's
unbox this new processor
so it's great to see that AMD upgraded
their packaging along with their
architecture but something you may have
noticed was the form factor of B 2150 X
it still uses the same TR for socket
found on today's first generation thread
wrappers and guess what that means yep
that's right
aim D won't be updating their x29 and
platform and even the 2990 WX and e 2970
WX will be fully compatible with
existing motherboards there won't be any
new features added since AMD believes
their current HTT motherboards have more
than enough features for enthusiasts and
I completely agree with that if you do
have an existing x29 and motherboard the
upgrade process is actually pretty
simple
all you have to do is download and
install the latest bios that supports
these new three different processors and
you can just simply swap out the cpu
with the new one and enjoy but what if
you order a motherboard that's running
in older BIOS or the process is actually
fairly straightforward because every X 3
9 a motherboard that's available on the
market right now supports usb BIOS
flashback feature so this essentially
means that you wouldn't necessarily need
a CPU in order for this thing to
function so all you have to do is just
download that BIOS with the USB plug it
into the motherboard and you can start
the flashback or the BIOS update process
right away the last thing that I want to
mention is how AMD will be staggering
this launch because the render / 2
products will be trickling out rather
than being available all at the same
time the first one out of the gate will
be the threader / 2990 WX which starts
shipping on August the 13th and that's
followed by the 29 50 X on August 30th
then we'll have to wait all the way
until October for the 2970 WX and the 29
20 X I have to wonder if these dates are
being planned around Intel's rumored
launch schedule or if it's just a matter
of ensuring availability so that pretty
much wraps up our introduction to thread
Ripper - there's obviously a lot more
content coming around in the next few
days and weeks with these new processors
personally I'm really excited with what
AMD is doing lately not only have they
successfully introduced an evolved
version of thread Ripper in less than a
year since the original launch but
they're obviously winning the core count
against Intel now one of the biggest
benefits I see is their commitment
towards the X 399 platform because it
still offers you know way more
connectivity features compared to
$2.99 and these processors are simply a
drop-in upgrade and that's pretty
awesome I guess the real question here
is whether or not if until will respond
and if they do what would that response
be like let me tell you this the end of
2018 is certainly going to look
promising or interesting for content
creators and enthusiasts but what do you
guys think do you have plans to purchase
surrender bar - or does Rison - or
copulate still hold more value to you
let us know in the comments down below
obviously stay tuned for more coverage
around these new tractor processors but
until then you can check out some
relevant content over here or you can
