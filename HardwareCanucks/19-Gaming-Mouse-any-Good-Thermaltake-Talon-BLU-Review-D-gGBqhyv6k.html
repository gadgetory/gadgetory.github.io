great technology selection and service
hey guys
EB here with hurricane axe and thermal
take is really aiming to bring
budget-friendly gaming peripherals to
the masses without sacrificing quality
the talent and the talent blew my stand
at an extremely affordable twenty dollar
price point so the question is what can
gamers expect for this value as concerns
on quality control and build quality
come to mind
both these might look exactly the same
they have the same sensor the same
button placement the same build quality
and the only difference is the lighting
which I will get to shortly the build
quality feels surprisingly good for the
price this is partially because of the
soft touch texture that feels smooth
just like my AVR 7000 and I love it the
elevated portion of the rear
accommodates four palm type users while
claw grip is always another option and
notice the mouse's ambidextrous that
Thermaltake advertises as perfect for
both right and left hand users however
this is just plug in play Mouse there
are no drivers available so you cannot
switch your primary left hand by clicks
and therefore this is a right hand Mouse
only Thermaltake has to be more careful
with this misinformation the large
teflon feet at the bottom are adequate
for smooth glide and I didn't notice any
signs of peeling which is great one of
the unique features that we were really
surprised to see our removable side
panels that are held with two screws at
the bottom this way users may adjust the
shape and feel of the mouse to their
liking
I noticed that edges we're a bit sharp
and actually introduced a bit of
discomfort for handling and material
feel is different too it adds a bit of
grip it also lets a lot more of internal
blue lighting shine out on the tail and
blue and the color cycling effect on the
talon the mice are equipped with a
Nevada 3050 optical sensor with
sensitivity up to 3000 dpi which is
plenty enough for gaming even on
multiple monitors it is regarded as a
decent entry-level infrared sensor
showing no artifacts on clawed mouse
mats and keep in mind white surfaces and
glass are not picked up by the sensor
the liftoff height algorithm does a
proper job with different types of
surfaces and that's an impressive
feature for a $20
the primary left and right buttons
respond well with excellent tactile
feedback with less resistance which I'm
glad to see the scroll wheel is light
enough to press but with very big scroll
steps which is a disappointing factor
the browser buttons just feel fine and
is in a proper spot the DPI share button
is well within reach behind the scroll
wheel and since it's a single click
you must cycle through five levels which
are 500 750 1500 2500 and 3000 dpi again
coming back to the lack of drivers the
only indication of your dpi setting is
lighting changes on the talon and the
scroll wheel blinks on the talon blue
the lighting on both these mice is the
only features at the first the talon
changes it up from traditional lighting
accents throughout the mouse body with
these translucent lines there is a 6
color cycling effect lighting system
that cycles through red orange yellow
blue dark blue and purple to turn the
lighting off you'll have to press the
left click button and the dps shift
button at the same time clicking on the
scroll wheel and the DPI button at the
same time allows you to lock one color
so it no longer cycles through
unfortunately our review sample didn't
recognize this command we weren't
totally surprised given the price point
so lower your expectations the talent
blue on the other hand had blue LED
lighting with static and pulse patterns
and the effect can be switched off the
cable is braided and it comes with
proper logo at the tip to help
differentiate between other cables which
is good to see on both the talent and
the talon blue
so when conclusion Thermaltake has
brought a lot of features with the
talent and the talon blue towards the
market at extremely affordable price the
highlights include the excellent build
quality and the ergonomic ambidextrous
body with the soft rubber coating the 6
online switches and the LED lighting on
both are always welcome some drawbacks
include the lack of driver software and
the issue that we had with the talent on
the LED lighting the removable side
panels could be considered a positive
but personally I prefer them leaving on
since the sharp edges without them are
totally
uncomfortable that being said the weight
Thermaltake approached pricing on the
talon and the blue can be praised for
delivering a truly budget-friendly
gaming house that offers more than the
basics and we're giving it the Harbour
Canucks damn good value award thank you
