Canucks and welcome to another video
Deus Ex mankind divided just rolled out
with a dx12 update so let's put out the
two mid-range cards right now the gtx
1060 versus the RX 480 see which one the
fare is better in terms of performance
both in the x11 and dx12 enjoy cable mod
now offers sleeved Ethernet and power
cables so you can color match outside of
the case with mod mesh and mod flex
sleeving available at different links
custom cables are now outside the box
so first in order to enable the D export
option you need to activate it in the
steam properties after which an can be
enabled in the options themselves I am
using the built-in benchmarks for these
runs and I will be doing 3 presets with
medium-high in ultra graphics mainly at
1080p but I'll also be showing some
1440p results later now the game is
actually quite fun letting you play at
your own pace selecting lethal or
non-lethal weapons and graphically it is
a pretty beautiful game as well if you
have the eye for detail for example I
love the lighting in your apartment and
execution cutscenes are pretty nice too
now the difference between the three
graphics presets are pretty substantial
when you look at textures and although
my new details on your characters
particularly the clothing pieces and
also plenty of details of assets in the
environment but as far as I can see dx11
versus dx12 graphically are the same and
so before we dive in this is still only
a preview of the final implementation of
the x12 in this title so more
optimizations are to follow along with
update good old days are gone I haven't
seen one of these before
orange level you are some kind of badass
just someone with a job to do but it is
a very demanding game so let's just dive
right in with dx11 and our lowest medium
preset I will keep the x-axis static so
you can see how much fps changes from
medium to high into ultra and I've also
included the gtx 10:17 there just to see
if the pattern remains the same on the
green side so the RX 480 is giving us
11% better score on medium and high and
a 15% extra boost in fps in ultra preset
for the averages compared to the gtx
1060 now lets enable DX 12 and run the
same benchmarks and check this out with
the arcs for any is doing so much better
we're getting 22 % better average
PS medium and high and 18% better fps at
Ultra settings compared to GTX than 60
so we're almost approaching the GTX 10
seventies performance here now when we
place the DX 12 results next to DX 11
which are in gray
the picture becomes clearer as the GTX
1060 does not move the results are
identical between the X 11 and 12
while the our X 480 receives a pretty
significant boost for performance on
medium and high presets then I cranked
up the resolution to 1440p and I was
very surprised to see such a drastic
difference between the two cards placing
the RX very solidly in the middle but
then again comparing the x11 to DX 12 my
Nvidia cards did not move while the our
experi got that little boost now there
were a few interesting Timbits that we
discovered during our testing that could
have negatively impact performance
numbers for one there seems to be a
potential cpu bottleneck for the gtx
1070 at very low settings in DX 12
notice how at lower settings we get much
better fps and dx11
meanwhile it seems like DX 12 puts
additional stress on a limited number of
processor threads for secondary tasks
and that's a problem since this game
isn't properly multi-threading aware
which means even with a 6800 K a very
solid six core 12 thread CPU the GPU
ends up requesting frames faster than
the CPU can process them and as a result
GPU usage goes down as it's waiting for
frames so when we crank settings up and
increase the resolution then the
performance numbers between the x11 and
DX 12 really kind of are identical so
don't use low settings for powerful GPUs
because you might experience the CPU
bottleneck with DX 12 in this particular
title and so those are our results if
you're playing the game share your
performance numbers in the comments down
below if you're doing the x11 or dx12
and you might potentially find a kill
switch under somebody's desk I'm going
to meet you with Huracan axe thanks much
for watching we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
