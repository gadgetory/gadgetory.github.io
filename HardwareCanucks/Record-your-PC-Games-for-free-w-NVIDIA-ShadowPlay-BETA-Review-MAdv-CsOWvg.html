and today we're going to take a look at
nvidia shadowplay a software that allows
you to record gameplay at 1080p and
60fps without affecting in frame rate
the shadow play is available through the
GeForce experience and only supported on
desktop Kepler base GPUs so GTX 650 or
higher that feature that h.264 encoder
that allows that seamless video stream
that is also the exact same reason how
the shield is able to stream games at
60fps thanks to that built-in encoder
unfortunately though notebook GPUs are
not supported for shadow play now
compared to other recording software
shadow play is available for free
through the GeForce experience and
allows both local recording and twitch
streaming auto twitch streaming is not
yet an added but it's also limited to
your nvidia GPU perhaps on the other
hand is a very popular and a common
recording software Alto it doesn't
stream to twitch it is free but requires
payment for the premium features and it
will work regardless of your GPU opening
up shadow play through the GeForce
experience and we are presented with
this very simple interface allowing you
to turn it on and off open the folder
with all your recordings and of course
set your hotkeys for recording and we
have three modes available usual manual
mode for unlimited recording in Windows
8 or up to 3.9 gigabytes in Windows 7
and the shadow mode that is very useful
to capture only some of your best
moments of gameplay so you set your
shadow time or the amount minutes and it
will record that last set of minutes of
your gameplay this is awesome for not
having to record everything and later
cut down on your best moments but allows
you to play the game now and record up
to 20 minutes of your last game play on
Windows 8 and up to 10 minutes with
windows 7 and I think this is a very
unique aspect of shadow play that makes
this a more superior capture tool and we
can also adjust the quality of the
recording from one point eight megabytes
per second to six point two five
megabytes a second which means that even
at high quality you're not capping your
right speed of like your conventional
7200 RPM drive so the two major
disadvantages of other capture tools
have been basically addressed by
utilizing the built-in encoder
have minimal effect on your frame rate
and even a 1080p with high quality
recording the right speeds are under
control the audio option is very
limiting at this time you can only
record in game audio or none but cannot
record yourself of course there are
other methods of capturing the local
audio but it would have been nice and
convenient to do it all within
shadowplay so finally let's jump into a
game capture some awesome footage and
see how it handles we get a recording
indicator that helps to know whether
you're recording or saving a footage now
notice there are no options to change
the resolution and I myself in gaming on
a 16 x 10 monitor with effective
resolution of 1920 x 1200 this means
that my output image will be squished to
16 by 9 aspect and that's kind of a big
limitation as my footage will look
squished and unnatural now we're also
recording at 60fps and have no control
over that so if your in-game framerate
drops below 60 we do get a bit of a
choppy recording now finally I decided
to test to see how much strange shadow
play had on my performance and they used
fraps to benchmark my frames to see if
there was any difference and so I ran a
one-minute benchmark three times both
with shadow play on and off and looking
at the result it is very impressive to
see such a minimal performance strain
with all three games my Delta was around
two frames which really isn't
significant and NVIDIA claims there is
less than ten percent performance impact
on your frame rate and throughout my
testing my highest was a four and a half
percent performance train in Metro which
is still very impressive also one of the
best things about shadow play are small
file sizes compared to Bentley came or
fraps these are one millionth files at
60 frames a second and as you can see
you save yourself a significant amount
of drive storage also let's take a look
at detailed comparison between the three
levels of quality that the shadow play
offers so if you really are conservative
on file sizes going with low quality
will still deliver pretty decent results
although it isn't as sharp and lose
detail in motion so shadow play for
Kepler based GPU users who want to
record gameplay is an excellent option
that allows up to 20 minutes of last
gameplay to be recorded so you never
lose your must be seen footage you also
have an unlimited recording with windows
8 and 1080p at 60fps without putting too
much strain on your hard drive with
maximum 50 megabits per second rights
and most importantly not affecting your
in-game frame rate that is crucial for
competitive matches and just a more
seamless capture and plus twitch
streaming is soon to be available now
while the software is still in beta we
cannot capture user audio we cannot
change the resolution or the frame rate
of your recording so these are just few
limitations that will hopefully be
addressed in the future but shadow play
turns out to be a very well suited
capture tool that is bound to get better
and we're giving it the harbor Canucks
named grant award so as always thanks
