Hinrich knocks review today we're very
excited to check out the gaming mouse
and a surface from a brand that may not
be familiar to many now that's because
the company only recently got back into
the game with the introduction of the MS
3 and the 1030 L surface now the
company's slogan itself is an
interesting element which is sort of the
backbone of every single gaming
peripheral and that's functionality so
with that in mind and expectations set
quite high let's check it out and
starting with the mouse one of the most
predominant features you'll notice right
away is the full hand support now when
it comes down to economics it's one of
the most crucial aspects for precise
aiming and obviously hand comfort so it
is designed for palm type grip with
natural thumb support but also placement
for your ring and pinky finger your hand
just fits in and the rubbery surface
does complement the entire design now
you can still use the mouse with the
claw grip but it's unconventional size
is quite distracting as your pinky and
ring fingers are sort of the oddly
placed on the side now the mouse is
quite wide because of the extra support
on the right side and does require some
time getting used to and the MS 3
weights only 127 grams so fairly light
for its size and unfortunately we are
unable to customise the weights now in
one hand the large size does complement
it's lightweight
since you can still do quick navigation
however I would have loved having the
ability to add a few extra grams to make
the mouse slightly heavier and aside
from the hand support the button quality
and layout is very well executed all the
buttons have a smooth press allowing a
little extra travel time after the
button is registered now this serves as
an excellent way to minimize any shake
or disturbance to your aim for example
if you are switching between dpi level
and in total we have 10 buttons so
starting off with your left and right
click a very solid scroll wheel with
excellent feedback zero play and a great
textured surface dpi change buttons are
out of the way but can be naturally
accessed without any disturbance and all
the four buttons on the left side are
placed appropriately for your thumb to
do a job with your browser buttons the
very popular sniper button and sort of a
concealed button for your thumb that
requires a lot of pressure and is very
difficult to press without disturbing
your aim the profile switch button sits
right beside the middle finger which is
very convenient and the three discreet
LEDs on the side Mouse indicate which
profile you're using along with which of
the three dpi settings is currently in
use now speaking of the LEDs the mouse
has a touch of fancy with customizable
color system for your scroll wheel and
the sniper button now what's cool is
this massive array of colors that you
can choose from from the software menu
for each of the buttons now even the
ability to adjust the saturation or
brightness is included now this is that
sweet icing gamers are looking for and
it's very nice to see funk is covering
some of those details still a wait
system in my opinion is more preferable
over color adjustments now when it comes
to the M is 3 software this is one of
the best and compact you eyes that we've
worked with we get our usual dpi
adjustments for the three steps and the
sniper button with the maximum set to 57
60 dpi which is I would say reasonable
we have more goodies with such a scroll
speed liftoff distance and some other
useful settings now when it comes to
button Simon's we do get a decent list
of default commands but also the ability
to record your own macros which for
gaming mouse could come in very useful
now the last one is the color setting
which also offers great flexibility for
customization for each of the three
profiles that are saved on the mouse and
not on the saw
we're DMS three connects with a regular
USB port with a braided cable now we
have the specific design on the cable
that will help you to differentiate
between different peripherals at the
back of your computer
now let's divert a little from the mouse
and take a look at the 10 30 L surface
this is a dual sided design one with a
bit more grain for a little more
resistance and another smoother surface
for easier gliding now both surfaces
have completely different feel and allow
the user to experiment with either one
for whatever you prefer simply pop out
the surface outside of it insert flip it
and you have yourself in different
mousepad the convenience of this dual
design is certainly there and having a
primary base that holds the dual sided
mat is quite clever with large rubber
bits at the bottom to prevent the mat
from sliding regardless of the surface
you're using one drawback to this design
however is the surface isn't really
secured inside the main frame and can
easily pop out now of course you're not
going on the roller coaster with this
thing but you might experience some play
while using the mouse but of course this
is not a big deal and almost
unnoticeable wild gaming now in
combination with the MS 3 this new line
of gaming products from funk carry great
potential to break in the market by
offering this unique economic design and
throughout my testing with gaming I was
initially skeptical of the shape to me
it was a bit too bulky and honestly a
little uncomfortable but after some time
the mouse grew on me and the additional
finger support actually proved useful
for long gaming sessions the sniper
button is placed right below your thumb
which is very rewarding to use for some
accurate headshots now while I do prefer
a slightly heavier Mouse this
lightweight didn't bother me so much
with appropriate dpi sand
theory now this mouse will certainly
work for larger hands but may prove too
bulky for those with smaller hands and
so to recap what we have here is a good
set of gaming goodies that bring
functionality to the table the MS 3 is
designed with comfort in mind with the
additional finger support with an
excellent focus on button layout and
quality sensor tracking was excellent
and so was the driver software with many
options for button and color
customization but I do feel the size is
not for everyone and mainly might find
it unconventionally large and the lack
of weight customization is a big deal
especially with such a saturated market
and the lower left thumb button is very
difficult to press which will disturb
your aim the 10 30 L surface proved to
be an excellent choice for a gaming mat
the dual surface design while may not be
utilized often still provides double the
options than your standard mousepad and
the quick flip between each side is
hassle free there are no issues with
tracking and both surfaces perform quite
well my only gripe with the 1030 l is
there is slight play with the surface
inside the frame which could be
addressed with some internal clips but
overall the MS 3 along with the 1030 ll
serve as functional gaming peripherals
and showcase what funk is capable of now
let's hope they take into consideration
the feedback from gamers and further
improve the functionality we were
expecting but at a decent price point
both the mouse and mouse pad received a
damn good award so thanks guys for
watching let us know what type of setup
you have going on with your mouse and
mouse pad and we'll see you guys in the
next one
