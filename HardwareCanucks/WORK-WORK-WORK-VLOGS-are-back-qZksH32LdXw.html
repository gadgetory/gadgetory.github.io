behind-the-scenes recently but I woke up
today with an idea that we should do
something about audio well I've been
playing around with the idea of
explaining what we use for audio and
apologies for me using the built-in
microphone on the sony rx100 I really
want to share my thinking my thought
process behind making this video that
you're about to watch v link in the
description it's about audio full video
and why it's important I'm setting up my
first shot it's going to be in this
little hallway here because what I'm
trying to do is do tell you guys a story
of like what happens when like I wake up
maybe go in the kitchen have coffee and
whatever all this through audio so the
you you'll be seeing the visuals but you
will not be seeing me as a subject of
interacting with anything in the kitchen
or anywhere in the household and the
idea is to is to tell you what I'm doing
through audio ok so what I need to do is
highlight the door frame and it just
happens that well I have one the softbox
is firing on left side of the frame the
other edge the other right side of the
door can gets lost in the light and I
want to separate that because I want the
viewer to know that we are coming
through a doorway my trusty light there
we go
that's it on to the next shot with the
floor the idea where the floor here is
that I want to capture the pattern and
then in the actual video you'll hear me
walking across but obviously you won't
see me walking across and I do want to
add the motion to the scene that's why
I'm using the slider because I want to
indicate that yes there is something
happening aside from just static visuals
you'll be able to hear what's happening
and my direction of the slide indicates
where the subject is going next
otherwise you'll be kind of confused so
I hope that translates really well the
floor does squeak a little bit so when I
do record audio and you will see that it
just a little bit i'll be able to i'll
put a microphone exactly in this spot so
that the microphone is recording from
the position of the camera so that once
you're looking at the footage you have
also the correct audio representation of
space and other the same thing for all
the other shots so for this sequence i
brought a light into my kitchen because
i want to add extra light onto the
coffee machine for this one we're gonna
have another slide shop coming into the
coffee machine and then all you'll be
hearing is me like pressing the button
bring the pot back in playing coffee and
on whatever
so I'm i was actually keeping the frame
or the coffee mug I don't focus pretty
much for the entire time until the end
partially because I want to hide any
little crumbs or little spots of coffee
on the machine itself because that
that's gonna look dirty and also because
hopefully that will drive the
storytelling aspect through audio much
better so for this next shot I want to
have the coffee mug on this coffee table
to represent that you know when I wake
up I go to the kitchen make myself a
coffee and have the coffee outside of
the office because the office entrance
will be a whole new little sequence in
the opening sequence for this video so I
want to separate the two and hopefully
it all works out
so this next shot took a little longer
to set up I have one main key light
highlighting subject which is our cup
and then I have one light on this side
to give the cup a little extra things on
the sides there I think it turned out
really good now I just have to add
drinking coffee sounds so that you guys
can tell what try to portray here but I
think it looks really nice especially
with the all the lighting know if you're
nice good texture on the couch
especially with the color and good
texture on the coffee table as well so I
just finished filming all the visuals
inside the office with window opening
some stuff with the desk and stuff now
it's time to record all these this
sounds because using the h5 going to be
placing it on top of the camera so I can
actually angle the tripod and the camera
in exact position where the slide
happens so I can capture the most
accurate audio representation so let's
do it ready to record I'll keep the
camera off so that there is no
additional noise is coming from the
system just everything that's been
recorded through the microphone
alright so it is seven hours later I
finally finished the Edit it's rendering
right now and check out how quiet the
system is while it's rendering pretty
quiet right but I hope you guys enjoyed
this behind the scenes episodes on my
development of thinking of what I wanted
to create waking up in the morning
having an idea and developing it into
something that I think you guys were the
joy and that I am really proud of but
make sure to subscribe for more behind
the scenes and we'll see you in the next
video or should I say we will hear you
in the next audio once you watch this
video you'll get it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
