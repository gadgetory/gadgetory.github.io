great technology selection and service
recently we took a look at G skills new
gaming keyboard the km 780 RGB link to
that video will be down below if you
want to check it out
but to complete the peripheral side G
skill has also announced a new Gaming
Mouse the Ripjaws MX 780 RGB it's
approaching the market with a unique
modular design gaming grade laser sensor
RGB lighting and some extra features all
of this will set you back about $80
which I think fits appropriately within
the price range for gaming mouse but the
real question is can G skill compared
with the offerings from corsair logitech
my onyx Razer and so on well that's what
we're going to find out starting with
the bill the aluminum frame structure
feels robust and solid although the
bottom brushed aluminum surface is prone
to scratches the soft touch rubber
surface at the top is an excellent
choice G scale and you know how much
I'll appreciate the quality of this
material it's comfortable and adds that
extra grip just like my AVR 7000 and I
love it design wise there is some
resemblance to the colgar 700m but there
are a few unique features that g scale
has implemented on the LX 780 to be
specific the two side grips are
magnetically attached to the main frame
which can be interchanged for either an
ambidextrous grip or if your left or
right-handed the side grips can be
adjusted accordingly which is nice also
note that the magnetic force is very
strong for the side grips so you'll have
to pull pretty hard to detach them it's
a nice system as you won't have to worry
about it coming off as you gain over
time the mouse weighs 111 grams and G
skill has included an additional pair of
4.5 gram weights that can be installed
to the main frame behind the side grips
on both sides which is an excellent
feature some people still prefer really
heavy mice and adding extra weights as a
nice touch you can also adjust the
height of the palm rest with the
provided allen key my preferred spot was
somewhere around the middle which
economically was comfortable for my palm
there are eight programmable buttons on
the MX 780 and all of them feature amnon
switches the primary left and right
click buttons have
excellent tactile feedback and require
minimal pressure to press this would be
a great option if you are an FPS shooter
and throughout my testing shots we're
spot-on and the response time was pretty
fast the scroll wheel was a pleasure to
use with best-in-class scroll steps
although it does require some pressure
to press the DPI shift button right
behind the scroll wheel follows the
exact same feel as the rest nothing to
complain about and you can set up five
levels of dpi through the driver
software the two forward and backward
buttons on both sides of the mouse are
easy to reach and when clicking the
buttons they continue to travel after
the click is registered I personally
like this feature as it allows
activation of these buttons without
affecting cursor navigation key skills
mx7 ad houses and a boggle gaming grade
laser sensor that's capable of a 2 8200
dpi my preferred setting was somewhere
between 1200 to 1600 dpi which i think
is a sweet spot for gaming and as I
mentioned earlier the combination of
excellent amnon switches and outstanding
argonauts along with a really good
sensor equates to a much better gaming
experience the sensor tracks well on
both dark and white surfaces but not on
glass let's talk lighting there are four
lighting zones which includes the subtle
lighting inside the scroll wheel the
lighting on the sides the top lighting
and the logo on the palm rest I have to
admit it looks amazing during night
times all of these can be configured to
your preference within the driver
software and speaking of the driver
software you're greeted with a physical
layout of the mouse but you know how
g.skill advertises that the MX 780 has
eight programmable buttons well if you
take a close look on the right side of
the window there are two more buttons so
to speak which seems a little misleading
I'm sure no one assigns the scroll wheel
step has a left or right click so
g.skill fix this with an update the
other buttons can be assigned with
certain functions by just clicking on
them switching over to the Settings tab
you can adjust a polling weight set the
number of dpi stages and assign each
stage with your preferred dpi value the
double clicking speed window pointer
speed mouse wheel scroll speed and the
liftoff range can be adjust and
customized
well moving on to the lighting tab there
are three main options background
lighting is where you assign each zone
to your preference when you click on
each zone the lighting turns off but if
you want to change the color of a
specific zone you have to turn the
lining zone off select your preferred
color and then turn the zone back on
honestly I wasn't pleased with this
process moving on to the effect lighting
the scroll wheel the two side lights and
the logo can only be set to breeding
while the center lighting strip can be
adjusted to either a color cycling
effect or breeding just like my km 780
keyboard that I reviewed recently I had
to create a preset for these effects
lighting sync with system basically
allows the mouse lights to turn off when
the system is off and to complete this
you'll have to save the settings to the
device memory I'm hoping that g.skill
comes up with an update as soon as
possible for both the km 780 and the MX
780 I have to admit I'm not happy with
gee skills drivers software but on a
positive note g.skill has completed the
gaming peripheral set with the MX 780
RGB gaming mouse the build quality was
excellent in changeable side grips is a
very convenient feature customizable
wait options is a bonus at this price
point and the buttons have excellent
tactile feedback and the Avago laser
sensor provides accurate tracking and
the lighting system on the mouse is a
pleasure to look at the only gripe I
have is the driver software
I'm sure g.skill can fix this with an
update and that would sum up a
well-rounded gaming mouse well that
concludes our review of the g.skill
