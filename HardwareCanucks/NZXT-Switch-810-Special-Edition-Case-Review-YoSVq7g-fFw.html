hardware connects review is you may
recall we've already taking a look at
the hybrid full tower from NZXT the
switch 810 that really surpassed our
expectations and there is no other
chassis like this one one of the major
concerns the company received from
consumers was the exterior coating which
not only made the casebook plastic but
feel weak and toy like so NZXT got the
hint and have released a special edition
of the 810 that took care of that glossy
exterior coating the special edition
case rings in at $179 just slightly
higher than the original 810 with two
color choices the gunmetal gray and the
matte black which we have here so the
front and top plastic parts now have a
nice matte black coating no longer
fingerprint magnet nor reflective the
metal side panels are also non glossy
but are slightly reflective and there is
an obvious color difference between the
side panels and the plastic around so
the special edition of the 810 was
really aimed at refining the chassis
exterior without modifying the already
innovative internals so let's recap of
what this hybrid chassis has to offer
for the front panel connectors we have
four USB ports two of which are USB 3
ready and connect through an internal 20
pin cable we have an SD card reader
audio jacks reset an led button that
lights up the i/o panel at the back and
the power button is located separately
at the top from the rest of the front
panel connectors below that we have four
removable drive bays along with a hot
swap bay for 2.5 inch SSDs and regular
drives as well the front intake panel
can easily be removed has a built-in
dust filter and spacing for the airflow
behind which dual fans can be installed
with a single 140 millimeter fan
provided and right the bottom a dual
dust filter is located for the optional
bottom intake fans taking a look at the
top we have this large ventilation cover
that can be open to allow for the air to
exit and it's also easily removable for
installation of the fans and since this
chassis is heavily focused on water
cooling triple fans can be installed
above the frame
take a look in the back the large sizing
of the chassis allows the rear exhaust
fan to slide closer to the top panel
which could come and use depending on
your cooling configuration then there's
the i/o area water cooling holes and
nine PCI slots and they bottom out the
power supply with a removable dust
filter the side panel has a large window
that shows off the internals it's nice
and clean it fits in with the overall
design to get inside the case three
thumb screws must be removed with the
middle one to be loosened up and pushed
down and once inside the case they've
maintained the same black color scheme
as on the original without any
modifications at top right we have three
tools optical beam mounts along with the
extra thumb screws to secure the optical
base at the back then we have the
connections for the hot swap a and the
two removable hard drive cages at the
bottom on the other side a very large
CPU cutout is available to support
multiple motherboards and CPU cooler
backplate placements then many large
rubber grommets to accommodate for
pretty much any cable management and
looking in the back we have plenty of
cable tie notches which are spread
around to tidy up any mess and just
under one inch of room to work with but
it really shouldn't be an issue
another simple but the very clever tool
to minimize hassle with cable management
and all these fans is this fan hub that
is powered up by one molex connector and
supports up to 7 fans it is attached
with Velcro meeting positioning of this
unit is not restricted all right let's
move to the front and check out these
modular hard drive cages they are
removed by several thumb screws and
slide out through the front either which
can be installed individually either to
allow more direct airflow or utilizing
the bottom portion for water cooling a
dual rod came installed at the bottom
after the removal of the hard drive
mounting rails and this is where the
dust filter would be crucial now the
hard drive cage itself is something
unique because it incorporates a fan
bracket that can be angled towards your
internals and each of the tools brackets
can be secured to the cage in case the
system is in transport and NZXT has
listened to our feedback with regards to
the brackets and mounting SSDs now
should not be a problem as
or there were some clearance issues
since the case supports a 360 millimeter
rat at the top there are two walls that
must be removed first still quite a
tedious process with many screws but the
back wall which has all the front panel
connectors running through it it is
still closed in meaning you have to
backup all the cables in order to remove
it we wish NZXT would have made it
easier to work that one out and as part
of the accessories n16 who's a braided 8
pin extension just in case you need that
extra reach and assembling the system
into the special edition a intent wasn't
any different than the original our ATX
motherboard looks tiny in this large
interior a good sign for water cooling
enthusiasts graphics cards and length of
14 inches are supported with the cage
installed so really this monster can do
it all and cleans up nicely as well so
to wrap this up the special edition 810
was only a minor refinement to the
original the new paint job is welcomed
and it does give off a better vibe in
terms of quality maybe because it no
longer looks like it came from a toy
store and the matte black is just more
elegant and practical to keep the
chassis clean the small revision to
drive brackets is also appreciated
meaning the company is listening to
consumers feedback and tries to deliver
to what we want other amazing aspects of
the chassis include air flow and water
cooling capabilities which are simply
unmatched in this price range and has no
limits to what can be installed inside
this beast and just an outstanding cable
management design that makes your life a
heck a lot easier during assembly and
since the main focus for the special
edition has been on color those who are
picky about color may not appreciate the
difference between the metal side panel
and the plastic as it's quite obvious we
do however feel that a special edition
series is a bit of an overstatement as
releasing an identical chassis at
different colors is something that
should be available to all without
having to pay the extra seeing that the
negative
outcry for the original 810 revolved
mainly around the glassy coating and
Ziggs teeth should have just released
the extra two colors and the same price
as the original but overall the
switching tent still remains one the
best and most practical cases for
enthusiasts and deserves the damn
innovative award and that concludes our
review for the special edition switch
810 from NZXT thank you guys for
watching and we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
