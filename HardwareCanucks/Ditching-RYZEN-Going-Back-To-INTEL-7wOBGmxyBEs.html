Intel
now don't get me wrong
our entire rising experience we've done
so much content around it has been
incredible and the amount of time
savings we received using the eight core
sixteen thread 1700 X monster has been
immense in comparison to what I was
using in the past with Intel but I think
it's time to switch back to Intel see
how those guys is doing in terms of
stability in particular for Adobe
Premiere and that entire suite of
applications because the latest Adobe
suite updates don't work for my machine
everything is crashing I have to revert
the drivers I have to revert the
programs and it just seems like there's
this misalignment between Adobe and AMD
Rison and that does not work well with
me and just to make sure I'm not making
a huge mistake by switching to an 80 600
K which is only a 6 core 6 thread part
I've run some gaming benchmarks
alongside with the rendering performance
just to see if I'll be gaining anything
in performance with the Intel side of
things I'm not really looking for
performance improvements because right
now rendering is pretty good anyway but
I'm mainly looking for improvements in
stability so let's do the system swap
right after this
what is that the view 31 you should put
a ring on it
yes time to make it hard to be official
there will take ring high static
pressure fans because your case deserves
a ring full details in the description
below so this switch back to Intel is
not permanent I just want to see if
those issues also exist on an Intel
platform or I'm just being super unlucky
with my machine here so inside I have a
17 100 X at 3.8 gigahertz I cannot push
that any further i have a gtx 1080 and
then vme SSD nothing is eber is also
having issues with his adobe
applications so it seems like it's a
platform specific issue and not
necessarily component issue this also
gives me the perfect opportunity to
create my black and white system inside
the PC o 11 dynamic using the white and
7 motherboard from NZXT with the kraken
X 72 and I'll put in some RGB fans on
here so that it's like you know going
back to the illumination days from
something that was air cooled or
something that has an all-in-one and RGB
should be fun
so usually this part of like actually
installing the motherboard inside the
case is never a concern until now so
I've stumbled upon the frustrating
hiccup because of this white shroud it's
a bit unconventional it requires these
long screws for mounting otherwise you
can't fit a normal screw in there but
the threading on the screw is different
from the threading on the motherboard
standoffs here so I had to take out some
Malamud stand offs from the h200 encase
put them inside the Lindley case so it
can actually mount this motherboard and
you would think that this would be
standardized across all cases in terms
of what type of thread the screw and the
motherwort standoffs use but as you can
see here apparently that is not the case
man so it's been a frustrating couple of
hours as you can see by the state of
this office so I finally was able to
boot into Windows with this system but
not without its challenges because of
this motherboard so the reason why I
have all these NVIDIA GPUs out on the
table here is because I'm only able to
boot with an AMD card into the windows
because for some reason the motherboard
would not detect the signal from an
Nvidia card but the text set from an AMD
just fine which is also why I have this
riser cable because I was actually able
to bypass some sort of bias thing with
this riser cable using an Nvidia card to
actually get into Windows but right now
we're back to an AMD card because I have
to access the BIOS in order to overclock
some memory and CPU which I cannot do
with an nvidia card so yeah this has
been fun
alright so let me get this clear for you
I use an AMD card to get into the bias
of the n7 motherboard to overclock the
memory to XMP profile and the CPU to
four point nine gigahertz
I still cannot go beyond four point nine
because then it will not boot whereas
with this ITX motherboard from Asus five
gigahertz in five minutes no problems
whatsoever so now we're back on my
machine and video card inserted right
now so I can resume my tests but still
wow I was not expecting this experience
to be all over the place and quite
frustrating - it is kind of ironic - if
you think about it of me wanting to
switch to Intel because of extra
stability
yet we have all this instability instead
damn you and seven
yeah I don't think it's stable Wow
believe it or not after some 20 hours of
troubleshooting with NZXT trying
multiple graphics card multiple riser
cables multiple configurations and the
BIOS I finally figured out what was
causing the issue and it was the monitor
so this 4k freezing display would not do
it with an Nvidia graphics card but once
I populate this g-sync panel I'm here
from Acer everything boots just fine no
issues I can get into the BIOS without
needing to plug in aim the GPU first so
that is awesome
however I still cannot achieve my 5
gigahertz overclock the system is not
stable with this motherboard I am doing
some benchmarks right now to see what
performance we get at 4.8 but the asus
prime z 370 a saves the day so this is
also a black-and-white color theme so
that fits perfectly and this white
actually matches the case much better
instead of this eggshell white that we
see on the n7 this one we have more
aluminum that matches the graphics card
so color scheme here works out perfectly
well and i've had nothing but fantastic
results with overclocking on asus boards
so i'm actually quite excited to
populate the chip and here do the quick
system swap so I can finally resume my
work
aka edit this video
it's actually a good thing I did not do
cable management easy-peasy
and now I have to repopulate all the
original standoffs inside this case
which is a bit inconvenient I wish that
these things were standardized across
all cases across all motherboards
I am very much out of thermal paste
catch
I am pretty confident and hopeful that
this will work come on they sous work
with me here I'm such a noob forgot the
front eh oh hello forgot to switch on
the power supply beautiful and all right
moment of truth but the question is will
 boot with an LG display something
that I was not able to achieve on the n7
motherboard strangely Oh BAM that is how
you do it a soos or NZXT and so the
first order of business is making sure
that the system looks beautiful with the
illumination so both the GPU the kraken
and the motherboard area all have this
purple illumination that looks beautiful
inside the white enclosure I mean I
haven't even done any cable measures so
right now all my SSDs are just hanging
out over here you know this is this
whole thing is just a mess but five
gigahertz is achieved in five minutes I
just had to tinker with some memory
stuff but yeah everything going well
with this asus board whoo so after all
that trouble was the switch actually
worth it so for 1080p gaming games like
overwatch Assassin's Creed origins and
which are three for example don't really
see a significant boost in performance
for averages and minimums however Far
Cry 5 and bf1 definitely see that
substantial increase in frame rates with
the Intel chip and bumping up the
resolution to 1440p the difference is
not as significant as 1080p results
obviously because the GPU is more
important in this resolution so the
frame rates are on both chips are pretty
acceptable and I game at 1440p anyway so
the slight boost in frame rates is not
that significant but it's nice but then
what's premieres performance like
because that's why I'm making this whole
switch in the first place so back a few
months ago when I tested the 86 hundred
K versus the 1700 X the Intel chip was
rendering the videos faster than Rison
but since then it seems like Adobe have
upgraded their engine to utilize better
cores and threads on horizon systems
because rendering 4k videos on my 1700 X
is faster
8600 k at 5 gigahertz now this
difference of 1% is not significant at
4k however if your output into 1080p the
difference skyrockets to 24% of the 5
gigahertz
8600 k vs. 3.8 of the 1700 X and it
seems like those extra cores and threads
on the Rison system really are utilized
when you output to 1080p with Adobe so
just keep that in mind if you're
potentially thinking of getting arisin
for content creation it's still a
fantastic value and performance the one
thing we're into winds is warp
stabiliser something that they use quite
often so you're about 20% faster and
stabilizing clips versus rising but
numbers aside editing on an Intel
machine inside premiere is like night
and day vs. risin so absolutely no
dropped frames when playing back
original 4k footage with adjustment
layers and color presets applied
something that I've never been able to
do on the rising machine because we
start to drop frames as soon as the
playback starts to happen so you rely on
using proxies to to like edit stuff and
now I can just preview original 4k pixel
to pixel footage and not see a dropped
frame when so many layers are stacked on
top of each other that is exactly what I
was looking for when I initially wanted
to make the switch back to Intel and it
really makes me sad to date tries it
because I feel like this platform has a
lot of potential especially with the Zen
plus that just launched so you're seeing
about 10 to 20% extra rendering
performance on like the new 2,000 chips
so make sure to check out our review
over here but you know until we get that
you know that balance of stability and
performance with highly used
applications like Adobe Suites you know
people will gravitate towards Intel
because of that and by the way if you
have not yet subscribed to the new
channel boot sequence consider doing so
let's see what's on the news hey what's
up guys I'm your host snows and today in
the news we've got YouTube cracking down
on MC NS Amazon trying to get into your
car and some new rumors on the nvidia
gtx 1180 click down below to learn more
alright guys so I hope you enjoyed this
little adventure coming along with me
and just seeing the whole process of how
things have evolved throughout this
entire idea and I'm happy that
everything is stable it looks beautiful
I love the purple
I love the case but I do miss that air
cooler because going with them eh oh
that is definitely louder alright guys
I'm Dimitri make sure to subscribe and
check out this other relevant content
most likely Rison and we'll see you in
