possible without the innovative fantex
world-leading nvidia graphics memory
partner corsair and the retail partner
NCIX
along with silverstone and in win hey
guys Eber here with Harbor Canucks and
we stopped by the or suite and they
announced their top-of-the-line gaming
notebook the x5 then actually claims to
be the world's most powerful 15 inch
laptop featuring a 5th gen Core i7
processor GTX 960 5 m in sli memory
support are up to 32 gigabytes and a 3k
IPS display that looks gorgeous with
outstanding viewing angles and a sharp
image now with g-sync support the panel
is 75 Hertz instead of traditional 60
Hertz this whole GC part is very
exciting as we can experience tear free
and stutter free gaming and GPU
communicates directly with the panel now
plus triple-a titles are super demanding
especially at that resolution so having
your framerate hover over 40 to 50 FPS
on average would feel like 60 plus with
g-sync
the x5 supports a quadruple storage
system with 3 m2 SSD slots and one 2.5
inch standard hard drive or SSD that can
be configured in raid and this large
array of drives would be awesome for
content creators or is also partnered
with Avery media to fully integrate a
hardware encoder that is designed to
record high-definition gameplay footage
along with a video feed without
hindering on performance this is perfect
for twitch streamers as it can come in
very useful on the go at zero point nine
inches the laptop is a very thin and it
only weighs about 5.5 pounds so the x5
actually fits the portable category for
productivity work and gaming the
aluminum chassis feels strong and the
design is a little bit on the aggressive
side very oars like they really wanted
to emphasize the lit-up logo on the lid
something that was missing on the x7
notebook so give us a like if you would
like to put the x5 through proper
hardware qex treatment and let us know
your first impressions on the x5 plus do
you care that g-sync is now on notebooks
let us know with the comment below
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
