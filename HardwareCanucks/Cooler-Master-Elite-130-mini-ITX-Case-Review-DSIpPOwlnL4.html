welcome to another video review so as we
continue to explore the world of mini
ITX and closures it is becoming more
clear that people want to go towards
that form factor to save space but most
importantly the potential for
enthusiasts great gaming systems without
compromise coolermaster has been very
impressive with their n series the tries
to merge functionality with space
efficiency so today we're taking a look
at their elite lineup that takes a stab
at small form factor enclosures with
that exact same focus the elite 130 is
the latest addition that rings in at
just $50 that makes this an extremely
competitive enclosure with a pretty
small footprint as well both left and
right side panels are ventilated
unfortunately without a dust filter
while the top where your power supply
will intake cool air has an integrated
mesh at the back we can see a power
supply bracket which is an awesome
addition for compatibility with longer
power supplies and standard ITX seen
here with two PCI slots the front of the
case we have an optical drive slot 2 USB
3 in the audio jacks
along with PR buttons and a single USB
2.0 jack on the right side the panel is
removable with that brushed aluminum
plastic that looks quite elegant plus an
integrated dust filter is there now I
don't know why they didn't use the same
for the top or the sides a 120mm fan
intake is included but I'd recommend
swapping it for something more powerful
for better cooling at the bottom we find
small case feet for stability and a few
mounting holes for the drives removing
the case cover and taking a closer look
at the dust filter it is removable for
cleaning but I do question the
effectiveness of it considering how
large the openings are and I really wish
cooler master took dust proofing more
seriously especially on the sides for
your graphics card intake now one thing
to mention is how compact and sturdy
this 130 is without panel there is
absolutely no flex no cringing metal
sound so the steel frame is perfectly
robust now given the form factor cooling
is usually a big challenge so we have a
single front intake and aside
eighty millimeter fan that sits on the
bracket and set for intake and you can
rotate it for exhaust or remove it if
needed the bracket on the left is
actually meant for drives but it will
support a 120mm fan in case you'd want
to utilize that and now the challenge
within these compact spaces is storage
the optical drive cage incorporates two
and a half and three and a half drive
mounts just in case you don't care for
the optical drive it utilizes a rubber
grommet system for mounting on each side
of the drive and corresponding holes to
secure drives in place it also supports
a single mechanical drive with the same
mounting and also a hidden SSD placement
at the bottom of the optical slot so
that's very considerate the drive
bracket on the side of the case can
utilize either an SSD or a three and a
half inch drive again using the same
rubber grommet system and we also have
more drive placement on the floor so
drive capacity in this case is pretty
great now with the three and a half inch
drive installed at the bottom it does
not interfere with your graphics card so
there is no compatibility issues however
connecting all the SATA cables to the
bottom there was quite difficult
considering how close it is to the side
drive bracket and starting with the
assembly the power supply bracket is an
excellent feature but because it is
mounted on top of your motherboard
motherboard goes first on our unit one
of the whole stuff where the standoffs
didn't have any thread so I couldn't
mount the standoff into the case instead
I secured it to the motherboard so it
doesn't bend at the corner and this is
actually quite common occurence based on
other user experience so I would love to
see a tighter quality control and
starting with the initial cable work the
side fan bracket may become of an issue
depending on the motherboard layout and
an opening on the left side of the
bracket would allow cleaner routing as
otherwise it's just on the way there
isn't much for cable management some
cable tie mounts at the bottom and so
you will have to maneuver your cables
away from your front intake now I'm very
impressed with GPU compatibility as 12
inch cards are supported no problem so
this certainly has gaming potential
because the power supply placement CPU
coolers are limited to three inches but
this really is meant for
or 120-millimeter all-in-one water
coolers to be mounted at the front and
while there is that slight cable mess
you can tuck everything to the side
leaving a pretty clear airflow tunnel
for the internals and getting our GPU
installed and the system has a lot of
potential for a mobile and machine or
steam box I had some trouble fitting the
power cables because the graphics card
is taller than standard but I managed to
make it work I initially wanted to
remove the optical drive but realized it
is riveted at the front
so that's something to keep in mind and
with the system assembled the Elite 130
is an impressive little case that was
straightforward to work in and fits the
criteria for a performance mini ITX
enclosure with no power supply or
graphics card restrictions it has pretty
decent drive capacity while utilizing an
optical drive to its full potential
plus the just $50.00 this is almost a
no-brainer considering competing cases
go for almost twice the price however I
would like to see more emphasis on dust
proofing the enclosure not just in the
front but on the sides and the proper
dust filter for the top also a modified
side fan bracket for cleaning cable
management would be appreciated but
still the elite 130 is a strong
candidate within the rest of offerings
that doesn't sacrifice functionality and
really focus on enthusiast potential and
deserves damn good value a word now I
still think we need to see more emphasis
on space efficiency and internal layout
so I'm really excited to see what
Coolermaster will bring out next now
between the elite 130 Corsair 250 d the
