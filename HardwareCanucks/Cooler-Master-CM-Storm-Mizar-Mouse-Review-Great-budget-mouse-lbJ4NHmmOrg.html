great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Eber with Harbor
Canucks and gamers today have so many
options to choose the right device for
your budget and your preference one of
the latest gaming mice from Coolermaster
is the CM storm bazaar rocking a
straightforward ergonomic and attractive
design that most users will not ignore
retailing for just $60 CM storm is
aiming at the mid tier bracket so let's
see if it's worth it
the initial impressions indicate an Okie
a build quality it has a very familiar
feel to the SteelSeries rival gaming
mouse with a familiar shape and even the
sight coding is almost the same
everything is plastic and given the
light form our perception of quality can
be scoot at only hundred grams the Mazar
is one of the lightest mics that i've
used so far yet with a well balanced
weight distribution unfortunately it
doesn't come with customizable weights
to suit the users need and personally a
heavier Mouse would have suited my style
slightly better
ergonomically it's well shaped the
textured grips on the left and right
side of the mouse complement a secure
grip while offering a pleasant handling
experience the curvature of the right
side provide enough support for sight
fingers and a slight curve for your
thumb to sit the right place nice
the Teflon feet at the bottom provide a
smooth Glide without any signs of
peeling and that was great to see given
our recent experience with the g502 from
Logitech the Mazar is equipped with the
latest Avago 9800 laser sensor which
does seem to be hitting a lot of mice
these days tracking was as expected no
issues on white surfaces nor on glass
the sensor can go all the way up to 8200
dpi still unusable for most gaming
situations even for high resolution
displays but I enjoyed my usual 1600 to
1800 dpi setting there are seven
programmable buttons on the Mazar the
omron switches on the left and right
primary buttons are not heavy and quick
presses are easy to do the scroll wheel
on the other hand required a lot of
pressure to quick which made it
difficult to use in game plus the scroll
steps are really light so they are not
as defined as they should be the DPI
shift buttons right behind the scroll
wheel are easy to reach with your middle
finger
and the two buttons sitting on the left
side of the mouse are nicely placed for
quick use via thumb actuations come to a
hard stop on these side buttons
requiring slight tightening of the grip
in order to keep in line with your aim
so keep that in mind the cable is
braided and it comes with proper logo on
the tip to help differentiate between
other cables that you may have plugged
in the Mazar has customizable LED
options that is multicolored and there
are two separate lighting zones which
includes logo at the back and the scroll
wheel along with the DPI share buttons
unfortunately the only zone that you can
customize is the color of the logo with
seven colors to choose from it is
somewhat limiting but at least the
lighting of the logo is uniform the
software looks pretty clean with six
different tabs that are organized
appropriately and you can store up to
four different profiles thanks to the
built in memory of the mouse you are
greeted with the main tab that
essentially displays all the seven
programmable buttons which you can
customize to your preference the
Advanced tab helps you tweak around with
the different DPS settings of up to four
steps and you can customize the LEDs
with seven colors with the LED
brightness the sensitivity double
clicking speed and the button response
time the macro tab essentially helps you
record macros and assign them to seven
programmable buttons and of course you
do have the option to create load delete
and save different profiles and so its
conclusion time the ergonomically shaped
design should suit many gamers the laser
tracking is different from optical
sensors but nevertheless it's accurate
on the fly dpi change and excellent
online switches make for one enjoyable
Mouse to use the driver software is
complete with all the customization you
need and the LED lighting is a nice
stretch for the price the only negative
we can mention in this price bracket is
a scroll wheel that was just too
difficult to press with really weak
scroll steps that wasn't comfortable to
use for gaming also we can't have it all
but the mouse is fairly light and the
lack of weight customization means
you'll have to adjust to the light form
at the end of the day the Mazar doesn't
disappoint at all for the price and
should not be overlooked if you're on
the market for one and we are giving it
the horican Arc's damn good value award
although if optical mice are your thing
check out the following reviews
the g502 a few my onyx mines and the
SteelSeries rival that would help you
narrow down your best option for your
price range and let us know in the
comments section down below what mouse
you are currently using are you rocking
a laser or an optical sensor as always
