great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with Hard
Rock Canucks and it's been almost two
years since the launch of a m-- DS
Hawaii GPU and we've been patiently
waiting to see how and what AMD will
come back with as recent launch of
NVIDIA 980 TI really sparked consumer
interest in what's been in development
at AMD while this new generation of
graphics cards is nothing short of
revolutionary for the GPU market because
the first round of HBM 1.0 or high
bandwidth memory will pave the way of
how memory interface is built moving
forward so without any further ado let
me introduce to you the AMD r9 fury x
featuring their new fiji xt HBM GPU
now there's a lot to cover with a few
yaks and I'm truly excited to see Amy
get ahead of the game with mass-produce
graphics units with HP M so first things
first let's get the specs out of the way
the r9 fury X still utilizes the 28
nanometer a manufacturing process we
have 4096 stream processors 64 ro peas
256 texture units the core is clocked up
to 1050 megahertz
it has 4 gigabytes of HBM memory clocked
at 1,000 acre hertz on a gigantic 4096
bit memory bus bring memory bandwidth to
512 gigabytes per second AMD has done a
lot of work with power improvements as
well on the feejee xt core that hits a
TDP of 275 watts this is important
because the power envelope is identical
to their 390 X and actually lower than
the Tula TX but is significantly more
powerful than those two cards and now
the last piece of the puzzle the price
it is released at $649 which means it
will compete directly with invidious
flagship gtx 980ti and we really just
hope that availability is there but the
fury x should level the playing field or
at least allow aim the market share to
go higher aim they will be releasing
several variations of the card do we
have the water-cooled fury X air-cooled
theory and a true small form-factor card
the r9 nano which is the length of the
PCI slot so make sure to subscribe to be
notified when our views of those come
out but for now let's focus our
attention on the fury X so first of all
a nice design theme has done a fantastic
job with making sure the card looks and
feels unique everything from the soft
touch dotted texture on the side that
can be removed by the user by the way
and replaced with something you 3d print
yourself which is pretty cool with more
soft touch plates all around the backlit
Radeon text on each side to properly
regardless of orientation aim D included
a load indicator above the to eight pin
power connections to show GPU load the
color can also be switched from red to
blue or a mix between the two for this
sort of purple tone the tubing is
threaded we are told the idea here was
to match threading on many power
supplies but I wish it was just plain
black tubing like on their 295x2 and the
size of the fury X is also impressively
compact this will redefine how we think
of enthusiasts small form-factor pcs but
keep in mind even though it's only 7 1/2
inches in length because the tubing
exits through the back it kind of
lengthens the car to about nine inches
for realistic sizes the main reason for
this board size reduction is hpm and
here's a size comparison to fury x on
top and the 290x at the bottom and these
able to achieve a reduction of up to 65
percent in size because the memory is no
longer spread on the board around the
GPU but it is now stacked on the GPU die
and so the way this works is we have an
interposer think of it as a silicon
motherboard where the memory is stacked
on the logic die almost like floors of a
building and this proximity of DRM cores
improves bus width bandwidth and power
efficiency compared to gddr5 memory
structure and check out the actual size
comparison between the one gigabyte HP
m2 gddr5 so this is really impressive
size reduction
the 120 million radiator is a little
unconventional because of extra
reservoir space underneath that holds
more liquid but it may limit mounting
options in type cases and potentially
interfere with other components in your
system so here I mounted the fury X
inside my favorite ITX case the N case
m1 that fits it just fine but the tubing
isn't as flexible and could introduce
challenges and because the fan is placed
in front of the radiator the most ideal
mounting location here is at the rear
for proper exhaust and if you are
thinking of mounting at the front it may
not work in many builds as you usually
want the front to intake air Amy's
choice of fan here is nothing short of
perfect this gentle typhoon is one of
the best radiator fans with high static
pressure and low noise plus notice the
added circular support on the blades to
prevent vibrations for display
collectivity The Fury acts sports 3
DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 1.4 and given
the attractive nature of this card for
an HT PC it's really confusing to see
the lack of hdmi 2.0 also we are told
that an adapter will be made available
later the summer and so the fury X is a
feature loader GPU taking advantage of
upcoming dx12 support to drastically
reduce api overhead that promises to
utilize available CPU and GPU resources
and if you want to read up more in depth
on these exciting dx12 features I'll
leave a link in the description below to
our article and I would highly recommend
you check it out
so now on to the best part the apart
you've all been waiting for
let's talk performance starting with
1440p benchmarks there's a clear neck to
neck arms race between the two flagship
carts the fury X is either one frame
above or below the non-native tie
however this picture changes a little
bit once we look at the witcher 3 with
fury x losing to keep up and to our
surprise a similar result for bf
and all these other games where the fury
X is just below the competitors flagship
this is most likely due to driver
optimization and we really hope to see
more performance squeezed out with more
mature drivers but it is when we look at
4k gaming the gap between the two cards
closes and performance of HP M truly
shines and this resolution even if it's
just four gigabytes compared to gddr5
six gigabytes on the TI and twelve
gigabytes on the Titan X it's when some
it loses some but the important thing to
notice is just how much faster the new
Fiji architecture is compared to a m--
these previous Hawaii temperatures are
low the very impressive hitting just
fifty degrees Celsius
that water cooling unit is doing an
amazing job and we are really interested
in seeing how the air-cooled fury will
perform so leave us like if you'd want
to see the fury X compared to the fury
despite this being a water-cooled kart
though we've noticed GPU whine an
audible pumped noise for the card making
this one the louder GPUs in our stack
placing it inside the case though mutes
the whine but here it is take a listen
now we've brought this up to AMD and
they are aware of this issue on the pump
and changes have been already applied to
production parts and we hope to have an
even quieter acoustic profile for the
consumer versions of fury X next is
power consumption and AMD has been
really hard at work to reduce the power
draw and thanks to power efficiency of
HBM and other architectural changes you
are looking at a more efficient GPU that
is comparable to Maxwell's stop the line
and with that said there's very little
room for overclocking unfortunately
about 10% at best on the core and memory
overclocking is practically unavailable
but given the impressive bandwidth of
hpm you simply don't need to overclock
your memory and so this is it
r9 fury X is the first mass-produced GPU
to feature HP M and I think AMD has done
an outstanding job with the physical
aspects of the card the full feature set
of dx12 support power consumption is now
under control
compared to Hawaii it runs cool and
quiet and most importantly it fits right
in line to compete against the 980 TI
this was an important element to get
right with this release and I really
think that they did now a few hiccups up
to point out are noticeable GPU whine
and the pump isn't as silent as perhaps
you'd want hdmi 2.0 is missing which
makes no sense and overclocking is
limited and we were hoping to push the
core past a 1050 megahertz just because
we have so much cooling Headroom but
here's a product that is pushing
innovation forward with HP m and we're
giving the r9 fury ax a damn good and a
damn good innovative award
