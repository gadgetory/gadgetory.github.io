and the n60 h200 eye is finally here
it's just a mini iteration of the h 709
check it out over here but in order to
answer if it's Fred worthy we need to
first rewind
so I have a really exciting objects the
closure that's supposed to hit my
doorstep and I'm just excited to see
more ITX options in 2018 but why is it
that majority of companies that make ITX
cases are ballooning them up it seems
like the industry is going in Reverse
and trying to make them as large as
possible so it can accommodate the most
hardware but I don't think that's the
right approach you could say the same
thing about the intro so let's check out
the h2 100 I and what it brings to the
table right after this the new master
liquid all-in-one coolers are available
in 120 and 240 millimeter stylish
radiator sizes with air balance fans
included for best air flow and RGB sync
on the pump and the fans that are
controlled via this hub or through your
motherboard check out the ML 120 ln 240
l down below okay so first of all let's
start with the size um I didn't realize
just how little and cute the H 200 would
be I thought it would be something in
the realm of the size of the NZXT monty
ITX which as you can see it's much wider
it's taller it's just overall bulkier
and they went back to the roots of like
this whole angular structure that looks
fantastic and it's yeah it's so tiny I
mean the perspective here I can fool you
around but look at this here the NZXT
monta and the dark bass 700 the full
tower so in comparison yeah it's very
small I'm happy that this is the size
and nothing bigger and it's also quite
difficult to show on camera but the red
accents here are super vibrant I was
expecting something a little bit more
muted but wow I fell in love as soon as
I open this just the metal pieces on the
interior and the exterior looks
fantastic and so in the usual NZXT
fashion we have several color options
that you need to follow for color
coordination because the side
ventilation area and the interior cable
cover really pop in color I think the
price point will be a major deterrent
for many even though it comes with a
smart hub for fan control and lighting
control at $129 in an already expensive
ITX eco system you might be tempted by
several compact mid tower options like
the mesh if I see or the s340 elite for
example that they're much cheaper but
the H 200 I is a cute little cube with
fantastic built quality nice DG panel
that is only slightly tinted and the may
value-added here is that smart hub that
for majority of ITX users might actually
be useless and I'll explain later why
now because the exterior is full metal
aside from the glass panel if you own
one of the magnetic pucks you can easily
occupy one on the surfaces over here for
your headphones and even the colored
sections which are also metal you can
even attach it right on the corner there
for that really cool effect now I love
the design direction with the entire H
series with the hidden logo in the front
and a pretty deep air pocket behind the
front panel and the slightly angled
ventilation on both sides that actually
has a purpose so for the glass part it's
part of the frame so it doesn't protrude
only the thumb screws do and you can use
that slight angle area to pop out the
glass panel with your fingers while on
the other side it helps to secure the
right side panel the rear side panel has
captive thumb screws so that's awesome
and instead of you kind of inserting the
panel on all sides you just insert it at
the front because we have these pegs and
they go right over here making a
reinstallation of the panel a bit easier
and that way you can actually kind of
compress the cables that are behind it
because the panel does pretty much all
the job for you now I generally don't
might be for thumb screw method on the
tempered glass side panel but the
threaded here is so short that every
time I open one of these up they tend to
just simply fall out and roll away
forever
the i/o is basic with purple USB 3 ports
illuminated power button and the i/o
cables are already bunched up in this
super easy to install connector I really
wish this was the standard for all cases
up top we have a cool exhaust
perforation for a 120mm fan and a built
in dust filter since the fan is already
pre-installed it's kind of nice but
accessing it for cleaning will not be
fun now the case is large because we
have a roomy power supply chamber with
support for standard ATX units and a
bracket is pre-installed for SFX power
spice too and there's a dust filter
underneath there are only two PCI slots
the rear 120mm fan can be moved down
slightly and behind the front panel is
all of our airflow goodness with a
removable dust filter and the fan
bracket that you pull out after four
thumb screws now it only supports up to
a 240 millimeter radiator or dual 140
Miller fans and the bracket is non
symmetrical so if there's only one
correct way to install it with two high
positions for the radiator so the lack
of a to 80 millimeter rear support
is totally understandable given the size
of the enclosure but initially when I
found out it couldn't support my X 62 it
was like why and going back and we'll
the feeling a little bit like a
hypocrite because I want things to be
smaller but yet I question why I can't
support certain hardware so as you can
see I have the X 62 right next to the
front of the case and you can see the
height here if this was to support it
they would have to either move the front
i/o or extend the height of the case
because it's just I mean it's almost as
tall as the case itself and therefore
you know 240 only at the front and I am
totally ok with that
so coming inside I love the power supply
shroud and the cable cover I think for
this size of the case this division
creates is perfect as the ITX board does
not extend beyond the cover and
hopefully you are occupying the front
with the radiator I love how it wraps
below the top fan and extends around the
motherboard cable area and flattens out
near the GPU section it does fill up the
space quite a bit and it can be removed
for some breathing room at the front we
have 89 millimeters of clearance so you
can do push-pull setups but then GPU
clearance becomes a concern as with
my configuration a 27 centimeter GPU is
one centimeter away from the radiator
now unlike on the bigger cases this SSD
caddy on the side cannot be repositioned
to the perforation on the shower on a
smaller model because the holes here
don't align and they're just for visual
purposes and ventilation only at the
back the power supply chamber is fully
open we have awesome cable routing
channels near the main entrance and up
top to help control maybe some fan
cables or something like that there's a
dual SSD caddy and a smart hub tucked
away in the corner with everything
already pre routed so this is where I
think the inclusion of the smart hub for
ITX may be a mistake as I went ahead
with my XIII 70 build an 80 600 K only
to realize that majority of ITX
motherboards don't actually have dual
USB 2 motherboard headers my z3 70 I
gaming only has the one so that's where
the smart hub must be connected but
majority of all-in-one coolers also
require a USB 2 header for driver
control so I had to keep my x52 cooler
disconnected because of it so I cannot
control the color of the pump nor the
pump speed however the fans are
connected to the Smart Hub so at least
that is controllable to me the area
around the motherboard is well laid out
for all the cables with a long cutout on
the shroud to pass anything below and my
only complaint are with these 4 thumb
screws for the GPU mount which are way
over tightened something that's becoming
increasingly common among cases and it's
annoying ok so the entire build process
was easy I'm satisfied with the interior
it doesn't appear too large for the
hardware but having SFX only support
would make the shroud even smaller the
built-in LED strip at the top is now
more tucked away and gives off nice
ambient lighting and you definitely need
to have a radiator at the front
otherwise the case is not being fully
utilized cable guidance at the back is
not tricky at all with these plastic
channels and a large pocket in front and
on the side the power supply
but I will suggest to expand one of the
main plastic channels so the thicker 24
pin cable can sit in that easy all right
so with regards to the smart hub if you
want check out the full extensive
overview check it out on the H 700 I
review it's basically the same thing but
on the age 200 I devote you had you can
connect up to five fans and you can just
basically control the lighting of the
top LED strip so as a value-added it's
good because it's a combination of grid
plus which is a fan controller and the
hue plus which is lighting controller
built into one but you really got to ask
yourself if that's worth it to you and I
wish that NZXT would roll out the h200
without the Smart Hub would like a nice
price reduction because the case has a
lot of potential especially if you're
populating a radiator in the front
cooling is great it looks fantastic the
build quality is awesome tempered glass
is nice although those thumb screws do
roll away from you the Smart Hub is not
for me I would personally just go ahead
and plug in my fans into the motherboard
but again this is an ITX thing so that
you don't have that many fan connectors
on 90 exports so having a fan controller
built in makes sense but it does occupy
that USB port so you potentially may not
be able to use your all-in-one cooler
with it so it seems like we stumbled
upon some compromises that kind of
cancel each other out in some way or
another
but still I wasn't expecting them and so
that's it for my review of the H 200 let
me know what you think in the comments
