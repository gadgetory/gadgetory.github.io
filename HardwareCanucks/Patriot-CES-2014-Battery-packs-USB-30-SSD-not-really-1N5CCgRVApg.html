is brought to you by and see IX
technology connected alright so hey guys
we are here in the Patriot boot with CES
2014 and they are moving towards the
mobile market with the release of a
bunch of battery packs that will go over
now no news about ddr4 yet but it is
will be released later in the year so
not announced at CES but potentially
high later on the year so let's go ahead
and start with these battery packs so
when the first one is this sort of a
fuel plus mobile kit so it's an eighty
seven hundred million power battery pack
comes with an actual battery pack micro
SD card and the USB to micro SD in case
you want to connect your phone and use
it as for for data next is this fuel
active which is actually exists a fuel
active this is the fuel plus which means
you can plug in your iphone 5s and this
is twenty fifty million hours providing
about twice the charge of your original
charge of your iPhone so pretty
innovative also acts as sort of the
protective cover and with the additional
against camera in camera holes here and
all the button exactly where they would
be here next one is the fuel active this
is actually I do like this this is more
for you know if you go camping and stuff
so there's a power button to see how
much charge there is this is 6,000
milliamps of charge which is excellent
so we have a USB and a microSD for
charging and it also has its own cable
simply just you know it's kind of sits
discreetly on the side there for
charging your phone devices now this is
like I said would be used for I guess
this is fuel active so you will
potentially will be taking this on the
road with you so it's very very sturdy
it actually has a dust proof cover so in
case you drop this into a puddle it will
still maintain you know still maintain
all the connections and it also has an
LED here so by holding the LED button it
will turn on the first royal LEDs the
second roll with these and then if you
want to have a little Raven your tent
there you go okay so this is the fuel
active from
from Patriot next are these sort of
lipstick design / flashlights so this
there's a little button here so again
USB and a micro USB micro SB for
charging there you go we got a
flashlight this is 2000 milliamps of a
million powers of charge very nice and
it's actually based on the competition
so this is a very strong lady very very
good quality LED so nice a nice
flashlight there it's also very nice and
sturdy construction very thick materials
and also they're reaching out towards
sort of the larger brakes so these would
be fuel plus with larger charging
capacity and as you can see there are
multiple colors they are targeting chart
and targeting sort of the feminine
market here a little bit because that's
a huge market especially for for iPhones
and things and so we have 52 52 hundreds
of charge 6070 eight hundred and nine
thousand million hours of charge so as
you can see quite a variety in terms of
battery charging station for your mobile
devices so they're definitely going
towards that towards the market and it
seems like everything you need for this
type of mobile sector so now let's go
ahead and check out some memory so one
of the things that they like like we
said earlier no ddr5 announcement ddr4
announcements yet but here this is their
new patriot viper low-profile kids so
they are told they're telling us that
they've been requested from a bunch of
customers to release low profile memory
so it comes in both 16 18 33 and 2100
kids and 16 gigabyte capacities as you
can see in three different colors and
they'll also have a sort of your kind of
conventional memory with a larger
heatsink for a slightly better
overclocking again an 8 and 16 gigabyte
capacities and I'm sure 32 as well in
three different colors but also another
cool thing here at the Patriot kit are
there a mobile SSD so it is connected
whether USB 3 so let's go check that out
alright so another cool thing that we
saw here at patriot booth at CES 2014 is
this supersonic phoenix
the USB 3.0 now it could be a little
liberal of misleading so this is in the
name it's a USB 3 SSD this is more of a
form factor as you can see it looks like
an SSD but in a very smaller form factor
there will be available in 256 512 and
one terabyte capacities a little bit
more than a dollar per gigabyte so it is
a bit of a luxury item then your let's
say your regular says these but this is
a very small form factor as you can see
so will you will be able to connect this
with the USB into your into your
computer so instead of occupying entire
space like you would with a regular
flash drive instead of occupying this
much space when your laptop this gives
you a little bit a more compact and
compact space beside your USB so this is
the Patriot the supersonic Phoenix and
it's using its it's using the same
technology as you would with this sort
of flash drive here but you're getting
you're still getting very acceptable
speed so are on 250 reads and just
reaching 200 rights so this would be a
very good solution for sort of your
travel needs if you need to transport a
lot of data if you need to transfer a
lot of data when you travel and seems
like it's in this sort of plastic
housing with this sort of brushed
aluminum looking finish but hopefully
we'll see some more compact and sturdy
construction here so this is the
supersonic Phoenix very interesting
device from patriot and so this
concludes sort of our coverage here at a
patriot so don't forget to subscribe for
the rest of our CES 2014 coverage and
make sure to LIKE this video if you want
to see some ddr4 patriot</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
