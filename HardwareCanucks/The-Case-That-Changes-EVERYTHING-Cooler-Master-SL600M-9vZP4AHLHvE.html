always let me see what your master has
to offer they have to jump leads is that
I'm really excited to share with you
guys but first two states do fanfics
thermaltake and pure master making our
conflicts turn possible now let's go
check now's the case all right so first
let's start with a coup master SL 600 m
SL stands for the silent series M stands
for the maker series
we're told they'll be maximum two
hundred and twenty dollars so hopefully
they can bring that down a little bit
now that the evolve X is out at 199 and
it will come out in early October this
is actually the case that I'm super
excited from coolermaster because of the
exterior design it just has this
futuristic paneling with aluminum frame
on the exterior now they want your color
feedback and whether or not they should
stick with this like silver aluminum or
they should go with something different
like black black would look really
boring I really like the silver one but
potentially white is an option or
potentially multicolored paneling I
don't know let us know how you feel
about the paneling color it's the size
of a full Tower but I think it's likely
taller because of the really high case
feet because of new air flow direction
so the cool elements on this one are
include the i/o that illuminates with a
wave so there is a sensor so as soon as
you wave your hand over it it lights
have the USB ports so in a dark
environment that's actually pretty sweet
it will also light up the power button
and that's the only illumination that
they will include despite having the
coolermaster logo on front panel that
will not be illuminated okay it's okay
you can sneeze like just don't die the
interior your motherboard layout the
standard but the power supply has moved
to the front and this allows them to
place dual 200 millimeter fans which are
included at the bottom of the case for
that chimney airflow effect as the
traditional power supply shroud is
missing with this layout you can move
the power supply up and down to
potentially accommodate for longer
graphics cards and exhaust from the top
with a separate piece that can come off
for additional exhaust that will stay on
magnets and I really like this mesh
pattern on here and the mid section we
are told will include a coarser mesh for
better exhaust and so with this layout
you can do a 360 round up top in the
bottom and notice the rear section of
the case
where the exhaust fan is usually located
it is totally closed off to seal this
area and allow for better static
pressure of this top-to-bottom airflow
the issue though is that not all CPU
towers can be rotated on the standard
mud would lay out to face up so that is
something to take into account and you
cannot rotate the motherboard for that
90 degree rotation I really like their
approach with the vertical PCI brackets
which come by default and this entire
bracket can be turned 90 degrees for
horizontal orientation so the vertical
layout is better for the CPU
temperatures because there is more space
for air to reach to the top while
horizontal is better for GPU
temperatures and then cooler master
recommends an all-in-one for your CPU if
your graphics card is horizontal and one
of the main advantages of this layout
aside from the efficient air tunnels are
noise levels since the back of the case
is totally silent while the sound will
escape from the top only and behind the
motherboard tray we have a large cover
near the front so that covers our power
supply and cables they will are the
smaller cover near at the bottom area so
you could potentially leave that right
side panel completely off and all your
cables hidden too and this layout
overall is not super efficient since
with this large Tower we only have 4 HDD
or SSD mounts for storage but the
verticality does allow for better
airflow
I think this layout will serve very well
for micro ATX or ITX systems when you
can really compact the height of Tower
yet still receive this lot of airflow
from the bottom really hoping cluemaster
might go that route alright so the
second case is the cosmos C 700 M so the
price point on this one is a little bit
pricey side at 399 dollars which is $100
more versus the original which by the
way check out our review always over
here but they have improved a few things
on the exterior for that slightly
refined look plus the darker color
scheme on the gray versus the original
the i/o remains the same it just been
slightly restructured the interior
received an upgraded for the shroud and
this new cosmos is part of the maker
series so cool master wants you to feel
like a modern when working inside the
case so not everything is given to you
on a platter in terms of cable
management and the orientation and
hardware support but you kind of have to
go about your way trying to creatively
think inside this enclosure but for the
exterior we get a loo
front and top paneling with some plastic
pieces still buy the art colored so you
can't even tell what they are I love
this new cool ventilation pattern up top
it's something different
the iconic cosmos handles look awesome
and the lighting game has been upgraded
with a RGB strips of course running
across all three sides from the top to
the bottom under globe the front panel
is removable without cables for that RGB
lighting we have this four pin Tula's
connection that's appreciated the curved
glass is awesome but it's super tinted
you can see it's reflecting everything
around us and only reveals the interior
if you're actually lighting the interior
the rear side panel is still solid and
this case will come with four 140 ml
fans now the interior layout has changed
a little bit because the power supply
shroud now spends the full bottom side
instead of splitting into the different
panel like we saw with the original and
they're really pushing the whole chimney
airflow effect because the shroud is
ventilated and you can install fans at
the bottom for intake but the two weird
elements on the new cosmos include a
fully modular interior of motherboard
tray so aside from having the option to
invert the layout like we saw in the
original you can now rotate it 90
degrees with the motherboard IO facing
down now sure it opens up some doors for
creative and unique builds but the
motherboard IO is literally inaccessible
if you want to plug in USB or audio now
they might include adaptors for this
orientation but it's really inconvenient
if you want to simply plug in your mouse
or speakers or something like that you
literally cannot access that IO at least
the rotation is not difficult on this
frame and hopefully they'll include
visual markers on the mounting joints
now you also see this new GPU bracket
that is vertical and has a little swivel
action let us know if you like this
design by separating one of your cards
to a different part of the case it is
quite different especially because you
don't really compromise on airflow since
you can have front intake to cool the
GPU where is currently located and it
can also be installed on the power
supply shroud now the catch however with
this panel is that the small bracket
itself is included with the three $99
price point but the riser cable is not
so if you want to go that route you'll
have to buy the one which is $40 on top
of the current price and for storage we
have five hard drive caddies that
come out where the GPU is currently
located alongside forces these
throughout the case and so the cosmos
see 700 M is geared towards martyrs and
individuals who don't mind the challenge
of cable management since the backside
is totally bare so good luck but I do
like the upgraded shroud additional
modularity on the motherboard tray as a
concept despite not having access to the
i/o and the exterior upgrades over the
original but I'm personally more excited
about the CL 600 M to really test that
chimney effect because it's not a new
system but I'm happy that it's making a
return now all right guys so that's it
for ku master cases make sure to check
out this other relevant content I'm
Dimitri and we'll see you in next video
