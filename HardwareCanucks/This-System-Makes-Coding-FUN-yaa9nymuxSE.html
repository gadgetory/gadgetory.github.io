today we're checking out something very
exciting from the folks over at keno now
Kano is a creative computing company
that focuses on providing computer kits
and accessories for users who are
interested in technology and have the
desire to learn how to code age is not a
requirement here because it's for
everyone every in fact every product
that keno advertises is for everyone out
there including app developers so if you
like to build something creative with
the help of coding then you know these
kits might definitely or should
definitely interest you now what I have
here is the computer kit bundle that
retails for $300 and I feel like that's
a great deal because you're getting a
screen you're also getting a Raspberry
Pi through a unit a keyboard and
trackpad along with the necessary cables
to get you up and running so you don't
have to worry about getting an external
monitor or you know power cables and
whatnot everything is inside this bundle
so that's awesome kino also provides a
different kit at various price points to
get you started for instance there's the
entry-level pixel kit that retails for
$80 and it's basically a 16 by 8 LED
programmable kit that can be used to
code dazzling lights build your own
games create animations and perhaps
paint with light all you need is a
computer that runs either Windows or Mac
OS in order to download the Kano app
from the website to program the pics ok
however I will be connecting this pixel
kit to my computer gear over here
because Kano has pre-installed the
necessary applications to get me up and
running so that's what we'll be doing
for this video there's also a motion
sensor kid that's priced around $30 it
can be used to make music and games and
it can be controlled by simply swiping
and waving your hands pretty cool stuff
in my opinion just to be aware the
computer kid bundle can be picked up
separately so this computer kit can be
picked up for $150 and the scream kit
can be picked up for another hundred
fifty dollars so the options are very
flexible depending on how much you'd
like to spend so with that being said
let's unbox this bundle
alright guys I do want to spend some
time and talk about the building
experience because it was very intuitive
simple to understand and most
importantly it was fun each kit comes
with their respective bill guides along
with stickers if you're interested in
personalizing devices everything is well
laid out and the user gets to learn
about each and every component powering
the entire kit this includes everything
from how a CPU processes data to how a
graphics chip passes commands to the
screen you know what's even cool colored
cables guys I mean check this out keno
includes a red micro USB cable a blue
3.5 millimeter audio cable and a yellow
HDMI cable that's right
a yellow HDMI cable and all of this
encompasses into a colorful and creative
learning experience and I'm really
diggin it so far now let's quickly go
over the setup for the computer kit
bundle the screen is powered via micro
USB and it connects to the Raspberry Pi
3 unit via HDMI speaking of the
Raspberry Pi unit it comes with 4 USB
2.0 ports a LAN port audio output which
has already been occupied by the
built-in speaker HDMI output and a micro
USB port for power just to be clear both
the screen and the computer are powered
via this single 5 volt USB power supply
the included keyboard and trackpad unit
is Wireless and it connects to the
computer through the USB receiver so
that's pretty cool
moving on to the pixel kit it has been
by far my most favorite unit among the
other three it's so much fun to play
around with and it's also a great
addition for your learning experience
first and foremost the pixel kit can be
operated by its own because it features
a battery and if you want to program it
you can definitely pair it up to the
computer via Wi-Fi there are 5 moments
that you can cycle through but
out-of-the-box kano only preloaded with
two modes the rest are designed to be
programmed by the end user the built-in
presets are very interesting for
instance the audio visualizer reacts to
sounds so I can talk to the kid and
it'll simulate a cool waveform I can
also change the color of the waveform to
my desire using the joystick and there
are also two extra buttons that you
could use to you know switch between
presets the game mode dial features
three classics including Super Snake
Rainbow Runner and breakout you would
have to use the joystick obviously to
control you
and I have to admit it was a lot of fun
guys and it took away my productivity
time which could be positive or negative
depending on how you take it now setting
up the pixel kit to your computer is
pretty straightforward all you have to
do is download the aquino app directly
from the website and once you go through
the installation procedure you just have
to head over to the pixel kit option
within the app and pair the pixel kit to
your Wi-Fi network this is actually a
pretty cool feature because right now I
have the pixel kit connected to my Wi-Fi
network and of course my counters
associated with kano in remember you
have to create an account if you want to
take advantage of the challenges and of
course have everything synched up so if
whatever changes I make within the
aquino app will automatically be synced
to the keno pixel kit which is pretty
awesome in my opinion because you don't
have to worry about connecting it every
time if you want to transfer or run a
particular code it just works
automatically and that's pretty awesome
now programming the pixel kit evolves
around building blocks and it's not
about you know writing the advanced code
lines to you know get it up and running
in my case I have I followed a few
tutorials to get this weather which is
up and running and it's pretty
straightforward so I have the location
set to Tirana because this weather
widget heavily relies on your location
and what happens is when with these if
statements that are over here reflects
upon and it starts cross-checking with
the weather widget so in my case I've
said the location to Toronto and if the
weather is cloudy
it'll cross-check that with the weather
widget and it'll start to show cloudy if
it's rainy it will cross check with the
weather widget and I'll start to show
rainy if it's snowing I'll cross-check
you'll see it'll show snowy and if it's
sunny it'll cross check and it'll start
to show sunny so right now in Toronto it
is pretty sunny out there and it looks
like it has accurately determined that
weather condition and it starts
displaying sunny on the pixel kit now
what I can also do is head over to the
location setting and change to a
different City so in my case I can just
head over Toronto edit that to Ottawa
and I'll start displaying
cloudy because what it just did is
update the weather widget so it checked
marked and set that to Ottawa and then
it started reading these if statements
and it seems to have matched with it
seemed to have cross-checked it with
this statement over here which is if
weather is cloudy set the weather widget
or the
to cloudy to display the cloud figure so
the creating part doesn't end here there
are always different options and just a
multitude of things that you can do with
the pixel kit there's actually a tap for
different creations that you can share
with other community members as you can
see you know we have a Pikachu a display
which is actually very interesting
there's also you know Mario 3 you know
things like this that seem to be very
exciting and you can always learn from
their codes and understand how they were
able to create something like this and
you can build you can use that as an
inspiration and start working yourself
to create something that might be unique
to do yourself and of course to the
members out there I've also created a
few more programs for the pixel kit
other than just the weather app this
pixel painting app starts with a single
pixel that cycles between different
colors and once they start moving around
the entire kit the pixels start to move
up and down side to side painting the
entire screen it uses the included tilt
sensor which is just an accelerometer to
receive the positional readings and
start sending that data to the app which
I thought was pretty cool I was also
able to create this firelight simulation
for the kid and it looks through every
second so like I mentioned earlier the
possibilities of creating programs for
the pixel kid are endless let's switch
gears and talk about the computer kit
bundle as you can see I have the screen
connected to the Raspberry Pi 3 unit and
the keyboard the whole system powers on
by just plugging in the microUSB cable
you are greeted into the home screen and
displays all the major applications to
help you learn how to code for instance
you can head over to the Econo code app
now this is sort of the central hub when
it comes to learning tutorials and stuff
like that for example
you have the option to learn how to take
advantage of the speaker that's inside
the Raspberry Pi 3 unit so over here you
can see you can you know start from
level 1 can go 2 all the way to level 6
and get you know get yourself familiar
eyes with the with the system there's
also options to learn how to use the
pixel kit so for instance I have to go
through the training session to
understand and familiarize myself with
how to use this pixel kit and it turned
out pretty well I mean I ended up you
know enjoying like my time with the
pixel kit there's also the option to
code and learn how to you don't draw art
with the help of coding so if I just
quit here for a second so this
application allows you to draw pictures
with the help of coding so for instance
let me go over and click this smiley
face emoji and you know I can start to
learn how to code with the help of just
you know simple few steps so as you can
see what I've done here is just write a
few things like you know select the
color yellow you can also you know start
adding a stroke and set the level
depending on you can set a certain value
so for example 20 will set the thickness
of the stroke effect you can also do
things like you know hit circle and add
the value of the intensity of the circle
so for instance 200 means I'm gonna get
a pretty large circular figure it really
is an excellent option an excellent way
to learn how to code with just a few
steps and as you can see it's very
simple but this I definitely had a lot
of fun just trying to learn how to you
know draw things with the help of coding
so this is an interesting application
it's called hack minecraft and what this
allows you to do is program certain keys
within the keyboard to enable a certain
command so what I've done here is
actually called a named a function
called name if I especially what it does
is when I press a key for existence for
instance I have programmed C as my
command it will display a little add a
text named Hardware canucks so if I go
back to my game here for a second all I
have to do is hit C and you can sort of
see where hard-working X is so I have to
do is just go back and take a little
glimpse at what it's like and as you can
see it looks pretty amazing now you can
see Harbor connects in all its glory so
this is this is pretty awesome you know
you can do certain things like add
towers and assign certain commands
within your keys to help you know build
your own world within Minecraft and I
think this is something that I'm
definitely going to spend some time on
it I have to make a confession here I
really haven't played minecraft this is
my first time actually getting to
experience this game so if any of you
guys out there are
you know minecraft lovers well you can
go as much as you wanted to come and
down below I should also mention that
this is a fully functioning computer
because keno doesn't just restrict you
the applications that teach you how to
code but there are other programs that
are installed on the Raspberry Pi third
unit that you could take advantage of
you know if you want to just do regular
work for instance there is a browser if
you want to browse things there's also
an app store that you know has whatsapp
if you want to communicate with your
friends or family there's Wikipedia
there's Google Maps Google Drive Gmail
there's even a youtube app if you want
to watch HD videos not 4k because the
hardware is not capable of that and
there's also a task manager built inside
was so if you want to monitor your
applications you can certainly do that
now kano is actually running their
operating system which is based off
Linux so it is open source and so if you
want to switch things around you can
definitely just unplug the SD card and
you know plug in a fresh new card and
take it from there if you so desire what
kano has accomplished here with the
computer kit and the pixel kit is
revolutionary
I mean consuming technology is a great
experience from one end but
understanding the simple backbone
structure behind you know that builds
the entire ecosystem is fascinating sure
this kits not gonna help you build a
most advanced software out there but
it's a great stepping stone towards that
learning process to get you to that
level the visual building blocks helped
me understand simple algorithms behind
the weather app that I created and the
pixel kit is a great accessory to help
you interact with you know your
creations it's also a great way to start
a conversation you know between family
and friends and of course you can have
fun with your family and friends by just
simply tossing ideas and creating
applications so overall you know it's a
great kit it can be used for fun it's
also you know visually very appealing
and I'm definitely gonna you know have
this in my living room
I'll be playing around with it here and
then of course I can start programming
games and stuff on this pixel kit and
start gaming on this LED screen so yeah
it's going it's gonna be pretty fun so I
would love to hear your thoughts on this
entire kit from Kano
what do you guys think about this entire
ecosystem specifically the computing kid
there's
Green kit and the pixel kid let us know
in the comments down below links to
purchasing these kits will be in the
description down below as well you also
get a $5 coupon code so I'll leave that
in the description down below but yeah
let me know what you guys think about it
