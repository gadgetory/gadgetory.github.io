haven't even received our brief yet but
we're gonna do something a little bit
more exciting let's go to the balcony
let's see this view look at this it is
so nice and cool over here let's see
what's in this wall you can see it all
the way the mountains there's a pool are
you trickster what's everyone I'm
Dimitri with I recognize here at
Coolermaster what a welcome little
champagne in the balcony a little tour
of the entire suite and let me tell you
I am super happy to hear and see what
their sort of their future direction for
2018 so let's begin with the age 500 P
mesh so the idea behind this sort of
renovation in their master case lineup
is to take the feedback from the
community
aka your comments our reviews and
implement them into a very near future
releases so this is why the mesh is here
so there's a four step little upgrade
process so the first upgrade obviously
comes from the front mesh aka the the
thing behind the name very happy to see
them improve this situation so you still
get very beautiful looking enclosure and
now with so much extra airflow this mesh
has a built in dust filter so it you
have basically no restrictions and no
longer choking the airflow this panel
also has a new notch at the top so it
doesn't just simply fly out and has a
lot more resistance top panel also has a
thumb screw at the back for that secure
low paneling and the power supply can
now slide in from the back so the
installation is much easier and the
number four point is the built in RGB
controller so that the fans are no
longer need to be connected to your
motherboard they can be connected to the
for that lighting control it's very
similar to what they have on their
all-in-ones coolers low buttons for a
little customization of the color and
effect in the future what they want to
do is actually implement the whole
lighting controller into the reset
button and I can't wait for that to
happen the kiss that way you eliminate
the additional hubs and less wiring and
it's all just built into the i/o make it
happen
please obviously you can see the color
is different so this is the white
edition it will come out first and then
two to three weeks later we'll see the
gunmetal version come out with all the
same improvements so it's going to be
priced the same at $149 as the original
aged 500p and so the only caveat is that
these rollouts and these upgrades are
coming out a little bit you know not
immediately but two to three months so
by March we are expected to have all old
stock of the aged 500p that has all the
original features to be rolled out and
everything been replaced with these new
additions oh you're recording again Eber
you a little trickster all right guys
let's just get into it so this is the
master case emcee 600p so it's the
continuation of the upgrade program from
the master case six in this one a few
upgrades are fairly obvious so in the
original a master case 6 we only had the
red RGB now we have 17 color options
with some rainbow effect and it's still
quite bright but I think the lower the
brightness a little bit so it's not like
blinding you right in the face the
second upgrade is the power supply out
on the interior that is now removable
which is awesome that you can substitute
the LED power supply shroud that looks
absolutely fantastic and you can also
move the interior a little bracket that
has all the holes for different marginal
elements so that you can potentially
install more accessories down the line
but of course the best thing is the
price reduction the original was 159
this thing is now 129 so you get the $30
reduction and that's awesome because you
get the same case that you can open up
the low panels and have extra airflow or
close everything down for that silent
edition and the case looks still looks
awesome and also by the way they've
added the tempered glass panel so you're
getting more things for less money
master k-6 or the MC 600
is now on the market and by now I mean
in about one month and the last case on
this maker series isolators have a pop
up I felt like a carrot let's do it
again
and one more case here is the MC 500 M
so it used to be called the mastercase 5
now they're revamping their naming
scheme so with this one a few updates a
type C port at the front with the Gen 1
speeds the price reduction as well from
$1.99 to 169 and a really awesome
addition is they finally including a
case that includes their beautiful RGB
power supply shroud cover I think it's
one of the better-looking
RGB shrouds on any case that illuminates
the interior it's nice ambient and it
still allows that separation for the
hardware between your power supply so I
think that's a really good approach to
really maximize exposure for all their
accessories
alright guys so this is the last case
that we can talk about today this is the
H 500 M M stands for maker obviously it
has a lot of the same design language as
the H 500 P and now the mesh and it's
kind of like a merge between the two
because no longer are we seeing acrylic
side panels and they've replaced all
four sides with tempered glass which is
awesome because it makes the whole case
just feel more premium and you can wipe
fingerprints here easily and just having
glass is much better than the acrylic
panels now the cool thing about the
front panel is its combination with so
that you can see they've redesigned to
have a bit more mesh if you are using
glass but you can pull this out and
replace it with a mesh panel for better
air flow if you're going that route the
i/o still features a type C port at the
top but they're still unsure about
whether or not they'll be genuine or
gen2 however
the addressable RGB craze is all over
CES and seriously it's like everywhere
if a fan doesn't have addressable RGB it
is not a fan so here we have 200
millimeter fans that are addressable RGB
and a single 140 millimeter that is also
addressable RGB so we get nice pure
whites and better control more lighting
effects built-in right in here right
right a built-in built-in straight of
the fan built in out of the box now one
interesting interior piece they've added
is this little acrylic piece near the
power supply right now it's
lit up in RGB and has the cooler master
outline which there most likely won't
keep but let us know what you guys think
about that integration allowing you to
see the power supply and also allows for
a little different texture and different
color combination on that power supply
shroud so it looks a little bit more
unique and different now at the back
they've also added a little extra piece
near the power supply route so that it's
completely covered and therefore you can
have basically the entire case and cable
management exposed to the environment
without placing the side panel and I
absolutely love that industrial and like
all the panels everywhere and they've
listened to the feedback and they've
added that additional panel so it looks
a bit cleaner and they are also
relocating that fan controller and the
hub for the RGB to a different spot so
it does not actually occupy the SSD
caddy and so they'll have something a
little bit extra and they'll find a more
pristine and optimal position for that
hub so it doesn't occupy or you know
interfere with any of the hardware and
it's they're looking at something that
will also be easier to route in terms of
cable management so that's really good
forward-thinking
from their part on like all the feedback
that we've given them and the community
has given them as well now expected the
release date is q2 an end of May so
right before Computex begins and the
retail price of like what they want to
launch it with is at $199 so I would say
like if the H 500 mesh is 149 and here
we get temper glass and like all these
little additional upgrades I would say
it's actually a pretty decent deal from
the Coolermaster product line so they
don't let sort of overstep their own
toes in terms of competition between
their own lineup so yeah 139 what do you
think about that guys check this out ooh
nice snap your fingers and change your
color so one cool value-added thing that
cool master is going forward with is
letting you control the addressable RGB
not just on your fans but on all RGB
peripherals so we have the master plus
software and it takes dominant color of
your screen and changes the RGB to that
color so it's really good in games it's
really awesome for movies so right now
we have that Vanna Leaf thing above us
and it changes color based on what's the
dominant color on the screen we're
watching my review of the H 500 P so
yeah master Plus software to
control and develop your own lighting
patterns for all that customization of
lighting and creation of your own
lighting patterns coming from
coolermaster alright guys so that
concludes our cool master tour we're
about to head out to a surprise place
that we've never been to and it's been
teased out throughout the entire week so
that's actually our last CES appointment
so hope you guys enjoyed this
coolermaster coverage and let us know
what you think about our CES coverage in
general I'm a tree tree Connie burr
thanks so much for watching and hey you
guys both good people Michael Michael
alright guys thanks much for watching
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
