that simplistic Scandinavian appeal with
easy to work in internals great airflow
and storage potential and comes in both
the windows or plain side panels for
your preference the Nvidia shield began
as an experiment to test out the waters
on Android gaming and it's what really
brought portable Android gaming to
reality with a console great built-in
controller also the ability to game
stream your PC games up the shield was a
major selling point plus the console
mode allow this device to basically
become your home theater PC with its
HDMI output and wireless streaming and
based off the success of the shield
portable Nvidia has gone ahead a step
further with the introduction of the
shield tablet featuring many of the
capabilities of the original shield
while in a more familiar and portable
form factor
alright so the unboxing experience was
simple with the entire shield family
packed together with a few cool gaming
perks like good luck have fun inside the
control box all nicely hidden here's the
entire shield family if you will it
definitely has grown and I feel Nvidia
is really onto something with regards to
mobile gaming pricing for the shield
tablet is competitive retailing in $2.99
for the 16 gigabyte and Wi-Fi only and
399 for LTE enabled 32 gigabyte model
the shield controller retails for $59
and the tablet cover 429 the 8 inch a
1920 by 1200 resolution screen is nice
with wide viewing angles and decent
contrast without any color shifting good
to see that but the edges of the display
are a little harsh and the plastics that
rub the sides peek out just to be
noticeable and I wish these were
smoothed out for a better handling
experience the shield tablet is rockin
Tegra k1 that is the star of this launch
it's a quad core SOC a 2.2 gigahertz
with 192 CUDA cores based off the Kepler
architecture so it can do many things a
desktop equivalent GPU can do there's 2
gigs of ram Wi-Fi a BGN unfortunately no
AC and
four-point-oh support both the front and
rear cameras are 5 megapixels with
really fast burst mode but with constant
focus problems and images are come out
grainy even in well-lit scenarios 1080p
video recording is available here's a
sample looks really decent actually and
speaking of good the front-facing stereo
speakers are done right with excellent
forward projection and enough volume for
proximity gaming plus the extra bass
ports on each side to deliver a more
rich sound so let's take a listen movie
on the physical tour all the connections
are on the left side with a headphone
jack mini HDMI out micro USB and two
bass ports on each side up top there's a
power in the volume rocker micro SD slot
for expandable storage up to 128
gigabytes awesome a sim card space for
the LTE enabled versions and the stylus
that sits securely inside the power and
volume rockers are really flush to the
body and on our sample had very little
tactile feedback instead they were
squishy and difficult to press requiring
either precise nail press or full hand
readjustment to have enough force for
the buttons to register not cool the
included stylus is passive with the
rubber tip that hasn't shown any signs
of wear with daily use but there's no
replacement tips included unfortunately
it has pretty decent palm rejection auto
not exactly lug free as there is visible
catching up the NVIDIA dabbler amp
utilizes the power of the key one to
simulate water and oil painting that's
quite impressive actually
and pretty accurate auto doesn't do real
color mixing on the canvas it just
overrides the bottom color at the bottom
we find magnetic slots for the optional
tablet cover that snaps into position
with confidence and allows triple angle
orientation although with this landscape
mode the power and volume side is
inaccessible at the
and also the magnets give out easily
would just slide pressure on the tablet
which I'm not happy about and so while
the cover is low-profile using the
tablet with it on was uncomfortable as
it sticks out on the other side making
gripping the device more challenging the
backing is slightly rubberized with a
shield tag speaking through that allows
secure grip and the shield tablet is as
thin as my nexus 4 although not as light
as you'd expect for a tablet this size
but you'll get used to it
now moving on to the shield controller
and has a very familiar feel to the
original shield and side-by-side the
controller has a slightly smaller form
and no longer has a rubberized on the
side
it is using Wi-Fi instead of bluetooth
for apparently reduced latency and it
also allows up to four controllers to be
connected to the shield tablet for some
multiplayer gaming button placement
feels natural with comfortable reach
although the Direction pad has a soft
click instead of defined presses that I
would rather prefer they've added the
volume rocker at the bottom along with a
small trackpad that works quite well and
capacitive touch buttons in the center
for Android navigation along with the
middle shield button to access the Tegra
hub plus a built-in mic for voice
commands in Android and these all have
useful functionality added like double
tapping the home button to access
running apps or holding it to get into
Google now holding the back button to
enter shadow play and twitch streaming
and holding the Start button to enter
the controller remapping they all
illuminates indicating when the
controller is on and the controller also
automatically goes to sleep when idle
after a few minutes there is a microUSB
for charging and the headphone / mic
jack for audio pass-through at the back
of the controller and the audio quality
is actually impressive auto could be
tabbed louder and only once I
encountered strange interference with
the audio now for some reason the
controller is not capable of connecting
to the shield tablet over a five
gigahertz band instead you have to
connect over two points four gigahertz
for the initial connection and only then
switch over to the five gigahertz once
they are paired up the controller also
lacks a power button for the shield
tablet itself that would be very
convenient for console mode to get rid
of needing to turn the tablet on for
yourself the controller has up to 40
hours of gameplay on a single
very nice with the battery level shown
on tablet when paired up now coming up
to the CEO tablet the overall user
experience and Android 4.4.2 is mostly
satisfactory of course giving the
powerful hardware packed inside and
while the key one almost doubles the
performance on the shield portable there
is an occasional and unusual stutter and
lag in the UI for example sometimes when
exiting game you can see a laggy home
screen the preloaded camera app crashed
on me a few times and here's a
side-by-side rotation speed with my
Nexus 4 where the shield tablet just
slags behind and the same deal when
compared to the Nexus 7 it just shows
that Android optimization isn't there
yet for the k1 okay so now on to some of
the cool features of the shield tablet
is the gaming experience the shield hub
allows you to find controller compatible
games and also navigate into your apps
thanks to the built-in shadow play
feature you can record your gameplay
directly from the tablet you can also
stream to twitch at 720p with a
front-facing camera broadcasting you and
you can enable voice for commentary and
twitch chat overlay all thanks to the
Kepler architecture and considering how
popular twitch has become this is an
excellent feature to have inside the
shadow play settings you can adjust
orientation ego landscape and portrait
quality of the recording and volume for
commentary and you also get the
flexibility to move windows on the
screen now trying to comes pre-loaded
it's on the games that's optimized for
the Tegra k1 and it plays very well also
a with occasional dip and framerate and
pretty lengthy loading times but with an
overall satisfactory experience
revisiting half-life 2 certainly brings
back some memories and it is quite
impressive considering it's all running
on the k1 plus there are many titles and
new works that would take advantage of
this SOC like war thunder now compare it
to the gaming experience you get the
shield portable that is more natural for
this all-inclusive device the tablet
feels more awkward for example the need
to pop the tablet on the stand but I
find limiting and the need to carry the
controller could be a hassle and I think
many of us were expecting some type of
pop in controller like we saw on the
Razer edge but where the shield tablet
really shines is console mode that
utilizes the HDMI output turning this
device basically into an HTP see where
you can power a 1080p screen with
Android gaming or multimedia like
Netflix HD plus you can still game
stream off your kepler powered PC so all
the original capabilities that made this
shield portable so popular are still
intact
unfortunately the CEO tablet does not
complement the shield portable in any
way so if you already own the latter
they're just standalone devices without
any mutual benefits whether you guys -
battery life I've got a full day and a
half using the shield tablet as a tablet
plus some casual or relaxed and running
half live to serve me well over 2 hours
of gameplay it's not the best but I do
think that the shield tablet as a gaming
device is definitely more suitable for
console mode or maybe like your station
a device other than portable gaming in
which case will be constantly plugged in
all rights bill 81 so the shield Aegis
system has become slightly more immersed
with the shield tablet and complementing
accessories and I'm glad Nvidia has
covered most of the groundwork first of
this being a proper tablet with
excellent display and speakers
appropriate image foam factor to be just
the perfect size for mobile use as a
tablet with HDMI out capabilities and
incredibly impressive Hardware packed
inside that allows a screen capture and
twitch streaming without a significant
hit on performance console mode and game
stream capabilities that would turn this
into a perfect companion for your TV in
the living room the wireless controller
is actually quite nice with excellent
audio pass-through and low latency
thanks to Wi-Fi connectivity plus
pricing is extremely competitive for the
$2.99 model for basically what you get
the shield cover on the other hand needs
work as it is an integral part the
equation for mobile gaming the UI
experience on the shield tablet wasn't
as smooth with occasional a lag and
stutter which I wasn't expecting
plus the volume and power buttons need
to see a redesign and there's no way to
turn on the shield tablet using the
controller and it is awkward needing to
carry the controller in the first place
if you want to play some games while
you're on the go now it is a device that
shows the muscle squeeze
Vidia as project logan now known as the
k-1 is finally able to shine in the
android sphere and while the entire
shield system still needs a bit of
polish it's not perfect we're giving
this the Harbour Canucks damn innovative
award as there's no other tablet on
market right now that can do as much as
the shield but what do you guys think of
this implementation or would you rather
prefer the shield portable leave your
