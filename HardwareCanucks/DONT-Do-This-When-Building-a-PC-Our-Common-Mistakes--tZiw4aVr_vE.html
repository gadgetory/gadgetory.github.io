computers over the years and you know
sometimes things get out of hand and
silly mistakes happen nots the fun level
errors but common mistakes that happen
when we build pcs and by the way if you
have not yet ventured into building your
own highly recommended and super fun
poopoo yes and so today I'm gonna share
a slightly embarrassing list of mistakes
that 100% did not happen to me so we can
all appreciate the art of the assembly
process I would love to hear what you
have to say about this topic in the
comments below let's begin damn what I
provide the egg system you run and this
is an ATX machine you mean micro idea no
no full sized ATX components it's just a
small package it can still satisfy the
queue 500l by Cooler Master and
affordable and the pretty compact
enclosure for all your regular hardware
would perforated exterior and PSU
bracket the chips up and down flexible
signed io and awesome cable management
the Q 500 L a compact frame with full
ATX satisfaction check it out below
alright so let's start with the basics
simply opening the case box which you've
probably been doing wrong for this
entire time so instead of opening at the
top and then rotating the box to give
the birth of the case and then rotating
that it's way too much work you cut at
the bottom of the box lift it and then
the case is ready
since one of my most common mistakes
believe it or not is actually forgetting
to turn on the power supply so you get
that brief moment of panic when you're
trying to press the button on the case
and nothing is booting up and this is
especially annoying and frustrating if
the power supply is somehow hidden
inside the frame and is not easily
accessible but of course for majority of
the time make sure that little eye thing
is switched on I hate how the threading
on motherboard standoffs is not
standardized across cases so we either
have the fine thread screw which can be
used for like SSD mounting and such or
the slightly wider thread which is most
time used for radiator installation of
course if you use the included screws
with the case you will not have an issue
but I have collected so many toolboxes
and screws over the years that I just
take one from there and don't use you
know the screws provided by the case
what I wish I should but that is my
mistake so half the time my screw
doesn't fit the motherboard standoffs
you have to double check which one need
to use before inserting the motherboard
I think we've all been there not reading
the instructions manual even though you
may think you know how to open the side
panel or construct the entire case if it
comes this
or mouthing is simple PSU bracket so
it's always a good idea to refer to the
manual to avoid frustration and actually
discover new things you know you'll feel
like an adventurer that are not 100%
obvious like being able to rotate the
motherboard orientation on the street
come to or install a second power supply
on the OLM and dynamic instead of the
hard drive gauge or even just like
accessing or removing that dust filter
on the mesh fic with an awkward finger
poke from the bottom I know we're
friends in here but this is your best
friend
when it comes to avoiding any
frustration and clarifying things hey
clarification on the screws to and the
screw thing can actually be quite
frustrating if you have screws for the
model or standoffs for the SSD different
ones for whatever our brackets and stuff
and they're not labeled properly inside
the accessories pouch and they're not
labeled properly inside the instructions
manual so that can be a really major
frustration point sometimes when i'm on
the russian trying to get b-roll i've
installed the fan facing the wrong
direction and this is actually a true
story when eber was building his first
system he mounted push and pull
configuration with the fans facing each
other so blowing directly into the
heatsink yeah no mistake sometimes when
I'm not paying attention to the radiator
placement I have the fan cables facing
the wrong side so when the radio is in
position the cables are facing you and
not towards the back and speaking of
cables and that's like a whole other
category so often I plug in the GPU and
route that before realizing that I
forgot to plug in the SSD and that SATA
port is right underneath the GP you have
to pull everything out to route a single
Drive come on
now what about routing everything in the
system only to realize that the case
lighting or some other fan controller
requires molex power and you're using a
modular power supply don't expect
anything in the case that needs a molex
power connector and that is not plugged
in to your power supplies you have to
re-take just take everything out and
that's super frustrating so always
double-check what needs to be plugged in
either additional SATA cables or not
molex man that thing gets me every time
for cable management the way I used to
do it is plug everything in and only
then try to route and clean things up
that is a rookie mistake one by one is
how you get the cleaning done as much as
I love my SATA cables I used to use one
that doesn't actually
in 2d drive which kind of sucked because
post assembly it might had shifted and
therefore when I tried to boot it would
not be recognized in the BIOS and then
the hair gets pulled the same can be
said for the 8 and the 24 pin
connections because they're quite bulky
they're usually in like two housings and
they're quite difficult to put in when I
built my dual system and evolve X I did
not fully plug in the 8 pin on the ITX
motherboard and that's like like hidden
behind everything else that's going on
so that would not build and that was an
hour of my time wasted tried to figure
out why because the motherboard was
receiving power and I thought it was my
GPU but nope a simple 8 pin on the
motherboard was just not fully plugged
in all the way and yeah that eliminated
a lot of headaches afterwards now for as
long as I can remember a magnetic
screwdriver would always accompany my
hardware and assembly adventures
be quiet actually has the best one that
comes with some of their coolers but it
wasn't long ago until I got myself a
magnetic screw tray so you know when you
remove the side panel and you put your
thumb screws on the table and they just
run away and disappear well and finally
with any new machine please do a clean
install don't be an idiot like me you
know I went from an interim oisin to
rise a machine and use the same drive
but instead of doing a clean
reinstallation and wiping everything I
just did the windows refresh thing
caused a bunch of driver issues and
instability don't be like me do a fresh
wipe alright guys so those are all my
mistakes that I'm hoping we can sort of
relate into you know this is obviously
not the only thing that happens to me
right I would love to hear some of your
errors and PC building living in the
comments below make me feel slightly
better because yeah it's a little bit
embarrassing all right guys I'm Dimitri
