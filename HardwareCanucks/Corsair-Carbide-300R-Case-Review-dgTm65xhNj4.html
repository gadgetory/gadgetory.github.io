at the value chassis from course here
this is part of the carbide series the
300 are now coarser has given a stab at
sort of budget cases in the past with
the 400 and 500 are which still holds
strong ground too similarly price
competitors and the 300 are breaks the
lowest price point we've seen so far
from Corsair however the major concern
with this breakthrough is if the company
managed to deliver to price conscious
consumers without too many compromises
and first impressions on build quality
were a little disappointing and that's
because the case feels a bit flimsy and
then say relatively light enclosure
which is a first coming from coarser the
front panel connectors are kept to a
minimum and then easy to reach spot with
your power and reset buttons audio jacks
that are not coloured which we really
like and 2 USB 3 ports that connect
through an internal 20 pin cable and
unfortunately no adapter is included
below that we have three optical drive
bays that are removable from within the
case and our usual intake for airflow
with additional venting on each side of
the panel the panel can be taken off
which is secured by these metal clips
and courser includes a 140 millimeter
fan with support for an optional
secondary fan intake now check this out
the side venting in the panel have
removable dust filters but unfortunately
the main front dust filter is non
removable and taking a look at the back
we have our usual exhaust io slot water
cooling holes without the rubber
grommets 7 PCI slots little more venting
and a bottom mount a power supply with a
removable filter and the chassis is
elevated by large case feet to allow
ventilation for that power supply the
top panel can house dual fans which is a
big plus for heat exhaust but there is
no dust cover which makes it prone to
dust collection when the computer is
powered off the side panel can mount
dual fans that sit directly above your
graphics card for that extra overclock
and so far no windows version is
available and coming back on the topic
of Chrome
Mises the side panel feels cheap and
flimsy which doesn't reflect coarser as
usual standard so let's get inside first
we have three tools optical Bei mounts
below which an empty compartment that
squeezes in that extra airflow and the
hard drive cage with four Thewlis
brackets that are also SSD compatible
now the sidewalls seem to have the same
mounting for the drives meaning a
potential release of the same chassis
with more storage options but it would
be nice of course they're offered the
other wall as part of the accessories
unfortunately there is no bottom intake
cutout and the power supply is elevated
but not on the rubber grommets which may
cause unwanted noise from the power
supply the case supports ATX and micro
ATX motherboards and as we have seen the
absence of rubber grommets in this case
the cable cutouts around the motherboard
tray are bare which is a first coming
from coarser who initially implemented
the whole idea of grommets and at the
back of the case there is just under an
inch of room to work with for all your
cable needs and no issues for passing
them through the cutouts the CPU cutout
is fairly large and should have no
issues with support for mini
motherboards and also another great
thing to note are all the front panel
connectors are in black which is perfect
for making it tight interior now one
issue we did come across during assembly
is the length of the front panel audio
connector obviously this would depend on
your motherboard but it did not have
enough reach to pass through the very
bottom cut out another option Corsair
suggest is to use the cutout closer to
the back but in this case the power
supply did not align with the mounting
holes and in the end the audio cable was
left unused and continuing with the
assembly the tools drive mount has
become the standard which makes
installation and swapping drives a
breeze and let's check out the back
there 300r cleans up with literally
minimal efforts on the 5 minutes spent
plugging and tucking away the cables
which would make even the beginners to
enjoy the process of cable management
and as you can see graphics cards are
linked up to 450 millimeters are
supported thanks to the breathing room
above the hard drive cage in case you're
going for a multi GPU build about eleven
point seven inches is available which
should be plenty for most of the current
high-end graphics cards
so let's recap the new addition to the
carbide series first off this value
chassis brings to the table many
practical and future-proof functions
like USB 3 support for drives for
storage relatively small enclosure that
supports extremely long graphics cards
with excellent cable management that
doesn't project what courser is capable
of but it does the job and the entire
package for around 80 dollars that many
people would consider within budget for
a value build unfortunately courser is
not capable of keeping up with its own
quality standard when they try to cover
a larger market and the degraded build
quality is definitely felt on a 300 art
if you really want that corsair
experience while working with a chassis
you might want to consider the earlier
line up of the carbide series thanks
guys for watching and we'll see you next
