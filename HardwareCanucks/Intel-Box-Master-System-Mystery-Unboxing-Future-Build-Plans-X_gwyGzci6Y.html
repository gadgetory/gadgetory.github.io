Canucks and the mysterious box just
landed at our doorstep from our friends
over at Intel super excited to check it

guys seen some videos online already of
it but this is gonna be slightly
different because this is us jairo
Canucks so we're gonna take our handy
screwdriver check it out what's inside
the box so let's open it up
the mysterious box from Intel I don't
think I'm doing this right oh my god
actually smells he's got some get some
very interesting smell all right guys
this is it this is the int'l box the
Master System it smells very straight it
smells I don't know if it's either the
packaging material or is it some type of
smoky wood flavor smell reminds me of a
sauna for some reason I'm not sure maybe
because there's this interesting family
on the front but I mean Intel huge you
know props for them making this look
like an Atari system with the rainbow
colors very cool color scheme this
cartridge here very authentic stuff look
at this Oh me I can't wait to open this
up and see what it is impress your
friends hopefully we can do that with
you guys but let's see let's open it up
all right this is it continuously with
the uniform design with the rainbow
color scheme and this color look at this
wood accents on the bottom ventilation
on the back and the fake power switch
power adapter
Wow look at that experience what's
inside now this is this very interesting
locking mechanism that I hope isn't
broken but let's see no no big deal
Dimitri's here we're going to fix it so
we can show you the proper unboxing
experience on this master until box it's
just a simple battery swap where the
batteries have fallen out and because I
want to experience what's inside and
will experience a properly man to
battery oh did you hear that I heard it
alright we're back to business people
the master box from intel has been fixed
so we can experience this unboxing
together properly let's do this one more
time BAM look at that look at those
beautiful oh you didn't see that power
on alright so this is this locking
mechanism where we have to dial in the
proper until tune which is playing right
now in order to I get access to what's
inside so this is this audio law ah
wrong oh we got one right all right
let's uh let's keep doing this
yeah alright so this is it this is
that's how we get inside alright so now
this locking mechanism has been unlocked
you can see it here and we can put this
away experience what's inside and what's
on the outside so you guys can visit the
link in the description below the first
length to go see the unlocked
performance and check out the CPU
options and your s is the options of
choice the first link in the description
go check it out alright the first item
inside this box would be the CPU this is
the new sky like chips into a core i7
processor that's been unlocked so it's
got a que after it what's so tiny intel
corporation 4 gigahertz so this is the
6700 k very excited to actually start
using the sky like chips to see how they
perform for an editing machine or maybe
just go for a sick as gaming rig as well
very excited to start using this
processor and i believe there's
something else inside this box that i am
super excited about especially for all
the editors out there the 750 series
SSDs utilize the nvme controller with
incredibly fast read and write speeds
and we have reviews of both the 6700 k
and the 750 SSD add-in card and i'll
link those two below I can't wait to
actually start populating some footage
onto this Drive and seeing how fast it
goes 400 gigabytes 750 until salsa drive
he or she is I got 400 gigabytes until
sol state drive how beautiful
wait a backplate gorgeous nice heat sink
and the last two pieces that the right
with the Intel delivery included an
appropriate Z 170 motherboard this one
from gigabyte the Z 170 XP SLI the board
looks pretty good with dark PCB we'll
just slight hints of red on the platform
controller hub heatsink the amp up audio
is fine with the illuminated strip there
and the LGA 1151 socket is designed for
Sky lake that would house our new 6700 k
cpu that we just unboxed the four memory
slots a support dual channel ddr4 memory
upto 3466 megahertz when overclocked and
for multi-gpu setups we have three PCI
Express 3.0 lanes for two-way SLI or
three way crossfire support and the i/o
features USB type-c and USB 3.1 for
memory we got hooked up with a corsair
vengeance LP X this is a 16 gigabyte kit
with speed of thirty two hundred
megahertz the black module is
low-profile with an adequate heatsink
and I'm really looking forward to
testing out to see how the memory speed
impacts rendering performance for adobe
CC applications so make sure to
subscribe to not miss that the memory
kit also comes with 2 vengeance airflow
fans with multicolored plates at the top
so you can interchange them and base
them on your color theme and hopefully
would allow further memory overclocking
with this additional cooling alright
guys so that concludes the info box
master system unboxing we hope you
enjoyed really excited to put these all
these parts to either an gaming system
or an editing system so let us know
which one you'd like to see first in the
comments below thank you so much for
Intel make sure to visit the link down
the description below to explore your
options for cpu and SSDs thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
