great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Herrick knucks and I just realized that
we have produced and surpassed 400
videos released on this channel so give
us a like if you'd want to see 400 more
now this has given us many opportunities
to highlight some of the best top
quality and value for many products out
there so in this episode we're doing a
top 5 gaming mice to consider if you're
looking to upgrade your current Mouse or
just looking to get a sense of what is
available on the market now these are
not in any particular order but instead
we hope to provide an objective top 5
gaming mice that we have reviewed and
starting with number one the rocket ion
now you can click on the name on the top
right corner to view our full reviews on
each of these mice but this one
seriously has one of the best button
layouts you can find on the mouse with
awesome easy shift plus functionality
that adds secondary commands to each of
your buttons there's a tilt joystick for
aircraft control and there's also a
fence switch that isn't very comfortable
to use but could serve helpful for
additional macros the ergonomics are
top-notch with proper thumb inserts
curvature of the top frame with a slant
to the right to properly support your
palm and I love the scroll wheel it has
very distinct scroll steps and is also
light enough to press there is something
I consider crucial for a gaming mouse
now this is a laser option but with
proper configuration in the software the
tracking is super precise without
noticeable acceleration and let's not
forget the awesome rim lighting that you
can actually see while you're using the
mouse if you got the means to afford
this $99 product we would highly
recommend this to get on your list now
for number two we've got the asus rog
Gladius this is their latest gaming
mouse as of making in this video and
it's got a lot going for it the grippy
sides allow light holding with good
support along with proper thumb rest and
extra form on the opposite side to
accommodate for your ring and pinky
fingers the optical sensor used in this
mouse is considered one of the best on
the market and if you have committed to
optical mice you would definitely love
this the scroll wheel and quick dpi
change behind it are tactile and allow
users to switch between two dpi
without needing to cycle through as even
one eye game I use only two DPI steps to
increase it in decrease it if I get into
a vehicle and if I exit and the best
part about the Gladius would be the swap
well on run switches as a soos includes
an extra pair that you can replace
yourself for a different resistance
click on either primary buttons and you
can even mix them up to suit your
resistive map reference the red lighting
looks sexy to suit the rog color scheme
and the Gladius is a strong contender
within this list that should be
considered just for $79 moving on to
number three my onyx AVR 7000 and my
onyx Nao's 7000 now I've grouped these
two together as they use an identical
sensor and just vary in the form as you
can't avoid the left hand users so for
those who require that left hand
operation the AVR 7000 is a good place
to start
the native 7000 has been my daily driver
ever since release and I've come to
appreciate that slightly wider body that
fits my hand like a glove for that thumb
support and both ring and pinky fingers
covered in a soft touch coating both
mice offers superb build quality but
don't be thrown off by the lightweight
it is unfortunate there is no weight
customization but you quickly can adjust
to the lightweight for both the Avior
and the nails they use outstanding
switches for your primary left and right
click and excellent site browser buttons
for soft roll off that provide tactile
actuations but continue to travel inside
the body that prevents it from affecting
your aim this is a brilliant feature the
optical sensor used here provide
outstanding tracking given you combine
this with a proper dark hard surface mat
for best results and finally the subtle
lighting features of an illuminated logo
and the scroll wheel are super
appreciated with full RGB spectrum that
allows seamless color matching to the
rest of your setup and at $79 both the
AV ER and the nei of 7000 form a
well-rounded bundle for lefties and an
extremely comfortable Mouse experience
on the nails as well coming in at number
four we have the CM storm bazaar for
those on the limited budget but still
want the proper ergonomic design good
switches and the trusted Avago 9800
laser sensor so the Mizar might be a
way to go you get RGB illumination on
the mouse a proper Glide feet at the
bottom and rubberized sides for a better
grip along with large browser buttons
for your thumb the scroll wheel is not
the best at least not as nearly as good
as with the other mice on this list but
the dpi change buttons behind the scroll
wheel are appreciated
with good access that for sure will come
in handy and for $59 the CM storm is our
rounds off the features with a trusted
layout to still be competitive and on
the last gaming mouse on the list at
number 5 is the logitech g502 proteus
core this is an extremely popular mouse
for gamers that offer outstanding
ergonomics with deep curve for your
thumb and proper top surface curvature
for comfortable handling now for larger
hands due to such a slim profile you
might not find it as comfortable but
this would be a total killer profile for
smaller hands all of the switchers are
outstanding with really fast primary
switches for FPS titles for example
quick dpi levels with LED indicators and
a sniper button to quickly activate your
preferred sensitivity when it is pressed
this is also the only Mouse in this list
with customizable weights that comes
with a storage compartment and that's
really appreciated so you don't lose
them the g5 a2 features an optical
sensor with awesome precise tracking and
the only thing to be aware of how the
teflon feet at the bottom that on our
sample were out easily and became an
annoyance with tracking and there are
many other cases like this online so
there's no replacement feet included but
it seems Logitech has addressed this
issue by sending out replacement feet
and they also believe that extra set is
now included in all the packaging and
well that would be it for our top 5
gaming mice that we have reviewed as
they have gone through our deep analysis
but let us know if any other gaming mice
that you would recommend to the viewers
to expand the horizon of a half a
million options that we already have
available and if you're an owner of any
of these mice mentioned on this list are
you happy with your current setup or
considering to change for something else
