Harbor Canucks and son Heiser just
announced a few new pairs to their DJ
line and of course knowing the quality
they stand behind we head out
expectations set quite high and today on
the review table is a pair of HD 8 DJ
headphones featuring very capable
drivers and a few useful structural
implementations designed for DJ's and
that is reflected in the just about $400
price tag so let's take a look now we
got to give a huge thumbs up for quality
packaging along with a rather large
headphone case that houses the
headphones additional ear pads and some
room for your cables I also like the
little handle for this to be used as a
standalone carrying unit HD a DJ are
appropriately weighted at 284 grams
despite the headphone being pretty much
full metal and this is one solid
headphone without standing built quality
the air cups have plenty articulation so
some swivel and angle adjustments plus
the metal extensions allow for size
adjustment depending on the individual
they do fold all the way in with a very
satisfying and reliable mechanism that
clicks in place these are feeling too
loose nor too stiff during the HD 8
conveniently compact during travels I
would certainly recommend using the
provided case for extended longevity of
the headphone but it being so solid I
wouldn't worry of just throwing them in
you bag while they're folded and putting
them on as you can see the headband is
angled forward providing an overall snug
fit without too much force and looking
very low profile the ear cups are soft
to the point of shaping to the head
without making contact the internals I
also appreciate the blue felt lining
that compliments of the other blue
accents on the headphone the headband
itself has slightly rubberized up top
with individual leather pockets
underneath to shape to your head and
give it a small nature of the headphone
this is OK but I would have preferred
slightly wider pad
now coming on to the DJ oriented feature
is that each ear cup can be snapped
behind your ear allowing DJ's to listen
to their surrounding environment without
disturbing the overall fit of the
headphone the headband is angled forward
on purpose that allows the headphone to
be stable when you change the position
of these ear cups now the conventional
way of doing the same thing is to move
the entire side of the headphone behind
your ear but that might introduce uneven
contact on the opposite side and also
uncomfortable headband pressure after
some time so this approach where the
pivot rings is a little bit
unconventional but you get used to
folding the ear cups naturally and also
very quickly with just the one hand now
because of this functionality the
removable cable can be attached to
either side that perfectly would
complement any type of placement for
your music equipment it rotates securely
into position and provided is a 1/2
meter coiled cable that extends to 3
meters so sure for any DJ set this would
be appropriate plus a quarter of an inch
adapter is included along with a
standard 3 meter cable son Heiser also
includes a set of velour pads that offer
just a little extra breathing room and
switching between is very simple just
pop them out and also don't forget about
the dedicated space inside the carrying
case so you don't accidentally displace
them now the leather pads do provide a
little extra bass extension and also
excellent isolation and you'll need to
vent your ears just in a while as they
do concentrate the heat which is
acceptable for this type of ear pad all
right so so far the HDA DJ have been
nothing but fantastic from build quality
the extra features but how do they sound
so being a DJ oriented headphone son
Heiser has made sure to pump a lot of
life into these drivers with one of the
best bass responses that have heard on a
closed headphone it's just so deep with
very satisfying sub based response I've
never heard such clean low-frequency
brace that makes me revisit some tracks
to hear sort of what I've been missing
the low frequency Rumble and young and
beautiful at the beginning of the song
is just so pronounced plus the upper
bass is neither too thin nor too boo me
allowing the bass drum throughout
to have that needed impact without
drowning out the vocals proving the
driver is very capable without
compromising on the mid-range detail nor
the high end and that's another really
strong point with the HD 8 the detail
despite the obviously present rich and
full bass it's a huge compliment to the
upper mid-range giving so much body to
the vocals without any harshness yet the
amount of sparkle and brilliance with
the HD 8 gives it a very energetic and
lifelike response also for a closed
headphone I was quite surprised with a
relatively large soundstage obviously
not as roomy as open style but in no way
congested listening to September and
it's quite easy to differentiate the
distant trumpets from placement of other
instruments within the song now the HD 8
is a 95 ohms impedance headphone that
would certainly benefit from an amp to
drive that proper bass response
however being targeted towards the music
industry I don't think that's really an
issue but even with my Nexus 4 I was
able to achieve comfortable listening
levels and overall any genre that I
tried with HD a DJ I was pleasantly
surprised house and uplifting music
stood out the most with a very well
controlled rich bass response and
totally outstanding low-frequency bass
with clean and linear mid-range and non
harsh trouble now these are very capable
drivers housed in an incredibly robust
and solid construction plus the swirl
feature on the ear cups works well after
the getting used to period they are
comfortable for what they're made for
and offer great isolation both the cable
and ear cups are interchangeable and the
included carrying case just ties this
hole into a complete package of course
this all comes at a price they are quite
expensive at almost $400 but I wouldn't
necessarily label it as a con as for
audio enthusiasts within the field this
would be a totally worthy investment and
the HD a DJ deserves the damn good award
for its sound built quality and the
extra features I would like to know if
we have any DJ's watching this review
how do
feel about the swivel earcup feature let
