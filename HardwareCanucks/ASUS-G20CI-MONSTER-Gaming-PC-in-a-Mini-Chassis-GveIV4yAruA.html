we'll start with got paper manuals here
this there you go nice to get it
Oh check this out a mouse
it included a mouse gags that's amazing
okay my assumption is that this is a
keyboard which is kind of amazing
because the corsair one does not include
any of this it's an actual keyboard I
don't think it's mechanical but let's
just see how it's going to work out so
this is it guys all to her nice and sexy
check this out
the pure bass 600 is now available with
a tempered glass panel with an easy
mount a couple of pure links to fans one
of which is 140 millimeters with three
modular interior drive caddies along
with dual SSD brackets have nothing to
hide
weather be quiet pure bass is 600 so
guys this is the ROG g20 CI desktop
gaming PC from Asus it is meant to be a
simple plug-and-play gaming PC that
doesn't require any additional setup
other than plugging it into your monitor
this Asus design has been around for a
little while but the insides have
received a pretty big upgrade over the
previous version there's now a setup
that has a seventh generation Intel i7
7700 and an NVIDIA GTX 1080 that's some
serious horsepower for such a small PC
let's talk pricing because the g20
surprisingly fits within the desktop
market there are two models to choose
from starting with the base that costs
$1500 which gets you a core i7 7700 9 K
CPU 16 gigabytes of ddr4 Ram a gtx 1070
and a 512 gigabyte SSD the model we have
in hand costs $300 more and it comes
equipped with an extra one terabyte hard
drive nn GTX 1080
that's not bad for a compact gaming
desktop because if you build a similarly
spec system you'll roughly end up being
at the same price point so Asus is
really pushing hard towards the compact
enthusiast platform and unimpressed now
some of you may be wondering about that
I 770 700 since other compact systems
like the Corsairs 1 use an unlocked 7700
K I actually like the fact that aces
went this route since this processor
cost less and the audience being
targeted by the g-20 CI cares more about
ease of use than extreme overclocking
what's interesting about the system is
just how much performance asus has
managed to pack into such a small form
factor
now just for reference the corsair one
is 12 liters in volume but the g20 is 9
and a half liters yet both have very
similar specifications the g20 ci is
basically a slim tower that can easily
be transported to land parties and it
includes some aggressive design elements
to the front grille for instance acts as
a cool showcase for the RGB lighting
inside plus it helps with air flow these
a red band around the center of the
chassis defines the allergy blending
really well and check this out even the
front USB ports and audio jacks have
been modified to match the color scheme
that Asus was going for really cool
stuff and it looks pretty tasteful I
know everyone thinks of designed
differently but I really like what Asus
is done here in terms of build quality
it's mostly plastic but that's
necessarily not a bad thing it's put
together really well and the reason I
say that is because the material that
they've used isn't cheap
the stealth black exterior isn't glossy
so don't be afraid of fingerprints plus
they've added these angular edges on the
sides to give it some character in
person it looks amazing in addition to
that sleek design asus is also included
a mouse and keyboard now these aren't
super high-end peripherals but they're
actually quite decent and they add some
extra value the keyboard for instance is
membrane so don't expect it to be as
pronounced as a mechanical keyboard it
does get the job done really well in
fact I did most of my benchmarking with
this keyboard and actually had no issues
with that although the problem with this
keyboard is that it doesn't feature
anti-ghosting or NQ rollover so if
you're in the middle of a gameplay
session and if you're sort of using a
Juanes keys and if you want to switch
weapons instantaneously you might have
some trouble with that the included
Mouse was actually a little too small
for my taste but it's pretty decent
although I wasn't able to use it for
that long because I have big hands so
it's something that you need to keep in
mind the IO is well laid out throughout
the system taking a peek at the back
there are two USB 3.1 gen2 ports for USB
3.1 gen2 given ethernet 7.1 audio and
spdif Jack's Kensington lock a single
USB 3.1 gen2 type-c port that supports
quick charge and two power jacks which
I'll talk about shortly I'd like to see
that type C moved to the front panel for
easier access but it is still good to
see it included display i/o is also
fairly straightforward I mean they
managed to pack a fully fledged gtx 280
inside so expect the standard layout
found on other Pascal GPUs like dual
link DVI dual HDMI 2.0 and dual display
for 1.4 ports the front features two USB
3.1 ports a headphone and microphone
jack and yes a scissors also managed to
fit a slim DVD drive
so no one is left out of the equation
the power button is placed at the top
it's nice and subtle plus it blends in
really well with the ROG design Asus is
really spent some serious hours
perfecting the design of the g20 without
compromising on port selection awesome
stuff guys coming back to those power
jacks at the back this is where things
start to get a little interesting since
the g20 is so small there wasn't space
inside for a dedicated power supply so
that means external power breaks yes
that's right not one but two each must
be connected to a separate input jack
and each of those support a different
input power standard in this case the
top takes a 180 watts and the bottom 230
watts to some people lighting on a
desktop PC is just as important as
having high-end hardware these days I
won't get into the sad state but at
least a CSS bulb base is covered RGB is
the new trend and people love to color
coordinate their Hardware to match their
setup but with that being said the
lighting here is fairly subtle but I
think it looks great there are three
zones that can be customised through the
software this includes the two lighting
strips behind the fun grille and a
single zone at the bottom of the chassis
there are three effects that can be
tweaked around through the ages 3
software which comes pre-installed in
this case I can have the front left zone
to display a pulse effect and the right
output a wave effect cycling up to 10
colors once again customization is
endless and you always have the option
to turn it off while we're on the topic
of ages 3 let's dive in a little closer
if I want to describe it in simpler
terms it's a much fancier way to monitor
system stats as you can see it
constantly monitors the CPU and GPU
clock speeds along with CPU temperatures
you can also view your RAM and hard
drive usage and there's a visual graph
to give you a clear representation for
the stats fan control can also be done
here within ages 3 there are two modes
performance and silent I highly
recommend silence because when used with
performance mode this thing sounds like
a jet fan under load this is a preamble
system from Asus
so definitely expect some bloatware
out-of-the-box programs like a trial
version of McAfee Antivirus asus is
dedicated suite for office and a few
others can be found so be aware of that
one of the reasons why people prefer
pre-built systems or building their own
pcs is simply because they might find
building a PC and loading it up with
Windows a little bit overwhelming of
course I can be the judge for the
majority of our audience here but think
about it this way if one of these
arrives at your doorstep
all you need to do is unbox set it up
just like setting up a gaming laptop or
a regular laptop plug in power
peripherals which by the way come
included in the package and off you go
download your favorite titles and bam
start gaming if something goes wrong
with the system you have reliable
customer service which is pretty awesome
because you are not left alone trying
trying to figure things out
and trust me it's always good to have
help with that being said the g20 has
its ups and downs and if I were to
describe my experience with it in simple
terms it was intriguing let's take a
look at some performance numbers just to
set up a stage for me to share my
thoughts and feel free to add yours in
the comments later on now remember there
are quite a few competitors in this
space and I'll be taking a look at a few
more in the near future but for now I
compared the g20 to the Corsair one
simply because they both feature
identical specs except for the processor
and as you can see this was expected
these 7700 scored almost a hundred
points below the 7700 K with stock
settings and the high result is due to
their respective bass and boost clocks I
also performed our standard Premiere Pro
render test exporting a one-minute 4k
h.264 video and the g20 took 16 seconds
longer to complete the task compared to
the one at stock settings now onto some
gaming battlefield one at 1440p set to
Ultra averaged just a little over 60
frames per second and dipped into the
high 40s
that's pretty decently given how small
this PC is overwatch at 1440 P set to
epic settings averaged around 120 frames
per second and did just a tad above 100
frames per second doom at 1440p set to
ultra using the Vulcan api averaged just
a little under 100 10 frames per second
and finally Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
violence which is a heavily demanding
title averaged about 62 frames per
second and minimums hitting the low 50
so there's no denying for the fact that
the choice for the CPU can affect gaming
frame rates especially if you have
access to overclocking now remember
depending on the load the difference
between a seventy seven hundred and
seventy seven hundred K can be between
three hundred megahertz and six hundred
megahertz that can make a pretty big
difference CPU and GPU temperatures were
also decent once again you have to
consider that there are no liquid
cooling elements on the g-20 like the
corsair one and this is partly why the
g-20 costs significantly less than the
one compromises have to be made right
the SanDisk X 400 m2 SSD inside the g20
is SATA based so don't expect crazy read
by performance compared to a higher end
and vme drive but it is sufficient
enough to launch applications quickly
the one terabyte hard drive also dished
out respectable numbers and from my
experience benchmarking I didn't have to
wait too long for game scenes to load up
since most of my games were installed on
this drive having that extra storage
space is great especially when some
games are pushing past the 60 gigabyte
mark these days all in all the g20 ci is
a very capable machine and I sure had
fun gaming on it except for this
now doing idle scenarios the g20 I
operates almost silently but under load
things change up quite a bit noise
became the only annoying factor here in
its performance mode it sounds like a
jet fan and the silent mode does quite
things down a little bit but not that
much this is where I give value to the
Corsair one since it's not only powerful
but also super quiet
I mean go back and listen to the sound
test when I'm comparing the two the
difference is night and day but then
again you pay for it since Corsair
system is a lot more expensive
personally I think that the g20 CI is an
excellent system for people who are just
looking for a good gaming PC that can be
set up in just a few minutes while DIY
systems may offer a slightly better
value for people who are comfortable
building their own asus has managed to
create a compact well priced and high
performance system the only problem here
is the fan noise but I'm hoping Asus can
fix that in the future and that's what
I'm going to end this review I want to
hear your thoughts about the ACS g20 CI
let us know in the comments down below
and if there any alternatives feel free
to let them let me know in the comments
down below as well once again I will be
doing a lot of system reviews in the
future like this so stay tuned for that
I'm Eva with horican axe thank you so
