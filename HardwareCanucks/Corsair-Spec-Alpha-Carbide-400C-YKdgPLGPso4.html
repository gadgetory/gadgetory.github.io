possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex and NCIX
without them we wouldn't be here
stopping over at the Corsair suite made
me realize that they are solidifying
their presence on the enclosure market
with unique releases that deserve
consideration first the spec alpha
clearly carries a similar design
language as their bulldog machine
without interesting front and top panels
that seem to angle the enclosure but in
fact the interior is perfectly flat it
is a polarizing design but I personally
really like it there's that memorable
feel to the exterior frame one that
somehow manages to get away from that
gaming look into that yeah that kind of
looks cool vibe priced at $79 for all
color versions you are looking at the
diverse catalog with red black white and
red black and yellow and we are told
many more color options will be
available the front case feed complement
the design very well without which the
case would have a totally different feel
the front I'll include 2 USB 3 ports
power and reset and a 3 speed fan
controller which is awesome so this is
clearly targeted for mid tier systems
and on the interior design it is very
similar to what we've seen from Corsair
in the past with some minor iterations
there is no 5 the quarter inch drive bay
instead it's an open concept for airflow
optimization the drive cage can host
four hard drives and two SSDs on the top
there and while there are two more SSD
brackets behind the panel respect alpha
will come with a couple 120 millimeter
LED fans and as you can see the interior
is capable of supporting a clean look
and high-end systems I noticed there are
no rubber grommets but based on the
width of the chassis
it looks like cable management should
not be a problem due to the lack of
height in this case radiator mounting is
more suited for the rear exhaust or the
front intake and for $79 you get a
unique looking enclosure that carries
over that similar internal design for
mid tier configurations also we got to
check out the new carbide 400 C and the
400 Q C stands for clear aka window and
Q for quiet and I really like this I
think this be a very popular case as it
incorporates many features that users
really
see and especially in this elegant and
clean frame obviously the design
language carries over from the bigger
brother the 600 C which is much larger
and taller and here there are next to
eight each other the 600 C is on the
right we still have very tall case feet
which I like and I think the sandblasted
metal surface at the top and front hides
fingerprints very well
handling marks are non visible which is
fantastic the layout is traditional ATX
with an acrylic window that opens like a
car door and is removable and on the
inside we find the closed off power
supply chamber that hosts your power
supply and your drives and the shroud
itself is in two parts which can be
removed independently so if you like the
drive cage to be exposed that is
possible or the power supply as well as
you can see the layout welcomes front
radiator installation thanks to the lack
of any dry ice in that spot as they are
all in the basement which makes cable
management super simple with rubber
grommets spread all around the
motherboard the 400 Q which is the
silent Edition has a removable top cover
if you want to utilize those fan spots
and sound dampening material applied on
all of the interior panels overall I'm
super excited to build inside the 400 C
and we have the case coming in so make
sure to subscribe to not miss our full
review and it seems that the assembly
process would be satisfactory and at $99
this would be an awesome mid tower
decision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
