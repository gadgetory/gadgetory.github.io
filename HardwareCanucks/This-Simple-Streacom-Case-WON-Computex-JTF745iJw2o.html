hi fans we're on the way to street cone
by the way and you got a nice low
entourage - what's up good people I'm
three tree and as always we come to you
from Street come they always has
something incredible so they do have a
new ITX enclosure the DA - so let's
check it out now but first a message
from our sponsors thanks to thermal take
cooler master and fantex for making this
trip possible alright guys you know how
much I love ITX enclosures and stre come
with their da - is here to impress this
is quite a popular sort of form factor
with this beautiful aluminum
construction
you know nobody comes even close those
three comes quality control and they're
like elegance and this is something that
I really appreciate plus with this new
ITX design and revamped internals
they're really trying to push this whole
space optimization with like extremely
modular elements to the next level so it
is a pretty compact ITX enclosure with
this beautiful bent aluminum shell if
you love simplicity you would definitely
appreciate the i/o which only has a
power button that has an LED and they
can also potentially put logos on the
button as well and a single type C
connection for the i/o they are thinking
of a tempered glass option with this
unique magnetic mount it's currently a
work in progress but potentially put one
on the sides light it up show show keys
the hardware and even though we have
this sort of closed look both the top
and bottom are completely perforated and
are covered with this dust filter and
you remove it by flexing the filter and
which is a cool approach because it
means the enclosure can remain super
elegant no there's no little brackets
and clips necessary it is a totally
toolless approach and I hope more
companies take the note now the default
side panels are completely perforated
with the dust filter built in underneath
and so the cool thing about these is how
they are actually mounted onto the
enclosure via press fit so you install
the top section first and then you mount
the bottom and the kind of like latches
onto the frame again a completely tools
procedure no additional clips required
lovely
now what streak on was doing on the
intern
is actually pretty clever they're
thinking in this like cubular
three-dimensional format and wanted a no
compromise system so you can mount on
ATX power supply or radiators up to 280
millimeters and GPU is up to 350
millimeters because of this new rail
system which has been simplified with
these captive square nuts on both sides
and these new Universal brackets the top
ones are slightly shorter but the sides
ones are slightly longer to accommodate
for your dimensions of the enclosure and
so these brackets can be installed along
the length of the case and the height of
the case and each bracket can support
you know one this is D or you combine
two of them to create like a little rack
of SSDs or hard drives or anything else
that you might mount in there it's
pretty clever and you know doesn't give
you any limitations in terms of where
you want to mount it aside from having
clearance for the other hardware so for
example if you mount an ATX power supply
you have about 220 millimeters for the
GPU clearance and up to a single 140 or
120 rad for the CPU cooling if you are
installing a CPU tower you have a
hundred and forty five millimeters of
clearance for that we do have a rear 90
millimeter fan mount for a little
additional either intake or exhaust and
we have also have this power supply
bracket for either SFX or ATX for
storage you can mount three three and a
half inch drives or eight two and a half
inch drives on a single drive bracket
which is pretty incredible and the
modularity element doesn't stop there
because you can actually invert or
rotate the motherboard tray because the
actual motherboard is mounted on those
universal brackets that have the
motherboard standoffs
so you could rotate the rear panel of
the frame to accommodate the motherboard
being on the opposite side and it being
inverted and so that is the da - I love
how they've simplified those Universal
brackets yet it still has that streak of
DNA because that's that's what they're
all about using brackets to mount any
hardware for flexibility we also will
have the db2 which is a completely
passive case utilizing the exact same
chassis but with giant basically
heatsink panels on both sides so you can
cool the CPU and the GPU on the db2
alright so that is the street comb da
- or as we call it in this sweet da -
but now let's go check out something
another piece of really innovative
engineering for your hardware the
concept case that they call the canvas
so we got to do a little bit of reveal
okay so right now you can see just a
piece of glass here we just have this
plain canvas with a little cable
sticking out but now if Mike if you come
around we can reveal what this case is
all about alright my friend so this is
the canvas case it's still in early
stages prototyping we definitely want to
hear your feedback but from what we've
just you know experienced here it is
absolutely incredible so they're totally
redesigning how you're assembling your
enclosure not enclosure your hardware
inside the case we're here everything is
you know one by one it's individual
pieces but the most unique thing here is
everything attached via magnets so this
giant black plate here is just a big
magnet we have these little magnets
attachments on all types of hardware so
you can literally position your hardware
components your motherboard the graphics
card your hard drives your power supply
your cooling your SSDs your cable
management strips anywhere on this you
know blank canvas thus the name I love
it everybody is on camera right now so a
few things to talk about are the actual
magnetic points there will be different
sizes there potentially thinking about
expanding or adding more so you can have
different height for the components when
they are actually installed onto the
canvas for example we have the SSD but
if you want to have it slightly higher
away from the motherboard
you can add more and position it and so
the modularity aspect of this canvas is
just absolutely insane it's
mind-boggling to think of how many cool
things you can do with it simply because
you have this you know in the entire
space to work with these pieces are also
going to be potentially expandable so if
you are placing a piece of glass here
you could expand it so you can have
reader that does not interfere with the
high clearance of these side pieces the
glass piece will obviously will cover
here
it's
the visual aesthetic you can mount this
on top of your monitor not on top your
monitor above your monitor so that you
can have this entire system showcased
this way you know because this magnetic
middle section is magnetic from both
sides you could potentially even spread
out your hardware on two sides let's say
having power supply on one side and
having all these cables kind of wrap
around the canvas which is such a cool
idea or you can have a different system
on that side altogether so the
modularity like I said is completely
just mind-boggling now theoretically
each of these magnet points can support
up to two kilograms of weight so in
terms of your hardware and things like
that it's not really an issue of
supporting like really you know heavy
power supplies or long radiators and
because we have this large section you
could do potentially cool water cooling
builds and they're also thinking about
doing smaller sizes something for a
simple ATX motherboard and even ITX
systems only where it's gonna be a lot
smaller for here for this size they can
fit eight ITX motherboard on one side
which is insane imagine having like you
know multiple power supplies on one side
and have this really cool multi system
plate filled with hardware that's
amazing so the only thing they have to
kind of figure out now is really perfect
the design in terms of how to do your
cable management because obviously you
can mount your hardware motherboards
anywhere else on here but how do you
route the cables so that is kind of like
the main concern right now and just
making sure that you can do as much with
these mounting points and little fan
brackets that attach the power supply
mount for example as much as possible so
that you have literally no compromise
when it comes to mounting anything on
the canvas and so the idea and
brainstorming can go on forever so let
us know what you think of this concept
and how would you perfect it so that
when you potentially buy this thing you
could get the perfect product and the
last two logistic elements are this
would be crowdfunded on IndieGoGo and
they're thinking about 160 to 200 dollar
price points and I think for something
that's totally unique you know it's very
inspirational when it comes to building
your own PC I think that's a fair price
point so we'll leave a link down
where you can check out what this whole
concept and the canvas is all about
all right good people so that is the
street come da to let us know what you
think about it and then you can les
concept the closure it is fantastic let
us know if you agree make sure to check
out this other relevant content and
we'll see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
