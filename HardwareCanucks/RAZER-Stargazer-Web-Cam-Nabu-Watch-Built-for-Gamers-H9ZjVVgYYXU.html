possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX without them we wouldn't be
here we stopped by the razer booth at
CES this year and they have some cool
accessories that could spice up your
current gaming setup let's start with
the newly announced star gazer the
world's most advanced webcam
you may be wondering what's so advanced
about it let me talk you through some
cool features the sensor can streams
720p at 60 frames per second and that's
the maximum quality this is because
razer told us that this resolution was
the popular setting for streaming among
gamers but the video feed is directed
via USB 3 pi know so there's that
limitation you can capture but not
stream 1080p video at 30 frames per
second razer partnered up with intel to
deliver some of their realsense
technology to bring next-generation
features to users today one of the cool
features is dynamic background removal
this essentially removes the need to set
up a green-screen and go through the
whole process of isolating yourself on
the background with the help of our
depth sensing technology we're able to
remove the background and still achieve
a professional grade stream with the
Stargazer another feature is called 3d
scanning this can highly be useful for
game developers who can import scanned
objects directly into unity or any other
API for further and the best part is
that gamers will be able to scan their
faces or any other objects right into
their favorite game huge props to intel
and razer for bringing this into reality
there are a lot of applications that can
take advantage of the facial and
district
inside the Stargazer like unlocking our
computer using windows hello launch
applications with just a wave of the
hand and even play gestured enable games
the Stargazer
is set to be priced around two hundred
dollars and shipping starts around q2
the next piece of gear razer announced
was their new Naboo watch from all the
smartwatches we've come across Razer is
approaching this device with a regular
watch that's smarter from first
impressions I thought that this watch
looked just like any other sporty
looking watch but what's new here is the
built-in notification display that syncs
via bluetooth on your phone
and every time you receive a
notification on your phone the Naboo
watch vibrates and displays the
notification this also acts as a fitness
tracking device so you can track the
steps walked the distance traveled and
the calories burned and the main button
lets you cycle through them the battery
life of the smart module lasts for about
seven days and it can be charged via the
three pins beneath the unit via the
magnetic charger the standard digital
chronograph is set to last for about
twelve months so stay tuned for our full
review on both these devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
