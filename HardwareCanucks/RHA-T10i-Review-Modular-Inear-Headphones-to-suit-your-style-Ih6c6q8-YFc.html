great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with
hurricane axe and one of the most
important factors I looking for
in ear headphones has always been
getting the right fit aside from the
sound quality of course and I mean the
point of time when I can finally say I
have found the ideal headphone that
covers comfort just as good as they
sound this is the RHA t10 I so rha is a
British audio company this is our first
experience with them and at $199 for
pair you must really love your audio but
everything from the initial impressions
about the t10 I really solidified our
confidence in the quality of this
product so really outstanding packaging
and presentation not over-the-top but
appreciate it for the price taking out
of the box everything is well laid out
this massive selection of ear tips both
in silicon and memory foam and I
initially thought that is completely
overkill and another reason to charge so
much but you realize the importance of
finding the best fit whether you prefer
smaller silicon tips or you like the
complete isolation from the memory foam
tips also for the first time I found the
perfect ear tips for me these dual cone
shaped ones that sit in my ears without
pressure they are stable enough to only
need occasional readjustment and make a
good seal for excellent bass response as
well now the earphones look fantastic
but the steel housing and laser edged
RHA on each side and blue and red cable
tip for left and right side respectively
but with also engraved lettering on the
side for just better clarification
however despite the great looking
earphone the most unique element of this
audio device are interchangeable filters
that's right you can swap these sound
filters to give you a different sound
signature the ship with reference
filters installed but for individuals
who like brighter sound signature with
emphasized treble you have that
and the same goes for the extra bass all
of which are color-coded and the swap is
as simple as unscrewing the filter and
putting in the new desired one and they
are able to achieve this sound signature
difference with a dense foam insert that
this is slightly larger on the base
filter and nothing inside the treble
filter and just a slightly smaller foam
thing inside the reference filter and so
you notice the trend with the t10 eye
it's all about user configuration with
all the ear tips and swamp oil filters
but really satisfying in the build
quality department is well with matching
steel inline remote with a microphone
and three multi-purpose buttons for
volume adjust play pause skip tracks
answer call or drop a call but if it
wasn't for such a muddy and depressed
middle click that unless you press dead
center it's actually really difficult to
recognize where it is on the remote just
by feeling it and I also think the
remote is a little bit too high just
below my chin that is not a comfortable
spot to reach for volume adjust but at
least it's close enough for the
microphone for not actually needing to
hold it during conversation coming down
to the splitter that's also steel with a
signature engraved Wow
and finally coming to the end of the
cable another stainless steel cylinder
with a 3.5 millimeter jack to tie the
entire design into a really beautiful in
there headphone and also this leather
like pouch is included to store the
headphones during travel with a short
clip that I never used so the t10 I
utilize an over the ear cable that
allows your ears to hold the weight of
the headphone and not your earlobes and
I appreciate the color combination of
the cable that blends in with the skin
pretty well they are low profile design
and the left and right cable can be
collected underneath the chin with this
sliding clip now most of my listening
was done using the reference filters as
I found the signature really pleasing
with detailed base hits that resonated
really well into the ear tips with
impressively deep response and in no way
sounding muddy or muffled the treble in
no way harsh either and the mid-range is
clear and I can constantly say that
these are probably
one of the best in your headphones that
I've listened to there very analytical
they're very crisp they perhaps lacks
some warmth like what is found on the
se215 s from sure but the outstanding
bass hits the slightly move back
mid-range so that the soundstage is not
so pro not super open but this kind of
semi open the good thing is not super
closed off and also the treble is left
out to really pick out the details out
of the song the bass filter I found a
bit too bassy for my preference but it
certainly delivered extra punch and if
you're looking for that there is your
option although with a slight leak into
the mid-range so you get a booming sound
signature something I'm not a fan of and
then I switch through the treble filter
and that is the one that will stay on my
pair so it flattens out the bass still
delivers really deep hits but without
any sort of Bhumi attached to it that
opens up the soundstage even more and
you hear just slightly extra crisp
presentation and so here's the bottom
line the customization options on the
t10 eye is what allows users to
fine-tune not just the comfort with
availability of all these ear tips but
change up the sound signature as well
it's a really unique feature to
complement the beautifully crafted
design that also sounds fantastic and I
initially thought that all the extra
parts like the extra silicon tips and
the foam tips were kind of wasted
especially if you're not using the sound
filters you're swapping them all the
time but I understand the necessity to
get you to a point of content finding
the right fit for the ear tips and
finding this at the right sound filter
for the typical sound signature that you
prefer and the only drawback that I can
mention would be the inline remote
buttons that are very difficult to press
they require too much effort to change
song or to play pause or to change the
volume for example as otherwise you are
looking at a damn good audio product
and before I skedaddle out of here I'd
like to mention that if you've had
issues with India headphones previously
not fitting or not having the right fit
for you perhaps look out for the dual
cone design that has solved all my
previous fitting issues and this is by
far the most comfortable in your
headphone that I've owned and so this
