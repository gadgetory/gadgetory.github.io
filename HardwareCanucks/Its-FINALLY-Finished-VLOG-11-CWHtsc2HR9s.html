because for the past well ever since I
settled into the office I've been
working off this type of setup my single
monitor but the reason why I haven't set
up a second monitor that I have this is
exact same Asia panel is because when I
moved the actual monitor base that you
see that requires for the stand to go on
top didn't come with me and I thought I
was it was lost in transition but it has
finally appeared as I found it in my
backpack and therefore i can use the
second base to attach second monitor and
please forgive me but until now it's
kind of been sitting very gently on the
floor there it is let's set it up
a
I'm going to find spot work
I don't know guys what do you think good
enough actually do some more cable
management I'm just kidding don't worry
all this is gonna get cleaned up plus I
have to spend almost eight hours a day
in this fix you know I gotta want to be
here those cables like that I don't want
to be here I really don't like doing
this guy's to give you tips on cable
management please let me know it is all
plugged in I was a little worried about
the second monitor not color matching to
the first monitor but luckily because I
had these monitors in past I have
calibrated them and it seems to save
that profile just as fine so opening up
a white page and the white looks exactly
the same and here is the full machine
this is the sky like system that I built
you can watch it in description below
two monitors I will try to keep this as
minimalistic as possible just one pair
of headphones have to figure out where
to put the Silverstone headphones and
which by the way guys if you do not own
a headphone stands i would highly
recommend you get this one it's so
fantastic and you can put two pairs of
headphones on here if you have more than
one and also if you're wondering why the
other side panel is not on yet to review
all the little components here and all
the cables like my dualies has these in
the raid it is because i will be
receiving orange sleeved extensions for
the power supply because the mustard and
ketchup cables on this be quiet power
supply I'm not exactly pretty on the
inside so definitely make sure to stay
tuned for the the final final final sky
like build update video for the to see
exactly what it will look like in the
very end alright this is the best is
gonna be for now I mean this looks
really good depend on what I started
with some people ask me with how I stay
motivated I'm making YouTube videos
pretty much well on a weekly basis but I
do some type of work for YouTube on a
daily basis button see where is it there
we go this this is my motivation right
here
so when we will come time to dump that
stuff I will be super pumped I'm super
pumped to actually build my AMD system I
haven't built an AMD system and so long
so that it's going to be an exciting
build I'm very exciting video playing
for this one because it's a little bit
of a fee going on Plus check this out
gaming off scheming was giving us giving
us giving Mouse gaming mice not only am
i creating a top-five giving my video
but also just a couple more mice coming
in to test for maybe inclusion in the
top five in mice video but right now
it's been quite a lot of fun with cs go
and i have this little puppy and
difficult to see what it is let me go on
with an angle but you can see it is all
black and I'm pretty sure you can guess
what case that is this is the age for 40
matte black it actually looks fantastic
there's plenty of changes that have been
implemented here so stay tuned for that
video but now it's actually time to get
to work film this guy finish filming the
insides and showing you the finished
product part 2 and there will be third
part coming out for that Skylit system
for the upgrade because we have a couple
more cool things lined up for that
system so make sure to stay or stay
around I'm at the metreon or economics
behind the scenes videos every Friday
make sure to subscribe and I hope you
enjoyed make sure to go double screen on
that like button and we'll see you in an
excellent
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
