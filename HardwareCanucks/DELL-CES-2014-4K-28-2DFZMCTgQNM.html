connected alright guys so now we're
gonna check out some 4k panels from Dell
I'm here with Matt from Dell and he's
gonna first tell us about well this the
one on the left is their first ever
porque panel so that was released last
year this is a 30 to 32 inch ultra HD so
4k resolution it's more designed for
professional users so it's got a really
great color accuracy a nice IPS panel
great viewing angles and it is designed
for the professional user because it is
thirty five hundred dollars but now
they're moving away well not go away but
they're really moving towards the more
consumer level 4k and that's exactly
what we want to see here at CES 2014 so
this is the dell 28 inch ultra HD
monitor so this is again this is 4k so
mad what is so special about this
monitor first I know everybody wants to
hear is the price point so how much are
we going to see this monitor and when
this has really been the darling of the
show because this is our first ultra HD
monitor to get into a sub thousand
dollar price point we're excited to
announce here at CES that we're going to
bring it to market it as 699 so for 699
you've got full HD resolution it's a
twisted nematic panel so we're using a
more commoditized type of glass to get
down to that price point but as you are
looking at it it's a very good iteration
of twisted nematic it actually has a
pretty wide viewing angle actually has a
billion color so it does have a very
good gamut to it and it keeps a lot of
our trademark organ ah mcphee chures and
the height adjustability the tilt swivel
so for someone who's looking for a large
desktop whether it's for their hobbies
and photo editing or stuff like that or
they're just looking to get some
productivity done right this is really
going to
perfect panel for that absolutely so 699
evan is released two weeks it will
actually release it in the u.s. January
23rd okay wow so 699 price point for 4k
display is totally a sweet spot for that
consumer level product especially if
you're looking for productivity
obviously the the tan panel is not
perhaps at the same standard as the
other professional IPS panels for that
creative director who needs that calor
accuracy but I'm really excited to see
that 4k is now finally available sub
$1,000 sub nine hundred dollars so at
699 700 bucks for that that massive
resolution that massive real estate for
your productivity purposes is excellent
