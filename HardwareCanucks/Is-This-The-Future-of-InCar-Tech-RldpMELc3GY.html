lives regardless of whether it's a
simple smartphone or a more complicated
personal computer we use it every day
from making grocery lists to interacting
with relatives and now vehicles have
become the next frontier for integration
of human and machine technology Ford was
kind enough to invite us to the annual
Canadian International Auto Show hosted
here in Toronto they wanted us to check
out how technology continues to evolve
within the automotive sector and how
those forward-thinking features are
being incorporated into a wide range of
vehicles I was more than happy to take
them up on that offer
why because while high-level interactive
car systems used to be accessible only
for those who had tons of money Ford is
at the forefront of making those systems
available at almost every price point
one of the key ways for is accomplishing
their goals of making in-car tech as
intuitive nose friendly and complete as
possible is with an evolution of their
sync ecosystem sync 3 is their latest in
vehicle communications and entertainment
system it incorporates a ton of cool
features a brand new touch or voice
controlled interface and faster response
times one interesting feature of same
three is the ability to automatically
pair with your Android or iOS based
smartphone via bluetooth
it will then grant access to all your
contacts call history text messages
music collection and much more with the
assistance of sing Three's advanced a
voice-activated technology which by the
way can be accessed by a push of a
button you can easily make phone calls
with just a few commands navigate to a
destination access Sirius XM satellite
radio and even adjust climate control
provided the vehicle comes equipped with
that feature Ford may have used sync as
a launching platform for many functions
but they're not locking you into their
own platform like some other
manufacturers do sync 3 natively
supports apple carplay and android auto
both which are fantastic additions in
fact when you plug in either an Android
or iPhone to the unit via USB sync we
automatically recognize as the device
and switches to the desired UI meanwhile
the voice assistant button on the
steering wheel shifts to either activate
Google now or Siri that means you can
actively and safely interact with your
smartphone while keeping your eyes on
the road and hands on the wheel
functions like reading and
two text messages and interacting with
things like Google Maps are very
intuitive provided you understand some
very basic voice commands sync Connect
is also an interesting feature that
allows the driver to remotely monitor
the vehicle provided it comes equipped
with this tech all you need to do is
download the four pass app available for
both Android and iOS users and register
your vehicle using their assigned VIN
number it takes a few days to complete
the identification process but
essentially you'll be able to track your
vehicle's location and remotely lock
unlock and start up the engine for
security purposes it doesn't act as a
virtual key but the functions are still
very convenient you can also view the
vehicle status including fuel level and
the approximate odometer reading plus
scheduled specific times to remotely
start your car so it's ready to hit the
road do not that any vehicle can be
registered with for pass but only sync
connect equipped vehicles get the full
suite of options discussed earlier
because sync 3 and sync Connect are
independent the good thing about sync 3
is then it is available across Ford's
entire vehicle lineup it's not
exclusively designed for a specific car
which is awesome past sync 3 &amp;amp; 4 pass
several other elements factor into
Ford's push towards a seamless
integration of in-car tech into their
lineup features like blind spot
monitoring in-car Wi-Fi quick charge USB
ports and even cross traffic alerts are
being rolled into vehicles at every
point and none of that may be
attention-grabbing as syncs evolution
but they play a key role in either
making your life easier or even saving
your life I mentioned a bit earlier that
one of Ford's main goals is to make all
of this cool in-car technology more
accessible to a wider market one
excellent example of this is their
upcoming 2018 EcoSport which is set to
launch later this year while this
compact SUV originally debuted at the LA
Auto Show back in 2016 it has returned
for a showcase here in Toronto the
EcoSport is designed to attract young
drivers who have a good grasp of
technology and are looking towards their
first new vehicle purchase the exterior
sports a sleek athletic profile which is
engineered for the best possible
aerodynamics the rear seats can be
easily flattened out to provide an
expanded versatile cargo space - the LED
lighting accents at the front along with
the projected halogen headlamps look
awesome under the hood you have an
option to go with two power trains the
first one is a turbocharged 1 litre
EcoBoost 3 cylinder engine with
front-wheel drive and the other being a
2 liter naturally aspirated variant with
ford's intelligent four-wheel-drive
system pricing is yet to be unveiled to
customers as this is a pre-production
model and it could go through some minor
design changes so expect updates in the
near future one of the most interesting
aspects of the EcoSport is the
technology fund the star of attraction
here is the 8 inch touchscreen
navigation system with all the features
from sync 3 I've talked about there's
also two USB fast charging ports a
single 110 volt outlet that'll keep your
gadgets topped off cross traffic alerts
for past compatibility and in some
markets in-car Wi-Fi taking a step above
and beyond the EcoSport
Ford was also showing a ton of hybrid
plug-in hybrid and full electric
vehicles that have been designed for
drivers who love to think from a broad
economical perspective there are a
variety of options to choose from but
understanding the key differences
between the three types of powertrain
within the evie lineup is important
first let's start with a full electric
car meet the 2016 Focus Electric it's a
compact hatchback that runs on a 107
kilowatt electric motor and has a range
of about 75 miles or 120 kilometers the
2017 model gets an extra 40 kilometres
of range plus it features DC fast
charging capabilities so essentially you
can charge up the battery up to 80% in
about 30 minutes which is awesome
the 2017 c-max hybrid is an excellent
example of a hybrid
since it combines a lithium-ion battery
and a gasoline-powered engine these work
together to provide a smoother carefree
and yet efficient driving experience the
regenerative braking technology recovers
energy that is normally lost through
braking and it stores that back into the
battery for later use the last and final
type of EB powertrain is a plug-in
hybrid car the 2017 c-max Energi that
you're seeing here takes advantage of
this technology the difference between
standard hybrid and the plug-in hybrid
is that you get a larger lithium-ion
battery that can be charged using an
available 240 volt home charging station
or a 120 volt outlet which in turn
provides you with extended range and you
can choose to drive either in full
electric mode or gasoline-only
or a combination of
both one benefit of this is that with an
all-electric range of 19 miles or 30
kilometers it's not really likely your
shorter commutes won't use any gas at
all but the gas engine could be well
used for taking the stress out of longer
journeys Ford doesn't want to end its
hybrid DNA within compact hatchbacks or
cars yet they're working on a fusion
between performance and hybrid
technology by 2020 you can expect to see
a hybrid Mustang hybrid f-150 and an
all-new electrified SUV with a range of
at least 300 miles also expect
autonomous vehicles to hit the road by
2021 they would be designed for
commercial Ryne hailing or ride-sharing
starting in North America as more and
more people migrate towards crowded city
centers the so called
last mile transport options are becoming
increasingly important for such short
commuters cars SUVs and even public
transport options aren't efficient
that's where something like the Ford
carry comes into play it has been
designed as a fully integrated compact
solution that allows people to move
short distances within a minimum amount
of time for the time being it's a proof
of concept but it gives a glimpse into
the future for people who don't feel
like car fits into their urban lifestyle
so our experience here at Ford at the
Canadian International Auto Show has
been an interesting experience I love
the mix between the Internet of Things
and how we interact with tech inside
cars I especially love the feature of
having the integration of Android auto
and apple carplay features plus the
ability to do multiple of things with
Ford's own ecosystem sync 3 I'm really
looking forward to trying on some of
those features in the near future but
let us know what you guys think about
our coverage here with Ford's new tech
and are you interested in any of these
new features that Ford has integrated
into their new cars and in fact most of
the tech that you see here are shared
across pretty much most of their
vehicles so it's not particularly meant
or exclusive towards one particular car
which is pretty cool but let us know
what you think about the tech that you
saw I'm Eva with Huracan axe thank you
so much for watching huge shout out to
forward for inviting us to the show and
we'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
