is brought to you by and cix technology
connected alright so this is the case
that's we've one of the cases that we've
been sort of waiting for and so this is
the anthro pro it does incorporate a lot
of the internal features the same as the
antic primal but obviously this is a
smaller version it doesn't incorporate
that dual power supply amount and so
let's just go ahead and run with the
exterior so here as you can see this is
a removable front panel this is not the
removable dust filter by itself you have
to remove the entire panel you have 35
according to drive base and right now
because since this is a prototype is a
type of locking liftoff cover to access
all your internals so nothing is in
there right now but with the power
button at the top same thing with the
top panel this is a there's a built-in
dust filter in there with a removable
entire top panel that you have to first
remove the front and then the top on the
side here this is sort of their staple
sort of triangular window that reveals
the phanteks logo on the internals right
now we're told that this type of window
potentially could not be there they
might go with a fully closed side panel
but i still i do i do appreciate the
fact that we can still reveal a little
bit of the internals so let's take this
off and check out what's what they have
inside so one of the first things that
we notice is well this is a ATX case but
it is a lot smaller than the end of
primal and that's exactly what people
have been asking for but it looks very
much like it's taking the same type of
frame for your optical drives and your
hard drive cages that is all behind and
that's one of the things that I do like
I like this whole exclusive access of
your hard drives from behind so you
don't have to open both side panels you
can just if you're swapping drivers or
anything just removing that back panel
is very useful it will include a 200
millimeter fan which is right here let's
so let's take off the front panel comes
off just like so so it's a 200
millimeter fan that is included you will
still have options for dual 140s and
dual one
20 million of fans so that's all
obviously excellent to see along with a
rear 140mm fan so again so this is
pretty much all it is on the internals a
lot of the rubber grommets and one of
the features that you see here this is
the power supply bracket as you can see
it covers the entire power supply and
all the cables that will be popping out
here plus a lot more rubber grommets but
this power supplied bracket is not
included with the case but it is
optional for consumers and it is
attached with a simple thumb screw the
back so it is simply removable so let's
take it let's turn this around and check
out what we have on the rear one of the
things that I really like to see that I
really liked to see here is this cable
management that has been kept from the
original phanteks and to primal so this
is this velcro strap system for cables
as you can see they already pretty much
done the initial cable job there and
this is one of the things that really
does make phanteks send out and we
haven't seen anything like this it's
very effective because you can enlarge
the the velcro based on how many cables
you have running there so it's an
excellent thing rubber grommets and
cable tie notches spread out like it
should be right if you're doing any type
of cable management awesome to see an
SSD bracket for such a sort of a
mid-range priced case and lots of room
at the bottom where the majority of your
cables will be concentrated where the
power supply is coming out here so it is
a little bit thicker a little more deep
in there and the rest of cables can be
sort of spread around the back so it's
awesome to see this little features in
such a sort of mid tower mid-range
priced case and also the hard drive
cages are removable just like they were
on the fence phanteks and to primal and
like I said earlier there is exclusive
access from the back so this is the N
throw pro at eighty-nine dollars this is
really sort of going to be I think a
very popular case for those mid tower
mid-range gamers and those builders that
want that functionality for the
enthusiast at sort of less very low cost
but now let's take out a check out the
anthro locks which is it
takes the same internal features as what
we see in the pro but it steps it up a
notch so let's go ahead and take a look
at the end to lux</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
