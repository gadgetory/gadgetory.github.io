great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
higher conducts and with the release of
the definer for almost two years ago
fractal design set the benchmark of how
a silent PC case should be built we
suggest to check out our view of the r4
just to get an idea of how far things
have come with regards to the new design
so meet the define our 5 fractal design
is once again reaching out to set a new
benchmark and redefine how we view
silent oriented enclosures the r5 is
released at $119 it will be available in
titanium and white and yes windowed
versions are also not forgotten for
those who want to admire their hardware
the exterior is a standard closed off
case it looks practically identical to
the r4 with steel side panels a little
boring but I appreciate the modest
approach you know everything you need
and nothing in excess and everything on
purpose well almost everything the
optional fan mount unfortunately is not
dust filtered so don't use it but each
panel is covered in noise dampening
material and they're really heavy
because of it
the left panel removes both the thumb
screws and the latch mechanism for
easier reinstallation while the thumb
screws on the right panel stay attached
so they the only way to lose them really
if you were to lose the panel then the
front panel has a matte finish with a
really fine brushed plastic that only
peeks through under specific lighting
conditions the panel opens a little over
90 degrees with sound dampening material
applied and the ability to swap the
panel to open from the other side I love
that companies are now starting to
integrate this feature there are two
optical bays along with a 3 speed 3 fan
controller that's accessible yet sort of
hidden below is a practical dust filter
that's easily removable also this is the
only spot on the exterior where we see
any sort of fractal branding so they're
really not afraid to stand behind what
they build without splashing logos and
branding all over the place now back to
the dust filter notice the vents are
angled down in order to channel any
noise that might escape plus help with
airflow and
take and while it seems a little bit
closed off there's plenty of spacing
between the panel and the front fans for
adequate air pressure to occur and this
type of front panel design is almost a
staple for the defined series and it has
never failed there's only a single 140
member fan included and for the price I
would have liked to see two but notice
how open the hard drive design is to
light a maximum amount of air without
too much resistance of internal framing
also with the panel open you get access
to that massive dust filter at the
bottom that spans the entire floor of
the r5 but guess what it's removable
from the front finally you no longer
have to wiggle your computer away from
the wall to remove the bottom filter
huge thumbs up for fractal for finally
implementing this and we hope this will
become the norm while we are at the
bottom the r5 stands on quality case
feet to help your power supply and any
other fan installation breathe the i/o
ports are at the top I love this
location with chrome plated audio jacks
power and reset button with the power
illuminated in dark blue with an
activity light in the center and four
USB ports two of which are USB 3 but
with black internal housing instead of
the standard blue thinking of that
stealth approach I like it now the top
is interesting here as the three plate
cover allows the use of only those spots
that are needed exposing less of the
internals and thus minimizing the noise
these monuments are removable with clips
from the inside now I wish they were
just magnetic for easier removal but
they all covered in extra foam
internally the r5 is plenty equipped at
the top to handle any type of fan or
radiator system you might throw in with
up to or 420 millimeter radiator support
at the top but you can see how you can
you know close off one section if not
used for maximum flexibility to the user
and also minimizing on the noise now
this wouldn't be fractal design case
without the white accents on the fan
blades of the 140 mm fan in the back
that users can reposition thanks to the
mounting strips instead of holes the
seven PCI slots right below and the
white metal drive caddies that brings a
strange sense of cohesion and this is
definitely a fractal design
and looking at the internal structure
fractal has kept an almost identical
layout as with the r4 but with excellent
refinements all around that make the r5
superior in every way
first the vast array of configurable
options of both drive cages that are
secured with thumb screws let's stay
with the cage really nice to see and
also notice the redesigned less
restrictive framing that exposes more of
the hard drive for more effective
cooling you can remove the top cage for
installation of a 140 or 120 mm air
radiator + GPU is up to 31 centimeters
will fit until we hit the drive cage and
of course longer compatibility with it
removed with the cage rotated internally
good luck handling all the wiring plus
the limited spacing because of the drive
caddies - about 27 centimeters with both
cages removed 240 and 280 millimeter
radiators will fit and the front now
this also opens up spacing at the bottom
for practically the same configuration
but this is where the r5 really allows
users to play around with the internal
layout for SuperDuper flexibility for
example relocating one of the drive
cages away from the front panel to allow
a front radiator support without totally
getting rid of storage drives but keep
in mind power supply clearance of 16
centimeters for this to work and any
potential height clearance with an ATX
board and the PCI card length
limitations for the bottom three slots
but then the optical cage is also
removable allowing installation of
either one or both drive cages so it can
still have all the storage potential as
of the default configuration and the
bottom radiator mount for example and
there's plenty of clearance between the
bottom of the cage and the floor
furthermore you can remove the mounting
plate on the roof to have clearance for
360 or 420 member radiator so that the
final 5 is fully equipped to handle any
water cooling now let's take a quick
look behind we first find dual SSD
brackets removal with thumb screws that
stay on with the caddy awesome to see
this element once again there's over an
inch of space to deal with any cable
mess with a wide sleeve to tuck away any
cables with cable type points directly
on the floor as well
for those needing total control plus we
are starting to see velcro straps
catching up after we first saw them on
the end to primo that are so convenient
to use with good strength to hold
smaller cables and everything else and
finally let's start with the assembly
the extra-long middle motherboard
standoff is starting to appear on many
cases to help with that initial descent
and the accessory pouch is nicely
labeled with all the bits and screws the
hard drive caddies are super sturdy of
course being fully metal with flexible
orientation all your drives depending on
how you want to position the cage either
facing the back or inside the case with
these rubber grommets to prevent any
vibrations and the caddies our SSD
compatible showtime ok enough teasing
let's take a look at the finished build
normally I would mount radiator at the
top but this time I didn't want to use
the top panel for exhaust as that would
open up the internals and I really
wanted to focus on silencing that build
so I mounted our x61 cooler at the front
this is a two eighty moment radiator
this means I needed to relocate the
smaller cage for my mechanical storage
closer to the power supply I am using
the micro ATX board to avoid any
difficult cabling work that might arise
with the cage in there and so I mounted
the fractal fan on the radiator as well
for push-pull to deliver extra airflow
for the GPU and the build looks really
clean internally and I'm very happy with
how much space we have left over at the
front for thicker radiators in push-pull
as wall coming around to the back it's
so good to work with in the case that
has cable management almost to
perfection that large gap where all the
cables exits from the power supply gets
utilized immediately and there are so
many cable tie points all over the place
so you can spread all your cable work
around without any heavy concentration
at one place there's even one between
the SSD brackets and in the top left
corner where I nested that large 24 pin
cable and look at just a flat I was able
to arrange all of my cables this is what
some patients of course but the r5 is
ready to handle it and that's important
now the only thing that I would ask to
change is to enlarge the 8 pin CPU cut
out and move it closer to the corner
that would make it easier for wiring
with any radiators installed at the top
and one last thing before we do our
silence test is I noticed the r5 was
flexing a little bit at each corner
this isn't part because I removed the
drive cage assembly but not to worry
once the solid side panels are in place
the r5 returns to that robust feeling
with zero flex finally listen for
yourself exactly of how quiet the
machine actually is and now let's turn
it on
partially we have to thank the side
panels that do an outstanding job in
blocking a lot of the noise but I have
to praise fractal for designing such an
outstanding front panel listen to just
how much noise it blocks when closed
and in conclusion I must admit the r5
may be the new king within the offerings
of quiet computer cases and it does it
while offering so much to the table with
outstanding internal modularity for your
drive gauge mounts to accommodate for
intense water cooling options removable
optical cage for clearance of 360 and
420 millimeter radiators the top module
ants allow user flexibility for airflow
without opening the other slots and
simply perfect cable management design
with bottom dust filter accessible from
the front I love that feature the only
few drawbacks is if you decide to
install anything at the top slot or on
the side panel dust filters are not
included plus it no longer will be as
silent but the define r5 without a doubt
brings a serious list of upgrades over
the previous r4 and we're giving it the
Harbor Canucks damn good award for the
enjoyable building experience and for
the new level of silence I have on the
desk now and that concludes this review
would love to hear what you think of the
new define r5 and make sure you
subscribe to the channel to see a
comparison video between the h4 40 and
this when it finally rolls out as always
thank you for watching like this video
