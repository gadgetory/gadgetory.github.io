hurricane accent on the review table
today we've got another digital to
analog converter or DAC that will
convert the digital audio signal into a
waveform something your headphones can
understand so this is the d3 DAC from
audio engine that has been sort of
specifically designed for portable needs
and that is reflected in its incredibly
small form factor and also the price for
just under two hundred dollars you are
buying into the size so if that's
something of a priority to you when you
travel or just want that minimalistic
setup d3 has you covered and it is as
big as a USB Drive which is deceiving as
it packs quite a punch for audio and by
the way we have viewed their d1 DAC also
from audio engine that is more of a on a
desk solution so make sure to check that
out if you're interested the d3 comes
very well packaged and for almost two
hundred dollars I was expecting nothing
less we have a little wool pouch that is
included that would house the DAC plus
we have a quarter of an inch extension
as the unit has a three and a half
millimeter jack output overall I'm very
pleased and impressed with the build
quality of this unit with full aluminium
body clean design with audio engine logo
and two LEDs in the front one indicating
power so as long as you're using USB 1.1
or above you'll be fine
audio engine has also placed the power
supply into a separate circuit to avoid
interference and help with the thermals
there's a second blue LED that will
indicate a sort of HD audio signal so
anything above 48 kilohertz that you
select through speaker properties in the
windows and it's also automatically
selected if you're using a Mac it is a
24 bit DAC with a maximum of 192
kilohertz sample rate that will be down
sampled to 96 kilohertz for output
there's no volume adjustments on the
actual DAC all of that is controlled
through the operating system instead and
so plugging in the d3 DAC into my
notebook and really the aluminium body
does complement the appearance of the
setup and this would really work well
for mac books however every single
notebook that I plug this in
III wasn't totally stable and wobbled
quite a bit and this is part due to the
USB port design and the DAC itself
however it is very slim allowing nearby
USB ports to be populated so audio
engine certainly created this DAC with
portability in mind without compromising
on either the DAC module no the amp the
d/a-converter is the ak4 396 DAC that's
known for its natural and detailed sound
and the opamp is the LME for nine seven
two six hundreds capable of driving high
impedance headphones without Distortion
and from my initial impressions with the
d3 plugged into my notebook using a few
pairs of headphones the DAC is certainly
going to be an upgrade in terms of
volume the headphone amp did an
excellent job driving enough power to
all the three pairs I was testing with
the HT 8 the K 712 pros and the HT 5 5
eighths the d3 produced a very well
balanced and linear response and overall
battery dynamics over the headphone jack
on my notebook
well the difference wasn't substantial
but I could pick out more mid-range
detail out of the d3 and the low-end
response seemed to flatten out this was
particularly evident an angel from mezzo
9 as the bass kicked in with the high
hats and continuous bass response didn't
dominate allowing the rest of the song
to sort of come to life there's a good
amount of sparkle on the high end but
not the fatiguing kind even at higher
volumes and I actually do generally
prefer brighter sound but the d3 was
able to produce enough brilliance to
satisfy my preference without needing to
tweak the EQ the d3 also expanded the
soundstage not by much but the
background music instruments in
September from Earth Wind and Fire were
naturally more distant and not as
congested coming from the headphone jack
on my notebook but you really have to
know the song to notice this very minor
expansion I also try this with a MacBook
Pro that delivered a more pronounced
difference than on my Asus notebook
sound coming from the MacBook Pro was
sort of bass heavy and lacking detail
compared to the d3 so a DAC is only
useful if the source is incapable of
meeting your expectations and
conclude the d3 is designed to amplify
the signal without distortion and
coloration to preserve that audio
fidelity so if you really after that
natural and flat and linear response
with great detail separation the d3 may
be a great addition to your audio setup
the incredibly compact form factor I
would say sort of the main selling point
here plus we have the little pouch and a
quarter inch adapter so that's
appreciated however it is difficult to
recommend such investment unless you own
good quality headphones that could
benefit from a DAC especially at almost
$200 so this isn't for your casual
consumer the USB connection does wobble
so I would have preferred a more sturdy
contact and so the d3 within the right
set up would be an appropriate upgrade
that is if you know what your headphones
or speakers sound like and can
appreciate the subtle differences in the
detail the DAC can bring out well that
concludes our review of the d3 DAC from
audio engine let us know how I feel
about this type of upgrade and
especially the price point would this be
