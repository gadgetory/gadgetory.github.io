caved but after using the 1 plus 6 for
the past six months I really wanted a
small device and really see how iOS has
evolved since my iPhone 7 days and I'm
going to be straight it's been a mixed
bag of 10s me because my own
expectations were higher than reality so
in this video I want to share all my ups
and downs with the most expensive
smartphone I have ever bought it truly
is I have asked a few others to join on
this conversation to share their daily
experience with a 10 or the 10s should
be fun optimize your desk space with the
Sora's new Graham spectrum TTL keyboard
with a compact steel frame and
low-profile keycaps removable cable and
sweet illumination plus your choice of
the Sora's agile blue or red switches to
satisfy those fingers see if the Graham
spectrum tkl keyboards for you links
below so I'm going to lay all my cards
on table right away so I love the size
for everyday carry one hand reach
ability is excellent there's enough room
for twosome typing there is still enough
display for entertainment and
comfortable sized font and many would
agree
I love the form factor the form factor
the iPhone 10 just feels perfect
there's a ton of screen and a very small
amount of body there so it just feels
like it's made for your hand I totally
agree with David the all screen body is
gorgeous with uniform bezels ignoring
the notch of course compared to many
physical inconsistencies of curves or
notches or bezels on many Android
smartphones although with the case it is
still quite chunky especially compared
to my similarly sized iPhone 7 the 10s
max the larger variance would be just
too big for me but let's hear what
Jordan has to say hey guys it's Travers
consumer here and I've been using the
iPhone 10s max since it was released and
I got to say the thing that I liked most
about it is the fact that it has this
nice large display that was actually a
con for me in the beginning getting used
to it was really hard and while having
that nice big beautiful display is
absolutely a benefit there can also be
some drawbacks with that since some
developers haven't updated their apps to
work with a new big screen and with that
you do get some of your content cut off
with a not some developers have been
treating a sense it first got released
but there are still some out there who
have it and
it's kind of annoying and speaking of
annoying it is just way too easy to
scratch the display and the back as well
many users are complaining about micro
scratches that appear just gentle use so
you're almost forced them to using a
phone case and a screen protector to
preserve its condition and therefore
value if you're planning on selling this
thing down the line and that's probably
a smart choice for a little extra grip
when you hold it and if you like some
music in the shower so the phone won't
slip from an uneven surface although you
could bring this into a shower because
of the ip68 water resistance but why
would you now the speaker quality is
excellent but the cellular and Wi-Fi
issues are still present with Apple
using Intel chips instead of Qualcomm so
my Wi-Fi range on the 1 plus 6 is
actually better and many are reporting
LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity slowdowns
where the 10 the previous version of the
iPhone is faster with LTE and Wi-Fi
versus the 10s and that's kind of a
bummer
this being Apple's flagship Matthew
Mona's here and thank you so much
Hardware Canucks for having me on I
really don't have too many iOS related
issues but my main issue with the iPhone
10s is definitely connectivity problems
I'll be chatting up with Eber we talking
about Dyson vacuums and a look at my
bars and I'll have like one to two bars
compared to 4 or 500 device so that's
one specific bug that still needs to be
fixed on top of that I had to do a
factory reset just the first week of
using this device because I would still
get full bars on my data connectivity
and Wi-Fi but no connection was going
through it all and to reset the antennas
by going into airplane mode I was
getting constant stuttering with just
like simple animations I would get bugs
all over the place where the phone would
just freeze the microphone on the
earbuds would not be working so nobody
could hear me also a little bit of
charge game what's happening as well
where the phone would not actually start
charging when it was plugged in it was
annoying as expected most of these have
been slowly patched out for the latest
iOS updates but I generally questioned
my decision to get a 10 s because of all
these unpleasant shortcomings but as an
upgrade cycle for me it made sense since
I'm coming from the iPhone 7
but for newer iPhone users it doesn't
really make much sense hey so I guess
the reason why I didn't upgrade to the
iPhone 10 s this year coming from the
10 is mostly price like it's just a very
expensive phone the iPhones are always
expensive but I felt like the phone
didn't give a notice we different
experience from the original iPhone 10
like everything is basically the same
except for the camera there's a few
things that have changed obviously but
the actual usability of the phone
remains exactly the same between the two
from my personal usage case now I will
say though that if camera is like super
important to you for me it isn't but if
it is tennis kind of makes sense if
you're coming from 10 like you just you
know I mean but for most people
iPhone 10 what's up guys I'm random
Frank P and I'm still using my iPhone 10
nothing that I saw really from the X R
or the XS really made it worthy for me
of an upgrade and this still works just
fine it's fast it's smooth no complaints
on my end and if I'm going to want to
drop a thousand dollars on a new phone
upgrade I'm gonna want to be blown away
but what I did do however though to kind
of combat that was I picked up the new
11 inch iPad pro this is more of my
style anyway I'm not really a big mobile
user as it is so yeah I'm so content
with my iPhone 10 now there are plenty
of things that I love that are not
followed by a negative so the vibration
motor in here is better than anything
else I've used you'll feel it in your
pants I guarantee it face ID since day
one and it's been reliable but with some
speed variation sometimes it's
instantaneous and other times you can
see the face ID page you can disable the
require attention feature so it can
unlock without you needing to look at
your phone directly and incoming
notifications will play at lower volume
if you are looking at your phone which
is cool and it's great for app purchases
and password managers it just makes life
much easier without needing to remember
things you know just look at the phone
and be good the screen is amazing and I
love true tone so it calibrates the
temperature of this screen based on
ambient lighting for a more pleasant
viewing experience it's true that the
notch is huge during media playback but
two-to-one aspect ratio videos are
becoming more popular to maximize that
viewing area without spilling over the
knotch gesture navigation is pleasant
and natural to use I don't miss the
on-screen buttons and all of my
interactions just feel fluid I love the
camera for the
natural color reproduction with amazing
highlight recovery and slightly boosted
shadows because of the new HDR
processing and have really enjoyed the
2x zoom for some cool compositions that
I find myself using constantly and the
portrait mode to the most part has this
clean cut out of the subject would
naturally simulated bokeh although
sometimes it's a miss and you have to
dial back the f-stop to save the shot I
actually prefer the selfie portrait mode
too that delivers a more pleasing image
now the last bit of my experience with
the 10 s has to revolve around us and
it's weird how we've all assumed this to
be like a more stable ecosystem because
for the first two weeks it sure was not
the case we've all heard that apps are
better optimized for iPhones and Google
even makes their apps first on iOS but
YouTube studio app that an app that I
use on a daily basis to respond to
comments was lagging so much and it was
like that for a really long time until
the latest iOS update it is developer
specific I know but still quite annoying
it has been patched out on latest
updates and this is the only instance of
the app kind of lagging behind or is
everything else Instagram Twitter and
all the apps that are used on a daily
basis a running fluid now lack of
customization aside you know iOS is
locked down like that so we can't really
complain but I haven't found any new 3d
touch functionality so it's mainly
pointless except for a flashlight
intensity disabling true tone for
example and keyboard navigation widget
selection is still incredibly limiting
for example I'd love a steps counter
instead of who's viewed my profile you
still cannot reassign the two shortcuts
on the lock screen the flashlight is
handy I'll give them that but the camera
is pointless since you can already swipe
to the right to access the camera at
least the notification system has been
fixed with grouping of items and easy
navigation from the notification screen
so my productivity with a-10s
is slowly approaching that of Android
phones and while the 10s charges like a
snail unless you give Apple more money
I've been very happy with battery life
reaching almost six hours of on-screen
time on a heavy day wireless charging is
of course present and so should your
desire for a wireless pair of headphones
it's just something we have to accept or
buy the missing dongle and so my entire
tennis experience has been improving you
know it was a rocky start in the
beginning but it has gotten better with
updates contrast that to my Android
experience where it's kind of the
opposite everything sent a smooth
sailing and over time the experience
deteriorates and I feel like it's all
about finding an absolute winner between
iPhone or any Android smartphone but
looking at which side you can settle on
that they'll satisfy more
of your own expectations and right now
the iPhone 10s is my perfect size phone
with my perfect camera with iOS
limitations that I'll just have to
accept all right guys so that is my
review of the iPhone 10s let me know if
you've recently switch sides and what's
your experience been like I'm a Dmitri
thanks so much for watching make sure to
check out this other relevant content I
will see you in the next video
oh yeah I was gonna say well I mess at
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
