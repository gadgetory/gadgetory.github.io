for like 4 years straight and it's weird
because with each single video edit you
kind of discover something new you learn
something along the way so today let's
talk about some of the techniques that
you can do for your edits to make them
stand out to make them unique and to
just really encourage yourself to do
something different on every single
video but before we get into that this
has to go you know this is too much hair
let's get a haircut
oh yeah new hair new edit let's go wow
it is snowing outside it's so beautiful
I'm bit chilly told ya this is better
alright guys so we had a lot of things
to talk about that I hope you find
useful but first a message from our
sponsor check out the outstanding k7 xx
open style headphones by mass drop and a
key G with beautiful design lightweight
and perfectly comfortable with
incredible sound signature and a
well-rounded price to join the drop link
below alright let's begin the number one
thing to do is to clean your space
before you head it this is something
that obviously is kind of a given and
you can check out our video on top 5
tips on how to clean your space for
cheap some tips in there that hopefully
will carry over but a clean space means
a clean edit and if you're working in
the messy environment then you edit
might come out messy as well for number
2 a very important point the feedback
was to review your footage before you
start to edit this way you kind of get
pumped about like seeing really cool
visuals and get your creative juices
flowing so for me that means dropping
the footage into the timeline and just
review things that I've captured for
particularly video that I'm working on
but more importantly working with really
good visuals generally contributes to a
really good edit - as I said in the
intro I've been editing for so long that
if you want to see my techniques on how
to become a more efficient editor in
actual software let me know using
proxies trimming storyboarding in out
points shortcuts all that
if you want to see that let me know in
the comments below now one of the
easiest things I realize to eliminate
that daunting feeling of like editing a
15 minute video is to edit things in
chunks so for me I used to perhaps maybe
edit a little body time-lapse sequence
but most recently I try to go in and
just finish my introduction so that the
introduction is very important to draw
the viewer in so I choose my music I
sort of pieced together this little cool
sequence and it really gets me pumped up
for the rest of the video but more
importantly once my introduction is
ready I can really kind of focus on
finishing up the rest of the video and
this way if you're editing in chunks
that means you actually have more time
to spend to refine it so if you have the
intro ready some body portions ready too
and then when you piece together
everything you have a bit more time to
process on how things work especially
because you have those other chunks
completed and all fine to go instead if
you are sitting down for an eight-hour
edit and you do the whole thing from 0
to 100 you're gonna make mistakes you
get tired of looking at that timeline of
course unless unless it's finished but
you need that time to separate yourself
from your final edit so that you can
review it back a little bit later and
fix those little mistakes that you
perhaps then see when completing that
whole thing in 8 hours or so
next is experiment with transitions so
in the introduction video you saw
already two of them with me covering up
the hand and it's a really good
transition in terms of moving from one
place to another and having you know a
slight changes in the scene that there's
not noticeable but for example with my
haircut transition you saw that the hair
changed and I had to adjust a little bit
of the exposure and color differences
between the two scenes but that made
that a lot more smoother when I had my
hand in front the lens and completely
black out scene because that way when I
removed the hands any of those changes
are really noticeable to the viewer and
the second transition of course is the
clap a bit chilly tone yeah this is
better we're having some audio cues in
the scene that introduce a little new a
stuttering element into the shot that
way you can ink
something else into it so for example me
putting on the sweater and that whole
ties in with the the winter scene that I
included the shot prior so that you feel
like yeah there's no there's winter but
why is this guy in the t-shirt so I
decide to include that and though it
ties to the story and it gives you a
really nice sort of transition effect
you can also do motion transitions using
camera movements so for example in this
scene with the forest and the tree on
the right side because I'm moving into
it I created the same scene where I'm
moving into my studio and so having this
smooth transition from forest into
studio is less you know jarring then if
you were to just cut in the middle and
having those two points of edge
blackouts it's really important because
I can simply piece them together and
have this nice and smooth transition
from one scene to the next or you can do
really fast pans up and down or left and
right and because of that natural motion
blur it creates that really perfect
transition point into which you can
blend the next shot and it just looks
seamless and really good next thing is
don't be afraid to play around with
aspect ratios everything is delivered in
sixteen by nine which is a beautiful
aspect ratio but for certain segments of
your video or if you are having a
different color grade or if you have
like slow motion in there why not go
ultra white or even four by three to
give that video just a different genre
of what you're trying to deliver now
important thing to remember the aspect
ratios is to not overdo it and simply go
and ultra white does not make it
cinematic but use it your advantage to
guide the viewer into certain portions
of your footage because obviously you're
cropping things and because you you know
most likely you're shooting in sixteen
by nine it allows you to do cool motion
stuff so you can do pans within that
crop and then really guide the viewer
into certain segments of that frame to
you know basically tell your story
better so next one is important because
it took me a while to realize but learn
to let go I normally shoot a lot of
b-roll and delete everything that I
don't think is worthy for the Edit in
camera so that anything that I import
into my premiere
I'm line is is like good to go footage
but sometimes things don't fit sometimes
the footage that you know some
particular shot is awesome but I've used
something similar to it in the Edit
somewhere else and therefore it just
really doesn't fit within certain
sequence within the Edit in itself so
just be fine with that and learn to let
go of not using some of the footage and
the last very important one revolves
around feedback so feedback is critical
to any video editor even though you may
think you're perfectionist it's really
good to get and you know to feedback
gurus that will not just say your work
is fantastic but will actually give you
constructive feedback on perhaps the
music choice in the intros certain
transitions certain elements of that
sequence that may not be in place or
feel kind of out of you know out of
order and stuff and that's important
because once you get out of that Nirvana
of like completing your edit and you
feel so proud of it and it's so awesome
you you know that excitement really
clouds your mistakes
and having that external feedback is
crucial and you have to realize that so
I think that covers up my thoughts on
how to become a more efficient and
productive and creative editor from the
creative side of things to the
production side of things as well so let
me know if you want to see the whole
techniques video regarding the software
in the comments because I really want to
share my thinking about like what I do
that makes my process so efficient and
fast and enjoyable but I hope you
enjoyed the tips that were included in
this video and share your own with the
the community I'm sure we have a lot of
people who would love to hear that
so I'm Dimitri thanks so much for
watching we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
