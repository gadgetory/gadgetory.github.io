special as killer gaming performance
along with a bunch of free games and
goodies for good measure click the video
to learn more it's been almost two
months since the launch of the alleged
flagship killer the oneplus 2 and you
know first impressions don't tell the
full story so after my extensive use
with this device here's five things
you're gonna love and hate about the
oneplus 2 hate may be a strong board but
not inaccurate so first let's start with
a positive the build quality I love the
metal frame outstanding clicky buttons
with combination of sandstone remove
plastic bag which helps to grip the
large phone but it's almost self-healing
in a way that hides all the scratches
and normal wear marks perfectly well and
if you like to customize the back that
is an option for a more premium look and
overtime little scratches here and there
occur on the metal frame but for this
price bracket I'm very satisfied with
the quality structure oneplus has
delivered the second positive is the
screen being in 1080p 5.5 inch panel it
isn't the sharpest thing around but with
excellent natural white balance with
nice brightness range and satisfactory
viewing angles that made the upgrade
from the z3 totally worth it for me plus
by default a screen protector is pre
applied that has taken a beating in my
pocket but better it than the actual
display underneath the third aspect of
the one posture you're going to love is
the price for the specs and capacity
going for 389 for the 64 gigabyte model
and 329 for the 16 gigabytes obviously
it makes more sense to spend a little
bit more to
quadruple your capacity and that's how
it should be giving users an ample of
storage to load up all your media since
there is no microsd card expansion
however on a positive note for
international users the dual SIM slot is
such a welcome feature I use it all the
time for my Canadian provider and
another one when I visit Europe and
hardware-wise the oneplus 2 is the
capable smartphone with great
specifications you know snap the
operation and it complements it's priced
very well plus let's don't forget about
the actual characteristics of a phone
call quality is fantastic with the loud
ear speaker the number four thing to
love about this device is battery life
the 3300 million power battery is
non-removable
but if you are a heavy user with social
media email and photos - one plus two
lasts easily a full day for me
with about 30% left in the tank for the
next day battery consumption on standby
is also very efficient but my main
complaint here is the lack of quick
charging so you'll need at least 2 hours
until full recharge to 100% and coming
in at number five you're going to love
all the built-in features for the
oneplus 2 that they're very surprising
for this price category but are super
awesome starting with the physical
notification slider on the side that is
also slightly textured and it's very
simple to just snap it in any of the
three positions that you wish was
integrated as a standard thing on all
Android smartphones moving on there's a
fingerprint sensor that is not always
reliable but as you realize the pressure
to put on it it's very handy and it's
also super quick for some reason there
has been a lot of discontent about the
USB type-c port but it is reversible so
it's super convenient to plug in without
even thinking twice so kudos to oneplus
for being such an early adopter and
everyone who complains about the lack of
cables it's $5 just get it moving on you
will love the customization options I'll
buy it somewhat limited inside the
oxygen OS like choosing between light
and dark mode and ability to choose your
accent color for too
and menus gesture customization like
double tapping to wake which is super
awesome I use it all the time draw a V
on the screen to turn on the flashlight
or a circle for the camera and a whole
lot of functions built into the bottom
row like double tapping the home button
to open the camera and that has to be my
favorite feature about the oneplus 2
either using the capacitive buttons that
feature very elegant backlight and with
this blue line or if you find handling
more comfortable with the on-screen
buttons that can be enabled in the
options as well and since all this is
built into oxygen UI on top of clean
Android lollipop you get an ear stock
Android layout 0 bloatware and that's a
major positive and so now let's shift
gears a little bit and discuss what's
not to love about the oneplus 2 first
the invite system despite of how it
makes you feel being part of this
exclusive club to own one of these
hard-to-get devices it simply is the
bottleneck between the producer or sorry
the consumer and oneplus and there are
currently 6 million people on the wait
list and Counting and therefore it's not
an easy device to acquire and that's why
I will be giving out invite codes in the
comment section below
and on our Twitter page so make sure to
follow us there at Hardware Canucks
to make accessibility of the oneplus 2 a
bit easier for you guys the second
really upsetting factor revolves around
the latest camera update now initially
when I received the device in September
I drooled over the camera quality with
very quick focusing the ability to
adjust exposure similar to the iPhone
the optical image stabilization in
low-light was phenomenal the exposure
was spot-on
all the time we're just natural looking
photos until a few updates ago that all
changed and all the pictures you see now
have been taken before the update was
applied now so this reason experiencing
now is shutter sound and when the actual
image is captured is off sync for me
sometimes causing me to think the
picture was taken because I heard the
shutter sound but then there was some
delay and the picture is actually
captured during motion when I was
putting the phone away the phase detect
is meteor
in low-light and always jumps back and
forth and never locks focus causing a
slight change in focus as you hit the
shutter button and what you're left with
is a blurry photo and the shadows now
have a green cast to them even if the
picture is taken at low ISO and it
always over exposes my pictures for some
reason which wasn't the case a few weeks
ago before the update so this is what
I'm seeing with my natural eye and this
is what the phone is capturing a bit too
overexposed now moving away from the
camera at number three a really
disappointing week vibration motor that
might as well not be here because if you
cannot feel it in your pants pocket it
should not be included and I disabled it
completely to not eat any of the battery
life
at number four there's no echo
cancellation when the speakerphone is
used so for example if you are on a
video chat with somebody and if you're
not wearing headphones the person on the
other line will be able to hear their
own projection which makes using the
speakerphone unbearable and at number
five the immaturity of oxygen OS is only
after two months I'm beginning to
experience lag with the keyboard taking
awhile to show there's a full two to
three second delay when I click on a
contact to make a call
I find that built in shell feature is
pretty useless that displays your most
used apps and contacts but that's what
my front page is for anyway and
sometimes text messages appear in the
new thread even if the contact is
already added and messaging history
already exists and hangouts notification
never get through and the phone
sometimes does not notify me of an
incoming call through whatsapp so I've
done a few factor resets already and
they have not fixed any of the issues I
just mentioned which seems to surround
oxygen OS and hopefully oneplus we'll
eventually get these fixed so guys this
is all we have to say about the five
things to love and hate about the
oneplus Stubbe it's still an excellent
phone in my opinion but we cannot ignore
the drawbacks as I said earlier we'll be
giving out invite codes in the comment
section below and on our twitter page so
