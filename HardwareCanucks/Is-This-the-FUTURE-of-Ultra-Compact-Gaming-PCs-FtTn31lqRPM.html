annex and this is intel's hades canyon
nook for those of you who don't know
what a nook is it stands for next unit
of computing and if you're familiar with
the skull canyon knock that was launched
a few years back until really defined
the future of modern desktop computing
with those units i mean i've taken a
look at countless people gaming systems
in the past here on the channel and i've
never seen anything as compact or
innovative as the skull can enact or
even this hades canyon nook and it's
just it's just mind-blowing considering
the amount of power
intel has been able to cram inside a
chassis that can comfortably fit your
palms intel is offering these units as
bare-bones kits so you have to populate
in your own choice for a memory and
storage and the sample that I have over
here costs $1000 which is an expensive
investment but if you're looking to save
a few hundred dollars you can actually
pick up the lower tier version of the
hades can a nook the only thing is that
it comes with a slightly less SPECT Vega
GPU with 24 compute units on it slightly
lower clock speed so that's something I
have to keep in mind so let's take an
in-depth look at Hades Canyon and put it
through spaces compared to some other
bare-bones pcs from the past and also
come up with a unique solution that I
could use or unique so you say the
Hughes case scenario that it could use
this for here in the office or perhaps
in my living room I don't know we'll
come up with something somewhere in this
video and of course we will I've come to
a conclusion as to whether or not it's
worth a thousand dollars but also you
know find out who this is really
targeted towards right after this the
new master keys MK 750 keyboard comes
with a comfortable magnetic wrist rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection coolermaster
doing it right check it out below
alright so taking a look at the physical
appearance of this unit I've gotta say
I'm really impressed
intel has taken these stealth and
minimalist approach here with the
exterior design there are no fancy or
aggressive
Kamri elements to other chassis you will
notice this cool honeycomb texture that
gradually fades into a smooth matte
black finish and I'm really diggin it so
far
and yes it's 2018 year where we expect
every flagship gaming device to come
with some sort of RGB lighting and intel
hasn't skipped that the signature logo
does light up in the subtle manner and
the colors can be customized through
software but what's really interesting
is that if you decide to turn off the
LED logo there actually no traces or
signs of that logo underneath the front
panel which is amazing moving on to the
i/o I have to be honest here this nook
has way too many ports been compared to
a standard ATX motherboard or even any
pre-built high-end gaming systems that
I've taken a look at in the past
seriously at the front you've got a high
speed uhs-1 full size SD card reader 2
USB 3.1 gen2 type-c ports HDMI 2.0 type
C Gen 2 port and a headphone /my combo
jack switching over to the rear see that
there's still more we've got another 3.5
out of Jack power in - Thunderbolt 3
ports - many display ports a couple of
Ethernet ports for USB 3.0 ports and
another HDMI 2.0 port ok I'm gonna take
it right now realistically speaking I
don't see myself taking advantage of all
these ports at the same time but if
you're someone who's looking for a
compact system with a load of i/o look
no further than the Hades Canyon because
hey they've got a full size SD card
reader that's just impressive to me
taking a look at the specs this is where
things get a little bit interesting so
Intel partnered up with AMD this time to
create a processor that features an
Intel CPU combined with Vega graphics in
this case we're looking at the core i7
8800 9g quad core eight threaded CPU
that comes with a base caco3 point 1
gigahertz with a boost up to 4.2 along
with 8 megabytes of cache the discrete
graphics is the Radeon rx Vega mgh that
comes with a base frequency of 10 63
megahertz and a boost up to 11 9024
compute units graphics memory bandwidth
of 200 4.8 gigabytes per second and 4
gigabytes of HBM to memory
this certainly looks a lot superior than
intel's integrated solution speaking of
which is still present with the i7 cpu
remember this cable AG architecture
features an intel cpu with integrated
HD graphics with the addition of Vega
and graphics all jammed into a single
processing unit really can't wait to
share my gaming experience with you guys
but before we get into the performance
results I want to briefly go over
accessing the internals of this unit
it's actually pretty simple and
straightforward all you have to do is
use the included allen key to unscrew
the six top panel screws once that's
done you can gently lift the panel upon
which you'll find the LED lighting
module carefully unplug the proprietary
connector from the little PCB there's
one screw holding that plate in place
once you take that out you'll be greeted
with two nvme m2 slots which are
populated in my sample and two sodium's
slots that can support up to 64
gigabytes of RAM now the lack of
including a two and a half inch hard
drive bracket could be a deal-breaker
for some of you out there but I'm gonna
give into a pass for that because
they've done so much to cram all that
power inside this compact chassis and of
course you have to m dot two slots to
work with what's really generous of
Intel is actually included thermal pads
on the top panels so you don't have to
invest on that and that would obviously
dissipate some of the heat that's coming
out at those two drives now just like
every other bare-bones PC it is
important to factor in the rest of the
cost that you would need to investigate
a fully functioning system so in this
case if you're deciding to pick up the
$1,000 Hades Canyon in valence PC you
would have to spend somewhere between
$1,300 to $1,400 to get a fully
functioning system with the inclusion of
a Windows 10 operating system and the
breakdown for those is basically you
know $8,250 on storage and of course the
rest is memory and given the current
state of memory pricing it's it's not
feasible to invest on a 32 gigabyte kid
or even a 16 gigabyte kid I mean if you
can find those kits for a relatively
cheaper price
by all means it's a better option but it
is unfortunate that we're at a state of
market right now what component prices
are definitely a lot more expensive than
they used to be so if you see yourself
spending I mean if you think you know
$1,400 is a max that you'd like to spend
on something like this I don't know let
me know in the comments down below would
you actually spend that much to get a
fully functioning system and now to the
million dollar question is actually
worth spending that much on the Hades
canon or are you much better off
building yourself
PC well let's take a look at the
performance results but before that I
have a little bit of a surprise here
because I did decide to do something
unique in terms of you know finding a
better use case scenario here in the
studio so let's check that out okay so I
decided to do something different for
the eighties Canyon testing so
essentially I want to build myself and
all-in-one system featuring the Hades
Canyon because if you think about it
the size of this guy is pretty compact
it comes with a with base amounts so you
can basically just attach it to a
monitor I provided that it comes with
the base mounting support system so
that's what we're looking at right now
this is the pick CEO a px 277 gaming
monitor it's a 144 Hertz 1440p display
for the price I think it's it's a really
good solid panel the bezels are super
thin or your problem is that the stand
is absolutely terrible and it doesn't
come with it the adjustment is not that
great because you can you can't adjust
the height nor tilt or do any sort of
thing it just it's just it's just what
it is so this is what I'll be working
with let's mount that haiti's Canyon to
this guy and see what we come up with ok
so I did run into a little bit of an
issue here so the included screws that
Intel provides for the base amount in
bracket is a little too long for this
monitor because the thread mounts or the
thread the thread holds for that that
are inside the panel are pretty short in
length so it doesn't actually go in the
screws don't go in completely so you do
get a little bit of this wiggle with the
with the base amount so that's something
to keep in mind but I think you know
from a positive standpoint this could
actually give us some more airspace for
the for the system to breathe properly
so it could come in as an advantage or a
disadvantage I don't know but that's
something to keep in mind
all right so we finally have our DIY
all-in-one desktop PC and as you can see
it's a work in progress I think I'm
pretty sure that our room for
improvements here but let's kick things
off with the haiti's Canon by itself so
I did attach four just fine I didn't run
into any clearance issues or not but
just be keep in mind that you know given
that we have that incompatibility with
the vase the mounting bracket to the
monitor there is a little bit of wiggle
in there but I did manage to put just
managed to just put a little bit of
cables in between so that it's just it
stays intact
of course as you can see I've done a
pretty I mean I've done a pretty good
job with with cable management here
basically taped some of them on the
monitor obviously it does look a little
disgusting but whatever but yeah I think
it looks pretty good of course we have
all these cables coming out so
definitely I think from an aesthetics
perspective it's probably not gonna look
as great but let's actually plug this in
and and see if it actually works
so we put it into Windows without a
problem one thing to keep in mind is
that this particular monitor has two
HDMI ports where one of them can only
support freesync up to 144 Hertz whereas
the other port can going only go as far
as 75 Hertz and so you have to make sure
that you've plugged HDMI port or the
cable to the right port to take
advantage of 144 hurts at 1440p of
course with free sync enabled which I've
already done so let's test out this guy
alright so how did the haiti's Canon
perform with my DIY all-in-one setup
pretty darn impressive guys I ran a few
benchmarks just to ensure stability and
kicking things off with Cinebench r15 we
got a score of 866 and to put this in
perspective I did compare these results
to the azrog decimate GTX featuring an
i5 7600 K and a GTX 1060 along with a
gaming laptop from your comp featuring
an i7 7700 HQ CPU with a gtx 1070 max-q
and as you can see hades canyon takes
the lead here in terms of Rho CP
performance ee primer the multi-core
test once again proves how fast the new
a generation cpus are so from a
multitasking standpoint the i7 88 a 9g
wouldn't break a sweat now I did run
some real-world tests like rendering
this one-minute 4k video using Adobe
Media encoder
and interestingly enough the Hades
Canyon took some more time to complete
that task compared to the ass rock and
the yurikano book which kind of makes
sense in a way because CUDA acceleration
with NVIDIA GPUs placed some roll faster
rendering that being said I did manage
to test both hardware and software
encoding with Indy encoding settings and
I didn't notice a significant difference
between the two because on both
optimizations are in both settings I did
notice the CPU usage and the integrated
Intel graphics utilized to its fullest
but I think this also has to do with
lack of optimization because this is a
new SOC so perhaps we could expect a
newer update with infamy apparel to
support these new Intel CPUs with Vega
graphics alright so moving on to the
best part gaming performance here's a
look at 3d mark time spy as well as fire
strike and as you can see the RX Vega
and GPU is not that far behind when you
compared to the GTX 960 and the gtx 1070
max q I did one all of my gaming tests
at 1080p
since pushing this GPU to 1440p really
wouldn't make any sense starting with
battlefield 1 at 1080p said too high
Hades Canyon averaged around 72 frames
per second which is completely playable
and it's again not too far behind the
other two systems featuring faster
graphics cards overwatch a 1080p set to
epic give us around 70 frames per second
doom again a 1080p set to ultra using
the Vulkan API dished out around 89
frames per second and finally Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon violence which is a
demanding title did push the Vega GPU to
its limits averaging around 47 frames
per second at the very high preset the
integrated cooling solution did a pretty
good job keeping the i7 88 or 9g under
control even under my 15 minute I 264
stress test I saw CP temps hitting as
far as 87 degrees Celsius and I didn't
notice any major throttling which is
great because during idle CPU
frequencies did run and it's rated for
to 4.2 gigahertz which is actually above
its specs because the base clock is 2.1
gigahertz and boost all the way up to
4.2 power consumption was also very
impressive during idle scenarios like
browsing the web or watching YouTube
video the system drew roughly 50 watts
whereas with gaming so for example under
full load
on the DeBakey GPU as well as a cpu the
system drew roughly a hundred and thirty
watts the GPU ran around 65 degrees
Celsius while gaming and maximum core
clock that I was able to achieve was
around eleven ninety megahertz which is
just right on par with the specs and
this is just impressive considering the
form factor and the system was also
relatively quiet during my testing
here's how it sounds
so to conclude I'm really impressed with
Intel's hades cannon nut this thing is
an absolute monster when it comes to
1080p gaming you wouldn't have a problem
hanging frame rates above 70 frames per
second depending on titles at Ultra
settings and what's even impressive is
its thermal solution it's relatively
quiet it stays relatively quiet so you
don't have to put in headphones or
whatnot to isolate the noise again it's
just it's just considering its
considering the compact nature I'm just
genuinely impressed not to mention the
amount of ports intel has been able to
cram inside the chassis is once again
mind-blowing I don't think I've ever
seen a prebuilt system with this many
ports and also my experience appearing
this up with a facing monitor was
amazing I didn't experience any screen
tearing it was just overall a smoother
gaming experience and what's even
impressive is that the monitor itself by
itself is not that expensive it is $3.99
on sale right now and when you pair that
up with something with Hades Canon
featuring an AMD PS GPU that can support
for you sync I think you're looking at a
pretty cool awesome compact gaming setup
another thing to keep note of is if you
decide to mount this behind a monitor
just make sure that that monitor comes
with a separate veissy mounting system
and of course a separate stand because
if your monitor is held up buying a base
amount if the stand itself is attached
to the base amount then attaching this
at the bottom wouldn't make any sense or
I don't think it's probably possible so
that's one of the town sights with this
fix your monitor the stand the included
stand was pretty terrible there were
limited adjustments with that I'm
probably gonna end up picking up the
monitor stand and just so I can easily
access the ports at the bottom the last
thing to discuss here is the price isn't
really targeted towards gamers out there
in a way yes it depends on who you
really are if you're someone who's
valuing a lot of performance for the
money you're much better off building a
gaming system I mean depending on the
component prices and if they're
relatively reasonable then you're much
better off building in system and then
getting slightly extra better
performance compared to Hades Canyon but
if you were someone who's looking for a
compact system that can comfortably
pushed any to be gaming I don't think
there's anything in the market right now
that can do anything better or perform
any better than Hades Canyon because I'm
genuinely like I said from the beginning
till the end
I'm just really impressed with what
Intel has done here so that concludes
this video let me know what you guys
think about Intel's hades can you knock
are you impressed by its performance
especially the thermal results and of
course just a way how it looks let me
know what you guys think about it in the
