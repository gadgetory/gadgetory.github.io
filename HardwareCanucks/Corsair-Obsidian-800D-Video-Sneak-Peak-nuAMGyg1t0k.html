different today take a look at the
Corsair obsidian 800 d case now this
isn't the official review that's gonna
be coming out in about a week but we
wanted to do sort of a preview sneak
peek for you so without further ado
let's uh yeah let's take a look alright
so the first thing you're going to
notice with this case is you probably
saw with the with the box there is this
thing is big we have a motherboard box
here and you're looking at at least
double the size high and then double the
size wide it is not small it's made out
of mostly steel the front has an
aluminum front bezel which will you'll
see in a sec the side is the side and
interior is steel so it's big it's heavy
but it looks pretty cool
starting off at the top we have our
front panel ports with four USB firewire
audio and microphone jacks as well as a
reset switch off to the side there's the
start button with LEDs and then moving
down there's one two three four five
external front ports and right sort of
in the middle at the bottom there and
yet one of the standout features of the
case which is a hot swappable drive tray
there's actually four of them at the
front maybe what you do is you're going
to be able to pull out the drive tray
now it is does require screws it isn't a
screw list design so you're stuck having
them screw your drives in you're gonna
pop it in now you'll be able to slide it
back in and it's SATA hot swappable so
you have the instant access to the hard
drives moving the case over to the side
we have a rather large side windows not
just square it's got a little bit of a
curve to it so a bit of a design I also
see that it is raised up with its feet
so there is room for airflow underneath
rotating around to the back here what we
have it's base for air intake you had a
couple of buttons here which we'll show
you in a sec water cooling holes 120mm
fan i/o area seven PCI slots and space
for the bottom mounted power supply
there is also an air intake on the side
here for air to get in the back the back
is completely clear and then we're
around in the front now just focusing it
on the back one of the coolest things
about this case is how easy it is to
open what you do is you push this button
down and you're gonna pull out and then
pull off now the first thing that you
really notice about this case when you
open it up is how everything is black
the
even gone so far as to make the fan the
fan cables and headers a black as well
so they want to keep a uniform look to
it as we zoom into the motherboard tray
you'll notice a rather large space in
the tray that is because this trade
accepts ATX ma T X and E ATX
motherboards and that is the CPU
backplate opening for all of those form
factors what you'll also notice is that
there are rubberized holes in the tray
for all those sizes in order to run
cables from the from the back of the
case out to the front and on to the
motherboard at the front of the case we
have a toolless external drive bay and
then moving down we have a hundred and
forty millimeter fan on the side of the
hard drive area this is in the back here
is where the hot swappable module is
going to go and then down below even
below that in the bottom chamber there
is room for another three hard drive to
sit as well as a hundred another 120
millimeter fan I believe and then right
down at the bottom is where the power
supply is going to sit there's
definitely enough room for extended
power supplies like say the Corsair 1000
watt series the other thing you'll
notice is that there's water cooling
hole tubes right here in the in the
divider that means that you're able to
you're gonna be able to put a pump right
down at the bottom here run it up to the
other components up top we're gonna take
a quick look at the accessories which as
you can see I've already opened I don't
want any surprises so what we have here
is basically the usual assortment of
screws and zap straps 120 mil fan
vibration dampener for a bottom fan
there's also some drive rails and this
is going to be a disappointment before
to do a lot of people we have mentioned
earlier about the hot swappable
capabilities of the of the Corsair
with that front mounted rack style
system and here's your hot swappable
module basically what it is is a
quadruple is a quadruple power connector
which you're gonna have to connect and
four SATA cables so it's not actually a
physical module that you're going to be
able to slide in and then slide out
you're still gonna have to go inside the
case install this onto your drives and
then install SATA cables onto the drives
as well bill thing that corsair has done
is that they've set this up for water
cooling what you have at the top here is
one two
three hundred and twenty mill fans
spacing for 120 mill rad you can either
you can install the fans on the top the
other thing you can do is because there
is enough space between the tray and the
and the top there you can actually
install a triple radiator inside of the
case if you wanted to and have the air
blowing out I install the fans on the
top right here on the top however
whichever way you want to do it right
and so that there is our quick look at
the Corsair obsidian 800 D it should be
hitting shelves relatively shortly don't
forget the official hardware connects
review is going to be coming out on that
in a couple of weeks so check the
YouTube channel and be sure to check the
website for updates we'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
