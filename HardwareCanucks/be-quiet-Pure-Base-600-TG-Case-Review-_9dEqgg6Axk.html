tempered glass yep the tempered glass
mid tower category just grew by one with
the release of the $99 pure of a 600 TG
Edition let's building it see how
prepared be quiet is for the case Wars
of 2017 right after this everyday treat
yourself with the best quality sounds to
complement any lifestyle your ears
deserve at some Heiser momentum products
move freely with the gorgeous momentum
in ears or style it up with the momentum

noise-cancelling momentum wireless
available over here or on to your pairs

with the momentum full details in
description below so I gotta say
tempered glass is like the new RGB but
how you implement this element is more
important than simply having it the
glass is tinted with this neutral color
it's like an ND filter and it is fully
transparent meaning the perimeter is not
darker or blacked out like on other
glass panels and this means that you can
see the frame underneath this may not be
a big problem for you but holding the
glass by the edges and this prime area
needs constant cleaning because of that
which is especially annoying on the
inside of the case and so the mount
itself we have a standard for thumb
screw method with rubber dampers and the
glass panel is backwards compatible with
90 G edition case and that is because of
the pure basics I'm going to use the
same pegs as what we saw on the dark
base 900 allowing you to actually remove
these little pegs that hold the glass
because they are simply screwed into the
frame and so this is the non CG edition
of the pure base 600 case and so here we
can see the same holes inside the frame
and that means that you could
potentially you know if you buy the
glass separately with these pegs you
could install them and turn your non CG
edition case into a TG Edition case it's
a very good thing that the frames are
backwards compatible however be quiet
currently does not sell the glass
separately so this backwards
compatibility is a little bit useless as
of this release design wise it's kind of
and traditional this is one of the few
cases that still has a five and a
quarter inch drive bay that are
removable but glass brings it kind of
back to life and there is consistency
would be quiet other cases so the front
panel has a brushed plastic look with
the color outlined on the side
ventilation also available in gray or
black because the price though it is
competing right against the s340 elite
and has some tough competition versus
the p400 SPG but appearance-wise let us
know which one you like the most the i/o
is clean with a three-speed fan
controller for three fans it is SATA
powered so that's nice and be quiet
includes some of the best stock fans
like this 140 millimeter pure wings to
fan and the 120mm exhaust one that are
incredibly quiet and have good airflow
the front cam support dual 120 and 140
more fans by default and triple 120mm
fans fb5 the quarter inch drive bay is
removed but the problem here is the very
restricted front panel that has this
mesh for catching the dust but the
openings are so limited you're
guaranteed to choke your fans and I'll
be doing a full cooling comparison
versus other mid towers in this price
range so stay tuned for that video all
the panels are covered with noise
dampening material with the really thick
piece on the rear side panel with
captive thumb screws but as I said in my
case trends video it'll be so good for
companies that release the silent
edition cases with this noise damping
material applied on certain panels to
give a statistics or some information
all those frequencies and let's say
noise levels these panels help to reduce
that way you as a consumer have the
value-added thinking you're going into
the silent case and you know you know
exactly what type of benefits you're
receiving versus a non silent enclosure
that does not have this noise damping
material applied like if you agree but
also if you have any sound engineers in
the audience please let us know how this
will benefit noise isolation or
insulation or how the sound look down
with such a thin profile of a foam yeah
they'll be great to know thank you
the top an area spends the entire case
for triple 120 or dual 140 mm fans and I
would not install a top radiator just
because clearance is very tight and now
sinkholes are not really offset enough
to accommodate for a comfortable fit but
I really like what they did with the top
cover letting you raise it for
exhausting the air without eating us
daughter or closes completely if you're
only doing horizontal airflow and
wanting a quieter system I keep saying
traditional in this review because the
interior is very much 2015 to me you
know there's no power supply shroud
there are the drive cages at the front
it's kind of the standard you know from
back in the day and that dual five the
quarter inch drive bay but it is still
modular and quite open so the metal
drive cages have spacing between them to
allow air flow to pass between and
through them and you can reposition them
to any of the five slots and most
importantly you do not need to remove
them for installation or standard front
radiator and these metal drive cages are
SSD ready for two drives at the same
time plus there are dual SSD caddies
behind the motherboard I do like their
approach to color customization using
rubber grommets so here's the gray
compared to the orange those also the
black variant just giving you a little
bit more color customization on the
inside aside from those ventilation
strips on the exterior but the rubber
grommets themselves are really soft and
kind of low-quality because when you're
passing the cable through them the cable
grubber the rubber grommet will simply
pop out with that cable and you'll have
to put it back into the frame once
you're finished with cable management
very annoying something that I haven't
had to deal with in recent a while with
many of the builds so yeah this needs to
be fixed now obviously one advantage of
a power supply shroud is to hide the
cable mess and it doesn't improve the
cleanliness of your build so we'll see
how be quiet' responds with their own
version of hiding this bottom chamber in
a future case but here is my finished
system you can either look at it from
this perspective of and this outdated
kind of frame you know glass half empty
or it might suit your tastes of having
nothing to hide it is more challenging
of course because absolutely everything
is on display with the glass panel but
you know what that can be said for all
tempered glass cases my main point of
criticism is the layout of the rubber
grommets since
they're completely covered by my
standard ATX motherboard and you're left
to think creatively on how to route a
24-pin cable and all your SATA cables
from different cut outs you know there's
not even enough space underneath the
motherboard for any cable unless you pre
route before inserting the power supply
but here is a standard ATX motherboard
as well but it's not as wide so those
cable cutouts accommodate the 24 pin and
the SATA area very well so perhaps they
thought about you know this is you know
perfectly fine for it's like the slimmer
ATX motherboard but you know this
shouldn't happen for 2017 the release
especially because the frame is fairly
long to accommodate the hard drives and
the radiator there so that you know this
is perfectly fine but yeah it's just
unfortunate that the cable cutouts and
this whole area just didn't take into
account standard ATX motherboards like
this and taking a look at the back cable
management is traditional you can make
it flat with a bit of work and you know
we have cable tie points and all the
needed areas around the sides around the
rubber grommets but kind of ironic as
the cable cattles themselves are not in
the right places so the main thing is
how to clean all this plus the interior
when the case is kind of working against
you and in the current state of
competition a case needs to handle your
default integration with an ATX
motherboard a clean way to organize and
hide the power supply area with
appropriate channels for routing none of
these things apply here unless you go
with a more of an entry-level build and
a slimmer motherboard and perhaps going
full air cooling also and taking all
that into account be quiet
release the pure basic Saunders with
entry level in mind despite having an TG
Edition that is competing in the same
price bubble as other high-end mid
towers we'll see how that plays out in
our full comparison of the bottle of the
mid tower so make sure to subscribe for
that let us know what you think of this
case I would meet you how our Canucks
thanks so much for watching keep calm
and be quiet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
