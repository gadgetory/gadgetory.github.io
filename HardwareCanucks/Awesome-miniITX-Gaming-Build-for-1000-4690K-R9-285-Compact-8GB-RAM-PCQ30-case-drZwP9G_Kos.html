great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with
hurricane axe and it's time to do a
sweet kick-ass damn good mini ITX gaming
machine because we can hardware has
shrunk but your ego shouldn't because
remember small can be just as powerful
so the reason for this project are
twofold first to finally utilize this
sexy curved case from Lee and Lee this
is the pc q 30 x the name is scheme of
Lee and Lee's absurd so we're gonna call
this built curvy instead so give us like
if you like that code name or leave a
comment down below on your suggestions
for some creative names for this build
the second fold behind this project is
to see what the frame rates will be
getting from our I TX components what
type of temperatures will beginning from
such a tiny case with limited air flow
and ventilation and also what are the
acoustics like because this is meant to
be placed on your desk to be showcased
and that is also an integral part of
curvy of this curvy project because it
is meant to spread the message of true
potential of ITX
builds not just HTPC sort of you know
hiding behind the closet type of
computer but actual computer dedicated
for gaming to be housed in your living
room and something to also be proud of
for the components for the curvy build
we'll be using an msi z87 i mini ITX
motherboard primarily because it's got
AC Wi-Fi with these cool antennas
because of really awkward router
location in my apartment having wireless
connection is crucial and this built-in
feature is very important to me for the
z87 i has the most bizarre connection
layout whoever designed this board i'm
not happy with them because every mini
ITX case that I've used this board with
brings up many challenges with wiring
for the CPU I've gone ahead with the
trusty Intel Core i5 4690k
that is a very capable quad core
processor that doesn't go overboard for
pricing over clocks like a champ from
the default 3.5 gigahertz to 4.5
gigahertz
awesome and to cool this bad boy we've
got a low profile CPU cooler from
silverstone the AR 0 6 with four copper
heat pipes that make direct contact with
the CPU aluminum heatsink and the 92
millimeter pwm fan for silent operation
and very good performance for ram we got
an 8 gigabyte kit from FX here this is
the core series nothing too high-end and
I always say that a gigabytes of RAM is
that perfect sweet spot for a gaming
machine plus it's got very cool lighting
pattern to indicate when Ram is in use
this kingston fury HyperX 240 gigabyte
SSD will store the OS and all of my
games plus I do want to keep the noise
factor to a minimum and avoid any heat
buildup that would normally occur from
mechanical storage and for graphics
powering the system is the r9 285
compact from sapphire this is a very
capable tonga GPU compressed into this
tiny I TX form factor and here it is
next to the r9 285 dual X the gtx 960
and the 970 from EVGA and measuring only
at 17 centimeters it will fit into our i
TX build no problem and powering
everything is one of the latest sfx
units from silverstone this 600 watt
power supply the SX 600 G got an 80 plus
gold efficiency rating intelligent fan
curve for zero rpm when loads are low
and to house this entire built together
the star of the show the Leonie PC Q
thin X there are many elements with
chassis that are unique first the fully
aluminium construction means outstanding
cooling capacity of the interior the
case is super light here durable but
because of our black version I had all
my microfiber cloths within reach
because aluminium despite all the
positive features is a toll to clean
obviously the curved facade with a
window to reveal the internals is a
major positive but this means needing to
do a clean wiring job for the build to
look attractive I love the simplicity of
the case with just the power button and
then Lindley logo at the front while the
i/o ports are moved to the side with two
USB 3 ports and audio jacks I also have
to mention how the front panel extends
at the top to sort of cover up existing
cables and that is very much
preciate it there's a single 140 member
exhaust fan behind the motherboard tray
taking heat out of the case and because
the internal volume is so low we won't
have any problems with overheating
I really dislike how the front panel is
secured with screws instead of thumb
screws for easier removal but they are a
sort of low profile to fit with the
style of the case and once inside we
find two and a half inch drive cage to
house four units and notice there are no
spots for three and a half inch drives
you can see the ventilation cut out on
each side panel for both the GPU and the
CPU cooler to breathe but the lack of a
dust filter though I'm sure you know how
I feel about that but aluminum is not
magnetic so magnetic dust filters are
out of question so I will need to keep
an eye on any dust buildup inside the
case especially on the AR 925 compact
and with the parts overview out of the
way let me show you how I build curvy
then turning sexy footage
all right I hope you guys enjoyed that
b-roll give us a like if you did but
here it is fully built and ready to gain
I'm actually very happy to have this
turned out it's not the most compact nor
efficient mini ITX chassis out there but
it is certainly one of the more unique
looking cases with that curvature one
thing to keep in mind is the length of
the power supply cables as there isn't
that much room in the basement section
luckily the cables on our sfx unit are
short for that specific reason the one
major annoying thing throughout the
entire build process was how slippery
the case is I would rather prefer some
type of rubber case feed that prevents
them from sliding instead of the
aluminum ball that is installed at the
bottom especially when installing this
entire front facade back as you're
trying to push it in it sort of slides
away from you and that's very annoying
but it's time to power up this curvy biz
beast of a mini ITX machine see how it
performs with games temperatures with
our infrared camera and all the other
things that we wanted to test and so
starting at the temperatures at load
both the CPU and the GPU were totally
under control
despite the non-existent air tunnels and
I'm very happy with how the low-profile
AR 0 6 Silverstone cooler performed with
our overclocked 4690k at 4.5 gigahertz
infrared reveals the air flow is capable
in cooling such a low volume thanks to
that rear exhaust fan noise levels are
taller Bowl given the open design during
load no complaints here and had no
issues with the machine on the desk
during all my tests and finally here are
some gaming benchmarks the shoot act has
an incentive to move towards ITX for
single GPU gaming dedicated machines as
frame rates are totally playable and
perhaps we all need to go through the
stage of building something different
and I'm very happy with how curvy worked
out so this concludes this mini ITX
gaming bed log slash case showcase and
let us know if you enjoy this type of
content and give us a like if you did
and also what do you think of the case
the
this looks like something that would
appeal to you and whether or not you are
considering moving towards an ITX system
for your future build as always thank
you so much for watching don't forget to

we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
