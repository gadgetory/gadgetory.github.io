sorry about the update update what
update ah the windows update so I feel
like we've all been there deferring
Windows updates because of many reasons
but the latest fall creators update
build
1803 supposedly has fixed a lot of
issues surrounding HDR so let's revisit
the topic make sure to check out our
original video on HDR here but yeah
let's revisit topic talk about the
desktop environment and the gaming
environment with HDR with the latest
Windows Update to see if it is
satisfactory right after this are you
ready okay watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P managed by
Coolermaster check it out in the
description below so my HDR experience
originally began with the LG 27 UK 850
it's an awesome display supports HDR 10
spec and supposed to deliver a brighter
and the more vibrant picture but my
experience with this whole HDR thing was
not satisfactory for many reasons not
because of the display but because of
Windows potentially driver updates and
game updates too so I experienced a
common pink issue where the screen would
be covered in this pink overlay as soon
as the HDR would be turned on that was a
windows issue so that's been solved the
desktop could also be way too dim for
regular operation outside of like
consuming HDR content originally so now
that's also been solved and for games I
had strange artifacts with colours HDR
would simply not engage and exiting a
non HDR game would sometimes turn HDR on
my desktop all those issues have now
been fixed with this build
18:03 and to expand my sample size for
HDR panels we have the 38 wk 95 C from
LG it's also an HDR 10 panel and I've
tested both Intel and Rison systems
along with nvidia and AMD graphics cards
to see if HDR plays better on one or the
other and so with the latest 18:03 build
enabling HDR on the desktop gives us
proper bright image and now we have
brightness slider for SDR content we
didn't have this before this means you
can adjust the brightness of your
desktop or if you're watching something
on YouTube that's not HDR you still get
that proper brightness levels on those
videos the hiccup however is Chrome for
some reason and how the browser is
basically gray instead of white and that
reflects also on SD our videos but it
still weirdly supports HDR playback and
display that super bright and vibrant
image through Chrome one of those HDR
examples would be Austin's iPhone 10
review which is absolutely stunning well
done and so this chrome hiccup is kind
of annoying because if you want to have
HDR enabled on the desktop by default
all the time you will need to use
Firefox that the
displays all the content properly
without having it too dim Netflix and
HDR is fantastic which is one of the
reasons why you potentially want to keep
HDR on the desktop on all the time so
you don't have to go back and forth of
enabling it and disabling it because you
cannot assign HDR turning on by app just
yet I'm sure that will come soon but HDR
on Netflix is absolutely incredible and
there's so many good HDR shows that I
would say deliver a superior image in
HDR versus SDR and one of the reasons
why you want to consider an HDR monitor
and so HDR 10 displays have their space
in the market to push HDR content but to
really fully utilize the potential you
definitely have to go with Dolby vision
and OLED displays because that is the
future of HDR now the gaming experience
visually is basically the same but now
without all the bugs which is awesome
now I've been kind of hesitant to
recommend HDR panels for gamers because
the list of HDR supported titles is
pretty short but the triple-a titles now
pretty much all of them will support HDR
so you know Far Cry 5b f1 the shadow of
war destiny 2 and the color experience
through all of these titles is basically
identical but I want to clear out this
misconception or the faulty assumption
that you'll get deeper blacks color
accurate image and what are some higher
contrast with HDR because that has been
not the case for me actually it's been
exactly the opposite in my experience
now sure the picture is more vibrant and
brighter as that's boosted to 100% by
default in HDR but you don't get more
dynamic range from the game you just
kind of see more shadow area because
they are lifted like in this be f1 scene
but mainly it's all about that color pop
that could make the experience better so
far cry 5 for me is too bright and I
like the less punchy colors of SDR but
destined to an HDR looks fantastic with
appropriate color boost and extra detail
in this whole like cartoony environment
and the same with Assassin's Creed
origins that game in HDR is colorful and
just absolutely awesome but I would
advise from playing during the darker
conditions to close to the display
because it is just way too bright and
I'm just worried about like my eyes
hurting after a while now some games
allow luminance adjustment like in bf1
and a co but for color changes you can
cycle between picture profiles from the
monitor itself also some games allow you
to turn HDR on in the settings even
choose between HDR 10 or dolby vision
depending on the game and some enabled
it by default based on the desktop color
space and I'm happy to report I've had
zero bugs with HDR and gaming so jumping
back into bf1 it remembers my HDR
settings but exiting back into Windows
that is not HDR disables HDR and there
is no that color cycling between back
and forth so that's awesome it seems
like both Nvidia and AMD have been on
top of their driver support also Windows
updates solved for majority of those
things too so if you are considering in
the HDR display now potentially now is
the time now in case you're wondering
performance difference between HDR and
SDR is not significant only a few frames
lower on average with HDR turned on and
for me personally once I tried out HDR
with certain games like this thing to is
fantastic Assassin's Creed origins I
cannot go back to SDR just looks too
flat and not saturated enough or vibrant
enough for me to experience the same
gameplay and so really this whole update
with the build
18:03 definitely is a huge point for HDR
to drive that whole acceptance forward
because many people in our original
video are saying that it could be
potentially because my Rison system may
be the monitor was faulty
maybe my graphics cards were something
was happening with them but in fact it
was just all windows-based issues that
have now been resolved and the HDR
experience as a whole is a lot more
complete than before now what excites me
the most when it comes to gaming with
this whole high dynamic range stuff is
g-sync
HDR because their panels are going to be
reaching that a thousand dense
brightness for a spec which is still way
too bright you gonna have to tone it
down in order to not burn your retinas
but they're approaching it from like
true blacks or like deep blacks quantum
dot panels so that
is where things going to get really
exciting for you know delivering a
beautiful deep contrast the image that's
still vibrant is bright and you can see
all the detail without needing to sort
of lift the shadow stuff that we
normally see with these panels with HDR
10 so g-sync HDR is super exciting and
yeah I'm just looking forward to playing
around with it myself too but I'm
curious to hear what your experience has
been like with HDR have you played any
games did you like the color just like
the contrast and you know once I started
playing HDR on Netflix on these panels I
just cannot go back to anything else it
just looks so vibrant and rich and
colors and the whole idea is when you
enable those HDR profiles the monitor
doesn't dynamically calibrate based on
the areas it's just kind of like a
filter but that filter is also as a
secondary layer pre applied to the
source footage the way the artist
intended for you to look at HDR 10
content so it's not based on the monitor
specs of like how they perceive HDR to
look it's more like taking that
information and displaying how the
artist wanted you to see it I hope that
makes sense yeah join the wireless club
with Corsairs new dark core Mouse play
the way you want with 9 programmable
buttons aligned in the comfortable shape
and fantastic sensor you can trust and
crazy good Wireless performance plus Qi
wireless charging built-in focus on the
game the dark core will do the rest
alright guys so that is it for my HDR
update it's working fine there are no
bugs so make sure to check out this
