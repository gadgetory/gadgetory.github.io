connects and we're always on the lookout
for some cool things that come across
our inbox and if they're inexpensive
bonus points dorsum because we'd like to
cover as much as possible here on the
channel
now we received a press release from
Philips a while back guarding their
inexpensive e lineup of monitors and we
thought to ourselves would it be
possible to build a triple monitor setup
that's relatively inexpensive but
doesn't actually sacrifice on picture
quality yet it also gives you an amazing
gaming experience well we decided to
take the plunge and as you can see I
have three boxes behind me and this is
my first time building a triple monitor
setup so I'm super excited about that
and yeah let's just you know fingers
crossed let's hope everything works well
so let's find out if this is even
possible and if it's even worth it right
after this
the legendary hyper 212 CPU cooler from
Coolermaster now comes in this
breathtaking matte black finish the
included Silencio 120 millimeter fan
delivers great airflow and reduced noise
plus you can pick up an RGB version of
this cooler as well learn more about the
hyper 212 black edition and it's RGB
sibling down below alright so the main
highlight of the video it's a Phillips
27 69q dsb monitor and we got this idea
because of what philips actually claims
these panels can accomplish so let's get
the good stuff out of the way this is a
true IPS display rather than being you
know IPS equivalent stuff that we've
been seeing with other panels so that
actually checks off a big number of
must-have points for a triple monitor
setup because new angles should be or is
an important factor for the setup also
did I mention that the price per monitor
is around $165 that is impressive my
friends you can also pick them up in 24
inches for on $130 or the 21 and a half
inch model that goes around $100 they'll
keep in mind that the 21 and half inch
model seems to sell out a lot another
cool feature about this monitor is that
it's basic impassible in the 100 my 100
millimeter configuration so you could
end up picking up an inexpensive
compatible euro monitor arm
Amazon or something like that and have
you know complete flexibility links to
all of these will be down in the
description cable ordering options are
pretty limited on this panel so you kind
of have to find your own way to do that
within your desk set up the rest of the
specs include a refresh rate of 75 Hertz
with support for free sync it also has a
5 millisecond grader response time so
that's adequate enough for casual gaming
but this also brings us to the bad stuff
where the lower price comes into effect
the free sync range is around 48 276
Hertz and it's only 1080p across 27
inches so the pixel density is going to
be a lot lower and that's something to
keep note of some other cost-cutting
factors include the design and the build
quality so the back panel is completely
crafted out of this cheap piano gloss
plastic construction that attracts
fingerprints like no one's business the
monitor stand is built pretty well I
mean it's a metal base with a plastic
shroud on top of it so it's pretty solid
the ports that are conveniently placed
at the back instead of being at the
bottom and a spur port so you get
dueling DVI HDMI and VGA as well as
audio out and power in and that means
the free sync signal can only be
delivered over HDMI since there's no
display port now in terms of picture
quality I was actually amazed at how
well a monitor that cost less than $200
can produce amazing colors so first and
foremost the viewing angles are amazing
for what it is you're really getting an
awesome experience when watching content
or just gaming in particular the
contrast ratios are just perfect the
only thing I did notice is that it the
monitors doesn't get too bright in terms
of backlit bleed I was not able to
notice anything with my naked eye and as
you can see with the triple monitor
setup I set the ISO all the way up to
ten thousand and that's when I started
picking up a few things you know started
picking up a code bleed around the edges
I should also mention 1080p at 27 inches
was certainly an interesting experience
for me personally because I come from a
4k monitor at 32 inches so pixel density
is certainly a lot lower and if you're
coming from a 4k panel then this is
definitely a downgrade for you
personally but I think if you're
thinking of expanding your laptop set
something with an external monitor then
this would be a fantastic solution or
add-on to your setup that doesn't really
cost that much all right so with that
out of the way I think it's time to
build this
setup I actually did unbox one monitor
just to test it out and stuff but now
it's time to build the triple monitor
setup so let's get to it alright guys so
I've run into a little bit of an issue
here with setting up these three
monitors so one of the things to
consider with the Philips Uihlein is
that they don't feature height adjusts
or even swivels so you kinda have to
you're kind of stuck with either tilt
and that's pretty much it now the
problem is that none of these monitors
are consistent in terms of height so for
example you can see that there's a
little bit of a clearance not clearance
but this monitor on the left side is
quite higher as opposed to the one in
the middle and when you look at the
point now if we hit the right on the
right hand side it's even shorter so
yeah this is this is gonna be quite
challenging but let's let's set up the
rest
guys as you can see the triple monitor
setup is complete and it's sitting right
behind me so tempting for me to actually
go right now and play dirt 3 but I just
I just have to finish this video so let
me walk you through some of the issues
that I did run into first and foremost I
do want to talk about cable management
because triple monitor setup is all
great and all but managing cables is
definitely something to consider you
might be able to see notice that little
cable in the background well that's
because the power supply isn't built
into the monitors so it act it's
actually an external unit which is
another thing to cable man and she I
actually ended up taping some of the
panels or some of the cables behind the
monitor I really don't want to show it
on camera because it's too embarrassing
I mean it looks okay right now but cable
management is definitely something to
consider now another thing that I should
definitely mention is the port situation
because this monitor or I guess these
monitors come with a single HDMI port
that's supports free sync and that's the
only way to get this whole thing working
unfortunately most modern graphics cards
only come with a single HDMI port so the
only other option we had left was to use
passive DisplayPort to HDMI adapter that
I had lying around the studio the issue
is that when use adapters like that if
you refresh rate caps at 60 Hertz it
still sports free sync but you could
pick up an active adapter that will
allow for 75 Hertz operation and we'll
leave links to some of them
but anyways I ended up setting all these
three panels to sixty Hertz which also
caps the freesync range as well so
playing sixty Hertz at triple monitors
is I mean I know it is i soaring for
some of you guys who are used to 144
Hertz but honestly I loved it and not to
mention the minimum bezels on these
panels really is perfect for each one
monitor setup because it's less
distracting when you're gaming on it and
when you're doing productivity things
like dragging a window from one panel to
the other it's just so seamless and that
bezels or those bezels when were
distracting to me at all except for the
fact that the height difference between
one panel to the other was definitely
different and the lack of height adjust
and tilt adjust is certainly something
to keep note of and that's where I would
recommend picking up a third party
triple monitor arm from Amazon I think I
found this one for $110 which seems to
have amazing reviews so if you're
planning on setting up a triple monitor
setup you should definitely consider
picking up a stand so that it's all
unified and you can you know get things
like high to just swivel tilt and all
that kind of stuff
alright so with that out of the way how
was it actually gaming on a triple
monitor setup honestly guys it was
breathtaking but before I get to the
pole experience and whatnot I just want
to quickly talk about the setup process
so Indies drivers actually include
something called Eyefinity and it's been
around for quite some time so I just
head over to that tab and I hit quick
setup and essentially what it did it had
stitched all three monitors together to
create this one you know wide screen
resolution so I get 57 60 by 1080 and so
that means all your windows would span
across all three screens if you go full
screen mode so if I open up Chrome and
if I maximize a window it just spans
across all three windows which could be
a good thing or a bad thing now just to
go over the specs of the PC powers
entire set up I Verizon 520 600 X with
16 of RAM and an AMD GPU which I'll talk
about in another video the good thing is
that I not experienced any driver
crashes whatsoever for once which is
kind of awesome especially since this is
an all aimed II themed set up so I'm
really grateful for that there's also
one thing that I highly need to
emphasize and that is game support
because
all right for some reason does not
support ripple monitors and there are
also a few other titles as well so if
you're planning on building a triple
monitor setup certainly look at the
games you play and if they support
ripple monitors because that is highly
important if you're actually going for
this in the first place but I ended up
trying a few titles like Battlefield one
I also tried dirt showdown and of course
fortnight and rocket League
obviously because all these games
support multiple screens and boy oh boy
the experience was fabulous I'm gonna
kick things off with battlefield one
because the whole field of view when
you're playing an FPS title it just
immerses you in the game and you can
sort of spot your enemies in a better
way and that's kind of amazing when
you're just cruising through a certain
situations especially playing team
deathmatch and whatnot it's kind of cool
to just you know blow up stuff and just
it just immerses you into the whole
experience now when you're playing
racing titles like dirt showdown it's
even awesome because it just immerses
you into the experience so in conclusion
this triple monitor setup project turned
out to be a success I think the obvious
down or the drawback was would obviously
be the fact that we were only able to
set these three smanos at sixty Hertz
and not 75 Hertz and the fact that
you're getting you know all of these
triple monitors were on $500
is kind of awesome actually coming to
think of it I just realized that you
kind of have to spend even more to get
the DisplayPort to active the active
DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and all the
cables and whatnot which would cost you
at least you know 50 to 100 dollars
extra cuz I'm telling you these monitors
don't come with an HDMI cable that is
something that I had to highly
emphasized because it's kind of the
cost-cutting factor of spending a
hundred and seventy dollars on a panel
like this it only comes with a VGA cable
which is kind of stupid but not to
mention you're getting true IPS
technology and that's awesome especially
for a monitor that cost $170 viewing
angles they're all great you really
won't have a terrible time setting at
least three of these in slo-mo because
it just is it is an awesome experience
guys you just have to take my word for
it by the way links to the monitors
cables everything in the set up will be
down in the description it does help out
the channel
very much but yeah that's about it guys
let me know what you guys think about
this triple monitor setup you know
would you consider building yourself
something like this and also considering
that this thing costs now that it costs
around $600 of the cables and adapters
included you know would you consider
recommending this to a friend of yours
and if you're currently rocking a triple
monitor setup let me know the comments
down below what your experience is like
and what your setup is exactly I'd love
to go over that in the comments I mean
