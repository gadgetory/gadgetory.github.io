axe and today Intel's launching the new
seventh generation Core Series codenamed
KB Lake and this is it not only are
these new processors supposed to offer
higher performance than the skylake
series but you can also expect new
motherboards updated features and a
whole lot of things this video is meant
to be just the tip of a very large
iceberg in it I'll get into what KB Lake
is how its platform differs from skylake
and the performance of the i7 7700 K and
the i-5 7600 cane against a ton of other
processors as you're watching this I'm
on my way to meet Dmitry for our annual
CES coverage so stay tuned for more
cable 8 content at the show and in the
near future so without any further ado
let's take a look at Intel's newest
processors in its most basic form cable
8 is simply a refresh of skylake with
higher frequencies and a few additional
features on the platform side you see
Intel is currently stuck in there 14
millimeter manufacturing process and
won't be moving beyond it for a little
while so cable lake is meant to increase
performance over its predecessor without
consuming more power basically it isn't
meant as an upgrade for skylight
Broadwell or even has well users rather
these new processors and their
accompanying motherboards should appeal
to people who still have setups from the
Sandy Bridge generation or before if we
focus for a moment on the slightly
higher end cabling processors you can
see that there's a 200 megahertz to 300
megahertz increase in raw bass boost
clocks over the previous generation
cable expressing also stays aligned with
skylight but there are a few moves to
very slightly lower cost markets and
expect this to change as aim DS intent
for rising becomes clearer and Intel
adapts their strategies accordingly at
least in the high range in tellers of
placing their skylake processors on a
one-to-one basis with the 7000 series
parts like I said earlier for the
purposes of this review I'll be testing
the 7700 K and 7600 k2 processors that
are unlocked for better overclocking and
find a home in the higher end of intel's
new line of like the 6700 k the 7700 K
has four logical cores and eight threads
whereas the sandy 600 K has four cores
and threads but commands at a lower
price moving a bit further down market
and this is where I think Intel's new
lineup really comes on is
own as we've seen in the past the more
affordable I five and I three options
actually provides some great bang for
buck performance while giving gaming
frame rates that are extremely close to
high-end CPUs even here there are some
incremental 200 megahertz clock speed
improvements when moving to Kaiba lake
and the dual core quad thread I three
series processors still lack a turbo
mode the most interesting KB like
processor is the I 373 50 K since it
only costs a hundred and seventy dollars
but it's unlocked for overclocking and
still offers for processing threads it
will be released into retail channels in
late January or early February and I can
see this thing playing perfectly with a
compact ITX system with every new
processor launch until always updates
their chipsets and rolls out either a
new or revised platform this time around
z170 is being replaced by a revised and
slightly updated Z 270 platform much
like the cable 8 processors themselves
the amount of changes are minimal but
there's one significant update the new
z2 70 motherboards like this asrock
fatality z2 70 gaming k6 are compatible
with intel's upcoming obtain octane uses
a combination of non-volatile memory and
PCIe storage standards alongside 3d
xpoint technology to significantly boost
system performance in many ways obtained
can be compared to Intel's Smart
Response SSD caching technology but it
will achieve its goals faster and with
more security in order to better support
obtain and other next-generation storage
standards the z2 7e PCH as for
additional pcie 3.0 lanes I'll be
covering opt in a bit later this year so
stay tuned for that even though there
hasn't been much done to the z2 semi
chipset to differentiate it from z1 70s
rock and other motherboard manufacturers
are launching some pretty interesting
products in the case of this gaming k-6
it may cost less than $200 but it
features onboard diagnostic LEDs and
power arrest switches there's also
plenty of space for aftermarket cooling
installation with a 12 phase digital
power delivery system it has a USB 3.1
type A and type C ports on the very
complete rear i/o and for ddr4 slots
rated at 38 66 megahertz operation
incredible stuff compared to the
original gaming k-6
this generation adds an opt in
supporting m2 slot as an add-on
a third m2 slot dedicated for a Wi-Fi
bluetooth module dual Intel and modules
and equative Sound Blaster cinema 3
audio controller other than a few
connectivity improvements as Rock has
really gone to town with other add-ons
there is now full RGB LED control
alongside a dedicated LED header they
bundle in a higher bandwidth SLI bridge
it has still reinforced PCIe x16 slots
and a dedicated water-pump header expect
many other z2 semi motherboards to offer
similar features at very competitive
prices
but enough about these motherboards and
let's get to the benchmarks for these
new processors as you can see we try to
equalize the test systems as much as
possible with all the memory GPUs etc
running at the same speed
note that older video drivers were used
since this allowed us to standardize
testing procedures across multiple CPU
generations so let's get on this and
start with the basic synthetic
benchmarks as you can see in these tests
the keyblade processors do offer some
benefits over their predecessors
particularly in single threaded
applications however this really won't
be enough to justify anyone upgrading
from Haswell processor or later
generations honestly if you were
expecting something around breaking over
the last generation of CPU cable it
won't be it and if you want massive
parallel workload capability
look towards Broadwell e kb lake is good
but it isn't a miracle worker since it
still uses a 40 nanometer manufacturing
process our real-world benchmarks show
that both the i7 7700 K and i-5 7600 K
are awesome performers in their own
rights but there are certainly better
paths if you need massive multi-threaded
performance but from a price to
performance standpoint I really like
both of these in their respective price
brackets they really do have excellent
results in every single test especially
the ones that don't rely completely upon
the processor in order to test how these
processors compare against one another
with the GPU partially taken out of the
equation we set up the system to run at
a lower 720p resolution while it might
not be realistic for most gamers to run
this it should help differentiate one
CPU from another we intend to do more
game testing in the weeks after CES to
give you a better idea how these
processors perform with a newer graphics
card as you can see in these charts the
number of games that actually take
advantage of
and for course is minimal at most that
means the extremely high-end processors
from Intel Brown well aligned up are
either tied or trailing the 7700 K in
many games the same goes for the four
thread 7600 K its performance is very
very good given its a lower price
moving on to 1080p and we see the
results becoming even tighter as the
CPUs performance takes a backseat to how
much data the graphics card can process
here frequencies tend to mean less for
frame rates and all for the newer Intel
processors perform very close to one
another with that being said KB Lake
CPUs are right near the top of the
charts which is great to see now on to
power consumption what everyone is
seeing here shouldn't be a shock
power consumption has remained extremely
consistent from one generation to the
next in Intel's lineup but the clock
speeds have been able to increase
dramatically
that means performance per watt is at an
all-time high do not however that some
parts feature higher power consumption
than others so the numbers here may vary
widely from one ship to another but when
you're buying a processor like one of
these overclocking Headroom is likely
more important to you than overall power
consumption and both of these chips were
able to get some pretty good results
after only a small amount of time with
each we were easily able to hit just
over five gigahertz for the 7600 K which
normally runs at 4.2 gigahertz and
additional 900 megahertz with simply a
multiplier change and voltage increase
is quite impressive and will net use
some very good performance increases
moving on to the 7700 K and I was a bit
less impressed with it since the final
clock speed was also just north of 5.1
gigahertz but you also can't forget that
this CPU starts out life running at 4.5
gigahertz in turbo mode over on the site
our team will be trying to push these
chips even further which will take some
time but it shouldn't be too hard
KB Lake includes newbie clock and
voltage controls which are meant to
improve stability with those in action
high frequencies are certainly possible
it should be interesting to see what
happens as time goes on and professional
overclockers are able to get their hands
on these new processors so let's sum it
up KB Lake may not offer all that much
additional performance over sky lake but
it is a great step forward for a simple
refresh the new processors are no more
expensive than printer
they don't consume more power and the Z
270 platform seems to be a solid
foundation which you can build a great
system around users of has well and
skylake processors won't find anything
hugely beneficial by moving to Kaiba
lake unless they absolutely want support
for octane however the z2 70
motherboards themselves will offer a
massive connectivity upgrade for people
who are still rocking Ivybridge and
earlier processors not only will they
now have access to cable X much improve
performance but they will also get
features like USB 3.1 octane ddr4 memory
MDOT to storage better rate support and
many other things so to sum that up if
you brought your CPU in the last three
years hang on to it for a little while
longer since cable a quo not offer you
much however cable a does provide a
great upgrade pad for slightly older
systems so what system are you guys
rocking right now are you looking at kb
lake as an upgrade let us know in the
comments down below
I mean bar with hurricane axe thank you
so much watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
