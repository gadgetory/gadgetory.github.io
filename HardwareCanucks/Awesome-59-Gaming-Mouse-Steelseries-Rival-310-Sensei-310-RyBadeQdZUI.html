Canucks and the large sergey pro mouse
has been my daily driver for anything
gaming and anything on the desktop just
a fantastic experience all around but
then still series came out and said hey
you're going to want to use this as your
daily driver we promise it with the
rival 310 and the sensei 310 the two new
mice they're announcing today and I was
skeptical because everybody says that
quite frankly so let's see if this new
kid on the block is actually any good
and still serious is approaching this a
very good price point that's $59 for
either the rival 310 or the sensei 310
it's a nice budget territory without any
bells or whistles it's just like a pure
performance mouse which i think is the
needed projection for many gaming
companies to take I'm happy that large
tech has done so with their G pro lineup
and I'm happy to see their series
following suit choose be quiet to join
the silent revolution designed and
tested in Germany they're meticulous
passion for quiet PC components ranges
from premium power supplies CPU coolers
and fans and innovative PC cases all of
which aim to achieve one thing is this
thing even on that's right totally quiet
power supplies even under load silent
wings fans deliver awesome airflow with
noise that doesn't reach your ears all
enclosed in the package designed to be
quiet all right so let's first start for
the main thing the new sensor the true
move 3 which has been specifically
designed by fixed art exclusively for
SteelSeries so the mice really kind of
targeted eSports arena the trimmer' 3
sensor surprisingly is still series as
top-of-the-line sensor which offers true
one-to-one tracking with raw performance
and SteelSeries doesn't really want to
partake in those crazy dpi marketing
warfare that's going on so they outlined
exactly how the sensor works and that's
appreciated so the sensor goes up to
12,000 CPI which is crazy but what the
advertise is a true one-to-one tracking
up to 3,500 CPI which if you play below
that you're golden which means it's
absolutely raw performance one-to-one
tracking and that's an advantage because
other competing 3360 mice that use the
3360 sensor only can achieve that Roth
1/2
tracking up to 2100 CPI after which
there is a introduced delay in latency
and old journal reduction for the
calculations a sensor to work properly
whereas with these new to move three
sensors that gee reduction doesn't kick
in until 3,500 CPI there is some
differences between the two so the sense
a being slightly heavier and I'm
textures of course with an 8 button
layout
whereas rival is right hand only and a 6
button layout the rival 310 also weighs
less versus the original at 88 grams
versus 104 grams without the cable and
it is byte behavior than my G Pro which
weighs 83 grams without the cable so I
prefer the G Pro still for csgo scene
but the adjustment period for the weight
that the little additional weight is not
an issue so the main differences between
the original size from the weight is the
size the form is now slightly smaller
it's not as long but still featuring all
the similar curves very comfortable to
hold great support for ringing pinky
fingers on that right side they have
removed the custom rubber plate that you
could install on the rival 300 which i
think is a good direction the side
textured grips feel excellent which are
now made of silicon so you can lock in
your hands in place and lift the mouse
no problem and the plastic texture is
matte and does not feel cheap that can
happen with a really light Mouse so the
rival 310 build wise overall is
excellent the ambidextrous design is
also awesome the side buttons on the
opposite side of your thumb are out of
place and don't activate with your grip
but of course they can be disabled if
they bother you and both come equipped
with a split trigger design that use
Omron switches with 50 million
keystrokes or the lifespan so anyway you
press the switch is activated and the
physical separation from the rest of the
body is much improved versus the
original that had that one single piece
of molded plastic
the scroll wheel is precise without
skipping steps very easy to control the
middle click is fantastic light but
without the scroll step activation and
the two-step CPI button behind is
aligned well to avoid accidental presses
and the browser buttons are large enough
but low-profile to only be useful when
needed the cable is non braided it's
very light though at 2 meters fits into
my bungee just fine and there is a logo
at the tip for easier distinction if you
need to find what to unplug RGB of
course is present with a back logo in
the scroll wheel nice in uniform and of
course customizable and we all
appreciate Easter eggs especially when
it comes to gaming peripherals so
SteelSeries planted a little slogan on
the PCB of the sense 8310 that says bow
to the master it's very fitting for the
name - say alright so now let's talk
about the sensor the true move 3 is
fantastic true one-to-one tracking
performance absolutely raw tracking so
what you do on the math math is exactly
what is displayed on the screen and it's
especially evident with high refresh
rate monitors there is absolutely no
delay no latency up to 3,500 CBI so what
happens if you use the mouse over 3,500
CPI SteelSeries tells us because of high
sensitivity they have to introduce
jitter reduction so the sensor is kind
of can be fully controlled but because
of that there is introduced delay
latency to the sensor so it's not as
accurate but still my experience using
like 4000 dpi trying to move a 4k
desktop it was still fine I don't play
at such high DPI levels so I can't
really comment on that because I usually
play around 400 to 800 CPI for
competitive games so when I ask you a
series on why this matters they told me
that other competing mice that advertise
true one-to-one tracking with a 30 360
variant of the pixel sensor can only
achieve that raw performance up to 2100
CPI versus the new true move 3 can go up
to 3,500 CPI without raw performance
without introducing jitter delays and
jitter
reduction stuff so
have a wider range of CPI's so if you do
play at the highest activity you have
just a better option with this map and
so for my gaming perspective the
tracking is fantastic it's excellent if
you're training for repetitive scenes
and absolutely no complaints about the
performance aside from not having the
option to change your CPI levels and
smaller increments you can only adjust
them in one country we also have onboard
memory of the mouse so if you need to
remember your dual CPI levels you don't
need the software to remember your
profile and seriously the rival 310 and
the sensei 310 are the best mice you can
buy right now
at this price point I love the sensor I
love the shape especially because we
have ambidextrous and right hand only
designs trying to cover a larger market
segment and I love the new silicon
textured grip so if you're doing any
flakes or lifting the mouse a lot it
will not go anywhere really nice and
locked in your hands I still prefer my
large like gee pro because of a lighter
and despite a slimmer base for doing
flicks and stuff but the rival 310 is
definitely going to be staying on my
desk for more
SteelSeries has done a fantastic job
with these mice and we're giving them
the Huracan ax damn good and then good
value our words so yeah that's it let me
know which CPI or dpi levels view game
as I'm curious to see if we have any
higher sensitivity gamers in the
audience make sure to check out all the
other relevant videos and subscribe and
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
