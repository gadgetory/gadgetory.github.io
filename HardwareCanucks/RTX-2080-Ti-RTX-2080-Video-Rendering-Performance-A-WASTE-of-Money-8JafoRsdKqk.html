connects and we're all familiar with
Nvidia's r-tx launched it's certainly an
interesting topic to discuss especially
given its current state in terms of
pricing and if you recall we did mention
that we're actually working on a
comparison between the Arctic's 2080 and
an affordable aftermarket custom gtx
980ti
just so you know we paint the whole
picture in terms of giving users another
perspective so definitely stay tuned for
that video but in the meantime I decided
to put r-tx to its paces when it comes
to video editing because you know for
content creators like myself a lot of
people who are looking towards building
a new workstation PC especially if it's
someone who's working with Adobe
Premiere Pro or even DaVinci Resolve
might be looking to build you know an
optimal workstation PC and they might be
considering r-tx so I decided to put
r-tx in compared to in videos 10 series
of flagship which is the 1080i to see
you're actually getting or if you're
actually benefitting out of the new GPUs
so let's check that out right after
message from our sponsor evolve with the
times
consider nvme storage today the new RC
100 brings affordable nvme storage into
your hands with various capacities in
this super compact form factor that
points directly into your motherboard
it's extremely powerful and utilizes the
Sheba's advance through the flash memory
for awesome speeds so you can be a happy
user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme
Drive to consider check it out below
okay so for this test I'll be using
invidious r-tx 28 ETF founders edition
hmm the most expensive consumer GPU to
date next up we have zou tax gaming r-tx
2080 amp Edition and finally invidious
flagship ten series GPU the most beloved
1080 TI in this case I'm using EVGA SC
or superclocked black edition now I'm
here to test out two main factors and
the first one is playback performance
because it is an important element for
content creators because you know when
they're working with Suites like Adobe
Premiere Pro and of course eventually
resolved you want to be able to get the
best experience scrubbing through the
timeline not experience any choppiness
or lag when it comes to playing back the
footage in real time so that's
definitely something that we're going to
be testing out on all three GPUs and of
course the second is being rendering
performance because as much as playback
performance is important in fact a lot
better than rendering it's again another
factor for a lot of these content
creators who are looking to build the
workstation or an optimal workstation DC
now mic test system consists of an Intel
Core i7 8700 k-6 core 12 third processor
running at stock settings 32 gigabytes
of Corsair Vengeance RGB memory set to
3,200 meters which is XMP rated speed I
also have all of this setting on an ASUS
Maximus 10 hero motherboard and for
storage I have Samsung's 970 Evo one
terabyte nvme SSD do note that I have
enabled the integrated UHD graphics on
the 87 under K through the BIOS remember
premier now takes advantage of Hardware
encoding with Intel CPUs that have
quicksand support to accelerate
rendering times let's kick things off
with Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018 version
twelve point one point one I loaded up a
12 minute 37 second 4k project primarily
shot on the gh 5 you guys might recall
this video it's the Leon Lee PC 11
dynamic case review and starting with
the EVGA gtx 980ti
playback seems to be just fine with the
full resolution I'll be it I did notice
maybe a few frames dropped here and
there especially with nested sequences
for example if you have a particular you
have to reverse that and if you want to
add stabilization on top of that you
have to nest that particular shot and
that's obviously CPU intensive so the
six core 12th right CPU might become a
little bit for bottleneck because it's
got a lot of things to process so that's
why you're kind of experiencing or
that's why I ended up experiencing a few
rain struck framedrops within those
particular segments within this project
interestingly enough when I looked at
the resource monitor I noticed that the
1080 TI was being less utilized when
compared to intel's new HD graphics sure
CUDA acceleration plays an important
role of playback but there is more room
on the hardware side for these
applications to chew through I did
notice the same trend after switching to
the zotac r-tx 2080 playback performance
was pretty much identical when compared
to the 1080i switching to the r-tx 2080
TI and what can i say the GPU
utilization especially with dedicated
graphics didn't go over 35% it really
looks like adobe has optimized playback
performance to run as smoothly as
possible
by harnessing the integrated u HD
graphics along with a little bit of cool
acceleration with geforce cards provided
that you're on an Intel mainstream
platform like you know C 370 or Z 270 or
if you're running an Intel CPU with
quick sync support I also managed to put
together a 12-minute project in DaVinci
Resolve 15 remember this was the free
version and I made sure to enable CUDA
within the Preferences and to be honest
play my performance on all three GPUs
were identical I didn't experience any
lag or choppiness in fact it was a
little bit better than Premiere
scrolling through the timeline was super
smooth
didn't really experience any artifacts
or glitches whatsoever and it actually
got me thinking if I should switch
completely from premiere to resolve
because the experience just after
spending a day with resolve was a lot
smoother than Premiere and yeah I just
feel like I should have learned resolved
a lot earlier than Premiere but I'm just
too lazy to learn a new NLE that's Ebor
in a nutshell I should also mention that
there was zero percent utilization on
the UHD graphics during both playback
and rendering I'm not sure if this is a
limitation with the free version versus
a studio version but it is something to
keep in mind anyways
let's switch gears and talk about
rendering performance so starting with
Adobe Media encoder I took that 12
minute 37 second project exported to the
YouTube 4k preset make sure you have
hardware encoding enabled within the
encoder settings if you're using an
Intel CPU with QuickSync support and as
you can see the difference is actually
not that significant especially if you
take the Arctic's 20 80 and the GTX an
ATI
and put them head-to-head we're talking
a few seconds of difference here which
is not a big
deal even the r-tx 2080 Tina doesn't
yield that much of an improvement I did
monitor system resources to see how the
workload was being shared across the
hardware and just as expected the CPU
was hovering around 50 percent the Intel
u HD graphics was well over 70 percent
and he discrete Nvidia cards I tested
here where you'd lost between 25 to 50
percent so that means you still have
some resources left in the tank if you
want to work on other tasks while your
video is being rendered so your system
doesn't you know crash while basically
maxing on every system resources you
possibly have our last test here is with
DaVinci Resolve 15 I took the 12 minute
clip that I quickly stitched together
apply to LUT on top of that and exported
it to the YouTube 4k h.264 precent and
the results were pretty much neck to
neck with the r-tx 2080 TI VRTX 2080 and
the gtx 980ti again it's all about
hardware and software optimizations and
for fun 6 I decided to throw a GTX 1016
to the mix to see what the results were
and to my surprise it took the exact
same amount of time to render that
12-minute clip with DaVinci Resolve 15
and it really proves that you don't have
to spend $1000 on a graphics card to get
the best editing experience you actually
better off with the 10 60 or 1070 to get
a better experience because you know
you're not really going to be taking
advantage of 100% of the GPU when you're
editing with programs like resolve now
switching to the Adobe Media encoder
test I think that's where things start
to become a little bit different because
with a 1060 it took six minutes longer
to render when compared to the 10 80 80
i BRT X 20 80 and the RT X 20 80 TI so
again that's something that Adobe still
has to work with in terms of figuring
out how well can it optimize the
discrete graphics card the integrated u
HD graphics and of course the CPU so
it's there it's certainly getting there
to a point where you can rely on some of
the hardware within your system but
again resolve is definitely tempting me
to switch over I also ended up testing
the render times in Premiere with the
integrated u HD graphics disabled
through the BIOS and just as expected
they were again neck to neck but all
three configurations took more than nine
minutes to complete the render so at the
end of the day if you're looking for a
discreet graphics card to accelerate
video editing performance completely
skip the RTS cars at least for now and
Adobe decides to take advantage of the
tensor course in the RT course and I
would actually put that money towards
high-capacity memory or extra storage
because those factors are very crucial
for content creators the gtx 1070 1080
and 1080 TI are still great options for
Adobe Premiere the be quiet dark based
pro 900 revision 2 is here with the
modern IO for your type C accessories
and Qi charging gadgets the new hub is
good for 8 fans and RGB strips plus
steam terior is incredibly modular for
airflow water cooling invert systems and
now with a power supply shroud check out
the v2 down below and that about wraps
up this test I still have one more thing
that I want to work on which is just
basically comparing different file
formats because premiere actually it
kind of behaves differently with
different file formats particularly with
jh5 footage sony a7r footage as well
you've also got red files and Canon raw
light files as well so again the
software behaves differently with
different file formats I want to make
sure that I test those formats on both
intel's
cpus with quicksand support and of
course the x2 99 workstation skylake x
pcs so yeah it's definitely gonna be
quite time intensive as well so
certainly have to spend some time
testing those let me know if you guys
are interested in that video in the
comments down below I mean we're with
hybrid connects thank you so much for
watching make sure to check out some
relevant content over here subscribe to
a new boot sequence channel for the
latest tech news and rumors I'm signing
off and I'll see you guys in the next
one
RTX r TX r TX I'm just kidding I'm just
kidding I don't want to I don't want to
promote our TX anymore I mean it's a
good card I mean it's fast it's the
fastest GPU that's right available right
now 28 ETA that is yeah but it's
expensive so it's certainly an
interesting topic to discuss especially
given its current state in terms of
pricing
