many of you may know about ROC add other
than a few reviews we've done of their
product but I have a feeling that that
will change the next year since they're
on a path to launch some really
innovative peripherals they're showing
some at CES and that we stopped to take
a look but before we go into all the
kind of stuff and shout out from our
sponsors big thanks to Nvidia gigabyte
fantex and NCIX for our CES coverage so
first rocket is launching a new optical
sensor called the D owl eye which is
based on the Pixar 3360 series it's a
fantastic sensor and Rockets own
iteration is the 33 61 which has been
tuned for optimum performance between
500 and 3,000 dpi which is where rocket
claims 90% of gamers spend their time
the sensor will be available on the cone
EMP and the cone pure and the new
wireless leader which supposedly has
one-to-one accuracy between the mouse
motion and cursor movement on the screen
and we know that the sensor is very well
equipped to handle Wireless operation so
the leader is definitely in the high-end
for wireless mice and so the leader is
based off the tie on with some lighting
disabled for improved battery life but
it also promises to deliver all the
performance of this wired mouse within a
wildest form factor this means it's
supposed to deliver lag free experience
with virtually no latency and this is
supposed to be their response to
logitech's excellent G 900 and the Razer
Mamba mice to accomplish that it uses a
2.4 gigahertz Wireless band a thousand
Hertz polling rate to communicate with
this massive base station this way they
have done something a bit low-key but in
my eyes the dogs is just way too large
the base station allows the mouse to
rest vertically so we're like showcasing
the mouse when it's charging and
indicates real time Mouse charge as well
when the leader is not docked so I got
to use the mouse and play some csgo the
Mouse felt great I was surprised at how
light it felt for such a large body with
a built in battery but I'm not sure the
time frame is the best choice for
Wireless iteration as I prefer
personally a smaller mice for gameplay
the good thing to know about the
wireless expansion for mice is
acceptance from gamers of a fantastic
sensor performance and all you have to
worry about is really battery life which
spans around 20 hours so between charges
and if you don't
want wireless operation you can also use
the included USB cable for direct input
and so price is set to compete with the
G 900 as they are pretty much the same
sensor with different bodies the other
thing we saw it work out was the SQ
keyboard which is just a boring membrane
keyboard but with a little spice of
analog switches for woz and QE switches
and so these new membrane switches allow
for variable pressure to be used and
when used with supported games inputs
can be drastically affected so for
example a hard press would cause your
character to run likely holding down the
key will lead to like creeping along
while amid pressure hold will allow you
to simply walk and so these functions
can be mapped within Rocket's swarm
software and can be completely disabled
if necessary and also customized for
your preference so we tried this concept
out for some time in the game it was a
bit hard to get a handle on especially
since the three-level actuation don't
feel that great on the membrane switch
and obviously after playing games for
years introducing analog technology into
your movement on the keys presents a
unique challenges like learning to ride
a bicycle all over again
but it might be awesome for driving in
GTA v licking the car so you can cruise
around so you have a bit of speed
control but maybe completely useless in
many other games and so the s key with
pressure-sensitive switches will retail
for $100 while the less expensive sq+
without the analog inputs will go for
more affordable $79 which is still a bit
ridiculous for a non-mechanical keyboard
but hey some gamers still prefer how
membrane switches feel</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
