and we are on our way through our first
complex meeting with a soos because
after a decade they're launching a new
case we're very excited to check it out
hope you are too and huge shout out to
our sponsors coolermaster fantex and
Thermaltake for making this trip
possible
we finally made it to a soos hole okay
so this thing behind me looks like an
art installation of a frame with all
types of motherboards inside looks
freaking cool oMG I see it right there
the a soos tough enclosure okay it's so
beautiful beautiful texture airflow but
is it any good of course it is let's
check it out and as you can see that's
Freddy over there not bread ready read
there so fredericka renamed okay so
after ten years of hiatus the tough
gaming chassis the GT 501 is here the
estimate price point is 149 and
hopefully lower at launch but gt5 one
there's been a lot of 500 serious cases
am i right so this case is very much
military themed it has this armored
plating look that fits the tough
branding so that's not an issue at all
the front panel is steel and has this
cool texture that spans both the top and
the front and I've been asking for more
textures and so this is really good to
see hopefully we can even get like
accident color textures for the tough
branding but that of course is how far
in the future the top dust filter also
has this military pattern that could be
used for different color accents and the
tough logo is centered at the front I do
like the symmetrical look but the
angular design has some resemblance to
Coolermaster cases but from the looks of
it the ventilation is spaced out well
from the fans and allows lighting to
seep right through the top the case
comes with fabric handles I personally
love this edition so you can carry the
case around during assembly and for just
transportation of the case that just
becomes much easier you can also tighten
them so they are totally flat to the
case and are pretty low profile now
these fabric handles can handle the
weight of a fully assembled system we've
seen examples so that's not an issue
they're also removable and there's a
little Easter Egg on the mounting joint
with a little bit of Morse code that
spells tough my only point of feedback
would be that this whole grey and dark
color scheme lends itself well for
additional color accents so the handles
for example
some orange to go with the top branding
would actually be pretty sweet but of
course going with the darker theme is a
safer choice the IO is basic but for a
premium case like it I want to see at
least four USB ports and the type C port
is not present but let me know how you
feel about that because it's kind of an
expectation for 2018 release but I
personally never actually used a type C
port on any of my cases
so yeah the site PG panel is tented it's
pretty standard but to continue with
this military theme we have these dog
tags that you can use to open the screws
to unlock the panel and I do appreciate
the little details that surround the
whole tough branding and hopefully we'll
see more in the final release coming
inside we have a large interior so
there's a ton of space at the front EA
TX motherboards are supported that will
cover the first column of rubber
grommets but we have those three SSD
caddies on the side with appropriate
cutouts so you can use those to route
the motherboard cables for larger
motherboards although I do wish that the
SSD mounts were covered so this space
could look a bit cleaner because all
these openings are a bit more exposed
and they are thinking of paneling for
this section so hopefully it will kind
of match the whole interior design with
the final release the power supply
shroud is not final since it's all
plastic and has no mount for the
vertical GPU yet but it will be
removable and properly accommodate a 360
rod with enough clearance at the front
the only thing though is the hard drive
cage at the bottom it sticks out a
little bit it might introduce some
mounting challenges and finally the
cooling capacity standard you can do a
360 rather the front and the top the top
bracket is unfortunately non removable
but the case is pretty high for
push-pull and will arrive with three 140
millimeter fans and finally the cable
area behind the motherboard is fully
opened with a few velcro straps and
cable tie points around the perimeter I
do think that cable channels would be
nice here since working on a flat plain
can be challenging but at least the
spacing is pretty wide between the side
panel and for storage we get two caddies
in the drive cage and two more side
caddies for SSDs and three and a half
inch drives so that's a pretty common
layout and it's actually pretty exciting
to have a new case brand entering the
market
that are trying to do something a little
bit different particularly with that
tough branding so military-themed
paneling different little Easter eggs
and little cool accessories for the
whole lineup and I'm really excited to
see how that entire ecosystem of tough
products can kind of merge together and
you know complement each other down the
line and so the GT 501 is not totally
unique but obviously they're still
taking feedback the case is set to
launch in August so there's a bit of
time so let us know what you think about
the enclosure and their whole direction
for the interior that whole expansion
with the side SSD caddies and how would
you like to see it changed and you know
particularly for the power supply shroud
because that is not yet final but yeah
let me know what you think of this new
tough case I'm Dimitri thanks so much
for watching our Computex video check
out this other relevant stuff here
we'll see you
