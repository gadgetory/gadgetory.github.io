great technology selection and service
hey guys Eber here with hurricane axe
and in every key board review we
mentioned how saturated the market is
you either focus on design or release a
new switch to attract attention and
SteelSeries with this new keyboard has
done both meet the SteelSeries apex M
800 mechanical gaming keyboard that
retails for surprisingly high and most
likely white won't sell $200 price I
mean we have a wide range of Corsair and
coolermaster keyboards that cost south
of 150 dollars so at first sign the m855
x didn't quite match our expectations
the plastic exterior feels cheap that's
also a huge fingerprint magnet and
compared to robust plastic or even
Lumina MEMS found on competing gaming
keyboards the flexing frame will
seriously hinder the appeal of the m808v
used to adjust the height of the
keyboard although without a compartment
to store the extras SteelSeries also
includes a set of key caps that you can
replace for OS 10 Yosemite since the
apex is Mac friendly although they
haven't included a key puller plus the
proprietary and virgin nature of the
switch means key cap customization is
off limits for now I found the enlarged
space bar a huge bonus for FBS shooters
as the pressure point is pretty
consistent throughout plus the new
mechanical switch complements easier
actuations as I noticed my thumb to be
less tired after gaming compared to my
Corsair k95 at the front you'll find two
USB 2.0 ports that can be used for
connecting other peripherals like a
gaming mouse or even charge mobile
devices the cable is weighted and it
ends with two USB plugs it comes with a
proper logo at the tip to help
differentiate between other cables that
you may have plugged in into your
machine there are six programmable
macros located on the far left side of
the keyboard which can be assigned
through the driver software the media
playback keys are assigned with the
function keys with play pause skip track
and volume adjust considering how large
the apex is we
I prefer dedicated media buttons instead
so this keyboard is a big deal because
of one thing a new mechanical switches
emerged the qs1 switch developed by
Steel series it's advertised to be 25%
smoother than a typical MX cherry switch
actuations felt lunch faster than MX red
switches since the travel distance is
only 3 millimeters compared to 4 on MX
red and actuation point at 1.5
millimeters compared to 2 on MX red it
requires 45 grams of actuation force and
the switch is linear
there's no clicky feedback to tell when
your registration occurs but the fast
response and super-quick bounds all
account for satisfactory fingers it
doesn't feel like a mechanical switch
though it actually kind of reminds me of
a membrane keyboard but with redesign
mechanics for longitude and eliminate
all the mushy and sticky problems you
experience with the membrane the keys
are extremely low-profile and I have to
mention how quiet they are compared to
my K 95 they are by far the quietest
mechanical switches I've experienced
let's take a listen moving on the
lighting system on the apex screams
attention this is by far the most in
depth color customization on a keyboard
we've ever reviewed you can change the
color of every individual key
so creating gaming zones productivity
zones or writing zones with only
preferred keys let-up is awesome
these LEDs have received the RGB
treatment with sixteen point eight
million colors and the LED is
centralized to eliminate that common
brightness grading found on MX switches
and overall quality of vibrance and
brightness is fantastic plus the subtle
side lighting and the logo can change
color as well that looks gorgeous there
are multiple color templates to choose
from for different patterns but some of
my favorites includes the disco mode
vertical wave down and even an American
flag pattern than truly represents the
custom nature of this backlight all this
can be configured within the SteelSeries
Engine 3
software that acts as a main hub for all
SteelSeries peripherals you are greeted
with a very clean and simple design with
a physical layer of the keyboard in the
center and the adjustable settings on
both the left and right sides
you can assign macros to any key on the
keyboard thanks to the built-in dual Phi
coprocessors although the six dedicated
macro buttons are there for a reason but
it's still awesome to see SteelSeries
not restrict this customization the
macro editor is a useful tool if you
want to make changes to your macro
setting the illumination tab is where I
spend most of my time playing around
with lighting patterns and flexible
customization as I mentioned earlier you
can personalize each and every key of
the colour to your choice with a
plethora of lighting effects so
SteelSeries has bought as one hell of an
expensive keyboard sure the new qs1
switch is an almost perfect hybrid
between a membrane key but with proper
mechanics for 16 million keystrokes the
switch is incredibly quiet that we
consider a major positive plus not
skimping out on lighting customization
is appreciated really the major
complaint we have is the build quality
for the price it's not at all what we
were expecting for $200 and I'm hoping
sting series will take a hint and also
focus on compact more robust version of
the apex to be released in near future
we like the new switch but we're hoping
for a more aggressive entrance to
compete against the MX cherry offerings
while that concludes our review of the
SteelSeries apex in 800 let us know what
you think about the keyboard and what
you will see in the appropriate price
point for this product thanks for
