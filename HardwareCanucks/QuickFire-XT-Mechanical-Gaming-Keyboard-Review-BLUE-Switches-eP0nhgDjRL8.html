back to another Eric Knox review when it
comes to mechanical keyboards I think
it's a pretty much a no-brainer if you
main purpose is gaming the key bounce is
much improved from the standard rubber
dome switches which contributes to
better response time in game quick fire
keyboards from coolermaster storm have
gained the reputation for very
minimalistic form factor giving us the
basics without any bells and whistles
and the quick fire XT is a good
alternative for those wanting tactile
response because the booth switches the
quick fire XT is one of the more
expensive keyboards which at over $100
may be a turn-off considering a very
similar competition from SteelSeries is
significantly cheaper and the XT is not
far from the K 70 from Corsair so this
pricing aggression may not be in favor
for this product so the XT is a very
compact keyboard with just over 1 inches
in height and a very comfortable angle
for the keys plus add in the touchable
USB cable and this makes it an ideal
candidate for on-the-go gamers taking a
closer look at the keyboard an internal
steel frame reinforces the construction
and as you can see I'm applying quite a
bit of force and there's almost no flag
so we're very happy with the build
quality there are four rubber pads at
the bottom with height adjustment now
the problem is the rubber is bound to
leave markings which is quite unpleasant
function keys have been fitted with the
F keys which I personally like is that
minimizes the frame size which is matte
black covered in a slightly rubberized
coating and we also have a Windows key
lock to avoid quitting during game the
lettering on the keys is bold and quite
easy to read although a little too bulky
for my taste
quick-fire xt also comes with an extra
set of WASD keys and a little tool to
remove the caps the problem is that you
have the exact same texture as the
default keys making them useless in
terms of functionality and since there's
no backlight the red color is purely for
aesthetics you can further customize
both windows keys with included caps and
quite frankly the premium price tag is
really not worth it for such pointless
little perks that do not hold any
functionality so the XT comes in a
variety
of MX cherry switches we have the blue
the red green and brown the blue offer
and audible and tactile feedback which
for typing is very pleasant you can
really listen to how speedy your fingers
can be but for gaming I personally
cannot maneuver as well as with the red
switches that's because you need to
almost live here entire finger off the
key for it to bounce back which was
quite annoying especially for the
spacebar also gaming when the blue
switches is slightly louder than with
the Reds so I certainly appreciate the
multiple switches options available with
the XD a ps2 to USB adapter is included
for full key rollover otherwise up to
six keys are registered in USB mode of
course the main gaming purpose for the
XT will be FPS as there are no
programmable buttons but I don't know
about you guys but I'm a huge fan of
this minimalistic style and so to wrap
things up the quick-fire XD offers a
very compact form factor with a
removable USB cable great build quality
and the variety of MX cherry switches
however missing backlight and even an
armrest makes you question the price
plus the additional key caps are of no
functionality as they should have been
textured now if you are an order of
mechanical keyboard let us know which MX
cherry switches you prefer make sure to
like this video for a chance to win one
of the quickfire XD keyboards and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
