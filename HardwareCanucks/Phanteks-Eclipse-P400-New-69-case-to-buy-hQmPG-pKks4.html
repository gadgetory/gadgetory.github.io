great technology selection and service
it seems with every new case release
fantex has always seemed to deliver an
outstanding product you could say
they're leading the pack when it comes
to innovative case features and we have
their pre-production case the new
Eclipse P 400 priced at $69 and a $10
premium for the silent Edition it's a
start of a new series which I think will
focus on budget-friendly catalogue and
will be launched in February we have
received a pre-production sample which
has a few minor imperfections like the
missing fantex logo on the front panel
and there's also no accessory box but
that will all be solved any final
release I think this is the first fantex
case that isn't easily distinguished to
follow with the brand in terms of
aesthetics
despite this ironman feel front panel
and plain boxy features for the rest at
the top you'll find the magnetic dust
filter spending the entirety of the dual
140 or 120 mm their fan mounts in terms
of the i/o the p400 features dual USB
three ocellated power button and these
two discreet buttons underneath the top
panel where on the buttons is for reset
while the other changes the color of the
underglow and the power button with
plenty of colors to choose from now we
have seen multicolor LED installations
on fantex cases in the past and I'm
happy they've included them on the P 400
and this is also where the fan Tech's
logo would be installed plus we have an
extra LED port included inside the case
if you'd want to add an extra strip
which fantex sells separately I love how
easy it is to remove the front panel
which reveals a flexible mounting system
for triple 120 millimeters or dual 140
millimeter fans with a total of two
120mm fans included inside the case the
panel is quite deep to avoid choking the
fence and both entry points at the top
and bottom are covered with these
removable dust filters it's nice to see
fantex taking the feedback from the
users and making sure that all front
intake area is fully covered although
with these areas being quite small
routine cleaning will be definitely
required to keep those fans clear the
side panel here is pretty standard
nothing fancy around and you guys have
for it so here's the Opie nail scratch
test is back and guess what the panel
survived with no visible marks so you
can take off those felt gloves when
handling the side panel although I do
have one minor complaint regarding the
metal surface which reveals absolutely
all of the handling marks which hasn't
been an issue in the past and fantex are
aware of that and they will be rolling
out with a new powder coat on the black
version to make it less sensitive to
fingerprints coming inside the two
things you notice is a completely closed
off power supply chamber Plus that
fantex plaque is nowhere to be found
unlike on many of their previous cases
which I would consider to be the staple
and no included hard drive brackets for
the main chamber which is kind of a
bummer however there are plenty of small
details to keep us happy like the self
secure thumb screws on both side panels
a very convenient this is the bracket
behind the mobile tray although only one
is included with two standard drive
caddies in the front of the chamber it's
basically an identical layout to the
enthu pro m but shorter in height
they've still included these amazing
velcro straps for cable management at
the back ventilated floor for the power
supply chamber in case the graphics
cards is very close to there and the
front piece is removable to allow a 360
millimeter radiator to fit that is if
the bottom drive cage is also removed I
really like this approach and this is
one of the best interior designs to
exist on a met hour today also to
differentiate this case from the n3 pro
M the installation of a radiator at the
top of the case would require a low
profile ram and heat sinks so instead
our h15 went to the front of the case
with perfect clearance away from the
motherboard
although blocking all of the potential
for drive caddies cable management was
absolutely simple despite not having any
rubber grommets and you can seriously
clean up very fast without hassle on
interior and I appreciate that we have
large and accessible cutouts right below
the motherboard so it is when we come to
the back that I wish more things would
have stayed the same on the one hand you
have so much space and that power supply
shroud to hide everything so you
basically don't really need to do any
magic when it comes to cable management
but on the other hand there are zero
cable tie hoops on the right
side of that SSD bracket which makes
securing that Aten table impossible as
there is nothing to loop the cable ties
through over although the new Eclipse
p400 holds married for a great interior
with one of the best user experiences in
terms of assembly they're clearly trying
to compete with the likes of the NZXT
s340 within this price range and that's
totally healthy in my opinion so wait
out until February for fantex to yet
again release a great enclosure one that
separates itself very well from the more
expensive pack but without crucial
sacrifices on features but I only wish
we have a second SSD bracket included by
default then this will be my budget pic
for 2016 so are you in the market for a
new case let us know if you think the
Eclipse p400 is worthy of consideration
or why not in the comments down below
and make sure to subscribe for our full
review of this and the silent Edition
case when they're launched in February
