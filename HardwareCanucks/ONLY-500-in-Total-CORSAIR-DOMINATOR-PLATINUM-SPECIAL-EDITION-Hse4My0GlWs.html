huge thanks to our Computex sponsors for
sending us out here
shout out to Nvidia fantex and CI X and
MSI the new Corsa memory is actually
pretty cool it features an LED top bar
is going to be controlled through the
corsair link so the light is going to be
controllable with brightness the
patterns the fade effects with four
modules and the cool thing is there are
no additional wires so you don't have to
connect the LED to anything else on the
motherboard it's all controlled through
the let me check the SM bus which is the
system memory bus so this be the first
memory of its kind that you can actually
control LEDs from which is awesome you
know you have the competition from FX
here which is which is awesome Ram when
you have different types of lighting
effects but there's no control so that
sometimes it can be a little sporadic
and so with this one the fact that you
can control the pattern of movement of
the LEDs and the fact that you can
select between one to four modules I
think that's really cool so that for
people that like just lighting to be
static they can have that without any of
the movement and things and still have a
really awesome looking you know
motherboard area then the second memory
is the Dominator platinum special
edition there will only be five hundred
kits produced which is quite limited
quantities for both Chrome and The
Blackout versions for the color they
have an aluminum top plate with LED
which are white versus the white and red
for the vengeance LED so you have a
little bit more color variation with the
vengeance LED series but the Dominator
platinum is cool because each model kit
out of the 500 will have laser engraving
on each DRAM module so you'll know
exactly what number of the 500 other
lucky people so they are ddr4 at 3200
megahertz so past Ram so it's basically
like lpx memory underneath the vengeance
LED ddr4 and the Dominator platinum is
the more high-end really cool looking
dims with aluminum top piece and this
additional lit top bar another product
is behind me the Hydra GFX GTX 1080 so
it's a collaboration with
ms:i and Corsair we've seen this in the
past before so it's using the 855 cooler
the card is the provided from MSI looks
like it's a standard reference founders
Edition GT X 1080 without any bin chips
but we're told it of course temperatures
will be much better and hopefully the
clocks will be also higher given the
card is provided from MSI so now let's
go check out the fans
the next thing we're gonna talk about
are these fans the magnetic levitation
fans the ML series from Corsair the ML
120 Pro and ML 140 Pro so 120 140
versions these are actually pretty
unique because they're using a different
type of bearing so that when the fan is
on its elevated and there is zero
contact friction so the fan blades and
bearing actually is not touching
anything while it's in the air there's a
little pocket of air well cushion of air
that's preventing there's any friction
so the only noise that's from that's
generated by these fans is through the
the friction of air and that makes them
extremely quiet compared to competition
I guess and also without compromising on
the RPM so there's quite fast or 2,000
rpm there's fiberglass reinforced
plastic frame which is awesome and
rubber sound dick dampening with red
blue and white corners and also LEDs the
next set of fans is the SP 120 RGB and
HD 120 RGB with 1400 RPM and 1800 RPM
respectively so the SP 120 is the warmer
lower end or more standard one so it's
got the one hub with four LEDs so we
need to push this button controller for
color animation and speed and each
controller can connect up to six fans
which is awesome and these this series
of fans has fluid dynamic bearings while
the HD 120 RGB has 12 zone full control
LEDs with eight animations PWM fan
control and the cool thing about those
fans is that you can control the fan
speed without affecting the LED power so
they're controlled independently guys
I'm Dimitri with our Canucks libras
behind the camera ashes here
entertaining me we'll see you in next
