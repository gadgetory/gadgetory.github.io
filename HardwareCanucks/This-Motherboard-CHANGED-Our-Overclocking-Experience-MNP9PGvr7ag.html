hardware connects and today is gonna be
an interesting day because I will be
swapping out the motherboard on my
existing X 299 workstation PC to
something a little bit more robust so if
you do recall about a few months ago I
think we did a build sponsored by Intel
featuring pretty much every hind
component out there including an 18 core
processor with a lot of with two gtx
980ti s and just maxed out stuff but
after then I've been using this PC for
editing because you know it's 18 cores
who want to say no to that right and one
of the things that I've run into is of
course with the motherboard so I've been
using or we decided to go with an MSI x2
99m gaming carbon pro AC motherboard and
one of the bottlenecks or I guess one of
the issues that we had with that
motherboard was the VRMs weren't capable
enough to overclock
the 18 core processor because I tried it
but just is to see if I can push it
above 3.5 gigahertz or even hit the 3.5
gigahertz overclocking setting but
unfortunately I wasn't because the VRMs
just got way too hot and so it just
wasn't able to overclock the 18 core
processor fast forward to Computex we
were at the EVGA booth checking out some
cool stuff and something really caught
our attention it was this guy right over
here the X 299 micro ATX version 2 and
what's really interesting about this
motherboard is obviously first and
foremost it is a micro ATX form factor
but most importantly it features active
cooling for the VRMs that means I would
be able to overclock my 18 core
processor so the objective for this
video is to keep the components
identical so that includes the cooling
solution the case the graphics card the
memory and storage stuff exactly where
they are except for the motherboard and
we will be swapping out of that
component with this guy so let the
teardown process begin but first a quick
message from our sponsor the new t46
caliber ddr4 memory is one unique RGB
kit with awesome light spill from each
module and the special edition has a
cool totem design on the light bar you
get lifetime warranty up to 4,000
megahertz speeds and full lighting
control through the software check out
the t46 caliber ram
down below
how are I good people so the swapping
process is complete but now it's time to
see if the system actually builds
because you never know I might have
screwed something up while installing
the CPU or the RAM or anything like that
but fingers crossed this actually works
here we go it works actually works well
fans are actually blasting a blade but I
guess that has to do with I might have
to go into the BIOS and change the fan
profile but this is this is news to me
because I always screw up something so
this is awesome well after spending the
majority of the day playing around with
the EVGA BIOS I was finally able to
overclock the core i nine 79-80 Extreme
Edition processor to 4.3 gigahertz and
1.15 volts now I leave the rest the
overclocking settings somewhere in the
video down here so you can actually see
those for yourselves but this is
fabulous to me this is great news in my
opinion because being able to achieve
that kind of clock speed on all 18 cores
consistently is just awesome
I mean being a nerd here it's just it
really does show something in terms of
where we are in terms of technology and
how far we've come now I did make sure
to run a few stress tests and concerns
to ability so the first thing I did was
of course run the Adobe Media encoder
test to see if those cloud speeds were
consistent and that was in fact true I
did notice I didn't notice any dumb
clocks or anything like that
while I was rendering a video which is
great and the only thing that I would
mention is that I had my AV x offset set
to 3 so if you're hammering the CP or in
my case if I were to you know stressed
as a CPU at 100% on all 18 cores then I
can expect clock speeds to go to 4
gigahertz that's something that I'm okay
with moving on to temperatures and I
definitely expected a drastic increase
in that department because you know when
you overclock a CPU and the obvious
drawback or I guess one of the
compromises if you need to take is the
increase in terms of temperatures in my
case I was rendering a 4k video or using
Adobe Media encoder and my low temps
were around 50 C at stock settings
compared to 78 degree Celsius when the
CPU is overclocked at four point three
gigahertz it's not too bad especially if
you think about this form factor because
I'm using the X 62
a cooler from NZXT and a push-pull
configuration so you know getting that
kind of temps and their micro ATX
chassis is pretty awesome I also want to
touch base on power draw and this is an
important factor for me personally
because I live in Toronto Canada and I
pay one of the highest hydro rates so
you know being able to find a system
that can be as efficient but also not
consume a lot of power is also something
on my wish list when it comes to
building the optimized workstation PC
and this is certainly not for that as
you can see under stock settings the
system draws around 400 watts and with
the 4.3 gigahertz
overclock the system drew around 520
watts which is ridiculous so does that
mean that I'll be sticking with this
external PC in the long term no because
I do intend to explore the coffee lake
ecosystem which is a lot more power
efficient in my opinion but it's also
for the fact that you know with the
recent update with Adobe Premiere Pro it
actually takes advantage of the
integrated graphics chip on the
processor as well as the discrete
graphics card to accelerate rendering
performance so I'm really curious to
test out and compare the 8700 K to the
18 core processor and see which one's
faster and more efficient especially
when it comes to cooling and of course
power drop because I really don't want
to pay those expensive hydro rates now
that being said allow me to showcase
some benchmarks that I ran on this
system with both the stock settings and
overclock settings so I'm not kicking
some foot Cinebench at stock we got a
score of roughly 33 57 when compared to
42 13 on the overclocked 18 core
processor at four point three gigahertz
again a massive improvement in terms of
performance right over there the same
story goes when it comes to blender as
well so I did run the BMW render scene
and the system had stock settings took
two minutes and 22 seconds compared to a
minute and 57 seconds on the old clock
setting at 4.3 gigahertz I do want to
mention that this PC isn't really geared
towards gaming or just external and in
general you're much better off investing
that money into XIII 70 series or even
the Rison platform because you're gonna
be saving a lot or getting a lot in
terms of value so I'd really plan on
running in gaming benchmarks just
because it just wouldn't make any sense
but here just for tests
purposes Iran 3dmark fire strike extreme
test and I got roughly 13,000 on the
overclock setting compared to 12,500
with the stock saying so it's not a
drastic improvement right there which is
it to be expected and the last test here
is rendering performance in fact it's
one of the reasons why I wanted to
switch from the MSI motherboard to the
EVGA board and see if the overclock
would actually make a difference in
terms of rendering so I took a 16 minute
4k project in this case it was the
cooler master of hmmmmm case review
video you can check it out right over
here if you're interested but I took the
16 minute video and I rendered it to the
YouTube 4k or using YouTube 4 k % with
Adobe Media encoder and it stock
settings the system took 14 minutes and
40 seconds to complete that task when
compared to 11 minutes and 27 seconds
with the overclocked setting at four
point three gigahertz it is a
significant improvement in my opinion
because when we try overclocking on the
MSI board we really didn't see a drastic
difference in terms of rendering so this
is definitely a win win and I want to
wrap things up by discussing some of the
drawbacks with this EVGA x2 19
motherboard the first one is the lack of
a multiple nvme inductive slots so this
particular motherboard only comes with
one of them so I was I had to sacrifice
my scratch drive that I was using so
that was kind of a disappointment the
second being it doesn't come with a USB
3.1 gen2 type-c port so I wasn't able to
hook up my WD hard drive or my W
external storage array to this
motherboard now it did come with a type
C to type a cable which obviously solves
the issue but if you're someone who uses
if you have external devices that use a
USB type-c interface then you might find
this a bit frustrating and I cannot
forget to talk about the active cooling
solution for the V RMS take a listen to
this
so as you heard that's something that I
have to deal with especially during
rendering times I can see or can hear
those fans ramp up because you know it's
basically utilizing all 18 cores at 4.3
gigahertz so definitely keep them in
mind don't expect the best acoustic
performance if you're trying to build an
ultimate compact extranet system with
this particular motherboard it's just
not going to happen so I hope you took
away something from this video in fact
it was an interesting experience for me
swapping the MSI motherboard with EBG
board I definitely did not expect the
system to boot right away because I
always screw something up in between and
I have to obviously go back and
troubleshoot but I'm glad everything
worked out just fine in fact I'm very
happy with the overclock because 4.3
gigahertz on all 18 course is
unimaginable it's the first time I'm
looking at something like this because
it really is awesome but I can't wait to
test out the 87 and can of course testy
coffee League platform to see how it
does in terms of rendering performance
and compared to this guy right over here
so definitely stay tuned for that in
fact if you're interested in this
comparison let me know in the comments
