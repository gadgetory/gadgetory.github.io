crackle design maturity fans not just
for computers oops
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with
hard-working accent for today's review
we've got something very special from a
company called street comm so they
specialize in unique aluminum designs
their target markets are not exactly
gaming enthusiasts builders but instead
someone who appreciates the form and
simplicity of an enclosure this is the
street comp F 12 C and before you might
get turned off about the $275 price
point the company's mission here is to
focus on highest quality materials and
finish and I sincerely appreciate the
fantastic build quality of this
enclosure the entire structure is made
of premium grade four millimeter
aluminum with refined edges rounded
corners and everything is so well put
together but the caveat here is the
unique interior layout is challenging to
work in and therefore the F of C is
targeted for users tired of that
conventional case and are looking for
something fresh and perhaps for even a
challenge
so the first surprising thing about the
case is the front a yo or actually bill
hack of it the front panel is completely
bare aside from the illuminate power
switch and a window for an optional IR
receiver given this landscape
orientation and the beautiful design the
f12 C is more suited as a living room PC
so the omission of any front USB port is
confusing also there are no 5 the
quarter inch drive base no way to put
the case standing like so even though
look at how fantastic this looks the
rubberized aluminum feet are screwed in
but removable and unless modded to have
the feet underneath the tower you are
limited to this lying orientation all
the sides are the sprue with these
clever filters it's a two-piece mount
having a metal outer piece to
magnetically press the filter underneath
that is held in place with these pegs so
the filter doesn't slide around the
triple filter at the top looks great and
is completely flush against the panel
they sit securely in place yet can be
quickly removed if needed for cleaning
at the back we find appropriate cutouts
for standard ATX power supply
motherboard i/o and
seven PCI slots to get inside the case
you have these two thumb screws that you
turn in one direction to unmount the
panel and it's a very clever system with
a built-in nut on the interior to keep
the exterior completely clean the only
gripe I have here is once you unscrew
the thumb screws the panel is a little
bit difficult to pick up and lift off
unless you sort of nail your way into
the liftoff edge but I found removing
the filter to grab a hold of the panel
to be the most convenient method inside
this is what's freaking was talking
about when they mentioned a challenging
process for assembly as you can see
there is no compartment separation there
isn't even a back panel to remove so
what you see here is where you'll be
working the dual rail in the center
supports triple 90 to dual 120 or 140 mm
they're fans with maximum 240mm radiator
clearance this means you can configure
the width between the two brackets to
complement your desired fan mount
there's also plenty of ventilation
underneath the motherboard tray
but the real unique aspect of the
interior are these brackets street comm
labels them as universal brackets this
has got to be the most innovative way to
move Hardware inside a chassis so this
is how they work first the bracket has
multiple mounting cutouts for drives
fans radiators reservoirs or hid really
anything you can fit on the bracket the
second piece of the puzzle is the
retention clip accompanying each of 80
Universal brackets to mount multiple
three and a half inch drives you place
them in order make sure they're straight
and screw in both brackets and the
shipping the system it is recommended to
attach a third one on the other side for
stability and you can mount four in
total for this type of assembly and it's
the same idea for multiple SSDs
however single drives can also be
mounted vertically three and a half inch
drives as well and here is a 120mm fan
mounted on the dual brackets giving
users total flexibility in theory of how
many drives and fans they want to
populate inside the f12 C now here you
insert the bottom end into the low
channel inside the case and use the
retention bracket to
Curia main bracket in place this is by
far the most impressive Tula's design
that I've seen and it's relatively easy
to master and so starting with the
assembly I got the tall motherboard
standoffs installed mounted our micro
ATX reference system with the radiator
in the middle bracket that works great
to save on space and have some fans set
to exhaust but then I finally ended up
with this configuration to show how
cable management is handled the 240
moment of radiator I mounted on the side
with the space in front the power supply
occupied by the only intake fan here and
less amount more in the middle top
bracket that can also support three and
a half inch drives and I installed two
there and right off the bat you realize
just how little cable management support
there is inside the f12 C there are no
included clips no zip ties no dedicated
channels to route your cables it's all
left for the user and I was able to
clean this up to best of my abilities
and I realized that if you had a full
sized ATX motherboard getting the
radiator installed on that one side like
you see here would be impossible due to
limited clearance and also notice how
there is no ventilation holes above the
motherboard IO this means you're limited
to either an all-in-one water cooler or
a CPU heatsink with a downward fan as
there is plenty of ventilation on the
top panel and so then I came to another
realization that this setup does not
make sense as there's nowhere to mount
an SSD and three and a half inch drives
on the middle rail are extremely
uncomfortable so I began to tear down
thinking with a smaller system inside
the case I would have more options for
storage so I installed my triple
mechanical drive array which is fairly
spaced out away from the GPU but still
covers all five other PCI slots which
means no sli system for you if your hard
drive is installed on this side of the
case I also mounted a triple SSD array
right behind the mechanical storage only
to realize that my micro ATX port can
only support four SATA drives which is
the case with most micro ATX boards and
so then imagine the night
mirror of having to route your SATA
power and data cables to those tight
spots or needing to replace one of the
drives and also check out this massive
empty spot in front of the motherboard
that could potentially house one of the
drive arrays but the rail mounting
system is not on this side it's only on
the opposite sides of the motherboard
which means for mini-itx systems this
entire space is pretty much wasted and
so here is the bottom line
I feel Street comms mission is excellent
we need diversity we need high quality
materials and finishes and we need
innovative modular pieces but on the
flip side of that coin how much
functionality do you sacrifice to be
unique there was a clear priority on the
elegance factor as the chassis is
absolutely beautiful and you are given a
choice of how you move things around
inside the case but what would have been
fantastic is orientation choice as I
love this tower look and more mounting
links right behind the front panel so
you have extra options despite all that
though the biggest challenge here is
cable management as there's absolutely
no way to tidy up your cables unless you
go in and mount your own clips or
reroute some cables behind the
motherboard or talk to them underneath
some fans or something like that but
that's not really the solution even
though there's a closed side panel I
want to know I want to feel like my job
where the system assembly has been
complete when I'm satisfied with cable
management and we already knew that the
f12 C would be a challenging case to
work in I mean streak I'm admitted that
themselves but I really wish that there
was some type of cable management system
in place to give more points for this
premium aluminum chassis and make it a
bit more user friendly and that
concludes this review we hope you
enjoyed now the main question is I use a
type of builder who would appreciate the
f12 C and what it has to offer in the
elegance department and the build
quality department and be able to be
okay with the fact that there's some
functionality elements missing so let us
