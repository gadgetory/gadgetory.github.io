another Intel processor launch so this
is the 18 core 36 threaded core I $9.99
80 extreme edition CPU and it's gonna
set you back $2,000
let's be honest this thing is geared
towards a very specific niche so let's
cut to the chase and discuss why exactly
this exists in the currency of the
market right after this
hello I'm looking for some fans well are
you married yeah
I have a ring what is your favorite
number I would say 3 do I have the
perfect fan for you this is the new
thermal tech ring trio 12 fans with good
static pressure for radiators it is a
beautiful frame with double side and
center ring illumination with soft and
super bright spill with razor chrome and
compatibility control it through your
smartphone the RGB plus software on the
PC or Amazon Alexa well I'm gonna take
these home perhaps you should to check
them out in description below alright so
first things first don't start thinking
that these new 9000 series names with
these new high-end CPUs means a
completely new architecture because
they're not in fact Intel is still using
the same underlying 14 nanometer
static-x design because there hasn't
been a significant or there hasn't been
any significant changes from when those
CPUs were launched more than a year ago
as a matter of fact Intel is calling
these new CPUs products formerly known
as skylake instead of giving them a new
name now right away you can see that the
I $9.99 ATX e99 60 X and e99 40 X will
be direct replacements for the older
generation they come with some frequency
increases optimizations to cache and
soldered Tim that's supposed to lower
temperatures oh and they have exactly
the same prices I do have to mention
that Intel has revised turbo management
on the cpus they're now able to hit
higher sustained clocks for longer
periods of time particularly when all
cores are used and that's one of the
reasons why the 99 80 XE base clock has
increased by 400 megahertz just note
that the maximum turbo 3.0 rate has only
increased by a hundred megahertz across
the board looking at the 99 20x and
things start to get in
sting it has more smart cash and also
offers a huge 600 megahertz base clock
boost versus the 79 20x but those
increases come at a cost of higher power
consumption pricing remains at $1,200
and guys that's still really expensive
when you figure the AMD 2950 X goes for
around $900 when we start looking at the
other new skylake
X processors there's some weird stuff
happening with specifications and
pricing but I think that's to make sure
that Intel's 900k has some room the 9900
ex keeps the 1700 X's thousand dollar
price but it gets a ton more cash and a
bit higher clock speeds now the 98 20x
is a really odd CPU and I have to wonder
why it's even around it has the same 10
core layout as C 9900 X but it has lower
clock speeds and cost just $100 less
sure it doesn't offer a lot more than
the 78 20x and it actually has 44 CPU
PCI lanes but what's the use of this
processor I just don't get it
the additional PC a capability cores and
cache are awesome but that price is just
way too high as usual Intel dangles a
carrot in front of you and then hits you
with a stake I actually think the 9800 X
is the 78 20 X is real replacement since
it also goes for around $600 but with
the 1900 K around on a less expensive
platform the only benefit I see here
would be running full-speed dual GPU
solutions alright guys so you now know
what the whole new lineup is all about
but I have to be a bit critical on how
Intel's approaching this launch
you see they sent us this you know $2000
18 core monstrosity instead of sending
as the lower tier variants within the
Refresh skylake excellent because I feel
like those CPUs are a little bit more
interesting to me personally considering
that there's so lower-priced when you
compare to what AMD sample says they
send us everything from the 32 core all
the way down to the 12 core variants so
that it gives us a full picture on what
AMD is offering for their price and it
seems like Intel solely wants us to
focus on their super expensive flagship
component and I think that's a huge
mistake because it gives us whole lineup
and all priced feel now you might
actually end up buying those other CPUs
for more in-depth testing but it just
would have been nice to have the full
picture right at launch now before I get
into the bench
I want to explain some of the results
you are about to see here we first
noticed some odd performance since the
1980s see wasn't hitting Intel's stated
frequencies but after updating the Intel
IME and turbo 3.0 drivers the system
behaved like we expected let's start
with the 1980 XE during a long blender
test basically it's hitting a pretty
constant 3.8 gigahertz and remember the
base clock here is supposed to be three
gigahertz
but there's extra thermal Headroom since
the Noctua Nhu 14s kept temperatures
below seventy five degrees Celsius that
meant until turbo technology could bump
frequencies while it tried to hit
maximum power input it's pretty cool
stuff
now moving on to prime95 and the results
here are very different from blender
here the CPU was still around 75 degrees
Celsius but it also just had three point
three gigahertz
that's because prime also stressed the
cache and memory controllers instead of
focusing on just a CPU cores and FPU
units like blender this causes the CPU
package to hit its power limit so even
though there's thermal Headroom clock
speeds are lower I also ran a quick
single core test and you can see that
the turbo boost 3.0 is working exactly
as advertised with clocks at about 4.5
gigahertz pretty often so that's what's
happening behind the scenes guys and I
know a lot of you guys in our previous
video mentioned that you wanted to see
the full set up so here it is now as
you're watching or as you're going
through these benchmarks I do want to
mention that other than the non stock
memory speeds we made sure to turn off
all motherboard enhancements during all
these tests
so there you guys have it and I have to
say the performance increases on the 980
XE over the 79 ad XE can be impressive
in the right circumstances now the issue
is that the improvements are a bit
narrowly focused on multi-core
enhancements so this could potentially
be beneficial for professionals who
would like to take advantage of you know
who'd like the most amount of cores at
the higher clock speeds but you know for
things like gaming and photo editing
it's it's honestly or it's just pretty
much impossible for me to recommend the
99 80 XC or just any sky like X CPUs at
the moment you're actually much better
off investing in a coffee like CPU or
even a second-generation Rison processor
the other issue with the 99 ad XE is
that it seems to operate without even
acknowledging the 2950 X now I get it
that processor has four less threads but
it's $1100 less I'll repeat that
it's $1100 cheaper but for those
professionals who need every ounce of
multi-tier performance to save time on
renderings or increased productivity the
1980 XE may be beneficial but then again
there's also the thirty-two core thread
repair 2990 WX which also costs less
than this thing and what about power
consumption well this CPU is a hungry
boy since Intel's 40 nanometer process
is having some issues keeping up with
aim these 12 nanometer technology 344
watts is a lot of juice guys and the
last thing that I want to mention here
is pricing because these Intel CPUs
rarely hit the price that they give us
right before lunch and the blame for
that can obviously be shared between the
retailers and Intel but it's funny how
aimed these products you know the
pricing remains consistent with both
reviews and retailers so you know under
saying so that's pretty much it guys and
I just want to leave you guys with a
little preview on where our journey with
this processor will go next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
