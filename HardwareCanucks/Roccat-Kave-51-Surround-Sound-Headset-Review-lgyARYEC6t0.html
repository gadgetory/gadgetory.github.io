great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry and welcome back
to another or her ik NOx review it is
certainly true that surround sound can
not only provide a more immersed gaming
experience but also allow you to
pinpoint where your enemies are around
you so you can be prepared of what's
coming around the corner we've seen a
lot of headsets that try to simulate
surround sound through software but what
happens when you place individual
drivers in each ear cup to represent
true 5.1 surround sound that's where the
rocket cave comes in a gaming headset
that cost $120 given each ear cup has
individual drivers you will need a
compatible 5.1 channel sound card either
on your motherboard or dedicated one
aside from the 3.5 millimeter jack the
desktop remote connects through a USB
and acts as an amp so regardless of how
good your sound card may be it
ultimately passes through the remote and
unfortunately produces a very quiet but
distinguishable hiss regardless of the
volume level using the desktop remote
you can control each channel adjust
total volume mute either the mic or the
headphone and switch between movie and
game mode the desktop remote
realistically will act as a volume knob
as after setting up each channel you
probably won't be touching that again
alright so now on to the headset itself
the matte black and rubberized surface
is really awesome the build quality is
impressive the hinges are made of
aluminum which is great for durability
the ear cups fold inside but I found
them to be way too loose for my liking
we are very soft ear cushions and the
drivers inside are angled to provide
better directionality and also a little
extra room for your ears so they never
make contact with the drivers themselves
the main channel drivers are 40
millimeters while the vibration driver
is 30 millimeters and the caves are
pretty loud at 114 dB
my major complaint though is the weight
something has to house these drivers and
at 449 grams
yep 449 grams the caves are extremely
heavy I'm used to my H d558 which are
almost half the
wait so while they may be comfortable
they are not comfortable to game with
for extended period of time
the mic is detachable adjustable and
fits very well with the design it glows
when mute although I would think I would
have liked it the other way around the
mic quality is nothing to complain about
absolutely acceptable for in gaming
alright so finally let's talk audio
quality these will have to burn in for
24 hours with a variety of tracks and
right away I booted into my favorite
servers to test out the surround sound
and to no surprise it works each driver
is responsible for specific direction
and you without issues can pinpoint
where that audio is coming from I
strongly recommend you set the channel
sliders to the following positions as
that provided a good low-end response
with deep punchy bass while allowing you
to hear your surroundings this is
another reason why I think this remote
is quite useless as after setting it up
you'll never have to touch it again
while the 5.1 surround sound works the
soundstage is just not there to complete
the experience I mean it sounds like
you're wearing headphones and not really
immersed into your gaming environment
now don't get me wrong the balance
between the lows the mids and the highs
is good especially with the vibration
drivers that do exactly that they
rumbled the headset without distorting
the rest of the drivers which was very
pleasant during intense firefights and
those landing choppers for gaming this
was a new experience as I always trust
my HD 5 5/8 to deliver the games are
very satisfactory in terms of rich bass
without Distortion now although
directionality is precise having your
sliders at different levels will
completely throw you off track for
example if your rear channel is louder
than your center your positioning will
sound confusing now putting these in
stereo mode and listening to my favorite
tracks was a bit disappointing simply
because the caves lack soundstage they
sound very dull and don't have that
warmth and imaging that I'm so used to
the balance between your highs demands
and the lows is well executed the
mid-range is defined and highs aren't
too sharp it just lacks soundstage so
for music you'll definitely want to be
looking elsewhere and when it comes to
headphones I think it's best of a pair
that can do it all deliver an amazing
gaming experience while allowing you to
enjoy
favorite tunes and I cannot say that
about the caves their gaming purpose is
basically all it can do with nice
directionality and vibration drivers but
for a gaming headset that's so heavy
lacks any decent stereo reproduction
produces very noticeable hiss from the
USB amp which we could easily do without
we would strongly suggest you consider a
proper stereo headphone and your ears
will thank you so that concludes our
review of the rocket cave thanks for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
