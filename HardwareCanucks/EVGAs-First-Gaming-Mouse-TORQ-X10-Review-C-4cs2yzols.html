great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hardware canucks and it seems like we've
got another major player within the
peripherals market as EVGA has just
released their first gaming mouse I
think this time it is exciting as we as
consumers and gamers get so many choices
plus the potential for these new
products to incorporate something unique
and different from the hundreds of
gaming mice that we currently have on
the market so this is the EVGA torque X
10 going for $90 and we'll also have a
carbon fiber version for a $30 premium
so all the glossy sides you see here
will be covered in real carbon fiber
instead pretty cool but you will have to
pay extra also to my surprise the glossy
sides are not slippery at all and
actually help with a sturdy grip both
quality is solid with an aluminum frame
and the torque extend feels well put
together so good job EVGA both the
removable cover and the back portion are
covered in this perforated plastic that
feels great
and it's also not rubberized so it won't
wear out in time the mouse is
symmetrical good news for left-handed
users although I kept hitting the two
browser buttons on the right side with
my ring finger and I had to readjust the
grip so that doesn't happen
overall button location is fine although
you can see there's quite a bit of
movement on the side buttons they are
fairly easy to press so that's why I
ended up disabling the ones on the
opposite side primary left and right
click are a little heavy but the rebound
is quick so that's good and I'm very
impressed with the scroll wheel it's
rubberized well illuminated and with the
well defined scroll steps actual middle
press feels a little too dense so I
never actually ended up using it during
gameplay dpi switch buttons are right
behind with excellent tactile response
and LED indicator to tell you which of
the five dpi settings you're using at
the very back and illuminated EVGA logo
with multiple color options same with
the scroll wheel and that's always great
to have to color match to all
your peripherals the cable is braided
plus the USB port is labeled which is
useful for differentiation but I'd love
to see more peripherals come with
different color tips on the end instead
now definitely shows that EVGA has done
their homework when it comes to
customization as using this proprietary
key you can either raise or lower the
height of the support surface the height
difference may not look like a big deal
but depending on your hand size you can
basically fine-tune the size of the
torque x10 a gimmicky feature that
you'll actually be thankful for at 121
grams the mouse is well balanced but
removing the top cover reveals a slot
for additional weights that can be added
if you prefer a heavier body now this is
great as a concept especially for a
gaming mouse but EVGA s execution here
certainly may cause some issues you have
to be very careful removing the top
cover by first sliding it towards the
back and only then using the small hinge
to lift off the cover actually broke one
of the notches on our first sample that
resulted in unbalanced left and right
clicks so keep that in mind also the
weights are cylinders without an
included housing so you can easily lose
the ones not in use the teflon feet at
the bottom do span a large area and
regardless of the surface Glide was
always smooth and consistent there's
also a profile switch button at the
bottom which is great to have on the
mouse itself so the x10 uses a laser
sensor that can be used on glass and
white surfaces this is the Avago 9800
that goes up to 8200 dpi and tracking
was accurate although mass acceleration
was on by default so make sure you
disable it and I had a good time gaming
with the extend especially after adding
in some weights and raising the height
and with my usual 800 FEI sensitivity
Tiger to dominate the battlefield once
more the driver software is a bit clunky
it definitely needs work although we do
have all the customization for example
on the button settings selecting each
button and remapping it is easy but
switching the layout for left-handed
users is right there advanced settings
with dpi is pretty clear with five
sensitivities plus the polling rate
adjustment we've got angle snapping
Mouse acceleration
the standard rest of the settings plus
the LED adjustment with color brightness
and different modes you can save the
macros on board the mouse which is great
and manage where these macros are saved
as well and overall what we have here is
a strong gaming contender coming from a
strong company with excellent build
quality great primary switches and
customization for both the form and the
weight
however the implementation of the
removable cover to access the weight
slots is problematic if we move
incorrectly housing for unused weights
is non-existent and the side button
exhibit just way too much play that may
cause concerns with longevity of those
buttons how are this being EVGA first
entrance into peripherals I really can't
wait to see how they proceed as the tork
extend is actually very impressive being
their first gaming mouse and will
perhaps see a keyboard roll out as a
slight slip in the software maybe just a
teaser to get us excited but let us know
how you feel about EVGA heading into the
gaming peripheral market and your
thoughts on the torque extent in
particular make sure you're subscribed

thanks for watching we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
