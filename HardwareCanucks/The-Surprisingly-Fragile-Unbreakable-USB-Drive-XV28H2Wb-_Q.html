this is a USB stick from Corsair it's
called it's called the survivor it's
waterproof shockproof vibration proof
but is it fireproof is it high proof and
exactly how much you know elemental
damage can this thing withstand before
losing my very sensitive information
because I'm stupid and I'm gonna put the
only information that I have no backed
up anywhere after this Drive and see if
it can survive the test the new OC CTR
200 from Toshiba is a great value SSD if
you're considering upgrading your hard
drive and get a nice boost in
performance with cutting-edge 3d flash
memory and ultra reliable controller
with built-in power management available
in different capacities check it out
below the issue though is that I don't
have the appropriate elements to torture
this USB stick so let's go somewhere
else
hello good people I have come to Panama
to test out the survivor USB stick let's
put it through the elements and see if
it survives
okay so the first order of business the
survivor sticker is already peeling but
it is more stout this way but I really
like this implementation of this USB
stick we have these rubber bits that
potentially would absorb some of the
impact so the aluminum housing remains
intact it is waterproof up to 200 meters
so in case you play the place this in
your pocket forget to take it out go to
the ocean or go to some some body of
water your data will be safe but I'm
curious to see what type of shock
absorbent this aluminum housing can
withstand so let's go drop this thing
run it over with a car leave it in the
heat I think it's like 40 degrees
outside for an hour and see if our data
survives after being thrown in the ocean
- okay so the first order of business is
to place some very important information
all to the USB Drive so I'm going to
place all the pictures that are taking
on this trip onto USB Drive delete it
from my computer so we have a little bit
risk involved huh I'm very surprised at
how slow the driver is it's not even
reaching 50 megabytes per second for
transfers what's up okay the files have
finally transferred let me delete my
local coffee on the computer this is
very nerve-wracking because I think it's
some amazing pictures
well let's hope I have not made a giant
mistake Corsair please do not disappoint
all right so first let's do an extreme
drug test
no no that I'm gonna literally throw
this as hard as I can into concrete
floor so it is completely closed
that's nothing all good
all right so as expected there's some
scuffs onto the body of the aluminum
housing but the little chunky pieces on
ends plus the rubber pieces help to
absorb a lot of that impact and so it
does look a little damaged but I'm sure
the actual drive inside is completely
fine so let's put some weight on it
instead
absolutely fine I think
so after being run over by a car looks
like we have a little bit of damage on
the rubber pieces so but they are still
holding up and there can be used no
problem and the actual structure of the
aluminum body has not morphed into
anything because I can unscrew the tip
just fine
the next before dumping this thing into
the pool let's first make sure that it
works alright so that did not go as
planned and I think I threw it way too
hard and the main flash actually
detached from the PCB the actual
aluminum closure is all fine but yeah
now let's test out the waterproofing
I've placed a $5 bill inside of here and
make sure that it still can protect you
from water in case you want to transfer
anything important and here that is not
your data so
all good it's waterproof as they say all
right so for the unclaimed attic
conclusion about the USB survivor is the
housing the aluminum housing is
waterproof its shock resistant you know
there's absolutely no damage on it and
I've run it over with a car and I've
smashed at the games concrete and it's
held up just fine the internals over
don't hold the same fate obviously don't
throw the game's concrete because the
force of that impact will make sure that
the interiors just fall apart into
pieces but I'm a bit surprised that the
actual NAND memory is just attached to
the housing and there's no other
supporting mechanism to make sure that
the USB stays intact
in case this thing experiences a really
fast and sharp contact with something
hard and looking over the USB connector
it has been worked most likely when I
was running it over with a car because
the aluminum housing how much I'm
assuming it can withstand a little bit
of flexibility to me it looks just fine
but as you can see I cannot even insert
this into USB port because this whole
male connector is warped now it would be
awesome to see a derivative of this
product that is you know super
high-impact proof so if you throw this
over like a five-story building it will
not fall apart inside because the actual
housing is totally fine to withstand
those unnecessary forces but the USB
technology inside of it cannot alright
so that's it for my experiment for the
core survival USB stick I honestly did
not expect the interior to be so fragile
but now I know and the exterior is super
tough and all my data despite it was
being deleted from the computer I
luckily was able to recover it from the
trash bin I'm Dimitri thanks so much for
watching we'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
