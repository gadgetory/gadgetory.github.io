great technology selection and service
hello everyone i'm dmitri with Huracan
arcs and i am wearing red on purpose
because today we'll be taking a look at
an overview of a m-- these new driver
software that promises better user
experience more stability in the future
and everything in between sort of
improved and they've added several cool
infrastructure additions within the
software so here's everything you need
to know about aim the crimson software
so the first feature is low framerate
compensator or LFC and these adding this
features to compensate for judder and
tearing if your framerate goes below the
minimum of fresh rate of a free sync
monitor so some of the first generation
free sync monitors had a minimum refresh
rate of 40 Hertz with free sync enabled
and therefore if your frame rate dropped
below 40 fps in-game you'll encounter
stuttering and just unplayable non fluid
motions so LFC will tries to compensate
for that with this new panels that have
a lower refresh rate not at 40 but now
will be at 30 Hertz which means that the
LFC will adapt the GPU output versus
refresh rate of a monitor so you have
more fluid experience even if you drop
below the minimum refresh rate of a free
sync panel so the next feature is frame
pacing in crossfire micro stutter was a
very common issue in dx9 games but now
with crimson that is all solved and you
should experience much more fluid
gameplay with the x9 titles with
crossfire so now let's talk UI see how
pretty this new software is from AMD and
see also if there is any performance
benefits with AMD crimson and so first
you can see that AMD has done a
fantastic job with the driver user
interface it's easy to navigate it's
very fast and provides a solid
foundation for all user interactions
with the drivers so the first gaming tab
will detect all the games installed on
your system it will detect them from
Steam origin you play the
time doesn't take this GOG galaxy games
yet but you can manually add them with
this settle and function here under the
global settings you can adjust multiple
image qualities this is where you can
also enable global graphics for
framerate target control which will be
applied throughout the board so what
this will allow you to do is set a frame
rate target for a specific game anywhere
from 30 fps to 200 FPS that would allow
your GPU to work only up to a certain
point so for example if you have a fury
X and you want to play a less demanding
title you can set a frame rate target so
that your GPU can run at a much higher
efficiency lower temperatures and lower
fan noise in order to reach that
specific target and you can also see
shader cache here that can be enabled or
disabled so in order to offer seamless
transition between areas of open-world
games like Far Cry for Fallout 4 dragon
age and you know Skyrim and all those
stuff the game engine has to store
compiled shaders within the graphics
driver and it becomes very inefficient
when you have to revisit that area of
the game again as it has to compile the
shaders it has to load them and has to
discard them once again so what they
what aim the crimson will try to do is
redirect those compiled shaders onto the
area of the users disk so a hard drive
or an SSD in order to offer much reduced
loading times in games and therefore may
potentially reduce CPU overhead and so
the CPU doesn't have to worry about
those resources the global overdrive
hasn't changed at all it's still the
same way you cannot adjust voltages and
it's very easy to visually see what type
of overclock and power limit percentage
that you will be working with if you
want to or a clock but the cool thing is
you can enter each single game and you
can adjust the same image controls per
game and adjust the frame rate target
control per title which is really cool
and you can also set different profiles
overclocking profiles per game as well
which is nice
if you want to have a little extra power
and one and less on the other so moving
on to the video tab this is where you
have local playback color presets for
anything that's playing locally so these
presets will not apply to the video
playing on the web so these are color
profiles are not specific to anything
that's playing on YouTube or anything
like that but as you can see here I have
a file right now it's in the default if
you go and cinema classic notice that it
does change the color profile and color
preset of that video moving out to
display tab here I was hoping to see you
know at least commands for resolution
and refreshed rate and all that jazz
that you'd what you'd like to see on the
display settings unfortunately that's
not available here you do however it can
enable free sync virtual super
resolution GPU scaling and scaling note
all of which are important but you will
have to go into additional settings
which is right here so clicking that
will pop up this window that we're so
familiar with in which you can see the
model the GP the monitor resolution
refresh rate and all that stuff and you
can go into custom resolutions here if
you want to change the refresh rate or
custom resolutions of this panel now MD
crimson brings multi-monitor setups a
lot easier I don't have triple monitor
setup or Multi multi setup but in here
you'll be able to adjust where each
panel is and how it is aligned and it's
supposed to bring multi monitor
configuration setups a lot easier to set
up now with AMD crimson and finally the
system tab gives you all the software
and hardware information about your
system that you know is great to have in
case you want to double check on
something that is is whether or not it's
updated or something being detected and
so the last thing to cover is
performance and through our our tests
only two games saw good improvements for
lot four and Star Wars Battlefront while
on the other hand hitman and shadow of
mordor saw a large decline in
performance with the rest of the titles
hovering around the margin of error so I
think will be just a matter of time
until we see performance improvements
rhasta board with indy crimson versus
previous catalyst software in our 30
hours of testing with four GPUs we have
experienced no abnormal abnormal
behavior with the GPU while some people
have reported to have low fan profile so
GPU faint profiles to be way too low the
cards would get hot with this driver
software but not in our experience and
so at the end of the day what AMD has
here is a solid software foundation that
will definitely be complementing their
future hardware with beautiful UI and
hopefully further refinements in how we
interact with the driver and if you want
more information on a in the crimson it
will be linked in the description below
we have a full article on Hard Knocks
comm make sure to give the like button a
virtual high five on your way out so
that we can feel appreciated we hope you
enjoyed this little overview video I'm
Dimitri with Hard Rock Canucks thanks
much for watching and we'll see you in</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
