Canucks and a lot of gaming gear has
passed through my hands and it's a
privilege to be able to experience all
the new mais all the keyboards all the
new headsets and over time I've sort of
compiled my perfect gaming set and that
got me thinking out of the three which
should receive most attention from your
wallet
the z9 neo-byzantine features on a
budget with a large windowed side panel
five included fans and the excellent
interior layout with super simple cable
management get it now link in the
description below so my gaming setup
consists of the large stick Pro Mouse
really love the weight and the size is
perfect
then the keyboard is the corsair k70 RGB
rapid-fire with MX speed switches this
is primarily why I use this keyboard
because that is one fine switch and by
far the most precious product in this
gaming lineup is the San Heiser
HD 800 with their mod mic 4.0 attachment
and this setup has evolved over time
with tkl keyboards wireless mice that
i've used in the past but my audio was
almost always the more expensive piece
of gear obviously as a conscious
consumer you would prioritize on what
matters to you the most in game I would
prioritize on a gaming mouse and audio
in my set having bad aim is extremely
frustrating especially if it's caused by
some hardware bad switches poor
ergonomics and let alone a poor sensor
for example that all sort of diminishes
your gaming experience so you got to
start with a good Mouse first and I have
been very happy with the Logitech pro
and the wire g4 two mice that are the
same price at 69 bucks and if you cheap
out on a mouse it will surely reflect
how you aim and really if you're having
a good time or not and interestingly our
Gaming Mouse reviews have received quite
the viewership and two of our mice
videos remain in the top most of you
content ever on our channel which is
pretty incredible to to think about and
makes me think that gaming mice are
possibly the most crucial piece of gear
in your gaming collection which also
happens to be the least expensive
because gaming mice usually cheaper than
keyboards and cheaper than gaming
headsets keyboards on the other hand are
a little bit different and our obsession
with mechanical switches promotes this
huge demand
and thoughts gaming is now very much
tied to mechanical keyboards but from my
experience would like a rubber dome
keyboard you can still perform very well
with keystrokes and be satisfied in game
the more expensive keyboards you buy
just personalize the experience a little
bit more with different designs RGB
lighting so many flavours of switches
which is that crucial part for the
keyboard but I feel that is one piece of
gear that you can save money on or at
least hold out until your mouse and
audio pieces are the best for you and
this is where I bring out the HD 800 and
emphasize just how much OPD are but they
give me a really good reference point
for audio and after running them with my
mod mic 4.0 set up having stellar audio
is that next big thing for me to enjoy
my games aside from having an awesome
Mouse audio engines are becoming so good
right now but like Battlefield one sound
effects and engine is amazing you can
hear every single little detail and it
would be a shame to tame that sound
signature with a poor headset so I would
definitely prioritize on audio before I
move on to a mechanical keyboard my
recommendation right now lies with a
game series from Sennheiser the game one
in particular which is an open style
design and is my go-to headset right now
seriously it's the most comfortable pair
of headsets that I have ever owned with
an awesome sound signature that brings
out any environment to life the
microphone quality on this pair is
fantastic it's almost like the
industry-leading benchmark on how a
microphone should sound on the gaming
headset but what exactly do you
sacrifice going with a more budget
solution so here we have the new
Logitech G 231 at $69 and from an audio
perspective they actually sound pretty
decent giving a bass lift while
maintaining a detailed treble and nice
resolution but you can feel their
value-oriented through the creaky
plastic construction totally distracting
cable noise that travels directly into
the left ear cup with I would say two
distant inline remote or the washable
but quiet unpleasant surface material on
the cushions themselves this is that
compromise you should avoid with budget
gaming gear especially when it comes to
headsets the microphone quality on the
GT 31 is actually pretty decent that was
so surprised to hear that it's clear
it's not nasally in any way it doesn't
cancel out much of the background noise
but it's fine I guess it's not as boomy
as the game one microphone but very very
passable
good job Logitech I hear the plastic
argument quite often related to
something that is cheap something that
should be avoided but plastic is awesome
because it's light and you can wear
something that is light for many many
hours on end without introducing any
head fatigue it's the lower end headsets
that are made of plastic that set the
bad precedent for higher end quality
plastic headsets and where is that
balance it's unfortunate the g2 31 is
comfortable to wear but it misses many
of the align and underlying quality
features that we are expected to see and
this is actually quite the common trend
for audio products which is why I
encourage prioritization on Mouse and
audio first for your gaming gear but
there are actually a few outliers like
the new $50 HyperX finger make sure to
check out our review which sounds great
and actually addresses the build quality
concerns at such a low price so big
thumbs up here and I hope this has been
helpful for those wondering how to
partition their budget for gaming gear
and I'm curious to see if any of you are
like me who prioritize on a good aim and
excellent audio I'm Dimitri with how are
Canucks thanks so much for watching
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
