axe and I've been using the gtx 1080i
ever since launch and one of the
concerns i mentioned in my review video
was regarding the core temperatures
during load as you may know the
reference cooler design wasn't really
doing its trick cooling the monster
inside even though pascal architecture
is efficient the GP 102 core is massive
and input a lot of heat as you can see I
ran the 3d mark 5 strike ultra on a loop
for 15 minutes and the maximum I was
able to achieve was around 83 C remember
Nvidia's boost algorithms will start
modulating core frequencies when the
core reaches an operating temperature of
around 84 C now this is why a lot of
people end up leaning towards custom
GPUs since both partners will add new
PCBs RGB lighting premium back plates
and other exclusive features that might
attract gamers in my case I was a little
uncomfortable with the temps on this
reference card but most importantly
sometimes I found its clock speeds to be
wandering a bit and I decided to do
something about it but before we move on
a quick message from our sponsor
you can only rely on the pros do the job
with every keystroke satisfying like the
millions before it
call it fooled every key regardless of
their state Kula master master keys bro
they could live negative now I'm pretty
sure most of you are aware of custom
aftermarket GP brackets that can be used
to mount an AI yo on top of the GPU core
Corsair thermal tank and many others
have launched them in the past some of
them even include lower style fans for
the V RMS but the downside to all of
this is a it's going to cost you more
especially when you include the cost of
the EIU cooler and B it might be a
little overwhelming for some of you to
install this cooling solution now today
we're taking a look at the new NZXT
kraken g12 GPU bracket it's priced at
$30 and you can pick it up either in
black or white variants the installation
procedure is also supposed to be a lot
easier than its predecessor the g10 and
it's compatible with more than 30 a i/o
coolers on the market so not just n
sixties models this is because like many
other manufacturers NCHS uses ASA tech
as an OEM so mounting compatibility
remains identical across many different
models compatibility with modern GPUs
shouldn't be a problem since the g12
supports both Nvidia and AMD sklearn
offerings including the Titan XP and the
rx 580 now remember you have to purchase
your own cooler of choice provided that
you've checked the compatibility list on
the website in my case I'm going to
mount this hot new Kraken X 42 from NZXT
it's priced at $130 so in total you're
looking at an investment of $160 USD
without any taxes just for the sake of
better temperatures and perhaps higher
frequencies that's a lot more than what
you would pay for a custom GPU but
without any further ado let's proceed
with the teardown process
a few moments later so I've run into a
little bit of a problem here and via I
have done a pretty interesting job well
I guess a little bit more complicated
and expected but you first need to
remove the back plates in order to you
know for the first initial turn on
process which I did by removing these
screws that are right here super tiny
screws and unfortunately they're
actually mounted on top of these hex
screws for the cooler so I don't
actually have a compatible hex screw
remover and so I'm going to head out to
the dollar store or the nearest hardware
store and come back to tear down this
whole thing because it's I need to do
this today so yeah success so I did find
a four millimeter driver it works so
yeah I'm gonna get this kit and go back
home let's do this guy's
all right I have to mention a few things
before revealing the results you see
mounting a GPU with the a or cooler can
be a little bit challenging especially
inside compact cases mind you I'm using
the X 4200 M NZXT that comes with a 140
millimeter radiator and take this s 340
case from NZXT for instance this chassis
has a lot of restraints when it comes to
mounting a radiator especially when
you're using a 240 or 280 millimeter AIO
for your processor I even tried mounting
the radiator at the top and the rear but
unfortunately the vrm heat sinks on the
motherboard was getting the way so to
provide an apples-to-apples comparison I
chose the be quiet silent based 800
chassis to mount to liquid coolers one
for the CPU and one for the GPU also
make sure to reuse the thermal pants
that come with your stock cooler as I
ran into a lot of hiccups without
installing them in the first place most
of them were mostly bf Saudis but envy
exceeds your taking notes please include
extra pads in your next revision anyways
enough of me complaining let's roll out
those results and as you can see these
numbers speak for themselves the X 42
does a killer job cooling the GP one or
two core providing idle temps around 27
C and there is about an eighth degree
difference between it and the stock
cooler which might not be a lot but
moving on to low temps I ran the Unigine
value test on a loop for 15 minutes and
once again the X 42 did a fantastic job
giving us temps in the high 60s which is
way better than 85 C on the stock cooler
I also noticed that there wasn't a
drastic difference with core frequencies
in this case with the a i/o Lemax I was
able to achieve without me tweaking was
eighteen eighty five megahertz compared
to 1873 with the reference cooler
another interesting aspect that I
noticed while testing both coolers was
the internal temperatures as you can see
the temps spiked up to about 50 C with
the G 12 compared to 40 C with the
reference cooler and I think I might
have the justification for that you see
I had the 140 millimeter radiator
mounted at the front as an intake and
given the thickness of the rad plus the
intake times
drawing hot air into the case it was
just a matter of time for the
temperatures to spike up inside the case
come
to set up where you don't have any
radiators in the front and just a stock
cooler from Nvidia
once again these results may vary
depending on where you decide to mount
the radiator inside your case provided
you have the room to mount one in the
first place now let's take a listen to
how they sound so guys the GPU is
installed inside the salad days 800 at
the side panels closed so it's a more
real world scenario that we're looking
at right now and the microphone is right
above frames right here and let's take a
listen to how it sounds during idle
so guys I've swapped out the NTSC g12
bracket and have installed the founders
edition cooler
I've also reapplied thrown paste to give
you a sort of an apples-to-apples
comparison so in terms of air flow I did
replace the radiator fans I did remove
the radiator in the front and I replaced
it with the NCHC and that came with the
radiator so we have fun intake just like
before so let's take a look at how the
system sounds under aisle
so conclusion time this was my first
experience tearing down an entire GPU
and sticking in an aftermarket cooling
solution on top of the core in this case
I used the crack in G 12 and the X 42
cooler it was definitely interesting I
had a few hiccups obviously the first
one was the case restrictions that I had
I tried mounting this on the s340 it
didn't work out so I had to choose the
silent base 800 which is a much bigger
case so make sure you have proper room
to accommodate the radiator in fact this
whole setup because it's definitely a
little intriguing the next thing to
consider is the cost associated when you
try to approach the solution because
I'll be it it is not cheap it's
definitely expensive for me at least it
would cost around $160 as an add-on so I
would highly recommend picking up an
aftermarket custom card from brands like
EVGA ACX gigabyte you name it also there
are other things to consider like cable
management because pump connectors fan
connectors they all require some sort of
skills to make it look non-existent
especially inside a case if you have a
tempered glass or window I also had to
sacrifice my front I Oh connectors
because the MSI board that I tested this
whole setup with came with two USB 2.0
headers inside the motherboard one was
for the X 62 cooler the CPU and the
other one was for the X 42 cooler for
the GPU and so you need to keep in mind
make sure you have proper USB 2.0
headers or enough USB 2.0 headers to
incorporate Funai oh and two pumps
especially when you're using the NZXT
series I'm not really sure what the deal
is with other AIO coolers but you need
to seriously consider this as a
challenge or find a workaround to this
so there you have it
I want to hear your thoughts about the
NCC Kraken g12 and is it even worth
spending $160 or even less depending on
which AI of solution you choose to
liquid cool your GPU if it's running
superhot let me know in the comments
down below I'm a bore with how it
connects thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
