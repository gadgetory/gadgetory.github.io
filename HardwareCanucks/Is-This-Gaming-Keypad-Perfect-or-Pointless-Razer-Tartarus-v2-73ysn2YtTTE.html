space to survive one must overcome the
challenge of economic support visual
stimulation and satisfying the
fingertips of the host this ancient
species of navigation is quite the rare
and until now was on the verge of
extinction however the latest research
suggests the growing population of these
small one-handed keyboard species it is
unfortunately still unclear why many of
its kind have disappeared this is the
Tartarus v2 the reproductive snake helps
to lure nearby prey locking them to
become lifetime hosts or until it dies
little blast from the past the tart
recipe - let's check it out the
legendary hyper 212 CPU cooler from
Coolermaster now comes in this
breathtaking matte black finish the
included Silencio 120 millimeter fan
delivers great airflow and reduced noise
plus you can pick up an RGB version of
this cooler as well learn more about the
hyper 212 black edition and it's RGB
sibling down below by the way everything
is linked in description below thank you
very much alright so I'm honestly quite
surprised at the number of people who
have commented on our Twitter post
saying they still use a one-handed
keyboard either for I cannot do anything
but game with it or the exact opposite
using it for professional applications
and using it for macros so not gaming I
remember owning the Logitech g13 and
that was a pretty interesting experience
but you know since then the mainstream
keyboard market has expanded with tons
of affordable and excellent quality
mechanical switches and that is the
reason why we are visiting the Razer
Tartarus v2 it comes with Razer's Mecha-
membrane which is which are less clicky
blues and because of the membrane thing
in the bottom it has that typical
squishy bottoming out of a membrane
keyboard in total we have 19 keys in the
main front area with the Oise layout
program by default and you can see the
arrows for that visual guide now it's
kind of weird using the shift key
because it's so small and had to program
mine 211 so the 16 key could be my
control the scroll wheel is quite poor
here with very loose scroll steps but it
is easy
accessible when you point finger while
the thumb gets a whole lot more than
usual so there's the d-pad that's
well-positioned with the option to
remove the knob to slim down the
joystick the round button above and your
space key below that is quite heavy
because of the Mecha membrane switch and
I wish that they did not have that much
travel distance so everything is easy to
remap but this is Razer synapse that
we're talking about so a login is
required to create those custom profiles
and you can see what key map setting
you're using with these three side LEDs
so the size is the obvious advantage
with these products I love 10 keyless
keyboards because full-size boards are
just always in my space for Mouse
navigation while these keypads open up
so much of there's no real estate for
Mouse movement and actually a lot of
flexibility to position the keypad
however is more comfortable for you like
this rotated the close to your body
wrist position allows the elbow to rest
on the surface without anything
interfering with your mouse area
also I think the keypad is a massive
compliment for notebook gamers because
anything is more comfortable than a flat
surface with that 2 millimeter of travel
distance but more importantly it's
located on the side of the notebook
instead of the front where you could
typically place a keyboard thus the
overall setup is just more comfortable
the ergonomics on this one in particular
a far superior to even the keyboard with
the wrist rest so the slight dip and the
keys strength in my fingers from a claw
grip to something a bit more natural and
because the spacebar is lower the entire
wrist is more balanced versus a regular
keyboard and that can immediately feel
some strain relief after a few days my
finger memory kind of kicked in and the
only thing that I never really used is a
scroll wheel it is a bit unnatural for
my left hand by the way you can remove
the wrist rest and move it back slightly
and it flattens out the entire structure
that makes the space key a lot more
comfortable to use but there is no way
to further angle the keypad from the
bottom alright so from a gaming
perspective despite the ergonomic and
size advantages the keypad only fits a
particular play style which is why it
clearly hasn't become this mechanical
keyboard killer for example in the
division 2 you have 10 key commands just
for your inventory alone and I attempted
to remap everything needed to the keypad
but
kind of got awkward and I was still
reaching for my keyboard to execute
basic stuff and we can all find the G
key in our sleep on the standard
keyboard but because that column of keys
is absent on the keypad thus it's kind
of awkward not having our standard
grenade key on the gaming pad I also had
to map an escape key to the keypad and
also control to the bottom-left and
generally for any game that has a semi
complex control system the keypad might
not be sufficient for example an escape
from tarkov there are so many controls
from checking your ammo type to
switching between flashlight and laser
to cycling between reticle on your scope
that I just couldn't fit all of it on
the keypad but for games with simple
control schemes like bf5 apex legends
quake champions Metro Exodus there are
no hiccups and gaming on the keypad
aside from that missing G key but you
know if you use one those crazy mice
with a thousand buttons many of the
shortcuts that don't really fit the
keypad could be allocated to the mouse
instead as for professional applications
outside of gaming I think would be a
fantastic addition to macro managing
certain things that require let's say
three presses like ctrl shift and L
control shift and something else on the
keyboard that you can easily macro that
to the keypad or keys that are slightly
further away from each other like ctrl +
ctrl - ctrl page down something that
does not require you to lift your mouse
hand to the keyboard and therefore you
can just Mac macro those keys to the
keypad and my workflow for resolve and
Adobe Premiere and other Adobe
applications has improved greatly I now
have my editing profile saved with over
10 shortcuts on to the keypad which is
awesome I colored that in orange and it
is on whenever I am editing anything and
this way my keyboard hand stays in the
keyboard area and doesn't have to move
too much in my mouse hand always stays
on the mouse and the main benefit with
these type of keyboard products is
obviously the size because if you were
to get a separate keyboard just for
macros that definitely is going to
occupy more room versus the Tartarus V2
or the orb-weaver but it will definitely
be cheaper because for some reason these
tiny keyboard products are quite
expensive and also the lack of
mechanical switch options for users is a
massive roadblock for this becoming a
bit more mainstream even
so it has that dual functionality either
for gaming or productivity that you
could fit into your lifestyle and for
work efficiency but yeah it's just not
there yet and I don't think it will ever
get there and really one of the main
challenges with this keypad is the lack
of a proper size shift key because the
one that's included here the regular key
is actually quite small and the muscle
memory kind of has to rework itself so
you recognize where to press and so it
makes sense why these tiny keyboard
species have not exploded in popularity
despite their dual life style and
ergonomic benefits the host might choose
a larger more abundant and cheaper
animal to avoid any future bottleneck
I'd love to hear your thoughts on these
one-handed keyboards and if you'd
consider getting one now we must leave
the snakes alone the mating season is
about to start
thanks for watching until our further
explorations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
