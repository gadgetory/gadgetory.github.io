rockin accent today we take a look at
the dual monitor desk stand from ergo
Tec there are a few unique features
incorporated into this stand and priced
at $189 let's see whether this would be
a worthy investment for your desk space
now one thing I wasn't particularly
excited about was the packaging it is
quite poor but all the parts did arrive
safely inside plenty of bubble wrap one
thing I do love however is how modular
this system is allowing you to basically
pack everything into a backpack if it
needs transport the entire construction
is either steel or aluminum so excellent
build quality throughout as for the
parts we have the base that is shaped
this way for stability but I do dislike
the curved nature and that doesn't allow
you to place anything on top they do
make flat bases for their higher end
models but I wish they would have kept
the same flat approach for their entire
lineup it is solid steel toe with rubber
pads at the bottom that will prevent
from scratches then there's the pole
that you insert into the base and
tighten with one screw at the back with
an allen key including the pole is 19
inches so it will allow height
adjustment next is the crossbar that is
25 inches long and for this particular
model it would allow two monitors up to
24 inches to be installed the entire
system is also expandable so with the
addition of a few parts 27-inch monitors
can be supported or more monitors can be
added the crossbar uses a very sturdy
clamp mechanism that you tighten onto
the pole and this will allow height
adjustment based on your needs so just
make sure to do this with our monitors
attached there are some cable management
implementations on the crossbar as well
that can slide based on your
configuration and your needs there's
also a little clip that you can attach
to the pole for clean cable routing now
finally coming on to the patented design
our DS monitor quick release pivots that
have the standard 75 and 100 millimeter
VESA mounting holes with appropriate
screws included each quick-release has
20 degree tilt up and 10 degree tilt
down and 25 degrees swivel in both left
and right these can be loosened
or tighten with another allen key
included plus the include this small
adhesive feast that can help the tool
which is a nice addition that you can
just easily stick to the bottom of the
base so you never lose it so the way
these quick release mount work is
actually pretty clever the small lever
up top releases the hold and is used to
secure the pivot to the crossbar you
attach the pivot on a slight angle and
the top lever snaps into position you
would pull on the lever and remove the
pivot in a reverse fashion this allows
very quick swaps and extremely simple
assembly the pivot just like the cable
management clips do slide across the bar
not with fluidity but just enough to get
the spacing right between the monitors
at each end of the cross bar we also
have a small screw that will prevent the
pivot from sliding off the rail now they
do have some play but that shouldn't
cause any concerns over stability or
improper mounting but this does mean
that getting that perfect tilt on your
monitor requires just a little extra
work now I have to say that setting up
the dual monitor stand is extremely
simple putting everything together is
hassle free and here it is in action I
do love the extra real estate underneath
each monitor and the 9 inch pole really
does allow me to raise the monitors to
new heights something that wasn't
possible with stock monitor stands and
the pivot also allows a 360 degree
rotation for portrait or landscape
orientation with reassuring tight hold
as you can see because I'm not using two
identical monitors there's no way to
adjust the plane of the monitors so one
is sticking out more than the other we
also cannot adjust the height for each
panel with these standard pivots but
Aerotech does carry height adjustment
limits that you can purchase separately
that will allow you to level everything
out but these are just few limitations
for this particular model also coming
back to the curve base design it doesn't
particularly allow for anything to be
placed onto it so I find that
disappointing now overall the dual
monitor stand offers a very basic
package with excellent build quality
height adjustment flexibility for tilt
swivel and rotation on the pivots that
are also extremely simple to remove the
inclusion of the cable routing clips is
a
percent useful the modularity of the
entire system means expandability for
additional monitors or support for
larger panels with just a few extra
parts without the need to start from
scratch that I find really useful also
ergo Tech offers lifetime warranty as a
reassurance for quality that they stand
behind however there are a few
limitations for this model unless you're
using the stand with two identical
monitors the lack of further adjustment
to the height and individual planes of
each monitor is limiting the base is
also not designed to accommodate for
tabletop objects like card readers and
etc so I would have preferred a more
flat design now as for the hundred $89
it is actually priced competitively
considering the expandable nature for
this modular design but it is slightly
shy over the word for this particular
model but what do you guys think would
this be an alternative for your dual
monitor needs let us know in the
