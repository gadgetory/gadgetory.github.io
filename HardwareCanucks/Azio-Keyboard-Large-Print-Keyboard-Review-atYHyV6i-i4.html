hard rock next review today were
checking out keyboard from azo which
holds specific purpose and that is to
improve your productivity now this is
certainly a budget-friendly keyboard and
will set you back just under $30 now the
name says it all it's a large print
three color backlit keyboard which is
supposed to reduce eye strain now this
is by no means a gaming keyboard simply
because the keys are low-profile and are
non mechanical and this would be
targeted mainly for desktop use and for
those who prefer the larger font for a
more comfortable experience and to top
it off this is a plug-and-play device so
no need for drivers it just works
straight out of the box and so starting
off with the keys what you see here are
large print letters that are also bolded
for a little bit of an enhancement as
you can see the letters cover the entire
keys and it's actually a lot larger than
your standard letters on a regular
keyboard now this would definitely come
in useful for those starting to learn to
use your computer but also for those
with poor eyesight a larger characters
are a lot easier to see and is actually
a pretty good alternative over getting
keyboard stickers now this keyboard
features backlight illumination which is
pretty decent it's not exactly uniform
and some keys are lit a lot better than
others but of course that does not
disturb functionality the one thing that
really bothers me about this keyboard
are the immediate keys at the top
they're quite dim and they're very
difficult to see from a normal viewing
distance we have large letter keys and
absolutely tiny media controls it just
doesn't make sense
now the media Keys should be as large as
the F keys below in order for SEO to
promote this as a Productivity keyboard
now on a positive note we do get a
choice of three colors for our backlight
the blue the red and the purple you can
also turn the illumination off and so
it's actually quite nice to see this
integrated into such a budget keyboard
now when it comes to construction it is
very light and it is very plastic but it
does provide a fairly comfortable typing
experience with this integrated wrist
support
it would be nice if it was rubberized
but of course we can't wish for
everything in this price point and you
also do get the occasional gems between
some keys but that is expected also the
keyboard is fairly quiet when typing so
that could be considered as a benefit
and coming to the bottom we have
standoffs that raise and angle the
keyboard that actually slightly improves
the visibility of the backlight this
however does make the keyboard prone to
sliding due to lack of rubber grommets
on the standoffs now my overall
experience with this keyboard has been
satisfactory for regular desktop use
this is a pretty nice keyboard of course
you're not expecting amazing build
quality for something that is just under
$30 the large lettering didn't have much
of an effect on my productivity because
I no longer look at the keys when I'm
typing but it sure does make the keys a
lot easier to see the three color
backlight is very nice
the purple seemed the brightest and just
a word of caution the backlight
illumination stays on after powering off
your system of course you can simply use
the LED key on the keyboard to turn it
off completely and lastly the price is
very attractive for people on the budget
and you get what you pay for now on the
downside the media controls are very
small compared to the rest of the keys
and I had trouble recognizing what is
what from the usual viewing distance and
I do feel this is a major drawback to
this keyboard if we have large and
bolder keys throughout why has it not
been integrated for the media controls
and of course being picky the backlight
isn't uniform on all the keys and you do
get occasional champs but overall SEO
has delivered a good budget keyboard
that can find its purpose for many users
so thanks guys for watching see you next
