happy sleeping
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Hardware
Canucks and today we're checking out a
new chair brand called verdaguer the
name is derived from vertebra which is a
bone composition of a spinal column and
thus we are happy to see this underlying
comfort built into the brain
their logo shouldn't be confused with
audio technica or abstract industries
from assassin's creed but in any way it
is a memorable deed for a further gear
pricing wise you're looking at 3:49 for
the SL 5000 model that we have here 339
for the SL 4000 and 289 for the SL 2000
all come with free shipping within
continental USA and for gaming chairs
like these I'd say competitive pricing
is key so let's check out if quality is
on par to what we should expect and
whether or not it's a comfortable chair
the unboxing experience is nothing to
complain about everything is safely
packaged no parts missing I'm happy to
see a lumbar cushion and the neck pillow
that followed that completely blackout
design without any accented colors the
wheels have a cool design on the rims
certainly follows the gaming character
and starting with the assembly the
instructions are super simple first we
need to insert the wheels into the heavy
aluminum base then attach the metal base
frame underneath the seat with pre
mounted screws which is convenient and
minimizes chances of any missing screws
the base frame has to be installed in a
certain way and then arrow indicates the
front of the seat for clarification the
telescopic cover on our sample arrived
with some type of damage this was a
defective piece to come out of the
plastic mold and I initially thought
that something was spilled over it but
we got a confirmation from verdaguer
that their quality control has tightened
since they moved factories and things
are now double checked before packaging
and so the next thing we need to do is
insert the gas lift and press the wheel
base into place and the bottom portion
of the seat is pretty much ready
attaching the back seat is
straightforward the screws are
pre-installed and after a bit of
maneuvering the seat into proper angle
and tightening the screws on both sides
we are ready for the final step of
attaching these plastic covers that are
also held in by
Kruse and the SL 5000 seat is ready
maximum supported load is 150 kilograms
I weighed about 80 kilograms and M 180
centimeters in height my first
impressions on the design is that I love
this stealth all-black look we usually
see some accents and colours on the
sides for these gaming racing chairs and
that's what the SL 4000 model delivers
it has multiple color options but the
full black is a nice departure towards a
more uniform design it's a bit muted
with these great-looking carbon-fiber
accents in the middle and on the lumbar
cushion the material choice here is PVC
leather or polyvinyl chloride which
looks great it's durable it can be
easily wiped after a liquid stain it's
waterproof and it's comfortable to the
touch the only drawback is the heat
factor as in my experience and hot
summer days it doesn't fully breathe
which means in a non air-conditioned
environment your back and your butt
would get really warm really fast while
FP you cover the polyurethane cover
which is found on my dxracer d series
chair does not trap that much heat so if
you are in a hot environment keep that
in mind now vertically your tells us
that PU leather will be introduced
sometime in the future one thing I
noticed is the leather is stretched and
attached via these o-rings at the bottom
and I'm happy to report I have found no
ribs
and no particular high tension points
either the seat is a common bucket seat
with firm foam relatively tall portions
on each side to almost fix you in
position and soft enough padding on all
sides I felt comfortable within the seat
base if you sit straight up with legs
where they're supposed to be but the
tall support extensions in the front of
the seat may limit your cross leg
seating position and that's unfortunate
because even just putting one leg under
the other creates this uncomfortable
angle because the sides are so high it
looks awesome but I think the sides
should be more in line with the seat to
allow freedom of maneuver the backseat
support though is excellent with wide
enough and short wings on each side that
would accommodate for broad shoulders
no problem without pushing them forward
also the midsection on the seat is
awesome as its slightly extended and
provides excellent contact with your
back both in the lower section and
approaching the shoulder blades so you
don't slouch
when I compared this to my dxracer D
series the SL 5000 for me was actually
more comfortable because I wasn't
slouched forward and the back seat
properly accommodates for my lower back
where would the dxracer I have to use
the lumbar cushion to push out my lower
back and prevent me from slouching over
the seat goes all the way back to 170
degrees which I did not feel comfortable
about because of stability it felt as if
the base would give out at any moment
and flip me over and I noticed that a
couple of times leaning forward where
the wheels would turn and the chair
would almost flip forward now this was
at maximum height of the chair as
otherwise bringing the seat 3.5 inches
lower felt more stable also on our
sample I had to manually pull the back
seat after it's been tilted back which
was not that inconvenient but just
unexpected I also noticed the material
to bulge up when I angled the back seat
support pack I'm not sure if this is by
design but the contact point felt really
tight now one of the best features of
this chair is the arm support so not
only do you have the usual height
adjustment which has plenty of travel
but you can also slide it to the side
for extra comfort depending on where
your elbows land and move it back and
forth again an awesome feature to sort
of fine-tune the arm rest based on where
your elbows fall and lastly we have
about 40 degree angle rotation in both
ways that makes this one of the most
versatile armrests on a game chair my
only concern here was the slight wobbly
structure regardless if it was extended
or not it doesn't feel like it would
fall apart anytime soon but I wanted it
to feel more sturdy
I found a pillow comfortable without it
that space felt kind of empty but still
padded enough to not create discomfort
its held in with a strap so you can move
it up and down depending if you wanted
behind your neck or
behind your head and so it's conclusion
time the verdict dear SL 5000 takes
comfort elements seriously with a nice
firm padded seat although quite high
side extensions that I wish for more
flat excellent backrest all around an
awesome adjustable armrest there are a
few imperfections on this pre-production
model that we were told will be fixed as
otherwise build quality feels good the
main hesitation I have with the SL 5000
is the PVC leather that is stain
resistant and waterproof but in my non
air-conditioned studio is just not
pleasant in this summer heat because of
the heat trapped on the seat overall I'm
happy with how they handle back support
and if we continue to see the same
direction from verdict year but with
different materials then this would
certainly cover a larger audience and
become a lot more competitive so guys
thank you so much for watching let us
