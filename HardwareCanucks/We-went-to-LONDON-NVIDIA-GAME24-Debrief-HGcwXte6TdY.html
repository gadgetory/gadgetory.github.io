teamed up for an awesome collaboration
to give away a core 3500 case along with
an 800 watt power supply to two lucky
winners click on the link in the
description below for the giveaway
details
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Heric
nux and the launch of invidious latest
iteration of maxvill GPUs really took
the world by surprise with its
outstanding performance per core and
also per watt and the International game
24 event was made to really celebrate
the amazing years of PC gaming plus use
this opportunity to launch those few
GPUs to complement the overall theme so
we went to London England which was one
of the European hubs for the event while
another was held in Stockholm and really
across the globe with game 24 livestream
kicking off in LA and bouncing through
Shanghai Chicago many other places and
finishing up in London the London gaming
crowd turned out to be quite awesome
plus we are met many viewers of the
channel to make our experience more
personal so thank you to everyone who
came up to say hello there are many
gaming stations set up starting with the
crew and for driving stations set up and
which you all for will linked up and you
could drive along with the stranger
beside you and really get a good feel
for how the game is that was very
arcade-like and perhaps a simple
controller station would have made the
driving experience more relatable to the
genre and I say this because they were
also showcasing project cars that's got
a bit more realism and with more
simulation feel with excellent weather
effects and proper damage to the cars so
perhaps a full steering wheel set up
there would have been more appropriate
for that title and not just joystick and
is just strange to see the crew getting
such better control treatment running
project cars was a properly utilized
Corsair seven ATT full tower with some
kickass hardware and 3-way SLI with GTX
980 there was a pretty sight and exactly
what the case was designed for next up
was Metro Redux where you play in a 4k
g-sync panel from Acer this survival
horror game that made some serious
history with its excellent storyline and
outstanding graphics but the Redux as a
reworked title with some new content
ant and the revamped graphics engine
with better textures and allows you to
play or to replay the game with some
extra eye candy we also saw a zombie
survivor title dying light it's not out
yet but it's coming out shortly it's
very similar to Dead Island the
mechanics auto now with more vertical
gameplay and really great sound engine
that made the terrifying screams of
approaching zombies from all the sides
truly impressive eval curry was there
with oculus holding the biggest line at
the event as everyone gets to try really
impressive space battle experience that
uses the head tracking on the oculus as
part of your missile guiding system and
actually tried it in monterey california
during editors day and have to say that
oculus dk2 is such an interesting
experience where the sense of scale with
higher pixel density and reduced latency
made this space flight game really
intriguing plus it's been in development
from the ground up directly for oculus
or at least so they say so this isn't
some sort of port but a truly designed
game for virtual reality we also saw a
battle of tanks it's running on gcing
panels you know it's like quite an old
game but with decent gameplay regardless
and finally the crowd was enthusiastic
with some onstage competitions and many
1980s nine 70s and some shield tablets
were given away that day to support the
gaming community and one thing that we
didn't see was anyone from the red team
despite of AMD's public attempt to
infiltrate into game 24 worldwide but
still it would have been interesting to
hear their perspective on the current
situation in actually speaking of
perspective how do you feel AMD will
respond to this launch and are you
actually considering to pursue the
latest Maxwell cards and did any of the
games interest you showcased in this
video so let us know with the comment
below and so that was game 24 London as
we wanted to give you a quick brief on
our visit in case you missed out on the
stream portion over
not able to attend it was very fun and
awesome to interact with our viewers so
until the next time thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next month
