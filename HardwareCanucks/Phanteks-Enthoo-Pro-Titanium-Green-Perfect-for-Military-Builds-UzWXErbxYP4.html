great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Harbor
Canucks and this is the fan --tx and to
pro the chassis of the year for 2014 and
we've awarded this case that particular
distinction because it has everything
that you ever need that covers all the
new friendly categories and all doing up
to the enthusiast level of building an
insane game machine inside this case so
an incredibly simple assembly process
outstanding airflow modular by design
one of the best cases for a new friendly
cable management and while it doesn't
look super unique
I had the important part it doesn't look
terrible
the reason it's on the review table
today is because fantex is introducing a
new color model into the mix so this is
the enter pro titanium green we don't
get many green options in the case
market especially this sort of muted
green or military green or olive green
however you see this color fit into your
spectrum as you would need to put this
next to other colors also to almost
realize the color of the exterior as you
can see the difference between the
titanium green versus the black define s
beside it and only when you have good
lighting shining on the case and it's
standing next to something like pure
black you kind of notice the difference
because once I turned off my studio
lights the case became gray this
titanium green would serve as an awesome
color choice for military theme builds
asus has a few excellent tough
motherboards that would suit this case
wall plus gigabyte has a few minor
boards on the green umbrella or if you'd
want to do a completely stealthy build
inside this case you can because the
internals are still black just like on
the other end two pros auto if fantex
only really has realized that this color
scheme is such an awesome military
themed build how cool would it be to
have matte black interior instead of
just standard slightly gloss
black and putting the system together
made me realize and remember how just
how enjoyable and simple and easy the
assembly process is with the end to pro
I actually used it inside the fury X
video just because I need it to offset
the top 240 moment of radiator so that I
could have enough clearance for the rear
exhaust fan because the fury X radiator
is kind of thick and because of the
extra reservoir spot you needed that
height advantage and you have that
perfectly accommodating for that type of
hardware no problem and I really really
love the power supply shroud and for my
PCIe cables I'd not use the cutout on
the shroud instead for more discreet
routing I used a few cutouts underneath
the motherboard and as for cable
management at the rear not a single
cable tie was used fantex has figured
out an amazing formula for case and they
are sticking to it plus we have a six
fan hub and velcro straps to hold all
the cables and something else that I
wanted to point out the side panels do
not sit on any hinges instead they open
like car doors after which they can be
removed that makes reinstallation really
simple and say you have a totally crazy
cable mess in there it's a lot easier to
compress everything with the side panel
when it's coming from that angle so
there isn't much else to say about the
fan techs and to pro titanium Edition
it's an excellent case and I'm happy
fantex has sort of reintroduced it to
the market in case you have forgotten
that this case exists which you
shouldn't have but for those on the
reader and looking for a new full tower
to house all your beautiful hardware and
have perhaps III on this green edition
you'd be happy to know that the price
remains the same as the original so
there is no premium just for the color
option and that's very good so I hope
you enjoyed this video make sure to
subscribe because we have the anther Pro
M review coming very soon and I will be
comparing it to define s from fractal
design because they hit
same price point and there are almost
kind of very similar cases on the
feature size things and we'll be doing a
showdown to see which one is better
which one is for you so I hope you enjoy
this video thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one so if you are in the market for a
new case right now and perhaps if the NP
pro was on your radar rater
if the enter promo is on your radar I
can't say radar alright there's a new
one if the enter Pro was on your radar
then oh my god I can't I can't
radar still Jesus man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
