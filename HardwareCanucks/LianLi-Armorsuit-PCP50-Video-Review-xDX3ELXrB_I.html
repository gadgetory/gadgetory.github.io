to get our hands on a truly enleat
chassis the armor suit PCP 50 the
company has literally dozens of products
in their lineup nearly everyone a hit
and it's name around the web is
synonymous with quality now what sets
lien leah part is they're classy styling
aluminum construction and detailed
features now all of this you ultimately
see recycled in most of their products
but hey why mess with a good thing this
particular case incorporates the
company's best features into an elegant
yet simple design that rings in at two
hundred dollars now while I may sound a
bit like a rabid fan boy it's a video
review so you get to see and judge it
for yourself and because it's Lee Ann
Lee we hold them to a higher standard
now the case is definitely more than
your standard mid-tower so let's see if
the craftsmanship and design is worth
the price now the front keeps a uniform
look with nine drive bay covers
including dust filters the top panel
hosts the power and reset buttons that
double as LEDs along with just a simple
audio and USB connections at the back
there's a 120-millimeter fan holds for
water cooling and impressive the eight
PCI expansion slots and a bottom mounted
power supply underneath the case is very
simple there's just rubber feet and a
mesh cover over the power supply that
easily snaps out here is one thing to
love above the pcp 50 everything is just
so easy to get to the side panels fit
perfectly and taking off the front and
top pieces to access fans clean filters
change drives requires no fiddling and
uses no screwdriver
underneath the top panel there are two
hundred and forty millimeter fans and
like all the fans they use Leanne Lee's
unique tulus installation system and
here's to show you just how lightweight
this case is but the quality
construction still remains at the front
of the case behind the bottom three
covers there's an intake 120 millimeter
fan so with things opened up we take a
look at the interior the bottom mounted
power supply sits raised on rubber pads
to reduce noise and there is venting for
airflow at the front three hard drive
bays that fit in a cage held in by thumb
screws up the back metal PCI clips the
120 millimeter exhaust fan with a grill
then to the front three empty five and
quarter inch drive bays and with three
more that use a screw loose clip design
and Louis the motherboard tray has cable
management holes along the side and the
back a very large opening for a cpu
cooler back plate now as far as room for
cabling is concerned there's a little
over two and a half or about an inch
between the back panel and the
motherboard tray which is going to just
be enough as we'll see later
moving on to the installation like many
of its cases Lee Ann Lee uses a
virtually to list design heck you can
even install the motherboard using
thumbscrews power supply has a retention
bracket that holds it surprisingly very
secure 11 inch long video cards like our
ati 5870 fit just fine and the solid
metal expansion slot clips are
undoubtedly the best of their kind on
any case we've seen they actually work
installing a rom drive just to simple
line it up and secure the tool list clip
however unfortunately our smooth
installation gets a little thrown off
track when we come to the hard drives
now I don't know if this is because the
PCP 50 was based on a little older
design or if it was the original
intention but you'll notice the drives
face front to back in a lot of more
recent case interiors we've seen the
move to drives facing sideways now the
problem is the straight back design
requires a lot of extra room to take the
drives out so you can see the problem
with a smaller mid-tower though in
Leanne Lee's case you can take the drive
cage out of the front but then you're
stuck having to unplug and pull out all
of the drives that are connected in this
case it just isn't very user-friendly if
you're going to be making any additions
later on with the drive cage out the
drives fit very simply into their tray
which then goes back into the cage and
then you have to go through the process
of reinstalling it all and putting the
front panel all back together as we
check out the wiring it actually goes
surprisingly smooth for a mid-tower one
thing I've never liked about aluminum
cases is with their thinner metal you
always wind up slicing and digits
somewhere in the bill lian-li however is
made sure that every single edge is
either rounded or as well softened to
avoid any mishaps wiring is fairly
logical the cable management spaces are
laid out perfectly but if you're intent
on cleaning up all of the wiring from
the bottom you will have to get creative
with your hiding spots the cables
themselves have no problem running along
the back of the motherboard tray if you
space them out but unused connectors
will have to be tucked behind the dried
basil where the power supply otherwise
the side panel just
fit
as far as water cooling goes don't plan
on any internal radiators at the top
there just isn't enough room to
comfortably fit anything and if you're
going to be fitting other things such as
pumps and reservoirs inside you are
going to be hard pressed for space so
that wraps up our review on the Leigh
Ann Lee armored suit PCP 50 case as
expected this case sticks to the
company's award-winning formula for an
excellently constructed mid-tower
they've included the incredibly handy
tool free features that really make
installation something you don't
actually mind doing and you can't beat
aluminum Leigh Ann Lee doesn't cheap out
and provides lightweight yet robust
material that is built in such a fashion
that things like the motherboard tray
and the case frame won't flex or feel
cheap along with that the exterior
design has a very professional feel that
allows many types of users to feel
comfortable with the look unfortunately
on the downside we would have liked to
have seen some interior improvements
that lien Lee has included with some of
its more recent cases the addition of
more than just three hard drives or at
least including some five and a quarter
inch adaptors would have been nice and
moving to a sideways mounted drive cage
system for a case of this size probably
would have been a smarter design at the
end of the day the case rings in has a
two-hundred-dollar mid tower which is
reasonable for aluminum but you're
definitely paying a premium for the
quality and aesthetics thanks for
