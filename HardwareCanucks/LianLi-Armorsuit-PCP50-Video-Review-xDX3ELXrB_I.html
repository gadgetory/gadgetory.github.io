to get our hands on a truly endless a
sea the armored suit pcp 50 the company
has literally dozens of products in
their lineup nearly everyone a hit and
its name around the web is synonymous
with quality and what sets lien Lee
apart is they're classy styling aluminum
construction and detailed features now
all of this you ultimately see recycled
in most of their products but hey why
mess with a good thing this particular
case incorporates the company's best
features into an elegant yet simple
design that rings in at $200 now while I
may sound a bit like a rabid fanboy
it's a video review so you get to see
and judge it for yourself and because
it's Lee Anne Lee we hold them to a
higher standard now the case is
definitely more than your standard mid
Tower so let's see if the craftsmanship
and design is worth the price now the
front keeps a uniform look with 9dr Bay
covers including dust filters the top
panel hosts the power and reset buttons
that double as LEDs along with just a
simple audio and USB connections at the
back there's a 120 millimeter fan holes
for water cooling and impressive the 8
PCI expansion slots and a bottom mounted
power supply underneath the case is very
simple there's just rubber feet and a
mesh cover over the power supply that
easily snaps out here is one thing to
love above the PCP 50 everything is just
so easy to get to the side panels fit
perfectly and taking off the front and
top pieces to access fans clean filters
change drives requires no fiddling and
uses no screwdriver
underneath the top panel there are 240
millimeter fans and like all the fans
they use Lian Lee's unique toolless
installation system and here's to show
you just how lightweight this case is
but the quality construction still
remains at the front of the case behind
the bottom three covers there's an
intake 120 millimeter fan so with things
opened up we take a look at the interior
the bottom mounted power supply sits
raised on rubber pads to reduce noise
and there is venting for air flow at the
front three hard drive bays that fit in
a cage held in by thumb screws up the
back metal PCI clips the 120 millimeter
exhaust fan with a grill and then to the
front three empty five and quarter-inch
drive bays and with three more that use
a screw loose clip design and louis the
motherboard tray has cable management
holes along the side and the back a very
large opening for a CPU cooler backplate
now as far as room for cabling is
concerned there's a little over two and
a half or about an inch between the back
panel and the motherboard tray which is
going to just be enough as we'll see
later
moving on to the installation like many
of its cases Lian Li uses a virtually to
list design heck you can even install
the motherboard using thumb screws power
supply has a retention bracket that
holds it surprisingly very secure 11
inch long video cards like our ATI 5870
fit just fine and the solid metal
expansion slot clips are undoubtedly the
best of their kind on any case we've
seen they actually work installing a ROM
drive just as simple line it up and
secure the tool list clip however
unfortunate installation gets a little
thrown off track when we come to the
hard drives now I don't know if this is
because the PCP 50 was based on a little
older design or if it was the original
intention but you'll notice the drives
face front to back in a lot of more
recent case interiors we've seen the
move two drives facing sideways now the
problem is the straight back design
requires a lot of extra room to take the
drives out so you can see the problem
with a smaller mid Tower though in Lian
Lee's case you can take the drive cage
out of the front but then you're stuck
having to unplug and pull out all of the
drives that are connected in this case
it just isn't very user-friendly if
you're going to be making any additions
later on with the drive cage out the
drives fit very simply into their tray
which then goes back into the cage and
then you have to go through the process
of reinstalling it all and putting the
front panel all back together as we
check out the wiring it actually goes
surprisingly smooth for a mint Tower one
thing I've never liked about aluminum
cases is with their thinner metal you
always wind up slicing and digits
somewhere in the bill lien Lee however
is made sure that every single edge is
either rounded or is well soft and to
avoid any mishaps wiring is fairly
logical the cable management spaces are
laid out perfectly but if you're intent
on cleaning up all of the wiring from
the bottom you will have to get creative
with your hiding spots the cables
themselves have no problem running along
the back of the motherboard tray if you
space them out but unused connectors
will have to be tucked behind the dried
basil where the power supply otherwise
the side panel just
fit
as far as water cooling goes don't plan
on any internal radiators at the top
there just isn't enough room to
comfortably fit anything and if you're
going to be fitting other things such as
pumps and reservoirs inside you are
going to be hard-pressed for space so
that wraps up our review on the Lian Li
armored suit pcp 50 case as expected
this case sticks to the company's
award-winning formula for an excellently
constructed mid tower they've included
the incredibly handy tool free features
that really make installations something
you don't actually mind doing and you
can't beat aluminum Lian Li doesn't
cheap out and provides lightweight yet
robust material that is built in such a
fashion that things like the motherboard
tray and the case frame won't flex or
feel cheap along with that the exterior
design has a very professional feel that
allows many types of users to feel
comfortable with the look unfortunately
on the downside we would have liked to
have seen some interior improvements
that liyan Li has included with some of
its more recent cases the addition of
more than just three hard drives or at
least including some five and a quarter
inch adapters would have been nice and
moving to a sideways mounted drive cage
system for a case of this size probably
would have been a smarter design at the
end of the day the case rings in has a
200-dollar mid Tower which is reasonable
for aluminum but you're definitely
paying a premium for the quality and
aesthetics thanks for checking out the
