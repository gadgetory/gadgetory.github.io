ox and one of the reasons why I haven't
fully utilized my spare parts for my
second workstation PC is because there's
not that many compact cases that can fit
a full array of ATX parts without
compromising on something and here I
have a full ATX board a power supply and
980ti dual SSDs on the hard drive and
the H 440 that could be its new home but
it's a little bit too big so let's try
this new rio toro case but can it handle
my needs let's find out the kraken x 61
liquid cooler by NZXT features variable
pump speed to high static pressure 140
member fans and beautiful user control
through the camp software click below to
get crackin and so this is the CR 1080
it's priced well for what it offers as a
concept a compact enclosure with fine
space efficiency for ATX builds and I'm
showing it next to the H 440 since I
would consider that to be a well sized
mid tower and the CR 1080 next to the
extra 40 is not bulky in any way and the
thickness difference is not really that
significant and so the this case comes
at a perfect time when people are
looking to downsize without compromising
on any of the ATX hardware that they
have available and so it looks like
cases are becoming smaller as the GPUs
and are starting to look like one
another - I love the simplicity of the
exterior with perforation and they think
the Stelter behind it but really dislike
the glossy plastics that immediately
take away the quality points from a $79
case now many of you will see the bulge
on the clear side panel and say it's
ugly but it has somewhat of a purpose
it's there to make sure that there's
enough clearance for the GPU cables and
potentially taller CPU heat sinks but
you see it only covers the bottom three
PCI slots and bulges out after the thumb
screws which means GPU is taller than
the reference PCI brackets will not fit
with the side panel as with the case
with Jack the panel simply will not
close the top IO is outlined with a red
perimeter that matches the text color at
the front we have power reset to dual
USB 3 and audio plus we have a
ventilation for the GPU at the top
that spans both compartments but without
a dust filter which is definitely needed
here
the only removable dust filter that is
magnetic is found on the other side
panel for the power supply it's nice but
not including it anywhere else is a huge
bummer behind the front panel are dual
120mm our mounts only a single blue LED
fan is included so I think real Toro
needs to work on their design cohesion
there is an optional 80 millimeter mount
for the smaller chamber plus a five and
a quarter inch drive bay which is a
fantastic addition to see you know
fitted inside such a small case and here
we have a better view of that chamber
separation with the power supply on its
side and the main compartment just
slightly wider with another 80
millimeter fan mount disappointingly
only two PCI brackets are reusable which
is so unusual at this price point
Andrea Toro cannot succeed on the frame
alone we need to see their quality
standards raised at the bottom our case
feet plus ventilation for dual 120mm
fans again no dust filter here for the
bottom and finally here's the interior
with well-placed cutouts on top and
bottom with all the drives and plenty of
cable space in the chamber behind after
putting in my components I was both very
pleased at how well everything fit but
again disappointed at the lack of
optimization of this could be fantastic
frame design this case clearly supports
a 120 millimeter all-in-one but it
covers the only cutout on the side of
the motherboard so you must route the 24
pin and PCI cables through the bottom
cat out leaving no room for anything
else
I had to route my SATA cable through the
top cutout which doesn't look very good
there should be additional openings
where the five and a quarter inch drive
bay would sit to allow better routing
between these two chambers if and on one
is used now if you are going just for
air cooling you'll be fine plus there is
enough high clearance for setter fans at
the bottom although no dust filter which
makes it an undesirable choice the rear
chamber to the most part is fantastic
with power supplies up to 175
millimeters supported we have a nice gap
underneath the unit to route cables into
the other chamber plus plenty of space
in front of it and all this drive
compartments is
nice this plastic caddy pops out just
like so that supports an SSD and then
there's the swirl bracket that opens
wide for cable access with dedicated SSD
spot on the back with a hard drive or an
SSD support at the front so you can have
up to two hard drives or up to three
SSDs now you can still open it with all
the cables connected and none of your
drives have to be disconnected when
cleaning cables behind it and I would
love to see more like it
the only underutilized space here is
that five the quarter inch drive bay
that I wish was somehow modular so the
space isn't wasted if not user populated
and finally here's my compact
workstation build complete with standard
ATX components and I absolutely love the
frame separation and quite happy with
how this turned out but this feels like
a product in beta with just how many
little things that need to change for
this to be worthy of the asking price
like inclusion of dust filters proper
PCI brackets a side panel bulge that has
appropriate function and also better
color coordination and finally no
crappie gloss and all those things that
I just mentioned would make the CR 1080
such a better case I'm not mad at you
real Toro I'm just disappointed I'm
three Tripp direct max thanks so much
for watching we'll see you in the next
