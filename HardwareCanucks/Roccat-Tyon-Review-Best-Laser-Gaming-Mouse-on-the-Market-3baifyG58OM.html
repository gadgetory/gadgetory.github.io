great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dimitri with
Huracan oxen we've noticed that gaming
peripherals from Roccat have been slowly
saturating the North American market the
company stands behind in quality designs
with excellent responses from gamers on
all fronts of products but especially
with their mice so one of their latest
gaming mice is the rocket ion a well
placed and competitive mouse that will
for sure attract a lot of attention
despite the $99 price tag so let's take
a look at the form first everything from
the extremely comfortable thumb rest
with a coarse texture to keep a solid
grip to the slight curve on the right
side and the appropriate height of the
tie on are all indicators that rocket
knows what they're doing within this
category
ergonomics are well executed with a
solid structure at the hundred twenty
six grams this seems to be that perfect
balance between offering a comfortable
handling experience regardless if you're
coming from a much lighter or a heavier
Mouse the button layout and execution is
also impressive all the usual buttons
have great actuations primary left and
right click travel easy enough but do
not allow accidental presses the scroll
wheel is by far the best I've tried with
really indicative scroll steps that I
love plus it's light enough to be
pressed without disturbing your grip or
aim during game the two extra buttons
beside your point finger are well within
reach and the angular shape helps you
find those buttons quickly and naturally
while the ones on the opposite side for
your middle finger do require some
finger learning by thanks to tall
buttons they do become more natural to
use with time there are plenty of
commands at your thumb and it's exactly
this button layout that will
differentiate the tie on and help it
stand out among many other gaming mice
the usual browser buttons are fine with
distinct click but soft actuations then
we have the tilt button that is placed
right above the thumb with smooth travel
in either direction and returns to the
center when released and for gaming I
really found this helpful were the
in your sights you know for your scope
and it's especially awesome for piloting
to adjust you altitude and your otter
there's a fence which behind the scroll
wheel for use by either your point or
middle fingers but it was really out of
the way for comfortable reach and was
left unused most of the time however one
of the best buckey's additions on the
taeyeon is the EZ shift+ located right
underneath your thumb it is kind of part
of the frame and part of the curve to
support the thumb but it is low profile
enough for easy reach this allows
secondary commands to be mapped onto all
your mouse buttons when the easy shift
bus is active adding a ton of extra
functionality to your mouse so this is
especially cool if you have a
complimenting rocket keyboard for extra
awesome productivity however with some
quick button mapping you could eliminate
the use of a keyboard entirely for a lot
of functions both for gaming on
productivity and this is exactly how
button remapping should work and here's
a quick test on how each of these
buttons sounds
so the tyonne is a laser mouse using the
pro aim r3 8200 dpi sensor while
tracking performance was pleasing I do
still prefer an optical alternative like
my nail 7000 that I really have gotten
accustomed to but smooth tracking is
possible throughout the entire dpi range
and I had absolutely no problems with
aim neither in-game nor while editing
the trick here for laser minds is to
decrease sensitivity and increase dpi
for precision and accuracy the lighting
additions on the tile are actually quite
cool with a single continuous LED strip
covering the bottom rim illuminating the
surface underneath along with a well-lit
scroll wheel the lighting is vibrant and
bright but most importantly it is color
accurate if you said the color is orange
it will be orange and not some weird
yellowish green stuff plus you can set
any type of effect you may wish for from
us or breathing effects too fast color
shifting plus an extra cherry for those
with Alienware machines they recently
announced a collaboration with Alienware
to incorporate alien effects to work
with the broken peripherals and moving
on to the software it is very well
designed with so much control under your
fingertips sensitivity scroll speed
horizontal tilt speed dpi sensitivities
for up to 5 fast steps
double-click spend easy-to-understand
button mapping with the top-down view
and side view for standard button
assignments and that easy shift plus
mapping macro manager is here with some
pre-loaded most used actions on some
applications like for shop and office
and many others but with a very limited
gaming selection so you will have to
create your own which is not a big
problem now under the advanced control
we have liftoff distance that is really
important and surface calibrations for
the sensor polling rate sound feedback
that is ridiculous 8200 dpi
6400 dpi but good serve helpful for dpi
and profile changes and perhaps even
trophy notifications as broke out
includes and built in a word and
tracking system for the mouse color
control as mentioned before is flexible
per zone with various lighting effects
and all that is safe per profile on the
mouse thanks to the built-in memory
requiring no software installation if
you move between pcs so this is the most
comprehensive driver software you can
find for a gaming mouse and so at the
end of the day the rocket iron is one
attractive Gaming Mouse for an extremely
comfortable handling experience a load
of programmable buttons along with that
easy shift plus that doubles the
functionality of each buttons for aiming
gaming in productivity purposes with
excellent actuations we have also the
best scroll wheel on the mouse period
the laser sensor is great so are the
lighting portions of the body and
intuitive software to pack it all up for
a really awesome gaming mouse now there
isn't particularly anything wrong with
the tyonne but the lack of an optical
option is disappointing considering how
many gamers are now switching towards
optical sensors including myself and the
fin switch up top in the mouse behind
the scroll wheel it wasn't comfortable
to use plus I would love if the software
window could be expanded a little bit to
have a less crammed UI but despite all
that we would strongly recommend the
rocket iron for all users on the market
for a mouse that practically has it all
and we're giving you the harbor Canucks
damn gonna warden and well that is it
