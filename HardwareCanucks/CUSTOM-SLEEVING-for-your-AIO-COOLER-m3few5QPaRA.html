some LED lighting maybe your hardware is
all perfectly matched maybe you have
some cable extensions in there to make
things look pretty but how do you take
that customization to the next level and
so I recently built this thing it's a
very open enclosure meant to be really
for showcase pieces only and of course I
used my cable as leaving from cable Mon
but it needed something extra and this
is exactly where the new AIO sleeping
comes into play it's pretty awesome
let's check it out
all right so qiyamat is expanding their
product portfolio with addition of a a
of sleeving so you can cover up those
boring black tubes and have unique color
coordination with the rest of you system
now obviously compatibility is important
so they cover most Corsair NZXT and EVGA
tubing including the hybrid variations
of the graphics cards and currently we
have five colors available with
expansions further on I do love this
color selection they're not ugly in any
way even the neon green has its place
the red is dark and rich with good
vibrancy and I love the medium blue that
to me is the perfect shade and then
there's the whites leaving that this
perfect white no yellow or orange is
peeking through
and finally the dark gray that has that
dual black and gray combination and
looks pretty sweet of course you can mix
the colors if it fits your style and
budget and they're currently a few
combos available with different color
combinations so you get two sleeves and
four brackets in total to secure the
ends that corresponds to the larger
Corsair tubing or the smaller NZXT slash
EVGA coolers now you already saw the
open style build where the red sleeping
on the tubes complements the rest of the
color scheme very well and you can still
tell that this is an AO but the full
system almost resembles a custom loop
because the tubing is so different with
this next build I went with a simple
white and blue approach and this is a
pretty common scenario with the color
coordination with the sleeved extensions
and some accented LED lighting super
clean but adding white AO sleeping that
matches the rest of the sleeved
extensions gives us that extra cohesion
element between components I really like
how the sleeping looks on the thicker
Corsair coolers it almost makes the
tubes the centerpiece of your system
while the thinner and more flexible NZXT
tubing allows for a more wavy look that
has a slightly longer span but a little
bit more discreet and my final system I
put together is a good representation on
what's possible with the entire
portfolio from cable Monde since you can
pick up extensions that match exactly
the color of the aao sleeping and have
that as your dominant accent color
without introduction of RGB lighting and
these
entrance share the same mod mesh
material that creates these beautiful
bands I got the GPU and the motherboard
extensions all ready to go and I even
installed their new aluminum thumb
screws of the same color that looked
fantastic
and so this is this leaving tube with an
overlapping seam in the middle that you
can easily hide when it's on the tube
itself then we have these plastic
brackets that they're used to hold and
hide the end tips of the sleeving
because without them it really doesn't
look that great and when installed the
kind of reassembled water cooling
fittings to an extent but of course they
are plastic and don't look as premium as
true water cooling fittings now I think
this is the most challenging part of the
sleeving because there's a particular
way to install these plastic clips that
attach into each other and I would
recommend to practice a little bit on
how they attach without the tube first
because they are difficult to install
alright so now let's do a demonstration
on how to install these things I'm using
the x52 NZXT cooler with a slightly
slimmer tubing let's use red sleeving
because of this motherboard layout so
installation the actual sleeve is very
simple you just kind of put her on
expanded a bit and you can you don't
have to be super gentle with it because
the sleeving is very tough and it won't
rip so far I haven't seen any damage
because of my application even though
I'm stretching it and everything like
that so once you apply it you can see
there's once one sleeve that has to go
over the other to cover this seam and
there is a bit of flexibility in terms
of maneuvering this sleeving so that the
seam is out of the view in terms of an
installation of the clips for the for
the clamps so you just have to make sure
that there's enough space on both sides
and installation of these things yeah
I've realized the good way to install
them but in the beginning it was a
little bit frustrating and figuring out
how to do it so with a slightly thicker
part that goes towards the radiator and
that goes as well towards the pump so
the slightly thicker part is the bottom
and you just simply kind of clamp them
together and they don't have to be
perfect and I realized that once you
clamp them if they're not fully aligned
all you'd have to do is start to rotate
it while holding the sleeving and that I
found to sort of latch on itself so
right there we go
once it starts - sometimes it does
produce that clamping noise sometimes it
doesn't
these are handmade samples and they are
not perfect but gives you a good
representation on how clean the whole
system will look after the the sleeving
is applied so now the they're not fully
clamped but with my system of rotating
it let's see what happens then boom
alright
we heard the clamp now I found the
isolation of the sleeping tubing to be
as simple outside the case as it is on
the inside of the case you just have to
make sure there's a little bit enough
room for you to install there the ending
clamps and that's like the little bit
more challenging part when you're
dealing with inside the case but okay
yeah the rotation method works really
well I just discovered it and because of
these handmade samples they do catch on
some of the threads but because the
sleeving is actually very tough I have
not seen any fraying or damage to this
leaving even closer to the edges so
that's really good
boom alright so that's that's it that's
installed right now I just have to make
sure that all the clamps are completely
secured and no sleeping is visible and
there you go beautiful system with a
your sleeved on my x52 color matched and
in terms of reinstallation so for
example if you want to remove them it's
simply about opening up the clamp and
they are very tough plastic and I've
opened them like I said over 20 times so
they have not shown any signs of wear
and these are handmade the final
production models will be even tougher
and more high quality in terms of how
they will sort of latch together but
once you remove the clamps all you have
to do is simply just to remove this guy
and there you go naked
eh oh now a few more tips I can mention
with the clips as to have only a small
overlapping portion of the plastic clip
over thus leaving to make sure the clips
fully attached into each other and
remember to use the rotation method to
get those small clips to align properly
I've also discovered secondary used for
these sleeves for cable management since
they expand without losing tightness
and you can easily route cables inside
of them I just routed my cables and that
open style PC and it worked wonderful
using both the Corsair and NZXT sleeping
for larger and smaller collection of
cables so I'm hoping that we'll see more
refined sleeves just for keyhole
management perhaps with some channel
cutouts so cables can exit at certain
links but as it stands right now these
al sleeves deliver very unique way for
color coordination they pave the way
forward that looks outside of the
traditional RGB lighting illumination or
color coordination scheme for most
builds and now you can use actual
sleeved extensions and sleeping on your
tubing for the ãao that that are the
centerpiece in terms of color now the
are priced at 22 95 per set so it is
quite pricey so you decide if that's
worth the customization element they add
to your system and I'll leave Amazon
purchase links in the description below
so how do you guys like what you saw
here today what do you think of my
system that I used you know the blue as
the primary accented color with this
white theme I really love the system and
what color would you like to see added
next for there aeo portfolio let me know
