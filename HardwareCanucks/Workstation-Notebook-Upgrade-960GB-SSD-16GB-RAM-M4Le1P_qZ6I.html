hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Hera
Canucks and the little while back we
uploaded the workstation PC upgrade
where it was a simple case swap for my
workstation PC I added some extra SSDs I
replace the power supply did some stuff
with cables but that is the machine that
is currently powering all my rendering
and all my editing needs and that is
machine that is sitting behind me that
is actually making this video possible
because this video is being currently
rendered on that workstation PC but we
as editors required to hold that
rendering power not only just in the
offices where that workstation PC comes
in handy but also when we travel to
events like Computex CES III and GDC
where we require to render things
on-site and bringing external computers
and monitors are just not the
possibility so we rely on machines like
these to do the job for us and so in
today's video we'll be upgrading the
stock configuration on this eurocom m5
pro machine that has an excellent GPU
and the CPU and you can check out our
review of this machine by clicking on it
but it's got a painfully slow 7200 RPM
500 gigabyte hard drive and only eight
gigabytes of RAM that is enough for
gaming and just regular tasks but Adobe
After Effects just eats through memory
like it's for lunch and so we will be
upgrading this machine with something
else and so for this upgrade we'll be
putting in to Neutron XT SSDs from
corsair at 480 gigabytes each giving us
close to one terabyte of storage which
is perfect considering an average the
size of each of our review projects or
the videos that we publish Rainier is
anywhere between 20 gigabytes to 70
gigabytes and some projects even go into
100 gigabytes of files because of all
the 4k footage that we get and I will
need fast drives to speed up my workflow
especially when working with Premiere
after facts for the memory upgrade I
have a 16 gigabyte vengeance kit so they
are 8 gigabyte modules at 1866 megahertz
speed here really doesn't matter for me
but what matters is low voltage of each
module at one point 3 5 volts and so the
next thing we need to do is open this
baby up and populate it with this
hardware
and so now that everything is in place I
really hope you enjoyed the footage and
the sort of the quick upgrade process
but after I put everything in together I
want to do another battery test to see
if the lower power consumption of the
SSDs and maybe potentially the the
addition of an extra eight gigabyte
would contribute to better battery life
and I am NOT super happy to report there
is a battery loss I still get over three
hours an hour browser usage scenario but
I lost about maybe 10 minutes versus my
previous battery test that I did
initially when I received a notebook but
aside from that everything is now super
snappy I mean one terabyte of SSD
storage so I can continue with my
expected workflow when they're working
with premiere and After Effects and
check out the drive speed comparison vs.
the 7200 rpm drive and the new of course
their Neutron XT SSDs and so this
concludes this workstation notebook
editing machine upgrade I hope you
enjoyed next thing for me would be to do
some physical maintenance on this
machine if possible like replacing the
brushed aluminum front front plate over
here and also on the lid just because it
catches fingerprints so easily any time
I have to bring this guy on camera I
really have to wipe it but see if I can
find in some way to cover that up with
maybe carbon fiber or something like
that
and also another thing find a way to
strengthen glid because it's so thin
like paper it's very it is whirring
every time I travel with this and when
it's in my backpack whenever things are
compressed I'm really worried I mean
check this out just in our review that
was one of the things that I mentioned
to be a major concern for me and if you
guys have any ideas on how I can
strengthen the lid without modifying the
physical dimensions of it just because
this still has to close down like it
does but if you have any suggestions let
me know in the comments below I hope you
enjoy this editing workstation notebook
upgrade thanks so much for watching and
we'll see
in a next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
