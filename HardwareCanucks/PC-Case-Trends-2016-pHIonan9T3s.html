ox &amp;amp; Computex is a great place for
picking up market trends so in this
video we'll be talking about PC case
trends for 2016 if you love what you see
from the show Nvidia fantex NCIX and msi
made the show possible so what are the
more common patterns here the glass or
other materials that resemble glass for
side panels we saw this with pretty much
every case brand we visited solely in
these new selection of cases is going
after the similar dual chamber case
design that we've seen in the past with
a gorgeous glass exterior but total
frame size has been shrunk every new
BitFenix case has a tempered glass panel
on and there's definitely something
about this direction to make cases look
more attractive again obviously the
focus here will be to showcase your your
hardware and your cable management
skills but it also adds a level of
quality to the frame when the guy when
the glass is involved now I hope this is
not an excuse for a sudden spike in
prices because glass is involved and
that's true that is an expensive element
but I hope we don't spiral into this
inappropriate pricing category because
everybody is using glass a perfect
example here would be with cooler master
master case five Pro wear if you were to
buy the case and then decide to add a
tempered glass side panel later on that
optional side panel is $50 for one panel
of course if you were to buy the case
with a tempered glass initially it would
be cheaper but that is one premium on
top of the case price already then
there's companies like Thermaltake with
a total transparent side panel that
isn't glass of all it's actually an
acrylic piece thus reducing the cost and
while you can definitely notice the
difference in reflection between glass
and non glass I think it's a fair
compromise then it's a matter of side
panel mounting and how do you create a
more convenient mounting method
everybody right now is using the four
thumb screw method which is fine but
it's a little bit uncomfortable to
install so if you were to create a more
convenient and more sturdy mounting
for class that would be fantastic and
also please backwards compatibility with
cases that are coming out with glass now
versus the exact same frame that you
bought a year ago I would love to see
this backwards compatibility so that
users don't have to opt out for a
totally new enclosure for wanting just a
glass side panel my 3 favorite cases out
of the show are the dark base 900 from
be quiet thanks to the removable
motherboard tray it can be inverted for
an upside down system and the same
applies for the hard drive cage the side
panels and even the power supply
mounting is flexible it can like shift
to the side depending on which side you
have the system on then on the opposite
size spectrum is the streak on dpu 4
which is a tiny in a gorgeous ITX
enclosure that is modern it's simple
with clean lines it's aluminum and on
the inside it's a fan --less case it's a
fan 'less system so the CPU block
actually connects to the side panel for
cooling and then the third case that I'm
most excited about is the fan Tech's
elite it is a very expensive enclosure
at $6.99 it is a very large enclosure so
it's like a full Tower plus like a mini
pedestal underneath but everything that
fantex is approaching this you know very
high-end enthusiast type of enclosure is
taking into account everything that
those people would want to see from a
case in terms of assembly process the
modular aspect water cooling support you
can do dual systems into it and I think
they'll be introducing a lot more new
kind of standards on what we can expect
at that price point and that is awesome
because we need to establish certain
standards for cases so that other
companies can follow and the thing that
fantex is a perfect company to do
exactly that the one thing that I was
surprised to not see is more focused for
ITX systems we saw some here and there
but you know everybody was mainly
showing off giant bigger cases for
towers mid towers and I don't think it's
a limitation for hardware because we
have quality ITX motherboards and a few
ITX GPUs but let me tell you this 4c
yes you guys going to see some fantastic
very unique ITX enclosures that have
good graphics card support proper
motherboard support for ITX obviously
and that is very exciting I hope you get
the hint I'm Dimitri with our Canucks
thanks so much for watching what was
your favorite case trends coverage part
from Computex let us know in the
comments down below and we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
