great technology selection and service
the Google Nexus 6p has been sparking
the internet since the launch as the
best Android smartphone to buy nearly
every aspect of this device has been
designed with the user in mind this is
the flagship of the Nexus line so here's
everything you need to know about the 6p
let's start with the price it costs $500
for the 32 gigabyte base model 549 and
649 for the 64 and 128 gigabyte variants
respectively there are three different
color choices you can pick from starting
with aluminium graphite and frost it
comes unlocked directly from the Google
Play Store so if you're switching
between carriers often rejoice Google
decided to partner with Huawei this time
a Chinese company that has been getting
some attention lately
with some of their flagship phones like
the mate s the 6p on the other hand is a
completely different design from its
predecessor the Motorola Nexus 6 I say
this because I was very surprised with
the build quality of the 6 be out of the
box the whole body is crafted in
anodized aluminum but be careful with
handling because the hefty weight of
about 180 grams and the smooth aluminium
equates to a slippery body google has
also launched a new warranty program
called the Nexus to protect pricing is
at $70 for the Nexus 5x and $90 for the
6p it adds an extra year protection for
manufacturing defect and two years of
protection for product damage like drops
spills and cracked screens which might
be a good idea to future-proof any
unforeseen issues
let's talk specs we have a snapdragon
810 processor 3 gigabytes of RAM 64
gigabytes of internal storage in this
model twelve point three megapixel
rear-facing camera with an F 2.0
aperture dual front-facing speakers a
massive 3450 milliamp hour battery and
last but not least a beautiful crystal
sharp 5.7 inch AMOLED display with a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 speaking of
the display it's a maze
to be honest this is my first time using
an AMOLED panel and I noticed a huge
difference between it and the IPS LCD
screen on the Moto G you can see
yourself how much screen real estate you
get switching to a phone of this size
texts are sharp viewing angles are
top-notch with deep blacks and the
colors seem to pop out really well I had
no issues of viewing the screen in
daylight with brightness set to about
70% and if you're like me and consumed a
lot of video content through your
smartphone you are in for a treat with
the Nexus 6p especially with the dual
front-facing speakers that are loud
enough with great projection the twelve
point three megapixel shooter sits
behind a glass panel that adds a unique
form to the body but maybe first to
crack if we dropped pictures coming out
of the 6p are as expected really good
the dynamic range is excellent with just
the right amount of sharpness I mostly
took these with HDR plus mode turned on
and I never ended turning it off since
the pictures looked really good I'll be
it it does take a few seconds to process
but the end result is worth a shot low
light performance is excellent with HDR
on and this helps clean the noise the
sensor does have the ability to shoot 4k
at 30 frames per second and 240 frames
per second in 720p but it doesn't come
with built-in optical image
stabilization yet it heavily relies on
software here are few samples
I am a huge fan of stock Android and the
6p delivers exactly that it's clean and
works just as it should without any
carrier bloatware it runs Android 6.0
marshmallow and since this is a Nexus
device it will be the first device to
receive software updates directly from
Google performance is very satisfying
the Snapdragon 810 paired with three
gigabytes of RAM goes along really well
with Android marshmallow opening up apps
are fast the on-screen keyboard response
is fast I can run 20 different apps at
the same time without experiencing any
hiccups one of the most unique features
built inside Android 6.0 is the new
battery saving feature called dillos
essentially it sets certain sensors to
sleep when the device is idle and that
significantly helps with the standby
time of the 6p you can leave the phone
unplugged throughout the night and wake
up in the morning with just a few
percent dropped and combined with a
massive 3415 milliamp hour battery one
full day of heavy use is a piece of cake
and even if the phone is about to die
you can charge it for 10 minutes that'll
give you an extra six to seven hours of
use thanks to the new USB type-c
connector that supports quick charge I
think Google bit the bullet a little
early going with USB type-c connector on
the 6p not every local store would carry
spare type-c cable if you end up miss
placing it and the chances of borrowing
it from a friend is very low plus the
lack of wireless charging is a bummer if
that were to be your backup plan it's
also hard to find accessories that are
compatible with USB see chances are you
may end up buying adapters to make them
compatible but on a positive note
it's future-proof reversible and
supports fast data transfers I guess we
will have to wait and see how time
catches up with the standard covering
the essentials call quality has been
very reliable I had no complaints from
people hearing me on the other side
speakerphone is loud if you decide to
use it thanks to the dual front-facing
speakers the fingerprint sensor on the
back is a nice addition
and Google Casa the Nexus imprint it's
basically the fastest and most reliable
way to log on to your device and with
Android pay right around the corner this
is the best way to secure payments and
that's basically the story behind the
Nexus 6p I think that it would be an
excellent by considering the solid build
beautiful screen excellent camera
top-of-the-line specs a fingerprint
reader awesome battery life and my
favorite part clean
Android it's certainly a damn good
smartphone to get thank you for watching
this video guys what are your thoughts
on the Nexus 6p would you consider this
a solid upgrade let us know with a
