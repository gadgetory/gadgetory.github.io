canucks and I battle against cords has
been a constant quandary with
convenience coming at the cost of
quality jaybird has been a strong player
in the bluetooth earbud market for quite
a while now with the blue bar ex and ex2
lineup being exceedingly popular for
those active and on-the-go
now jaybird is introducing a new lineup
the freedoms these are smaller in pretty
much every way than the x2 is except for
the price at 200 dollars these are
pretty expensive and that's gonna be a
hard cost to stomach for many users the
jaybird of freedom aims to combine an
extremely compact wireless design with a
focus on audio fidelity and active use
the freedom does serve by integrating a
battery and a Bluetooth 4.0 module into
the design they are supposed to appeal
to anyone looking for form and function
but a $200 price tag may be a hard sell
for some folks in the nicely designed
box we have our ear buds and a selection
of accessories there's a nice camera
pouch the charger and micro USB cord
shirt clip and cord management clips
three earbud wings and six ear tips
three of these ear tips are rubber but
Jaybirds also includes three sizes of
comply firm tips in the box it's a nice
accessories kit but let's focus our
attention on the buds one thing is
certain the jaybird freedom's look great
we've got this tiny curved body for the
buds which make them look miniscule when
compared to other wireless solutions
they're sleek and they've got an extrude
as far from the ear thanks for that
small form-factor allowing for excellent
helmet compatibility and minimal visual
intrusion rather than removing
components to achieve such a small
footprint Jaybirds shifted the wireless
components into the volume control hub
creating this slightly bulkier hub due
to the battery this is where you charge
access for here in control and pair them
I still can't get over the remote hub
though while it works as intended it
doesn't feel like an elegant solution
its weight makes the freedom's have this
weird imbalance with the right side
pulling more heavily than the left and
aesthetically it leaves something to be
desired the design of the jaybird x2
with the internals in the earbuds will
probably still appeal to many people
making the freedom less of a replacement
and more of an alternative the freedoms
hefty $200 price tag is a hard sell
especially when jaybird themselves still
have the extra
for 150 dollars and you can pick up the
original blue bulbs xfer only 80
honestly even with the freedom around
the older models that are still at their
current price that being said there's
gonna be a market which appreciates
these earbuds this small form-factor
will fit easily in your pocket and the
13.8 gram weight means these are perfect
for any activity no cord leads to
ultimate freedom of movement and if
you're working out in the gym you can
place your phone beside you which allows
for far greater freedom the Bluetooth
experience is seamless too once you've
paired it initially you can simply power
on the earbuds and they'll connect
instantly I didn't experience any odd
dropouts or signal degradation through
my time with these the most notable
trade off for the freedom is their
battery life j-bird advertises up to
eight hours like their x2 line however
that number is a bit misleading as it is
including the charger due to physical
restrictions jaybird could only squeeze
a 125 milliamp hour battery into the
freedoms amounting to an advertised four
hours of battery life so they included
another battery in the charging cradle
thus giving the eight hours since you're
not going to be keeping the cradle on
you should think of this as a four hour
device with an external battery bank on
the note of the cradle while it's very
small and portable it's also very easy
to lose and because of the proprietary
nature it's the only way to charge these
earbuds so keeping it safe is important
the upside of the battery life is that I
actually got closer to five and a half
hours of battery we're constantly high
listening volume and after an hour and a
half the cradle had fully recharged the
buds for most people this will be fine
but do expect to have to charge these
every couple of days if you use them
frequently while the earbuds are nice
and small I found that the fit wasn't
quite right for me of course this is an
extremely subjective thing and different
earbuds will fit different people but
for me I couldn't get a snug fit the
included comply tips were disappointing
compared to my experience with their
tips on the shure se215 and I just ended
up using the rubber ones the fit was
alright but I never felt like there were
that secure which is a big issue when
active the upside to this is that
jaybird includes these wings for
additional security and in my experience
they work really well
holding the earbuds in snugly even when
on the move however they do add bulk to
the form factor and they make the
earbuds less comfortable for extended
listening another trade off some might
not
appreciate however you won't find any
problems with the sound I'd wager these
are some of the best sounding Bluetooth
earbuds on the market vocals sound
natural and clear
bass is controlled but definitely
present high sound great and mids are
definitely defined as well now the right
ear tips will make a big difference so
make sure that you've got the white
right ones that fit but when they do
these definitely sound great noise
isolation was average they don't isolate
a whole lot of background noise which I
was disappointed with at first but then
I realized that's probably a good thing
if you're out running or riding you'll
be able to hear your surroundings out of
the box these sound quite flat and
neutral which isn't common of most
mainstream focused earbuds and I was
quite surprised and it only gets better
once you grab Jaybirds my sound app here
you get EQ controls and you can tune the
earbud sound signature to your
preference many people won't enjoy the
neutral sound signature so I loved
having the option to completely
customize it and now it's down to
nitpicks for $200 I want a polished
experience and for the most part that
jaybird freedom delivers I did have some
little issues though and most of them
were centered around control of the
device the first issue is with the
buttons the volume and play/pause
buttons are really mushy and without
looking at them it's hard to tell if
they're being actuated I'd prefer much
click here buttons to more easily
distinguished presses volume control is
another issue although this is partly to
do with Android on some devices you'll
find clunky control with independent
volume on the freedom and on the device
then with the latest Android M update
you get simplified control but the
volume steps are too big meaning that
it's either too quiet or too loud you
can't adjust volume on the earphones
when no meteor is playing you just get a
frustrating warning hopefully volume
management can be resolved in an Android
update or a workaround from jaybird at
$200 the jaybird freedom is gonna hit
your wallet hard but you'll likely find
value in them the excellent in their own
domain but when you remember that you're
paying $50 more for effectively worse
battery life for that smaller form
factor it might be hard to stomach keep
an eye out on Jaybirds previous products
with the x2 and bluebloods x4 better
bang for your buck if your wallet is
larger than these earbuds and you can
sonic their small quirks then the
freedom might be the one for you so
