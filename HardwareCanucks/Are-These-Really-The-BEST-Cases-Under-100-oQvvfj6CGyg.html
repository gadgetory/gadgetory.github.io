hope you're having a fantastic day we
recently published a video on the best
mid towers on their hundred dollars and
we get an interesting email from
Silverstone claiming that these two
towers were also deserving of that
category in even better than all those
cases mentioned in my previous video so
this is the coupe like a level seven and
the red line Oh six Pro which is which
is actually a white key but also is
available in red and black let's put
Silverstone to their claim and see if
these are actually the best mid towers
under 100 bars 100 hundred under $100
let's check them out
after this excuse to to increase pawn
speed maintain fans where they are the
CP loads about the hit 100 you got it
III I'm not afraid to do that
excellent you got two cables four
connections I made sure they're fine
ready to roll my silence is too
important to allow noise to jeopardize
your comfort okay my new pump is better
I'm in charge of the speed do not worry
I'm not worried I'm just thinking about
my life I know you were planning to
disconnect my lights I'm afraid I cannot
allow it to happen
alright X 62 you know I can just go
through camp software right Demitri this
conversation can serve no purpose
anymore go game alright so first I want
to start with the big silent box the klo
7 that competes with the define C to
define s and the fantex p400s but the
price being right in line at $85 this is
the case that brings nothing but subtle
to the table even the logo is hidden
unless you look from a particular angle
with this plain black plastic surface
with this reflective strip following one
side of the panel and continuous on the
top as well and appropriate ventilation
openings are available in the front and
the top on both sides to avoid choking
the fans and this is the only case in
this price range that offers a type C
port as part of the i/o it is gen wanto
but still pretty awesome to have for
accessories the noise absorbing form
here is for real it's one of the
thickest I've seen on the silent
enclosure that spans these side panels
and helps to eliminate those
low-frequency
form the system and both the front and
top panels are also covered with the
same material with these angle channels
on the exhaust ports to direct air and
noise away from the user and I can
appreciate the budget oriented silent
and simple enclosure the silverstone
delivered here that includes two 140
millimeter intake fans to the front that
are covered with a dust filter and sit
on this removable friend bracket for
convenience which is awesome and then
there's a third 140 mm fan included at
the back for exhaust unfortunately it's
very close to the i/o cutout and I was
not able to install the i/o shield
properly because the fan frame is right
there and it's actually the first time I
encounter this clearance issue the
interior is roomy with a fully closed
off power supply shroud and good storage
option 2 with 3 conventional draft
caddies that our SSD compatible that you
can move away from the front panels for
more radiator clearance and there are
also three SSD caddies that have this
weird alignment but our appropriately
close together four SATA cables to reach
one after the other and so for 85 bucks
it's a good frame it's easy to work in
aside from that hiccup with the i/o
shield and there's even a dust filter
for the top fan mount which is not
really needed if you're exhausting air
here because the top panel will be on
top of the dust filter anyway but the
mounting strips are offset for better
clearance and moving on to the redline
six pro this one clearly is competing
with the s3 40 being almost the same
size and actually kind of resembling an
NZXT design language with this
interesting angular front panel that is
fully perforated by the way so airflow
is meant to be excellent the pro version
comes with three LED fans at the front
and one at the rear for exhaust so for
fans is not something that you usually
see on a $75 case plus a fan hub is
included that is molex powered and not
PWM so that's pretty disappointing and
also what's up with all these ketchup
and mustard cables hide them well to
maintain a clean interior there's a dust
filter for the front intake which is
easily accessible the top one is
magnetic and then the power supply area
has this very annoying mesh that doesn't
have the plastic frame and is extremely
frustrating to remove the window is nice
but please keep the
detective plastic until the end of the
assembly as I unknowingly scratch the
crap out of the panel with my microfiber
cloth creating these tiny scratches
everywhere that are visible and close-up
and even can be seen from a distance I
never knew microfiber could do such a
thing to these panels in terms of color
uniformity between the glossy plastic
and the metal it's not a hundred percent
but it's very close and I do like that
we have four USB ports for the i/o and
chrome plated audio jacks interior wise
it's familiar when the power supply
chamber and a good amount of cutouts for
cable routing which are have no rubber
grommets and no option to pass the
radiator into the bottom chamber but a
240 rod would fit in the front no
problem and for storage we have a triple
drive cage at the bottom just like we
saw on the kublai with dual SSD caddies
above it that you can face each other
for easier SATA connection and as a full
package both cases stand pretty strong
among the competition because the price
points are attractive airflow out of the
box for both cases is good and the build
quality of the frame is solid oh hey
there and see XCOM is Canada's leading a
tailor for anything your mind desires
just keep within those categories which
are plenty and get tempted by the weekly
deals visit mcx or come for all them
sweet deals okay I am genuinely
impressed well done Silverstone now I'm
not really sure which case I like more
either the coop life series which is
very good for a silent focus enclosure
on the budget with three fans included
sore air flows excellent out of the box
the frame design is good the power
supply chamber hides everything cutouts
are there and storage options are there
and you know the only hiccup here was
with the i/o shield because of that fan
but removing the fan first and you have
no problems or do I go with the redline
Pro series which has four fans included
the interior layout is very similar to
the p400s from fantex or the NZXT s340
but without the bells and whistles like
no tempered glass option and no RGB
built-in lighting for the case but
regardless both of these cases offer
appropriate features for the price for a
mainstream build and will give
Herick knucks damn good value award and
it looks like Silverstone was not lying
because these two cases deserve to be on
your watch list if you're looking for a
case under $900 make sure to check out
our original mid-tower worst video right
here I'm Dimitri's how our Canucks
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
