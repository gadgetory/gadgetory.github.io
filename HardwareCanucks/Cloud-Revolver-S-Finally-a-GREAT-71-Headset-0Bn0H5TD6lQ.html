axe and gaming headsets have always been
an interesting point for debate in many
cases the word gaming is simply attached
to a product to make it sound more
appealing to gamers a good example of
this would be when you take a certain
product especially in the headset space
where low quality sound is usually
combined with a terrible microphone to
create a product that's somehow supposed
to appeal to gamers the number of crappy
headsets we've come across is incredible
this is where the cloud revolver asks
from hyperox comes in two things this is
the flagship headset in hyper access
line up both Dimitri and I have reviewed
a number of HyperX cloud headsets and
I've linked some of those down below
this one is a little different because
of the s in its name which stands for
you guessed it surround basically this
headset shares the same design and
drivers found on the original revolver
but it comes with a plug-and-play Dolby
Surround 7.1 module and a few changes
which we'll talk about shortly
price-wise you're looking at a $40
premium over the original revolver so
it's priced similarly to the launch time
G 533 wireless gaming headset that we
looked at recently so is it worth
spending $150 on the revolver s let's
find out now from a design perspective
the S model looks like the original
revolver headset but if you pay close
attention to the fine details they've
eliminated the plastic and glossy finish
on the ear cups and replaced it with a
soft touch rubberized material it
certainly adds a layer of premium
quality but I'm worried about it varying
off over time so I guess we'll just have
to wait and see
you'll also notice that HyperX have
replaced the red accents with white and
this includes the headband stitching the
headband also happens to remain the same
from the original revolver so why mess
with a good thing right back when he
reviewed the original revolver Dmitri
pointed out that the metal frame
observed sound which was the most
annoying factor of an otherwise
comfortable pair of headphones HyperX
addressed that issue by adding these
rubber inserts at the corner which are
supposed to reduce vibrations but
unfortunately they didn't do the trick
either and I still got some
reverberations to the headset this
shouldn't happen but it isn't unique to
the cloud series either since many
headsets with this type of metal frame
design and a self adjusting headband
exhibit we've herb from the core
through the metal band into the ear cups
on a positive note the overall clamping
force is minimal but still secure thanks
to a wider headband HyperX is also well
known for these signature memory foam
found on your ear pads so if we're
talking comfort this thing gets a solid
10 out of 10 from my perspective just
make sure to vent your ears occasionally
since their clothes back nature of these
ear cups can cause a buildup of slant
out of the box you get a few accessories
like a 2-meter splitter cable the
detachable boom microphone and a 2 meter
USB cable with the plug-and-play
surround module which is the main
selling point for the revolver s the
microphone is detachable and it plugs
into the headset via a 3.5 millimeter
connector it's also fairly easy to
maneuver around although it cannot
retract like the one found on the launch
tanks g5 33 had said either way it's
there if you need it or if you don't you
can just unplug it and store safely just
don't lose it the microphone which you
can hear me on now features noise
cancelling characteristics and as you
can hear it does a really good job
isolating background noise well it
sounds a lot better than the g5 33
headset in fact I'm typing on a
mechanical keyboard featuring Cherry MX
blue switches which do exhibit quite a
bit of noise and the noise canceling
technology almost removes the crackling
my voice sounds natural and boomy
without it being nasally so that's
awesome the cable coming out of the
headset is approximately a meter long
plus it's reasonably thick braided and
flexible which is awesome it's also
pretty short especially if you plan to
route it behind your PC but this was
primarily done to provide cost
compatibility with Xbox one ps4 Mac
mobile devices and even VR headsets the
shorter cable will definitely help with
cable management in those situations and
if you do plan to route it behind your
system the provided extension cables are
more than long enough to do the job and
now let's talk about the main selling
point of the revolver as gaming headset
which is this plug and play USB dongle
and features a high quality sound
processor which also happens to process
the Dolby Digital surround sound it's
pretty straightforward you plug in the
headset to the unit and this gives you
access to volume adjust for both the
headphone and microphone there's also an
equalizer button that cycles through
three different presets starting with
bass boost then flat and finally vocals
you can easily monitor that through the
three individually
LEDs last but not least you'll find the
microphone mute button and the star of
the show the Dolby Digital 7.1 which
turns red when enabled the thing goes
for the microphone so when you enable
this feature the USB dongle uses the
integrated DSP to menu play these stereo
drivers on the headset to mimic a
surround sound environment and let me
tell you it is an immersive experience
log gaming I've tried the virtual
surround sound feature on the g5 33 and
it had a similar experience as the
revolver S especially to take advantage
of games that have compatible sound
engines playing battlefield one which is
still one of my favorite FPS titles
sounded amazing
you get a good sense of positional
awareness the footsteps fell closer
while gunshots were bumi and powerful
due to the headsets excellent bass
response one major advantage of having
proper virtual surround sound is the
ability to track and lock your target no
matter which direction they're coming in
from and the revolver as delivers a
fantastic experience while gaming when
you switch back to stereo mode it almost
feels incomplete and it loses the
purpose of purchasing the headset in the
first place because it was designed for
virtual 7.1 surround audio now the only
time I turned off this feature was when
listening to music I like my tunes to be
imaged by two channels and surprisingly
the revolver s does not disappoint here
either higher frequencies were clear and
well-defined without any distortions the
lower ends were powerful but if you
prefer to tone that down
leave the Wii Hardware preset on the
dongle mentioned above could come in
handy so what can we take away from the
HyperX cloud revolver as a gaming
headset for $150 you will have to think
twice before pulling the trigger because
first of all you need to appreciate
virtual surround sound and use the
feature on a regular basis the HyperX
cloud 2 with 7.1 surround sound
runs for about $100 and like Dmitry
mentioned in his original HyperX
revolver headset review I find that
there's better value with the original
HyperX cloud headsets
simply because they're designed well and
you don't get the annoying metal frame
on top of the headband I really dislike
this feature really the only reason why
one would choose the revolver s over the
regular headset would be for the
slightly wider frame that would fit
larger heads and at this price point
you're entering the wireless realm so
it's between this or the g5 33 which
also delivers a fantastic
virtual transplant experience but with
the convenience of being Wireless which
one would I pick will neither because
personally I prefer a stereo experience
to something like a virtual standpoint
once on stage but make no mistake about
it the revolver s can deliver an
excellent stereo experience if necessary
but you want paying such a high price
for something like a 75 to $100 headset
can provide the Sennheiser GSB 300 and
the HyperX stinger can all be found for
less and while they don't feature the
fancy surround sound setting they are
priced well and they sound awesome so
what are you guys think of the HyperX
revolver asked gaming headset would you
spend $150 on this or are there any less
expensive alternatives that you might be
interested in let us know in the
