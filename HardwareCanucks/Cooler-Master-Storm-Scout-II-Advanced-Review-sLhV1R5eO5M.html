has progressed forward and really stands
out when comes to computer chassis they
really focused on the mobile gamer with
plenty of cases to choose from starting
from the trooper to the Scout showing
off your rig outside of your house has
never been easier but to a master isn't
stopping just yet and are expanding
their Scout lineup with this Scout to
advanced now this is targeted at mobile
gamers it takes the same concept from
the original Scout and refreshes it with
a more modern design and released at $99
for the black version and $10 extra for
the white of course it would be awesome
if they were priced on par the white
option however is very attractive and a
really awesome consideration is keeping
the interior all black I'm glad to a
master opted for this combination of
color as it makes your cable job a bit
more aesthetically pleasing the front
panel has three optical base with dual
120 millimeter front intakes and a
built-in dust filter for the front panel
the top connections are hidden behind a
slide cover very useful during transport
so we have our audio ports and four USB
ports of course there's no reason to
include USB 2 s as USB 3 are backwards
compatible the power reset and fans LED
buttons are large and bold exactly how
we like them now this case is really
made for a mobile gamer for one the
reinforced steel handle is attached
directly to a steel frame really sturdy
throughout and the rubber coating is
always welcome for a tighter grip and to
complement the carrying handle is its
relatively small size Coolermaster
managed to tone down the case without
compromising its ability to house
enthusiast hardware the top mesh is
removable which allows for easier
installation of the optional dual 120mm
fans and the mesh also acts as a dust
filter now I'm not sure what Co master
was thinking in terms of securing this
mesh with six clips not only does it
make a tedious process to remove but it
also denies a push configuration if you
decide to water cool a pool setup is an
option but this means the motherboard is
slightly to obscure the radiator but of
course removing the mesh completely will
allow you to install the rat in a push
configuration and looking in the back we
get our water cooling holes and a
standard exhaust seven PCI slots
including the storm guard security that
allows you to lock your peripherals to
your case and it has sort of become the
staple for all CM storm products and a
removable dust filter is included right
beneath your power supply always a
pleasant sight to keep your system dust
proof a windowed side panel along with
two fan mounts is a nice addition
although they are placed a bit too low
for cooling GPUs installed in the top
four slots now personally I don't mind
the extra cooling potential but we
really need to see more revealing side
panels without any fangirls to show off
your hard work and enthusiast hardware
and finally getting inside it's a
welcome sight to see tooless optical
Bane mounts the hard drive cage below
supports seven drives in total four at
the top and three at the bottom now we
only get two SSD brackets and the 3.5
inch drives are secured with these tools
clips that in fact pull the drive quite
well the two internal 120mm fans can be
installed one on the caged wall and the
other fold the bottom intake which also
has a removable dust filter now cool
master has made it possible to expand
the clearance on your GPU by removing
one the cage walls simply with four
screws of course this is not the most
ideal solution as the front wall still
restricts plenty of airflow it would be
nice if cool master integrated thumb
screws and perhaps a full removable hard
drive cage and looking at the back we
have cable tie mounts spread out and
logical manner with large quality rubber
grommets to guide all your cables and
installing our 11 half-inch monster we
are pleased to inform the cage wall fits
in place like it should meaning you
don't have to compromise on storage with
powerful GPUs now you do miss out on
that cage
and fortunately all right so let's check
this out
the coolermaster storm Scout 2 delivers
an exceptional mobile package with a
sturdy steel handle and the
complimentary small size this however
does not mean a lack of features but a
well-designed interior space to suit
your gaming hardware with long GPUs
plenty of storage and the entire build
that cleaned up very well despite my
lousy five minute job what I really
don't like is the top mesh cover they
really could have gone with a simple
clip that would allow a push
configuration for your radiator and the
single removable Kage wall is welcomed
but it does not solve for more clearance
for that front intake and also charging
$10 extra for the white version I would
call unfair for those of us who want to
stand out but nevertheless it's an
overall upgrade from the original Scout
and we're giving it the hardware canucks
damn good at word so thanks guys for
watching and we'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
