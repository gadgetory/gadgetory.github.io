new wireless mouse from Logitech but
this isn't your typical gaming mouse
that comes with RGB lighting a high
performance sensor or gaming looks that
some people are fond of Logitech has
their own division for those type of
products and if my memory serves me well
I think we've taken a look at most of
their gaming products so if you're
interested I'll leave links in the
description down below this my friends
is the new MX master 2s now you may
recall the MX master mouse that was
released a few years ago and as you can
see the new model clearly resembles the
old one in every matter at least from a
physical standpoint but the new guy has
a few tricks up its sleeves let's take a
closer look right after this explore
your future with the cosmos 2 case and
celebrate 25 years of ambition that
drives Coolermaster forward enjoy the
familiar yet still forward-looking
character of the frame with solid
aluminum handles it may be the most
physical you'll ever get with the
computer case but it's all worth while
or gets creative put any of the 13
storage options that encourage outside
the box thinking meanwhile the curve
temple glass panels on both sides
ensures a lasting impression classically
trained but still ready for anything the
cool elastic cosmos - lets celebrate the
past by building for the future ok so
there's a lot to talk about this mouse
let me kick things off with its price at
$100 it should be considered as an
investment for your daily computing
tasks because it offers everything that
an average consumer would need given its
flagship status in Logitech's
performance line up
they've even covered users who are
looking for a budget Wireless solution
like this
m5 90 for $40 the m7 20 Triathlon for 50
and a slightly toned-down version of the
MX master the MX anywhere 2 s for $80 my
first wireless mouse was this guy the
performance MX by Logitech and I love
using it ever since the time I bought it
this months was organically perfect for
everything ended back in the day I took
it with me to school it was my daily
driver for a few months when I started
working for hardware connects producing
videos but eventually Dmitriy shed his
light on optical gaming mice and I
switched over instantly but I think that
would be a cool topic for another video
if you still own one of these leave a
comment down below describe your
with it so far and I'm looking forward
to those responses now coming back to
the MX master 2's Logitech has
maintained a similar design language
from its predecessor the MX master to be
more specific you get the same
handcrafted design geared towards users
who prefer a palm type grip I have large
hands and I was comfortably able to wrap
my palm around the body and here's a
shot of it sitting next to the g4 3 as
you can see they are similar in length
so users with smaller hands won't have
an issue reaching the two primary
buttons the button layout hasn't changed
whatsoever compared to the MX master
you're getting the same 7 buttons in
total including the primary left and
right scroll wheel button the hyper fast
scroll button that we'll go over shortly
forward-backward button thumb scroll
wheel and the gesture button under the
thumb rest this has been integrated
since the performance MX and they've
included a lot of cool commands that
users can take advantage of on both the
MX master and the master 2's for example
I've set it to expose my virtual
desktops within windows but you can also
assign media playback commands to it
for instance play/pause gets activated
when the button gets pressed holding
that button while moving the mouse up or
down adjust the volume respectively and
doing the same from left to right skips
or forwards your playlist
that's hands down an amazing feature to
have an Emmaus
in my pain from a design perspective
this is one of the best-looking wireless
mouse I've seen so far it's elegant it's
simple doesn't look aggressive and that
means it should be able to fit in with
your death setup especially if you're
walking a minimal one obviously the
convenience of being Wireless is a bonus
for Mouse of this caliber and they made
a few adjustments to the sensor to make
it more appealing for users with
multiple displays for instance the
sensor can go all the way up to 4000 dpi
versus 1600 on the previous model now
that high sensitivity is still way
overkill for my dual monitor setup
because I'm more comfortable browsing
around at the 1600 to 1800 dpi setting
but like I said earlier people with
three four or five screens can take
advantage of the sensor really well now
one of the main selling features with
regards to any MX master mouse including
the performance MX is the ability for it
to track on virtually any given surface
be it your furnished wooden floors paper
carpets and even glass
thanks to logitech's darkfield
technology
sensor tracks based on micron size
particles which appears larger to the
sensor and it calculates it precisely
well the MX master 2's on the other hand
comes with an infrared LED technology
that comes with an optical lens so that
basically means that the sensitivity is
going to be a lot better compared to the
previous generation now tracking for the
most part felt similar between the two
in my experience and that's partly due
the cloth mousepad that I was using to
test these when switching to rougher
surfaces the difference is fairly
obvious and then thanks to the highest
sensitivity on the MX master 2's it's
obviously nowhere closer to the
responsiveness of my g4 3 and what I
meant by that was that the pinpoint
accuracy when playing games or even
trying to select certain tools within
premiere were noticeable but again you
have to consider that the g4 3 sports a
precisely tuned optical sensor that's
superior among both MX master mice but
if you're spending the majority of your
time editing videos or doing a de
productive tasks apart from gaming and I
repeat apart from gaming the MX master
2s and the standard MX master should
serve you really well the buttons on
both these mice felt similar as well
they exhibit great tactile feedback with
excellent travel distance for actuation
I love the signature hyper fast scroll
wheel on both mice and the smart shift
technology is a subtle but amazing
implementation for instance when you
enable the switcher through software the
scroll wheel default itself to exhibit
defined small steps like this but when
you force your way through excel
documents or a long webpages it
automatically switches to the fast speed
mode or the fast spin mode and I think
that's pretty awesome so you don't have
to hit the hyper fast Go button to
enable that feature it's automatic and
it works wonders I also loved using the
horizontal scroll wheel when editing
videos being able to scroll from side to
side from your timeline in premiere or
any other productive application is so
beneficial and it could potentially save
you a lot of time do note that it's just
a scroll without click and it's not
defined as the vertical scroll wheel but
rather it's very smooth and pleasing to
use with applications what got me the
most where the forward and backward
button placements on both the MX master
and the 2's now I'm coming from the G
403 that has a fairly simple and larger
button layout
but the buttons on the 2's were a little
too small for my taste
and it wasn't a seamless experience
switching between them on the other hand
the gesture button right underneath the
thumb rest is an excellent
implementation on both models they work
just as they should and Logitech has a
handful of commands that can be assigned
to this button so the user has full
control of customization which is
awesome moving on to battery life and
it's another selling feature for the
master 2s there's a 500 milliamp hour
battery just like its predecessor and
it's supposed to last for 70 days versus
40 on the MX master we were told by
Logitech that they've implemented a few
hardware and software optimizations to
get that claim it charges via micro USB
plus it supports fast charge this time
so you'll be able to quickly charge it
for a day of use in just three minutes
and that's according to Logitech there's
also a little battery indicator beside
the thumb rest that activates when you
turn on the unit the software only
displays three bars and less depending
on the remaining battery life but I
would have preferred a percentage
indicator perhaps a software update
Logitech yeah now I still have to
validate those claims because I've been
using the master to ask for about a week
now and it's still staying strong so I
guess we'll have to see how it lasts in
the long run but I'll make a follow-up
video on that the fact that it lasts
longer than my 3d a power-hungry g4 3
and not needing to recharge the master 2
as for a couple of months is so
refreshing
I wish Logitech implemented a USB type-c
port for charging because it's slowly
starting to becoming a standard now so
perhaps we can expect that in the next
revision the last thing to cover here is
the software experience just like
typical Logitech fashion it's a much
simpler UI with basic controls and I
like what they've done here you've
greeted with a physical overview of the
mouse where the user can assign commands
to any of these 6 buttons the point in
school tablets you adjust the
sensitivity set directions with regards
to scrolling both vertically and
horizontally enable or disable the smart
shift feature that I talked about
earlier along with its sensitivity and a
few more settings the lack of a visual
indicator for dpi levels is a bit
disappointing but I think I'm spoiled by
reviewing tons of gaming minds now let's
talk about Logitech flow feature because
it's one of the most important selling
points for the MX master 2's it's
basically a cross computer control and
file sharing system
baked into the software and it only
works with the master 2s so the regular
MX master owners will be completely left
out of the equation it's pretty simple
to set up all you need to do is install
logitech's option software on the
desired computers of your choice and
there's a limit of three in my case I
was using the unified receiver to pair
the mouse to my desktop and bluetooth on
my laptop make sure that all the
computers are connected to the same
network as this feature heavily relies
on both the network and the switching
mode built into the mouse the software
guides you really well to the setup
process and after completion the mouse
automatically switches cursor movements
between computers by moving into the
edge of the screen it's a seamless
transition and works really well as you
can see the user can arrange their
screen orientation for those quick
switches you can also copy and paste
documents from one system to the other
mind you that only works with the
right-click functions on the mouse
rather than the keyboard shortcuts
because the mouse acts as a gateway in
establishing that center point when
communicating between systems
transferring files depend on your
network strength but overall I'm very
impressed with this implementation the
2's does support both the Mac and PC
platforms
plus the dpi scaling shifts
automatically when switching computers
and I didn't experience any bugs so
that's awesome now if you're not a fan
of flow you can always disable that
feature and use this button to switch
between systems flow is just an
automatic switcher but keep in mind that
the copy and paste feature will be
disabled it's time to take illumination
seriously with vengence RGB ddr4 memory
by Corsair with incredibly bright LEDs
and uniform color spread add a touch of
classic color that is fully software
controllable and compatible with a wide
variety of intel and AMD platforms more
info in the description below alright so
I think it's about time to gather my
concluding thoughts on the MX master 2's
from Logitech you see this mouse is
intended for a different type of
audience and gamers are certainly not a
part of that you know people who work
with a lot of numbers scrolling through
Excel documents long PDFs and long
webpages or basically anyone who values
ergonomics should get the MX master 2s
or even the MX master both of these are
identical from a physical standpoint but
the newer one is supposed to last a lot
longer in a single charge it also comes
with a higher dpi scaling and it's
towards lobster-claw software so if you
value that then this might be a great
option and now price-wise the MX master
can be picked up for around 70 dollars
at least at the time of making this
video but I would wait for the 2's to go
on sale because that's likely going to
happen given a logitech's history with
sales on the MX master if you're looking
for a smaller version of the MX master
2's the MX anywhere 2 s is a great
option plus it comes with the same
sensor as the master 2's and support for
flow so that's awesome well that
concludes this video I hope you enjoyed
this comparison between the MX master 2s
and the MX master what do you guys think
of these mice for example do you value
flow or just flow interests you at all
