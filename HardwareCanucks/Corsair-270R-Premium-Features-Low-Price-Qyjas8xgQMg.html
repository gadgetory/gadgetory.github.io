to be exact
hey you want another case from you it's
a Corsair isn't it you 270 are you
arrived oh but first a message from a
sponsor the z9 neo-byzantine features on
a budget with a large window side panel
5 included fans and the excellent
interior layout with super simple cable
management get it now link in the
description below what's up everyone
this is Dimitri and in just one day
Corsair launched three cases the
beautiful but disappointing 570 X is
smaller 460 X that is awesome but with
some unnecessary compromises and now the
270 are from the Carbide series a case
meant to tackle the budget category at 6
9 bucks for the base model and the
$10.00 premium for the windowed side
panel and to me some elements on this
case are actually better implemented
compared to the other two releases now
first of all it's very basic reminiscent
of the defined s from fractal design
kind of boring plain solid plastic front
panel with intake on the sides there are
coarse dust filters that are not
removable they are installed on every
open section on the front panel
there's also power supply desk filter
and weirdly despite having no visible
damage on the box you can see the front
panel sustain the pretty heavy hit
bending the ventilation a little bit we
can blame the courier since the fragile
sticker is on the box and from personal
experience receiving a damaged case is a
very rare instance moving on the i/o is
possibly in the worst location on the
right side away from the window panel
and I don't really understand this
location as a positive toll all the
cables are routed directly to the back
of the case but it's right beside the
drive caddy so installing a three and a
half inch drive there will interfere
with this flock of cables top IO is
definitely more convenient but let me
know if you guys share the same thinking
and up here we get dual 120 or 140 no
more mounts with flexible Strix but the
lack of a dust filter is off-putting I
can handle the weak metal frame but even
if you were to populate to exhaust fans
there's still a lot of area for dust to
settle through I understand the need to
create
sort of feature separation from their
more expensive cases like the 400 C
which has basically an identical top
panel but with a magnetic dust filter
and I'm all for case category separation
but please please do not remove the
basics to hit a specific price point on
the positive note though the power
supply shroud which looks very similar
to the one on the more expensive 570 X
is actually so much better
weird how some features on the $69 case
are more refined compared to something
that cost 179 dollars first there is a
cutout below the model board which is
always so handy for routing and the
shroud is also closed off with this sort
of mesh looking thing visually blocking
the cables inside of it large portion of
it is also ventilated to allow a power
supply fan to be facing up and the main
interior frame
I actually really like there's a lot of
room the right side is lifted which is
better for cable management and the
middle standoff catches the motherboard
which I always appreciate for airflow we
have two fans one rear exhaust and a
transparent front intake which is a red
LED fan I honestly rather have extended
black fan that have this inconsistency
of color the front can house a 360
radiator with support for dual 140
melmer fans both top and bottom of the
interior frame have good cutouts for
cable routing and at the rear we have
two large caddies on the left side
accompanied by two SSD caddies in the
center and what's strange to me is
Corsairs inconsistency on dry storage
it's always something different
although the caddies on the 270 are are
my favorite the side panels are quite
bendy but with self catching screws
always appreciated and size wise it is a
mid Tower
slightly shorter than the s3 40 but
longer at the front which is good for
front radiators and that seems to be the
trend with Corsair as top radiators are
not compatible with anything other than
low profile Ram my vengeance LED ram for
example as you can see prevents any fans
from being mounted on the radiator so
fans only at the top is suggested if you
don't have low profile ram and because
of this I move the radiator to the front
which this case accommodates very well
but consequently I also have to relocate
the LE
defend to the top which again highlights
the wrong decision for them to even
include an LED fan in the first place
now thanks to the smart shroud design
everything is super clean no cables
poking out and I'm honestly surprised to
see this shroud design on a 270 R again
because on the 570 X we don't even have
a lower cable cut out and so the
two-seven yard is targeting that clean
and simple builder who don't mind having
empty pockets of space inside the case
as a drive cage could easily fit in the
bottom at the reader cleaning cables is
a piece of cake very quick job to make
things as flat as possible even if you
populate all the storage slots and to me
the 270 R is a response to the rising
demand of this type of open and
minimalist layout the closest competitor
would be the P 400 series from fantex
it's similarly priced yet superior in
feature set including case lighting and
the top covers with magnetic dust
filters you could also look at the fine
s from fractal design that has more
storage capacity plus that module and
system in the top which i think is the
biggest drawback of the 270 are having
no dust filters at the top so dust will
just percolate through and perhaps
because it's ten dollars cheaper than
the alternatives this could be coarser
strategy to lure in those budget
customers but it's not a welcome one
from my point of view and to conclude a
message from our sponsor oh hey there NC
XCOM is Canada's leading eat tailor for
anything your mind desires just keep
within those categories which are plenty
and get tempted by the weekly deals
visit NC x dot-com for all them sweet
deals and that concludes this review
