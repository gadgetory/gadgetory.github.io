the camera usually yeah there's one over
there
anyways probably wondering why I'm here
and why I'm sitting next to the Corsair
obsidian 700d case if you haven't
already seen the video review for it you
should click on the annotation it should
be somewhere on that if I remember
anyways we were cleaning up the harbor
connects filming studio this weekend and
there's a lot of clutter in there and we
figured what better way to get rid of
the mess then hey let's just give it
away so that's what we're gonna do this
is your chance to get your hands on the
Corsair obsidian 700d it's the
previously reviewed case and here's how
to enter it's very very simple first
subscribe to the hardware connect
youtube channel so if you're already
subscribed and you're halfway there
second in the comments for this contest
video just let us know what you have
recently upgraded in your computer or
what you're looking to upgrade in the
near future and if you're running a
laptop or a pre-built system or just
don't plan on doing any upgrades just
let us know what your existing system is
now unfortunately contest is only open
to residents of Canada and the United
States
we appreciate you international viewers
just the shipping logistics of something
this big kind of makes it not feasible
otherwise we're going to be doing the
draw on June 23rd of 2010 and the winner
is going to be contacted through their
youtube account so make sure that your
email address is up-to-date otherwise
that wraps it up I'm going back to that
side of the camera where I feel a lot
more comfortable and thanks for
subscribing guys we do appreciate it and
we'll catch you on the next video review
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
