today we're talking about the
SteelSeries apex Pro keyboard with new
omni point switches now we have done
several videos on the keyboard and the
switches during Computex you can check
it out over here but now that I've
actually had the keyboard in my studio
for about a week I've been using those
switches and I can finally make up my
mind of what I think about the omnipoint direction
by the general overview of the only
points which is is that there's a magnet
at the bottom there's a magnet in the
stem and when you press the switch it
creates this magnetic flux what they
call it which means that you can measure
that flux and through software and
through different calibration processes
you can change the actuation point on
when that key is registered from point
four millimeters to three point six
millimeters which gives you that whole
range of movement and when that key is
registered so you basically can create
your own speed switch or going something
with a little depth for typing you know
all the way up to three point six which
means that you're most likely will have
to bottom out in order to activate the
switch it is important to know that the
Hall effect switches are nothing new
this is not something that SteelSeries
has patented and in fact we've seen this
sort of actuation customization via
wooden one keyboard under wording two
keyboards VR the flare tech switches
which are optical so there's a laser and
could detect how much distance is passed
between the stem and the bottom so the
Omnipoint direction with magnets is
kind of better in a way because we have
a much larger range of actuation
customization but this isn't something
that still series invented so I want to
clarify that there and overall I'm
pretty happy with the execution of the
omnipoint switches but it is an
expensive keyboard for $200 or the $180
for the TTL version and there's also the
apex 7 which is a non-key point switches
and the price is slightly reduced so
welcome to my full review of the apex
Pro let's begin after this excuse me
please explain is easy to systems fully
powered by a single power supply just
like me and you two bodies powered by a
single mind just imagine the good we can
do the revolt X by fantex a high
performance unit for multi CPU GPU
and dual system configurations with
80-plus platinum efficiency with
entirely silent fan mode and 12 year
warranty and clean cable management
explore the opportunities with the
revolt XPS you buy fan tax links below
so before we get into the meat of the
Omnipoint switch let's talk about the
board itself I love the low profile
nature of the actual frame no excessive
pieces sticking out above the F
nothing on the sides nothing from the
spacebar
I love the low-profile nature and the
really smooth and magnetic rest rest
wonderful execution over here we do have
a USB pass-through on the top left that
is illuminated which is why the cable is
so thick that is one disadvantage I
would say it'd be nice if the cable was
removable but you can route it across
the bottom of the keyboard to channel it
in whichever direction you want the
keyboard feet have one angle orientation
which is nice however they're not strong
enough so if I push the keyboard from
the front they might collapse and that
has happened to me many times and this
stabilizes one end of the keyboard and
completely messes up my finger placement
on the walls area and this whole OLED
screen implementation and the actual
keyboard in the beginning I was like man
this is kind of cool but after having
used it in some games it's kind of
pointless I will say it is fantastic for
many customization so you can access you
macros your illumination your actuation
point your profiles and different other
settings without actually going into the
driver software all that is done through
the OLED screen and the little joystick
wheel over here and the one
multifunction button so with these two
combination you can do media control you
can cycle between different illumination
profiles and change your actuation point
for example but the actual wheel feels
very cheap the scroll steps for example
are kind of weak I feel like I have no
control the actual click of the wheel is
also kind of poor and for $200 this is
not what I was expecting and the reason
why I say the screen is pointless for
in-game integrations and applications is
because it is so limited so when it
works it works for csgo or dota 2 or
minecraft another game so you can see or
kill to this ratio you can see which
round you're on you can customize when
those appear and for how long they stay
on screen which is kind of awesome but
the screen is kind of out of sight like
I feel in when I'm playing a game I'm
never looking down to see what my kill
to death ratio is and what round it is
and from my perspective given the game
support list is so little unless you
play csgo Mortal Kombat 11 and dota 2
and minecraft then this is really not a
value
and of course you can do cool things
with animated gifs and actually drawing
your own little graphic to display but
do you ever really look at the keyboard
for any information outside of maybe
readjusting your hand or seeing where a
certain character is because the display
on the keyboard to give you some useful
information is more of a gimmick than it
actually being useful in real life that
is of course my opinion through my
experience but I will say the omnipoint
which has really saved the Pro
and the pro Tal keyboards because
they're really fantastic and what they
do and how they feel I'm a huge fan of
Gator on red switches which are
currently my favorite and the Omnipoints
remind me of that so incredibly
smooth travel distance throughout the
entire range and this is exactly what
you need when you can customize the
actuation point from point four
millimeters to three point six and just
let that sink for a second less than
half a millimeter to press before the
key is registered in game sometimes I
would not realize that I would be
pressing shift and my character be
walking or sometimes I would be going
slightly sideways because my finger
weight was registering the keystroke
point four millimeters at one point my
favorite switches were MX speed that's
registered at one point two millimeters
so they're really fast and I was really
comfortable with that but eventually
move on to something that actuator 2
millimeters but here you have that whole
customization range basically you can
make your own speed switch you can go
back to reg switch you can maybe even
drop the actuation point all the way to
3.6 in case you really want to bottom
out while you're typing that what makes
the switch so special but so in the
software for example you can select
between 1 and 10 but not knowing exactly
where the actuation happens in terms of
millimeters so that makes recreating a
certain switch that you're comfortable
with
can I difficult what is five so that is
point four to three point six so that's
three point two so that's one point six
millimeters all right so I guess you can
do your own math also important to note
how many points witches are only located
on sixty-one keys everything below the F
keys and everything to the left of the
arrow keys and the rest of the keys are
SteelSeries right I do appreciate the
perky actuation customization for those
61 switches because my was--they area
can be really fast same thing with my
spacebar but my shift and control can be
like fully actuated so that I don't
accidentally press them and my weight of
the fingers don't you know register the
keystroke and the same thing when I'm
doing something around the wast area
just to eliminate any errors while I'm
in game but when I go back to my desktop
all the keys go back to their normal
it's a two point five millimeter
actuation point which I'm quite
comfortable with and I like to bottom
out anyway so that hole per application
and purse which is awesome and weirdly
they've only recently added the perky
illumination customization before that
it was just like the whole board and you
chose the different color presets and
different profiles but now you can
select your entire you know range of
keys and color them to whatever you want
now I am disappointed the SteelSeries
decided to use abs key camps instead of
something more premium and quality once
you go pbt it's hard to go back and you
notice the difference in quality of the
actual key caps and just noticing it on
a premium keyboard like the apex Pro
disappointing now the fact that
SteelSeries decided to avoid the analog
direction of being able to detect on
like how far you press and actually
registering that as movement for example
like we've seen with flare text which is
from the winning one keyboard that you
can use things like to slow down your
character so depending on how far you
press so that is not present with the
Omnipoint switches so it's only based
on the actuation customization and
that's cool but it's also limiting to
the tech that's built into the switch
and so if you are interested in
actuation customization plus having the
full analog control check out wooden one
and winning two keyboards because
through the driver software you can
remap certain keys so they're seen by
the program as analog inputs giving you
the fool like full range of motion in
terms of how far you press to how fast
your character moves I was also hoping
to see more functionalities and features
built into the omnipoints which outside
of the actuation control so like maybe
setting in the recent point at certain
level and having different maybe
actuation points beyond the first one so
it like a double taps or it activates
something else so having these dual
functionalities that are built into the
Hall effect functionality but here it's
quite basic with the actuation
registration distance only it is cool to
play around different actuation points
and seeing how it reacts to your game
play and your typing experience or
whatever and given the 100 million
keystrokes this keyboard will last you
for a while so you can switch back and
forth depending on how deep you like the
press or how light you like tap I like
that alright so that's my experience
with the apex pro keyboard the omnipoint switches are fantastic the
actuation customization is super fun but
it's one of those things where once you
set it may be for like certain games and
certain applications you'll forget it
and the OLED screen is underwhelming
it'd be nice if it was slightly bigger
or maybe in a more visible area I would
like the keyboard feet to be improved
and also the actual little scrolling
wheel to have a bit more resistance and
feel more premium because using it to
control different things just yeah it
didn't feel really good and the frame
plus the amazing wrist rest really kind
of complete the package to be a really
premium keyboard so if you don't mind
spending $200 and want to play around
the customization of the actuation for
the 61 switches then the apex Pro and
kikyo might be for you all right guys
I'm Dimitri what is your favorite switch
right now I went from MX black to MX red
MX blue MX Brown MX green no razor
greens to MX speed to silent to get on
reds and the only point switches are
like up there with the Gator on red so
they've done a really good job with this
switch so if any of you have tried it
let me know what you think alright guys
talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
