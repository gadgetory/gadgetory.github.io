brought to you by and cix technology
connected get level Chuck okay alright
guys and i'm here with dulce with mimo
dulce this is probably one of the most
groundbreaking wearable tech for new
parents can you give us a little bit of
a breakdown us exactly what we're seeing
here sure it's the MIMO smart baby
monitor basically what a baby does is
they wear this organic cotton onesie
that has their respiration sensors on
the front these two stripes right here
and you pair that with a little turtle
and with this a parent can monitor their
baby's breathing skin temperature body
position they're awake or asleep and
also listen to audio so you can see all
the information in real time on your
smart tablet or phone set notifications
and alerts and then pull out trends over
time and there's a way that you can
actually push information to certain
Edison powered devices correct so can
you give me a break down or what these
devices are ya so right now the Intel
Edison which was premiered yesterday is
inside the turtle but there's also one
that we've prototyped into a brand new
bottle warmer that'll be released later
this year and Georgica this is yeah you
can pick it up yeah but essentially what
i can do is the two products can talk to
one another and a baby's nursery I know
when the baby wakes up and will be
hungry to help save a little bit of time
and getting the baby back how much is
good and how much is this gonna read so
far it's gonna retail for 199 dollars
and will be available this week it comes
with three of the onesies in a turtle
and then as much data yeah what about
some future applications yeah so I think
there's a lot we can do in terms of
feeding in terms of we're looking at
smart baby mobiles and we're really
excited about potty training
alright guys so this actually concludes
probably one of the most innovative
applications of wearable tech that we've
seen so far at 2014 CES coverage now
guys what I want you to do is I want you
to like the video if you like it I don't
want you to dislike it because there's
nothing to dislike and make sure that
you follow us on Twitter Instagram and
of course on YouTube and keep on
checking back for more badass kickass
damn good CES 2014 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
