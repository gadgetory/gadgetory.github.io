ibrahim with hurricane axe and welcome
to our first x 399 gaming slash
workstation pc build video i can
actually believe this is happening this
is this is like a dream come true in my
opinion i'm pretty excited for this one
because this is this build
seriously does not have any story behind
it or a budget or even a real goal i
just wanted to put together a great pc
around amy's new threat ripper processor
and that's exactly what ended up
happening you can see right behind that
looks it looks it looks pretty good
quick disclaimer this is a multi-purpose
bill video meaning you can basically
throw anything or everything at it this
includes video editing software
developing advanced 3d rendering or even
if you want a system on steroids that
can run java scripts like that this guy
can do it in fact you know you can even
stream and of course game videos at the
same time i think you can even add a few
more tasks if you really want it because
we've got 16 cores to work with here ok
so let's kick things off with the cpu I
chose the AMD risin thread Ripper in
1950 x16 core 32 threaded processor
clocked at a base of three point four
gigahertz that can boost to 4.0 plus
with an excel file range of 200
megahertz it should theoretically hit
4.2 on all cores given adequate cooling
which we'll talk about shortly price to
$1,000 it offers great multitasking
performance and happens to have more
than enough threads that you can use
several programs at the same time
provided you set core affinity properly
now I could have easily gone with the I
970 900 X from Intel because this bill
didn't have any budget whatsoever so
that could have been a possibility but
personally I feel like in the ultra
high-end processor market thread Ripper
offers the best performance for its
value so I decided to go with the 1950 X
in fact I think you can only pick up one
of these processors as of right now that
features a lot of cores and of course a
lot of threads now if you're interested
in Ross synthetic benchmarks we've
compared to the 1950 x2 a ton of for
high-end CPUs including the ones from
Intel so if you're interested in that
video I leave a link to that and there's
good
and down below now cooling has been a
bit of a controversial topic within the
tech community considering thread refers
epic heat output as of right now TR for
CPUs only work well with existing AC
tech look at coolers but air cooling
options are coming from Noctua and
others but since a and E includes an
adapter in the Box I decided to go with
the X 62 from NZXT it rocks a two eighty
millimeter radiator so that should be
sufficient enough to cool the sixteen
core monster and it looks great with
that gorgeous infinity mirror design lit
up for beautiful aesthetics housing the
1950 X is the rog zenith extreme x 399
motherboard this is one of the most
expensive boards we've tested in the
studio coming at around five hundred and
fifty dollars but it packs a lot of
features that enthusiast gamers and
content creators can take advantage of
for one you will have full access to
sixty PCI lanes what that means is you
can add multiple GPUs without
sacrificing bandwidth content readers
can easily pop in and red rocket rate
controllers workstation grade s disease
and much more without taking a hit on
performance RGB lighting has also made
its way into the zenith board and it
looks gorgeous to look at
plus when you add in the other
components that support the asus or RGB
system lighting customization becomes a
seamless experience the IO is loaded
with USB 3.0 ports along with the
inclusion of 3.1 gen2 type-c and type-a
ports the i/o shield is also pre mounted
so that's a nice touch do note that this
board will require 2 8 pin CPU
connectors to properly power the 1950 X
or any tr4 CPU this is to ensure the
user gets the best possible stability
when it comes to overclocking and we'll
talk about that shortly for memory I
decided to go with G skills a new 64
gigabyte Trident z RGB kit which is
capable of hitting as far as 29 33
megahertz and it has been certified for
use with thread Ripper 64 gigabytes
might seem overkill for a lot of gamers
out there as it does not yield the best
possible or higher frame rates but
rather content creators can take
advantage of this capacity as programs
like premiere After Effects resolve eat
through memory so this should definitely
help us ease the workflow we also cannot
forget G skills gorgeous RGB
illumination
it's the best in the business plus it's
compatible with aura which is awesome
now for storage I really didn't want to
compromise on performance so I choose
not one but two samsung 960 Pro and VM
em2 SSDs okay I know this is complete
overkill but there's a reason behind
this choice not only is a 960 Perl
currently one of the fastest SSDs on the
market but the m-dot - form factor means
I won't have to worry about routing
cables to my drives and cluttering up my
otherwise clean built the 1960's high
level of nanded Doran's for a non
enterprise drive and great random write
performance also means that it can be
used for my professional applications as
well
that's really important for this build
since it has to be as versatile as
possible so my intent for the storage
setup is to use a single 960 Perl 512
gigabyte SSD as my main OS drive and it
will also be used for applications like
Adobe Premiere and a few games if
necessary the second drive is actually
what excites me the most since I won't
have to make any performance sacrifices
when I move my main game library to it
I'll also be using it as an Adobe
scratch test so I can speed up my
workflow I should also mention that AMD
just announced that x3 I nine boards
will be the first to combine nvme drives
into raid arrays this will happen
through a BIOS update and a new driver
package at the end of September or
perhaps a bit later imagine having two
or more of these Samsung 960 Pro drives
operating in raid the performance will
be insane guys and I'm actually planning
an upgrade really soon so expect or stay
tuned for that video for graphics I went
with the ROG Strix GT X 1080 TI GPU it
features 11 gigabytes of gddr5 X memory
and when it's set to OC mode the boost
clock gets as far as 1700 megahertz but
it can be pushed higher with many
overclocking the Strix cooler is by far
one of the best aftermarket cooling
solutions we've come across on a GPU it
features the signature triple wing blade
0db fans meaning during idle they
completely stop spinning a susers also
implemented their new max contact
technology which provides two times more
contact with the GPU than traditional
heat spreaders so this should help with
lower temperatures while gaming
it also features RGB lighting that
can be controlled through the GPU tweak
software and it's all compatible so once
again that should help with lighting
synchronization housing the entire PC is
a case that might come as a surprise to
you guys I chose the corsair carbide air
540 ATX cubed case as you can see I went
with the white Marion because my goal
for this bill was to go with a black and
white the NPC and from a physical
perspective this chassis looks beautiful
in fact this was like a match made in
heaven I was looking for a unique
enclosure that could house the massive
Zenith ei takes motherboard and a 280
millimeter radiator while also being
available in white the number of choices
were pretty limited and after building
the system in it I have mad respect for
this new air 540 the case does not come
with a tempered glass panel although I
wish Corsair offered one however the
acrylic panel should do a pretty good
job showcasing the components inside the
air 540 uses a dual chamber system to
separate the hard drive brackets along
with the PSU from the rest of the
hardware so this should come in handy
during cable management powering the
whole PC is the be quiet dark power pro
11 1000 watt modular power supply
it comes with an 80 plus platinum
certification and given its excellent
modularity and the extra wattage
Headroom you can easily add a secondary
GPU that requires more power plus it
should help with overclocking the 1950 X
now I could have gone with the stock
power cables that came inside the box
but I felt it would be incomplete on a
high-end build like this
so I reached out to cable mod and they
hooked us up with some custom white and
black cables to comprehend the color
scheme of the PC we also did request a
white a IO slimming set for the X 62
cooler and it got here in time
installing it is actually pretty simple
it just takes a few minutes to wrap the
sleeving on top of the tubes and lock
them up appropriately using the molded
plastic clips and work it to go alright
so with that out of the way let's put
this thing together actually it's all
assembled and ready to go right behind
me but this is just for video purposes
so enjoy the cool montage
so here we are taking a look at the
final build it definitely looks gorgeous
guys I mean working with the air 540
case was a breeze everything from
mounting the motherboard to the a IO to
the graphics card was a fairly simple
process I did configure the lighting to
an all-white setting as it best suited
the case and it completely satisfies my
theme for this PC things to aura I'm not
really sure if I should name this PC
since I've never done that with any
build but hey maybe you guys could help
so know as much as you'd want in the
comments down below all right so let's
get serious this time and talk about
performance because it's just as
important if not more important than the
physical appearance of the PC before I
get into the results I wanted to quickly
touch base on overclocking I did manage
to get the 1950 x2 3.75 gigahertz it's
not the best overclock as far as I'm
concerned I mean I was hoping to get the
4 gigahertz OC but unfortunately I just
wasn't able to get it stable at that
point or at that time it's probably
because my CPU wasn't it capable enough
to get to that level but perhaps I might
need to spend some more time tweaking
around with the CP of the motherboard to
just play around the voltage and
everything to get it to 4 gigahertz but
as of right now 3.75 gigahertz is what
we'll be working with
starting with Cinebench r15 running the
CPU test the 1950 X at stock settings
scored a little over 2900 points but
when overclocked it dished out 170
points more than the first one so that's
a significant difference I've even added
my main risin PC featuring an overclock
to 1700 X for comparison and you can see
how it did compare to the 16 core CPU
switching to OpenGL and the results
shouldn't surprise you the 1950 exit
stock didn't yield the best frame rates
when compared to the overclock 1700 X
but the 3.75 gigahertz overclock
certainly close the gap between the two
making it almost a tie thread report
isn't really geared towards gaming it's
likely best suited towards people who
use programs that take advantage of
multiple cores and we saw that with the
CPU test moving to a complicated project
like this ACM monitor review which is a
9 minute and 30 second video shows a
clear indication that X 399 would
certainly save you some money times this
is where all cores get utilized to its
best
and while the 2 to 3 minute difference
might not sound that much imagine the
things you could do in the background
while rendering complicated projects as
you also mention that old clocking Rison
played a huge role with the faster
render times so I'd highly recommend
when you overclock the CPU to overclock
the RAM as well my sweet spot was set to
around 20 666 megahertz so like I said
overclocking will different from one
system to the other
but keep that in mind the 960 pro SSD
blazed through crystal this mark
averaging around 3.5 gigabytes per
second read speeds and around 2
gigabytes per second for the write
performance so it definitely met my
expectations when it comes to gaming
performance I didn't test all that many
games yet so all the benchmarks and more
will be included in part 2 video for
this build here's a little glimpse on
battlefield one at 14:40 pset2 ultra mdx
12 so system digital run 95 frames per
second on average on one of the most
demanding levels so that was just a
teaser on the performance segment of
this X 3 9 9 built there's still a lot
more testing to do with thread Ripper
and the way how it handles complex
programs and huge data sets I'll also be
testing mega tasking and going through
the process of setting up core affinity
properly so things like gaming and
rendering can take place on the parallel
I'm also curious would you like me to
perform a certain test that you may be
interested in let me know in the
comments down below well this concludes
our first X 399 build showcase video I
hope you enjoyed this guys and like I
mentioned in the beginning I was really
excited to build this monster and in the
short time of it being running it has
been a true workhorse and I can't wait
to share the rest of the benchmarks in a
follow-up video I'm also looking forward
to that BIOS update at AMD just
announced or you can configure to
me me SSDs in braids and given that I'm
using these two Samsung 960 Pro SSDs
performance is just gonna hit an other
level so yeah expect a follow-up video
because in the Emily I expect a lot more
coverage in the upcoming weeks because I
have a few more touches to do for the
build but yeah like I said I'd like to
take this opportunity to thank our
sponsors for providing the components
