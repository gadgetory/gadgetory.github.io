Wow
it really pays off to go outside I gotta
found the new one Plus let's review the
new master liquid all-in-one coolers are
available in 120 and 240 millimeter
stylish radiator sizes with air balance
fans included for best air flow and RGB
sync on the pump and the fans that I
controlled via this hub or through your
motherboard check out the ML 120 ln 240
l down below alright so the 1 plus 5t
may be the phone of the year and i'm
coming from the 1 plus 5 and everything
about the 5 t feels like a needed
upgrade with a much better portrait mode
for the camera I really like the two by
one aspect ratio on display and then you
fingerprint location at the back that at
first was kind of weird for me I kept
missing it but a day later your muscle
memory kicks in for that seamless unlock
and we also have that new face unlock
feature that as everyone says is super
fast and I would agree you don't even
have time to see the notification screen
and it lands right on your home screen
it even works in low-light situations as
long as there's some brightness on your
phone it lights up your face
now you can disable the function to auto
unlock when it detects your face and
this way you can easily view your
notifications and interact with them
it's a nice way to experience the
seamless unlock function and not having
to raise your phone but I doubt it's
secure since since using the selfie cam
for facial recognition and also it
doesn't recognize me when I'm wearing
glasses nor if I'm wearing hat too close
to my eyes so it's not accurate and if
you're like other things around your
face but it's pretty fantastic when it's
just simple facing from the camera now
it kind of sucks for 1+5 owners is the
fact that this phone's been out for six
months so the upgrade cycle to the
latest one is a little bit too close
together and then one plus offers the
trading programs but they're not
available everywhere and if you were to
get some cash back from oneplus for
trading in your phone you probably get
less money then if you were to sell this
thing yourself and the 5 T is just
slightly more expensive at launch then
wonder 1 plus 5 was when it launched now
I do appreciate the relatively small 12%
price premium for double the storage and
extra Ram but for reference ignoring the
base price you get
four times the storage capacity for 21%
price premium with an iPhone which is a
better ratio just something to think
about but now let's talk about the basic
phone functionality so the vibration
motor on a hard surface is audible but
I've missed many calls when the phone is
in my pocket it's too weak and I
recommend changing the vibration pattern
and that is a bit faster and can be felt
easier call quality is excellent the top
speaker is clear and the smooth curves
are pleasant upon contact but
unfortunately most of the cases have
these rough edges making them not
comfortable to press against your ear
and only the staple sandstone cover has
the top cutouts making in the ideal case
for phone calls and handling
unfortunately while oneplus drools over
their horizon line in the center with
the aluminum body it is incredibly
slippery so you must stick with a case
or a skin and while I appreciate the
diversity of colors and textures and
this new really cool red rubber case
it's still just way too smooth and can
slip out easily I do recommend the
sandstone cover for the most secure grip
the buttons are on the familiar spots
but they all feel kind of soft and not
as clicky in comparison to the 1+5 but I
love the alert slider and I wish more
Android devices were equipped with this
tomb you notifications except for your
favorites the bottom looks identical to
the five with type C port that is still
on USB 2 speeds a bottom firing speaker
that is super easy to block but it's
loud so find yourself a bowl and no need
for a Bluetooth speaker and the
headphone jack is still here with a
powerful output and in equalizer for
some volume controls
so no dongle need it now in comparison
to the five there are some physical
changes first the camera bump has a
smooth perimeter and this way it doesn't
pick up particles as much the included
screen protector had rougher edges and I
recommend you remove it for better touch
feeling and of course the 5 T is tiny
bit taller with a 6 inch screen but
slightly wider side bezels as far as you
can see resolution is good for my eyes
and brightness is excellent and it's
AMOLED so color and contrast is
fantastic as usual we have screen
calibration default one is way too cold
for my taste and I prefer srgb color or
the slightly more vibrant p3 and also we
have the
Custom temperature adjustment on the
screen I love the rounded corners to go
with the flow of androids UI direction
and I love the ambient screen that
lights up for your notifications for
just a few seconds and this way you can
sort of glance at your phone when the
notifications come in and decide if you
need to respond the notification LED is
present with a nice ambient light that
can be configured accordingly and
overall this is a beautiful display for
media consumption with this
pinch-to-zoom for regular sixteen by
nine content so you fill your whole
screen and the taller resolution is nice
to accommodate on-screen buttons but
even so you get more viewing area
without the need to scroll now I love
what oneplus is doing with the software
with subtle customization available on
the home screen you can choose a
different system font you can choose a
theme color swap buttons and assign
shortcuts for double tapping or long
pressing like launching the camera with
a double press of a power button you can
wake the screen with a double tap or
take a screen shot with a three-finger
swipe and we have multiple gestures on
the fingerprint sensor itself like
swiping down to real notifications or
long pressing and to take a photo or
gaming do-not-disturb to kill off any
notifications while you're in game and
one of my favorites reading mode that
goes into this nice warm black and white
state for comfortable reading now for my
homescreen I preloaded the pixel to
launcher and that looks really clean
plus I have Google now on the left side
because with the default launcher
we have shelf that is useless to me and
I wish we could remap it to Google now
now the phone is super fast and my only
complaint with performance revolves
around the unlocking animation where
sometimes the icons and the text load
before the wallpaper and that in real
time looks kind of glitchy and in slow
motion you can see that the fade effect
is not as smooth as on the 1 plus
running the same launcher and the same
wallpaper
however unlocking the phone when on the
notification screen is much smoother
when it comes to that faylene animation
and so now with the camera surprisingly
I've been asked many times to compare it
to the pixel to excel that currently
delivers the best images out of any
smartphone but the 5 T in proper hands
is pretty excellent
you
the portrait mode is now improved with
better edge detection and the wider
field of view so you can get more in the
shot versus what we saw on the five and
it's actually the same field of view as
the standard lens which is awesome if
you need extra reach you'll just do the
digital zoom on the primary sensor and
comparing the portrait mode on a 5 to 5
T in a to excel the dynamic range and
contrast is best on the pixel but edge
detection on the pixel is a little bit
more aggressive and on oneplus has that
smoother gradient plus it's not as
zoomed in as on the other tool the 5 t
also comes out soft sometimes even with
plenty of light but I usually edit my
photos anyway so adding some sharpness
and contrast it really helps to improve
those images now the 4k video is alright
it has pretty fast focusing and exposure
is alright too it has image
stabilization in 4k mode and yeah you
can walk with it and it's gonna have a
little bit of shake but much less than
what the 5 has but if we switch over to
1080p 60 so very nice and smooth and
slightly wider field of view as well so
not exactly sure why that is happening
but image stabilization is present here
also so you can do things and you can
walk around and yeah stabilization is
all good so generally I like the camera
on the 5 T and I'm taking some amazing
shots on my 5 on my trip to Brazil and
the 5 T is better in every way in terms
of portrait photography and low-light
and so I am confident that I'll be using
this moving forward now the selfie mode
is pretty good but it tends to blur the
background just slightly so for group
selfie is just as with the 1 plus 5
people behind you tend to be soft and
finally battery life is never concerned
thanks to - charging giving you like 60%
battery in half an hour
I even disabled the battery percentage
indicator because I never have to worry
and usually get
full day and half on a single charge
with top ups in the morning when I'm
showering or making breakfast and yeah
really good battery life so find the
words on value I think the five T is a
great package you know even though we
don't have official water resistance
rating I was playing around in the snow
and that introductory montage and yeah
the thing survived the phone is fine no
issues whatsoever so I love the 5 T but
I really feel bad for the 5 owners
because that upgrade cycle is just way
too close together and at this price
point the 5 T is my phone of the year
alright so that is this for my review of
the 5 T let me know what you think of
the camera comparison which when you
thought looked best in the portrait mode
I'm Dimitri with hurricane axe thanks so
much for watching we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
