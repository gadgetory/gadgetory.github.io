oMG we just got the fantex receiving a
brief from them
on so many exciting products and let's
just dive right in with the evolve X
they refined everything about this
enclosure that I love so much so let's
check out all the little upgrades and
they're little but they're incremental
and there's there's so many of them that
makes this case that I think would be
one of the best premium enclosures that
we'll see in 2018 so let's check it out
but huge thanks to our sponsors fantex
Thermaltake and Coolermaster for making
contexts possible alright so the first
thing is the price the evolved X will
run for a hundred and ninety nine
dollars we launched in August and just
to give you a reference point because
that seems like on the higher end of
scale at $199 the original evolved ATX
rent for a hundred and eighty nine
dollars and the amount of features
they've improved on here just the list
is huge so the ten dollar premium
doesn't seem so bad so let's start with
the exterior basically they've refined
the original design with tons of
improvements they've maintains the same
characteristics of the original evolve
but improved air flow so the length of
the case is the same but the height has
increased by ten millimeters so the top
is slightly higher with larger
ventilation area and air flow in this
case has been somewhat of a concern over
the years but now the surface area for
the front intake is three times larger
versus the original and the top one is
five times larger than the original so
there's higher spacing between edges of
paneling and interior spacing is deeper
so the distance from the fans to the
paneling it has been increased to
improve air flow they've also added new
lighting effects as you can see so two
large ambient strips at the front I love
how they're behind the panel sort of
revealing this sort of like you know
spacing between they are digital RGB so
gradients are awesome the color of
vibrancy is just incredible while the
side LED illumination is a high density
LED which means they've doubled on the
LED amounts on the strip so the gradient
is much smoother we no longer have these
like chunky transitions as we saw on the
p3 50x and also the connect
mechanism for the front panel is
utilizing the three pin method so it's
to us you don't have to worry about
reconnecting stuff and that's convenient
now in terms of the feature set man this
is a long list so the major focus was to
not waste any space and just utilize
things in smart ways so the new i/o
includes a Type C Gen 2 which has a 50
centimeter long cable so you can route
it to your motherboard regardless of
where the type C IO Gen 2 on the
motherboard is connected we do have the
two buttons for color and mode cycling
they've really put a lot of emphasis on
making sure that there's a proper
airflow for intake and exhaust so
implement that small details like this
radiator bracket at the top is removable
and includes latches to actually catch
the bracket so reinstallation of things
while you have your radiator on there is
much easier we also have cable clips for
routing on that bracket and a fill port
in the right place because many have
asked for this feature so you can build
a high end water cooling system so if
you're going for 140 millimeter width
you can do a 420 at the front or 280 at
the top or dual 360s one on top one in
the front we do have this magnetic cover
at the top that prevents the recycling
of air so if you have a radiator that
exhausting air you can position that a
little magnetic plate either at the
front or the back depending on where
your radiator is located and that will
prevent the hot air from bouncing back
into the case and recirculating that air
we have new locking points for the side
panels so they still swing to open like
on the original but you can secure them
with some screws at the front so if
you're handling the case and carrying it
they simply will not open there is now a
drain port something that people have
been asking for ever and it's actually
more important than your fill port it's
right in the front behind the panel and
you know easy access you can drain your
liquid refill your stuff and boom now
fantex is really focusing things on air
flow so they're trying to make their
cases airtight so the side panels have
now this rubber seals around the
perimeter so for one air pressure and
two sound isolation we also have a new
anti GPU sag bracket that installs
behind the PCI slots that pushes on the
heavy cards therefore avoiding that sag
it's a really cool addition and it's
include
with the Evolve ex coming inside we have
a new power supply shroud design so
there's a power supply cut out revealing
your unit behind it there's a new GPU
cable cut out it is still a prototype
but it can slide that's kind of you know
closing in that gap so if you have a
thinner cables you can have less of a
gap if it's a standard round cable it
can open it a bit more and now we have
three vertical brackets which is awesome
so if you want to offset your a dual
slot GPU closer to the motherboard to
create that spacing that's a possibility
or if you have a triple slot graphics
card for that vertical mount that is
also now a possibility the new cable
covers beside the motherboard are
awesome because they cover that entire
section which hides the like all the SSD
mounts and stuff behind it and they can
also slide to accommodate for
motherboard so if you install an ATX
motherboard you can slide those covers
to the right closer to the front panel
thus revealing more area for cables to
pass through and if you have an ATX
motherboard you can close those sections
it's a brilliant design that just it
just works now in order to showcase the
full potential of the vault X fantex had
basically built this professional server
great system with eight hard drives and
nine SSDs now the case can support up to
ten hard drives simultaneously all
thanks to this new hard drive brackets
which are stackable and they can be
hanged on the interior or stacked at the
very bottom we have a new cable
management system with these doors that
swivel to open their two lists so no
need for screws and they're attached via
Clips we have improved cable tie points
which are separated into two channels so
you can have one for your thicker cables
one for thinner i/o cables and we have
these SSD panels that open up fully and
hide the cables behind it and we have
three more SSDs that can be installed on
this new cover beside the power supply
and so the upgrade of this section is
brilliant because not only do these
covers allow for you to hide your cable
mass even though if you're not
necessarily attaching all your cables to
cable tie points and velcro straps they
also act for your storage so three SSDs
per bracket that's awesome and routing
all that is kind of you know within the
vicinity of the power supply we also
have a new PWM fan how
4:9 fans or you can use y splitters to
expand that count with awesome top
location so you can route all your fans
easily but fantex did have something up
their sleeve and so now we have this 15
dollar ITX bracket that's right it has
its own power button and this removable
top a rear plate on the actual case for
the motherboard IO
so it basically installs an irradiated
bracket up top and there you have a
second ITX system inside your ATX case
that is brilliant now it doesn't need
its own power supply so that's where
revolt
X comes into play it can power two
systems at once but what about the GPU
for the ITX system and that is where the
60 centimeter riser cable comes into
play so you can route it from the ITX
motherboard all the way down and you can
have a total of three GPUs or more
installed in this case so one GPU for
the ITX system and there is you know
offset closer to the side panel so there
is no interference with the main GPUs in
your ATX motherboard I do think they
have something special in their hands to
expand the popularity for dual systems
inside a pretty compact enclosure and so
that is the Evolve X what do you guys
think of all the little upgrades make
sure to check out our original review
just to get the reference point of where
we started basically to where we are now
but we also get to see a little sneak
peek of this prototype the Eclipse p600
so it will launch an end of q3 or the
lower price point than the evolve X so
that's awesome to see so this whole case
is about switching between silence and
performance so it's got a quiet
configuration with silent dampeners and
seals on the window with high airflow
configuration at the same time if you
open up the top in the front panel you
can angle the front panel so it's not
completely removed but removing it does
not detract from the attractive looks I
think that's a good focus from fantex
parts so you can have a silent system
that's a little bit more elegant or
airflow focus system that still looks
pretty elegant now the cool thing about
the p 600 is the new mesh fabric at the
top and the front so it is better for
airflow and holds some large dust
particles and there is a finer dust
filter on the inside to catch the
smaller ones this new mesh fabric is
about ten percent better for air flow
than your metal mesh and it allows
fantex to experiment with different
fabric materials color choices
textures and so it has this both
functionality for airflow and looks at
last for light leaked to go through so
you know any lighting will be visible
it's a cool direction and I can't wait
to see the final result the interior is
based on the evolve X so all the same
feature set would improve things glass
panels are on hinges you can upgrade to
a dual system it will be a steel
construction and not aluminium like when
they evolve X and there are no SSD
panels behind the motherboard tray
because the side panel here is solid so
you don't necessarily need to cover
everything up the one cool thing about
the front panel is the direction of the
ventilation channeling any noise that
escapes towards the back of the case
thus making a sort of a quieter system
and the spacing between the fans and the
front panel is adequate and you know I
don't think it should impede air flow
and the last thing to cover our fans
Soph antics is designing new ones
because they have expertise in air case
airflow so they want to build something
that accommodates their own cases for
more silent operation better CFM and
higher static pressure so that if you
have paneling and radiator and dust
filters all that is not compromising on
the cooling potential of those default
case fans so this new fans have new
blade design that minimizes the gap
between the blades and the frame they've
increased the thickness of the frame
itself so about 30 millimetres instead
of your 25 watching original which gives
us more prostatic pressure the sound
quality has improved with smoother sound
waves so it gives quiet operation and
cable management has been a part of
their thinking so you can daisy chain
multiple fans in the front with a single
cable and then plug that four pin pwm
connector into your motherboard alright
so as usual it's awesome to see fantex
working on those little details and
improvements to make you guys happy to
make the assembly process easier to make
airflow better because that's been a
huge part of discussion for 2018 cable
management is improved with new paneling
you know just diverse options from the
builds water cooling dual systems
complete server rack would like you know
10 hard drives inside a case and that is
awesome modularity to the level that we
have come to expect alright guys so let
me know what you think of the evolve X
