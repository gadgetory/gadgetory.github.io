he's a very good-looking game so we've
just won a pass in this free
what's our going to do the advanced one
we tried to beginner level before but
you know what the point is exciting
and what you have is in the demo they've
only one log for of the professions we
have the elemental s the warrior the
necromancer
Rangers we're going to go through with
warrior
thank you having Samaritans where they's
in excluding the bubbly be characters
who are going to be very easy do you
vanguard for the blessing
and here's the other thing guild wars 2
is all about the character customization
and making your own story so you have

loss or option but what we have is
options there's a domain collections or
background with each day from life's
teeth just going to go sugar foundations
of the world

I
a log home listen to me to do
I
you up
starting off to me they've used a lot of
textures you know we have even
individual planks of wood the Exodia
it's a very good-looking we have some
really good lighting you know great
shadows all over lace upon textures are
really good and the system specs really
aren't all end weren't all that much
different than the original to feel that
that you can do is it's also going to
have support for 3d vision and Havok
physics so for those who want the extra
experience yet it
now one thing we divorce do is all of
our reason combat mr. burns
magic is not true it is a little but you
know i am one of the Savarin forceful

you know in the different areas that I
attack maybe where it's less farmer I'm
actually going to be able to
evil threatens to our dream
sagging from the back almost triple
it's also turn based either you can
attack in bathroom than the other guys
you are going to do more down
running away from us and join Isis all
easily you're gonna do more Daphne you
run away or if you know what I'm he's
going to use less damage to you he just
it really is an innovative way of doing
it
every attack has an established damage
very good at it I'm to let somebody else
take Smith but
that is deal more stew in a nutshell
that they're looking forward to it
