refresh so what's up guys I'm Dmitry and
on the review table is a very exciting
tower from be quiet the dark bass 700
ever since the launch of the dark bass
900 Pro they kept telling me that they
have some new exciting things coming up
and it slightly smaller footprint so
that is exactly what we have here now
the thing is for a mid tower it is quite
expensive for a hundred and eighty
dollars so let's see what this case
brings to the table and the very overly
crowded marketplace in late 2017 right
after this invest in storage that makes
a difference choose toshiba Rd 400 and
vme SSDs that are incredibly fast and
reliable
backed by advanced warranty programs so
you can focus on what matters
Rd 400 check it out in the description
below alright so the new dark base 700
feels like a refinement in many ways
versus the larger dark base 900 and puts
the company on the competitive track
within the mid-range tower category it's
about the same height as the NZXT H 700
but it's longer and I wish they would
shorten the body a little bit because in
many instances the interior space is
left unused and feels empty another
point of feedback for be quiet is to
stop using brushed aluminum fantex has
proven that sandblasted textures look
far superior and don't leave any finger
marks something that plagues the front
and top panels of this case the tempered
glass panel has now received black out
top and bottom strips to hide the
mounting locations the amount is
standard with four thumb screws with a
small lip at the bottom to hold the
panel but unlike many cases with TG
there are no rubber bits on the frame
itself only on the mounting pegs
and none on the glass either and I would
like to see padding added in their
future case but the glass is generally
scratch resistant unless you
intentionally try to do something with
it
so with general handling don't worry
about creating any scratches one thing I
don't like about the front panel is this
continuous facade because it's not
comfortable to pick up the case in this
spot and if you do finger oils will be
spread all over the front doors pretty
loaded with all the standard goodies
like USB 3 power and reset buttons audio
jacks and finally a type C port on a mid
tower that needs that 20 pin connector
on your motherboard for the gen 2 speeds
and then we have one of the best
integrations for a fan controller with
three speed settings plus auto in which
the motherboard controls this speed via
the PWM connector the controller hub is
at the back and I wish it was more
discreet with better wiring but here we
have two fan rails with three fans each
that can be set to either performance or
silent modes individually that means you
can have let's say one rail handling the
intake and another exhaust for that
smart airflow control and lastly we have
built in RGB lighting and the front of
the chassis with those really nice
ambient side strips that wrap around the
bottom I actually quite like this look
they're not too bright and there's some
spill into the exhaust vents and it's
all uniform plus the hub has an
additional 12-volt RGB connector for
more LED strips and a motherboard
connector to control the lighting
through the software on your motherboard
I love this flexibility the problem
however is the removable mid plate that
if not aligned properly will not light
up in the correct colors in whatever
channel is misaligned and this can be
fixed by pushing the panel in a bit so
this is how the panel is removed you
pull it out by the edges the contact
points are at the bottom of the frame
and this Wireless approach to lighting
is pretty awesome
as long as the connectors are not bent
and I'm not sure if the panel arrived
like this or I accidentally touch the
bottom of the panel while removing it so
be careful and if the lighting does not
match you know why at the front we have
a large dust filter and an excellent 140
member silent wings three fan airflow
has never been a strong suit for be
quiet
and it really shows here with an
incredibly restrictive front paneling on
the inside and on the exterior to now
it's weird because their fans move a lot
of air and they're very quiet so they
need to open up the front on the case to
allow more air to enter at lower rpms on
the fans and this is also where we
access the bottom dust filter the top
panel is pretty much completely closed
except for the tiny exhaust strips at
the back now it's great for noise
isolation and placing objects on top of
the case but what's confusing is this
excellent removable top fan bracket that
accommodates 280 and 360 million
radiators with triple 140 Miller fan
support as well but no ventilation room
for those fans to actually exhaust air
the spacing between the bracket and the
panel is available but aside from the
rear exhaust ports and the top openings
there's nowhere for that air to go but
balance back inside so I love the
airflow options at the front the top but
the exterior paneling shuts down the
cooling potential now the interior
layout is by far the best be quiet has
put out yet they are pushing forward
better modular elements than most cases
especially since you can actually invert
the motherboard tray without any
sacrifices so for one I love these
plastic covers on the hard drive slots
they add some character to an otherwise
boring panel and then total we have
three of these metal drive cages that
you can mount on any of these five slots
and two of them are hiding at the bottom
but can be removed easily the interior
ones limit your spacing from the front
so push-pull is not possible but it is
an option with enough spacing allocated
in that bottom opening and to come back
to these plastic covers they can be
extended out to pass the cables since
the motherboard tray is flat and so are
the rubber grommets I really like the
new modular approach of the bottom
section with four top panels to reveal
ventilation above the power supply and
extra fan slot near the drive cage and
the spacing for the front plus the side
plate is removable to access everything
from
either side so my only complaint is with
the rear section it's pretty average and
form of cable management and I was
expecting a bit more from such an
expensive meant hour although we do have
three more SSD slots on these two
brackets so
storage options are adequate and finally
this is one of the only few mid towers
to feature in the vertebral motherboard
tray and 11 screws later and unplugging
the front of your cables we have an
empty frame for either modding or
repainting and you can do all the
hardware installation outside of the
case which has its benefits and a nice
touch for be quiet to install these
rubber feet so the tray does not wobble
and resuming with the inversion process
is super simple it took me like three
minutes to secure everything and now you
have this orientation swapping the glass
panel is taken into account by
remounting the pegs on to the other side
so the procedure is pretty much flawless
but I do wonder how much interest there
is with this inverted layouts hardware
does not look good when flipped so
unless you really need your system on
the left side this feature may be unused
by many if you decide to go with dark
base 700 and finally this is the system
I've settled on and much cleanly result
versus the dark base 900 but here you
can see if those drive slots are not
used on the side we have too much open
space I've got a 360 rad at the front so
that helps to fill some room and doing a
custom loop in here should definitely be
a nice experience
although the front airflow is heavily
blocked one of the panels on the shroud
had to remain off because there's no way
to mount it back with the cables coming
out and there's also no way to route the
eight pin CPU cable at the top unless
you pull out the fan bracket first as
the spacing is not large enough for that
connector to fit but I really like the
extra functionality of the side covers
throughout my GPU cable and in case you
need to access anything at the bottom
it's a simple panel away.now cable
management is fine because we have a lot
of room but organization is not made
simple
I think NZXT said really and you stand
it with the H 700 I and all those
plastic channeling that is no effort at
all when it comes to cable management so
in total we have 5 fans in the system
right now they are in the setting one in
the performance mode for both rails and
it's audible obviously the system is
audible to go it to silent then it's
fine but right now let me switch back
between
setting 1 &amp;amp; 3 so maximum speed that you
can expect from this case it does block
out some noise but of course 5 fans
going full speed is going to be audible
all right so dark bass 700 I like it but
it's not perfect I do appreciate the
direction that the choirs taking in
terms of those module elements and now
they're better than ever in terms of
that reconstructing that entire bottom
shroud or being able to seamlessly
invert your motherboard tray without any
sacrifices that's awesome I like the
lighting integration but because there's
nothing on the back there it kind of
looks odd like it's incomplete so
perhaps if they were to add an
additional lighting strip at the back
that's what have been nice and the price
point one hundred and eighty dollars
from in towered that is expensive but
perhaps big wires trying to meander
their way into that niche market for
people who want to have the option for
the inverted motherboard layout in terms
of acoustic isolation I mean I have five
fans in there but it's only quiet in the
silent presets at like one or two so
lower rpm fans but in that case we're
really kind of choking the system with
airflow because our really restrictive
front panel and so the next thing I
would like to do is do proper
temperature testing and compare that to
other restrictive cases that I have in
the studio and perhaps just see where
the case industry is going because I
don't see any innovation in terms of
airflow and opening up that those you
know front intakes and top exhaust
without sacrificing on acoustics you
could lower rpm and maybe set some
standards in terms of how quiet your
system should be in form of rpm and not
side paneling that doesn't let any air
flow or air to exit at all so guys let
me know what you think of the dark bass
