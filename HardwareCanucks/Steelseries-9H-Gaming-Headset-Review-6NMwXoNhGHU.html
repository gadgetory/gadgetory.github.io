ox and welcome back to another video
review SteelSeries is certainly a gaming
brand that you should recognize
especially when it comes to gaming
headsets from our previous experience
there were certainly things to improve
on with some of their three-piece
designs but when it comes to audio
quality and delivering to that amazing
experience
SteelSeries certainly can deliver so
today we're going to take a look at the
9h headset that incorporates SteelSeries
own drivers that are known to be quite
excellent for detail and clarity and
price at 106 dollars let's see how they
stack up for that professional gamer the
first thing to mention is that I do
appreciate the one-piece design there
are no detachable hand band or earpieces
and the overall build quality is robust
with solid joints and flexible design
the headband is adjustable and ear cups
do swivel for that custom fit the
pleather cushions go over your ears that
are quite deep and follow similar Orange
internal lining as there are other
headsets and the single external thread
that adds to the overall appeal and I do
like it
they provide some noise isolation from
your surrounding environment but
surprisingly have quite a bit of leak
which isn't a good thing if you like to
blast the volume the headband also
features extra padding and notice there
are four cushions that help to shape the
9h over your head without any specific
pressure points and combined with
lightness of the headset this type of
headband design is great for long term
comfort the noise cancelling microphone
is concealed within the left ear cup and
it's become sort of the staple for
SteelSeries as the mic is retractable
and the very low-profile and flexible so
here's a sample of the microphone as you
hear it is quite noisy so let's turn on
mic noise reduction with that on you can
hear it is becoming a lot cleaner and
loud now let's turn on mic compression
which levels out the volume so when you
raise your voice or lower your voice it
auto levels the microphone for a more
uniform volume now right underneath is
still series custom connector for the
cable that is detachable it is braided
with the mic mute button and volume
control wheel and
at the end you attach the mic headphone
splitter or the 90 degree headphone
attachment for mobile use
we do have an extension cable included
if you require that extra reach the 9h
also includes a USB sound card that is
24-bit 96,000 Hertz it's quite small and
allows you to connect both headset jacks
or the custom USB jack from the 9h I
would have liked to see a longer USB
cable so you can place the sound card
facing you but get inside the
SteelSeries engine software it will
automatically detect the headset where
you can enable Dolby Surround
choose your presets or adjust the
equalizer itself activate mic noise
reduction for cleaner chat and
compression for uniform volume and also
adjust microphone volume getting into
the configuration tab you can create
your own profile so battlefield 4 for
example and the executable and then
we'll activate that profile when you
launch into the game so it's quite
useful now I first fire up into
battlefield 4 with the included sound
card to see if it was any good and I
gotta say I'm not a fan of Dolby
Surround for gaming it does open up the
soundstage a little bit which for a
closed type headset is useful so your
audio environment is a bit larger but
then you sacrifice on the detail of
those audio elements in the game and it
doesn't sound natural with the Dolby
Surround plus it doesn't really benefit
directionality I did play around with
the included presets choosing the FPS
mode does bring out the detail in those
footsteps and that gunfire that passing
by you and the explosive action preset
was also surprisingly well balanced for
that little extra punchy bass but still
maintaining the excellent high range the
USB sound card however doesn't bring out
the best in a 9 inch so I used our audio
engine DAC to see what was missing and
the first thing I noticed was how much
more detail I could hear from the
drivers the USB sound card does lack
proper amplification and 100% volume it
just wasn't loud enough and the card
doesn't do justice to these drivers
that's because steel series drivers are
well tuned for gaming with excellent and
detailed high-end and proper mid-range
the lower base is pretty weak and
doesn't particularly impress but for
gaming FPS shooter
especially the bass isn't everything
here in the same direction of where
sniper fire is coming from is key and
giving this is a closed type headset you
do compromise on the size of the
soundstage but I think the detail makes
up for it
driver imaging is also great for stereo
sound and being aware of audio elements
around you and like I said soundstage
could be a bit larger but that's just a
limitation of the closed design overall
the 9h has a bright sound with emphasis
on audio elements that matter for
professional gamers and while the
included USB sound card has the
equalizer settings and profiles so you
can quick tune your tone properties I
found it lacking the proper power to
really drive the headset to its full
potential and I will conclude by saying
that there are many positive aspects of
the 9h starting with the build quality
and comfort both of which are crucially
important within this very competitive
sphere of gaming audio they retractable
microphone is something I think more
companies should take note of and the
drivers are tuned well for gamers who
need every bit of detail in the game as
the 9h can deliver very detailed and
clear audio the included USB sound card
like what pretty much every gaming
headset out there is quite for and while
you can't play around with the equalizer
it lacks the proper power to drive the
headset to its full potential
and because of this the 160 dollar price
tag is slightly high and I'd like to see
a cheaper package without the USB dongle
I also would have liked to see
interchangeable ear pads like with their
other headsets just to provide the
slightly more open audio that would
enhance the soundstage so guys if you
are in the market for a gaming headset
this should certainly be want to
consider that is if you want a closed
type experience so make sure to LIKE
