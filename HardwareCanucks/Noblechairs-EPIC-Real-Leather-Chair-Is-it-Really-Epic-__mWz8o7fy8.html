I give up all right let's go find you a
chair nope nope
No No
No
yep
this could be you every time you turn on
your PC super-chill CPU happy you
crackin x61
ye NZXT purchase discount in the
description below so it's up guys I'm
Dimitri with I reckon axe and I spend a
dangerous amount of time in front of my
computer editing videos writing bla bla
bla but ever since getting the dxracer
chair and then moving on to the verdict
gear chair and now this from noble I
realize just how wrong this entire
gaming chair industry is for agronomic
daily use now if you think about it
gaming chairs are perfect for eSports
events for promotional purposes and
marketing and whatever they're excellent
for show coverage like you know being
part of a demo set but it's not really
good for daily use and that's a fact be
warned if you're considering you're
buying one because of how awesome and
popular they are on the market now I'm
sorry I don't mean to be a party pooper
and I just ruined the mood for this
video so stick around it's gonna be a
good one lots of insightful information
if you're considering to buy a gaming
chair for yourself so stay tuned so the
chair in question we have today is from
Noble it's part of their epic series in
real leather so that's awesome it's also
in black color price-wise it's 550 euros
since they're based out of Berlin so
expect around 600 plus US dollars for
real leather and some 300 plus for the
PU leather now this is actually the best
gaming chair that I've owned in terms of
comfort which is thanks to that real
leather cover for the seat itself and
the backrest aside from being easy to
clean it does not concentrate the heat
which is so awesome for the summer
months and that alone puts it ahead of
many competing chair brands that don't
use real leather it feels great I
haven't taught us any imperfections in
the stitching and generally real leather
is more durable in the long term the
diamond stitching is a nice touch it
certainly fits the noble brand and I
like the full black appearance although
accent stitching is available the basics
of the chair include a smooth gas lift
with about 10 centimeters of height
increase which decreases to about 8
centimeters when you actually sit on it
because of the
impression we have 45-degree adjustment
on the back seat if you want a leisure
posture and then unlocking this lever
gives you 14 degrees of Seath recline
that I find has good enough resistance
and doesn't just rock back and less
intend it the armrests have everything
we need with height adjustment you can
slide them side to side to create more
space in the middle and also slide them
lengthwise to accommodate for where your
elbows might fall and they can also
rotate in and out which I constantly use
to create either enough area for my legs
when they're on the seat itself or if I
want my elbows close with the body so
it's all made to work for you the
surface of the armrest is also fine it's
plastic but feels very nice on the hand
and that's very important as I level the
armrest to my table height which gives
me nice support or I can simply lower
them if I need to tuck myself under the
table for an editing session the wheels
by the way are very quiet rotation is
fine on carpet and the wood floor
now materials the wheels and the armrest
is one thing but the core of the chair
is what matters the most so the seat is
a bucket seat which means you have
raised grooves on each side and it kind
of locks you in the middle so you don't
move around
luckily the sides are not raised much
and we have a much wider front that
allows me to put up my legs on the chair
and avoid all the rules when it comes to
proper posture now I was surprised at
how little padding there was on the seat
itself which I actually don't mind
you're not sinking into anything soft
and I feel the support is there so the
seat portion is quite good but when it
comes to the lateral support of the
backrest this is where gaming chairs
lose the economic appeal these chairs
are the most comfortable when you're
leaning back into the seat which is fine
for leisurely activity on your desk but
when you need to maintain proper posture
for hours and hours and the back seat is
no good this is primarily because of the
side wings that again supposed to slot
you into the chair
luckily the side extensions at my waist
are angled outwards and don't really
interfere with my posture but look what
happens when I strengthen the back seat
there's absolutely no support for your
lower back especially with these
additional curves on the top of the
frame above my shoulders that sort of
curve you inwards so this entire frame
design relies on one lumbar pillow to be
considered comfortable when sitting
upright with proper back position now
the pillow is very comfortable to touch
with foam inside which I wish was memory
foam as it's a little bit too thick and
a little bit too firm but without the
pillow your back is a curve which is
ridiculous if you try to sit straight
and so this racing seat design is fine
if you lean back and have a leisure
posture maybe put on the pillow and try
to relax but at its core as in their
genomic chair well it's quite sad to see
a single lumbar pillow being the saving
grace for comfort when you sit normally
and so here's a PSA for all the gaming
chair brands you figured out your
visuals the oh look pretty and
tractive we all want them that's a done
deal you figure out your market share a
nice big chunk from the gaming industry
but please please please fix the
backrest back support so it's not a
single flat piece but we have nice lower
back support like a built in lumbar
cushion that has actual support for
economics straight use you know when
you're sitting straighten from the
computer and not just slouching back and
you know going boss mode like that that
would be fantastic
and actually considerable for consistent
daily use for like Home Office and such
and so this is my third gaming chair and
I only now realize sort of what is wrong
with the entire industry and I can't
wait for it to improve so for all
potential buyers you should all have
realistic expectations in terms of
ergonomics and comfort if you are to buy
one of these gaming chairs I do like
that Noble is covering all their bases
in terms of excellent real leather
materials nice armrests nice wheels and
average build quality in terms of what
we can expect this price point but I
would love to see the chair industry
within the gaming sphere change for me
to recommend it as a daily consistent
use or driver as a chair and so guys I
hope you enjoyed this review I am
interested in here what type of surface
has the pleasure of touching your bottom
let us know in the comments down below
I'm going to meet you with our Canucks
and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
