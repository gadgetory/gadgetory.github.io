arrived I'll show you man anything
office chair but before we go on a quick
message from our sponsor the dark bass
900 may be the most innovative case of
the year with a built-in Qi charger
interior lighting tempered glass that
can be installed on either side and a
fully modular interior that can be
inverted if you so desire be quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below so I've been using
the vernier SL 4000 so far it's ok as a
racing seat but no way is this any good
for an office seat where I spend hours
and hours editing so a new chair has
arrived
something you perhaps has seen our
coverage during Computex the trigger
line from Burton here in the last year
is the trigger 350 s II which stands for
special edition
one of the biggest boxes I have ever
received this box is even bigger than
the previous box chair and even is
bigger than the giant thermal the gates
over there I am a little bit worried
about certain scuffs and stuff around
the box like I can actually feel part of
the chair sticking out that's not a good
sign I mean the whole box around is a
little bit scuffed up I can feel things
shifting inside of it
I really hope nothing is damaged now the
box is actually so large because the
chair is already preassembled so the
assembly process is three easy steps put
in the wheels put in a hydraulic pump
into the base which I have right there
and then simply put the assembled seat
on top of the hydraulic pump this is
because the trigger line has some
advanced tooling and everything is
controlled through the little triggers
on the on the armrest and you know
obviously you want to leave that for the
factory to assemble and not user
assembly headrest look at that I am
extremely excited about one particular
element on this chair see this is kind
of like pleather II material this my
friends is mesh you can actually see
through it
hello ventilation through and there it
is the very gear this is a trigger 375
SC ST because we have actual leather
accents in this maroon red which is
actually the harmonics colors which is a
quiet coincidental and we have an
aluminum aluminum frame over here look
at this look at that beautiful color Wow
well the chair itself oh my god I'm so
happy that I'm finally sitting on
something that is comfortable for an
office desk use there's so many
adjustable portions I love the lumbar
support and look at that color let
maroon
color is very much hard-working ox
colors it's not intentional but it's
absolutely gorgeous
I'm and when I'm starting to film the
chair review I will be doing it like a
car commercial because there's so many
like reflections and stuff that you can
play around with and especially because
this is mesh and see-through I'm
definitely going to be utilizing this
for the final video so I'm finally
getting around to filming the giant
thermal take case the biggest case that
I've ever reviewed and right now I'm
setting up like a shot of case within a
case within the case and this is
supposed to portray the scale of this
ginormous enclosure on the exterior
while I have two more cases inside so
this like mid Tower the s340 elite and
the s century this is the ITX seven
liters it worked out look at how
beautiful they all fit inside that's
going to be a very nice shot
and one productive aspect of my day
while I'm trying to shoot something is
to play something on the chair and
therefore I am not inclined to sit on it
so I'm constantly on my feet trying to
be moving around the office and trying
to keep filming because sometimes you
know the email comes in or if I'm trying
to re-edit something on the computer
right now you can see I'm doing a bit of
editing while also trying to shoot
something this is the intro for this
something crazy behind me let me show
you
Wow I guess it's time for this giant
it's going to be epic and hopefully you
guys don't hate me too much for taking a
look at this case is simply because of
its similarities with another brand that
produces similar cases as well the
problem of course of doing so many
things at once is this giant mess that I
have on the table you've probably seen
the Instagram pictures and the tour
where everything is super clean yeah not
so much everything is everywhere right
now I'm currently this thing there's
some highs RG s X 1000 amp it's actually
their new gaming amp and its really good
of course think busy is always great and
will keep you away from slacking and
slacking is the last thing I want right
now especially with CES around the
corner with so many videos to get
through you know I'm trying to stay as
busy as possible so right now I'm
setting up to do my slide that reveals
case inciting case inside the main case
crap just realized I'm shooting in the
wrong white balance of course trying a
new angle is always beneficial in case
the first shot doesn't work so do you
guys remember 2001 Space Odyssey when
the greatest sci-fi is ever made and
right now I am trying to create a
pre-roll NZXT a spot for the ex 61 X 52
Kraken coolers in relation to the howl
9000 computer as usual I'm trying to
just basically figure out what's the
best way to get my camera inside on this
angle so I can capture the actual cooler
itself I mean this office has been in
like full production mode for the last
four days and I just haven't had the
time to clean this up but I need to
place the camera so that I'm looking
directly into cooler
so my ideas to create this blackout is
you can see right now on the screen what
this looks like
that is my Hal 9000 computer or in the
terms of the X 62 ad spot this is how
its created and this is what the
surrounding looks like it's a little bit
embarrassing but you just wait you just
wait on what the thing what the final
video will look like I am not realizing
just how dusty my PC is and since I'm
doing a really close macro of the cooler
yeah it's tough because you can still
see a little bit of like particles left
alone on the mirror and regardless of
how many times I wipe it they all seem
to just come back I just have to angle
the light so that the particles are not
visible on video but right now I feel
like this is pretty good
you got it v3 I'm not afraid to do that
where's my sunlight come on there we go
all right so for my next project I
finally started to work on the street
come DB or for this amazing and the most
beautiful cube aluminum enclosure
definitely getting nominated for the top
cases of 2016 stay tuned for that video
but I literally woke up today thinking
what I should do with this enclosure for
the video introduction I want to be
something special and instead of doing
some music and some standard b-roll
something that you guys I know we're
known for I wanted to use the unboxing
sound so like me cutting the tape me
taking out the the case out of this box
or like like these status sounds to
substitute for the music and then I will
take this case into the park like I had
in my 1 plus 3t video and everybody
loved that type of scenery but aside
from that there are no other significant
differences in everyday use and I think
that there'll be a really cool
contradiction in audio and visuals so
like hearing something that's unboxed
while you just see case that's so
beautiful inside the park I think that's
gonna be really cool
so I'm going to worry about filming this
part because I only want to capture the
audio of the unboxing and I'm thinking
that's a pretty interesting take on an
introduction hopefully it turns out
pretty good so the microphone is very
sensitive and what I'm opening the
cardboard for example all I'm looking
for is that friction between the
cardboard and the carbon itself and like
just me handling the box that's what I'm
looking for okay I'm realizing something
the unboxing experience is actually very
unique it's packaged very well so I'm
gonna take out the big camera and
actually shoot it I'm you know gathering
ideas somewhat like what type of shots I
can acquire for this or the packaging
here because you know what it's a very
unique piece of a piece of case and it
comes in package very well something
that I really don't want to miss
although I did capture all my audio just
now so that I can use that for the
introduction and then once the video
starts I can actually show what type of
unboxing experience people would go
through if they are to purchase this so
guys thank you so much for watching this
vlog I'm sorry it was so sporadic and
and all over the place but as I'm trying
to work I'm also trying to film the
behind the scenes and just try to
capture water on my mind is going
through and then hope it clears out some
of the things on why you see certain
things on the review videos and you know
what you get below a glimpse on how they
are done behind the scenes make sure to
check out the previous vlogs and let us
know if you have any feedback or
continuation of these type of videos I'm
going to be teaching our next experts
for watching we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
