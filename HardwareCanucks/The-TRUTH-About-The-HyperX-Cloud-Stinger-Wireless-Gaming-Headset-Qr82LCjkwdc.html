higher price point and crappy battery
life is just so convenient from a desk
cleanliness perspective and better
mobility for keyboard mouse and
especially a headset and I feel like the
reason why wireless headsets aren't so
popular is because of price and sound
quality and I've done the massive
Wireless battle in the past comparing
eight headsets most of which were well
over $100 which is why I'm excited to
review the HyperX cloud stinger Wireless
a new $99 headset that promises a solid
experience it's compatible PC and ps4
and as usual I will leave all my
favorite wireless and wired headsets in
the description below let's begin after
this damn what I provide TX system you
run and this is an ATX machine you mean
micrognathia
no no full sized ATX components it's
just a small package it can still
satisfy the Q 500 L by Coolermaster and
affordable and the pretty compact
enclosure for all your regular hardware
wood perforated exterior and PSU bracket
that shifts up and down flexible side
high oh and awesome cable management the
Q 500 L a compact frame with full ATX
satisfaction check it out below
so the original cloud stinger the wired
version was a $50 headset and doubling
the price to an already bare-bones frame
for the wireless version seems a bit
steep even if they're just trying to
create some separation between other
HyperX headsets but the cloud flight in
my opinion is still a better product
altogether that goes on sale quite often
now the direct competitor here will be
the corsair HS70 for $99 or an $89
Logitech G533 that is very plasticky
but with fantastic surround sound output
and the SteelSeries octa 7 also
fluctuates around the $120 mark that is
worth considering now the frame is
identical to the original stinger all
plastic build with metal sized
extensions the plastic coating mimics
that of sandblasted aluminum which is
nice with this brushed logo texture
instead of being red and the ear cups
are similar to what you'll find on the
cloud flight but with thinner interior
fabric they are slightly lighter at 270
grams versus the HS70 or the cloud
flight and I've always found their
clamping structure to be appropriate
or comfortable wear throughout the
entire day although sound isolation
isn't as good as with the flight and
it's actually quite similar to the HS70
meaning the ear cups are not as soft and
don't create that super seal around the
year and I actually prefer this because
it makes me really uncomfortable not
hearing anything while I'm wearing a
headset it still has decent passive
isolation but not what you'd find on the
cloud flight I love the ear cup rotation
to wear the headset on your neck and
it's low-profile enough and none of the
joints are poking you the volume wheel
is on the right side without any scroll
steps instead it's quite smooth with
good resistance the power button with
battery LED status is on the left ear
cup with color-coded flashes to indicate
your battery life now HyperX claims 17
hours of playback at 50% volume and I
was able to go for around 12 hours
slightly above 50% so it's not ideal and
you'll have to get into a habit of
recharging this thing every three days
depending on how long you gain and you
can still use it while it's charging
but the provided cable is quite short
the USB receiver is the same found on
the cloud flight but with a blue
indicator instead of red and stinger
Wireless text on the - for
identification and if you travel the
receiver fits inside the ear cup like
this and for the wireless range I found
no interruptions in my kitchen which is
about 6 meters away with two walls in
between some pretty standard stuff as
for the microphone it is non removable
but has nice resistance upon rotation
and is also muted when in the upright
position in terms of vocal clarity let
me know what you think I feel like it's
got a lot of signal processing going on
the definition of my voice is quite poor
it's got a lot going on on the lower end
and I'm guessing in terms of trying to
cancel out me typing on a keyboard but
these are MX browns which are pretty
quiet they're still being picked up yet
the vocal clarity isn't really benefited
that's for the cloud flight microphone
this one sounds better to me let me know
what you think I feel like the whole
lower end isn't as muddy as on the
Stinger Wireless and just definition
overall is better and now in comparison
to the coarser HS70 this one sounds
flat in comparison to the other two so
because of it I prefer this thing of
Wireless even though it's very bass
heavy and
not as clear I feel like even though the
compression on that one is quite heavy
this one just is a bit too flat for my
liking and there's a reference point
among these other gaming microphones
here's what the GSP 500 sounds like I
would consider to be the benchmark for
Wired gaming microphones so just so you
can compare what you're losing on the
wireless side unless of course you go
with a mod mic Wireless you can check
out that video right over here alright
so I've put in some time into
competitive csgo with the Stinger
wireless and overall my performance was
not any different versus when I game
with the GSP 500 I didn't notice any
artifacts and could pinpoint the exact
direction of players because the sound
cues are well-defined the soundstage is
quiet Naruto and element separation for
really layered stuff could be better
this is not for csgo but for music
listening movies and other games and
especially in the mid-range detail is
buried behind the base somewhere it's
super disappointing and the lack of any
driver software means you cannot adjust
your EQ settings it is very powerful
output though so volume is not really an
issue but the detail in the mid-range is
if you've played EFT you know how
hearing steps on word glass or metal is
very important to map knowledge and
enemy presence yet with the Stinger
wireless they were not as audible to me
as with the HS70 and the overall
environment thought just muted to what
I've come to expect from my GSP 500 or
the HS70 and so the Corsair pair has
sharper treble thus appearing more
detailed with much better layered
separation yet still pretty close
soundstage to the Stinger Wireless but
the cloud flight has much better texture
throughout the entire range and much
more detailed and controlled bass
compared to these two pairs and I'm kind
of sad because the sound quality with
the stinger is pretty poor it's muddy
and lacks any mid-range definition it's
almost like listening to a low bandwidth
movie that is streaming online over a
really poor connection you know you
expect to hear some definition and it's
just it's there but you want more
definition and texture in the audio and
this thing just does not deliver and for
$99 my recommendation
still stands with the corsair HS 70
you're welcome now I'm going to pause
right here because looking in the big
data of user reviews on Amazon for the
HS70 iit doesn't look so hot while
the cloud flight is a bit more expensive
but user satisfaction is higher all
right guys I'm Dimitri thanks so much
