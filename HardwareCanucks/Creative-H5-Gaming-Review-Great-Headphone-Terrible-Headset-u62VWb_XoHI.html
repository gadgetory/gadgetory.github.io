we see and hear a good pair and it's
always interesting to test a new product
from an audio-only company because
creative labs have been around for quite
some time and for that reason we must be
extra critical so that their new
products don't simply ride the
reputation wave but are analyzed based
on the quality of the product itself and
not based on the history of the company
I
and so the h5 gaming headset is a $99
product which i think is acceptable for
the gaming umbrella the resemblance to
the HyperX cloud is there with an almost
identical frame but the ear cups here
are larger with reduced clamping force
I think creator have a really solid
product on their hands since the h5
meets my recommended requirements for an
everyday multi hour headset since its
build wall the minimal use of plastic is
refreshing it means it does not cry
anyway the aluminum frame around the ear
cups is nice but why would they put a
brushed aluminum plate on the sides it
just gets slapped with finger oils and I
don't want to bother cleaning them Plus
that visible very visible red X is a big
no it's like we have two steps forward
and build quality and simplicity of the
headphone but a big jump back and design
elements that ruin an otherwise perfect
pair the headband plus cedar cups have
leathery material that feel awesome the
ear cups are rectangular with decent
depth plus the clamping force is
excellent this is a very comfortable
headphone actually in the top three in
my gaming selection out competing the G
633 in the comfort level and even
competing on the same level as the game
one from Sennheiser they are close back
design that isolate very well despite
having ventilation or this bass port
holes at the very top the seal here is
excellent so you don't disturb others
around you and vice versa but venting
your ears is inevitable because heat
concentration is obviously present
the cable is removable which I
appreciate but why couldn't they
minimize the size of that inline remote
I think it's too large especially if
used outside the home but nonetheless it
can mute the microphone control the
volume and there's a play/pause button
for mobile devices that did not work on
my s7 nor on the iPhone I am NOT
impressed the microphone is removable it
has a nice flexible stem so you can
position it everywhere around you but
that's very sensitive so make sure not
but it has some noise canceling
properties as well which are you know it
picks up things you know if you'll be
typing on a keyboard don't expect it to
completely isolate but it sounds a
little nasally kind of hollow and but
it's so unfortunate when you compare the
microphone quality on a sub $100 gaming
headset to something like the mod mic
4.0 which sounds so much better it's
more clean it's not as nasally it's not
as hollow and you know why can't a
gaming headset have a good microphone
that is the sole reason of buying a
gaming headset because you have a
built-in microphone solution that's all
enclosed I know but that is the sole
reason why most people gravitate towards
their favorite pair of headphones and an
external microphone for all their comms
so as part of accessories we have an
extension for PC use that separates the
microphone and audio jacks from the
single 3.5 millimeter jack and so far
the h5 is comfortable it's built well it
isolates well the microphone kinda sucks
but the sound signature is on point and
so what I'm looking for in the gaming
headset is its ability to pick up detail
expand your you know audio environment
give you a fun frequency curve not
nothing too flat because it becomes kind
of boring with nice bass boost but
without spill nice treble extension
that's almost approaching the brighter
you know brighter range but without
harshness and the mid-range that is
detailed with good separation and all
that is present with the h5 as far as
the soundstage goes being a closed back
design I was pleased my positional
awareness in csgo was still perfect
despite feeling a slightly smaller audio
environment so instead of sensing you
know footsteps 20 meters that way it was
a little bit closed off so you
have the detail to sort of compliment
your positional awareness but soundstage
for clothes bag design is expected where
it is invalid for the sound engine is
fantastic so all the millions of sound
effects that are constantly bombarding
your ears is awesome and it did not fall
apart with the h5 and so you know this
would be my go-to gaming headset which
is a closed back design if I wasn't
already spoiled by my solution with the
HD 800 and the mod mic 4.0 the two
biggest weaknesses here are the
microphone quality there is a reason why
most gaming headsets suffer bad
reputation you know because they might
sound excellent like these do but the
microphone just totally sucks and you
have to go for an external microphone
solution which defeats the purpose of
buying a gaming headset in the first
place and the second thing is this
inline dongle is a little bit too large
I would appreciate to be a bit smaller
to be more comfortable to use for
outside of the home and so that
concludes the h5 review from creative
labs I hope you enjoyed the biggest
advantage with these over the HyperX
cloud would be the ear cup size I think
it's slightly bigger and so with the LA
with accommodate for bigger ears and
just bigger head in general and from
what I can see you know there are a
little bit more flexible and just less
clamping force initially so that this
would be generally better for larger
heads than the HyperX cloud but that
concludes this one I'm Dimitri with our
Canucks thanks much for watching and
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
