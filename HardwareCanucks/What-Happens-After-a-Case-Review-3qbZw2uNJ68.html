case review
let me show you so a very important
element for me after I start to do this
assembly is obviously organization you
can see right now there is none in here
or anywhere behind me
yeah I'm not the most organized when it
comes to stuff right after the shoot and
if you are wondering this is what for
cases on the loose looks like the finest
from practical design NZXT
and 450s right there this is the aged
440 the 2015 edition and the new monta
from NZXT actually there's another one
right here check this out this is the
fantex
P 400 and actually hold on a second
totally forgot about this one it's big
it's because it's in the box you know
it's kind of hidden there 400 C from
Corsair the worst thing about
disassembling a computer is the fact
that you do such a great cable
management job and then you have to
literally just cut off all the cable
ties that you know make you work so
beautiful and so clean I spend get a lot
of time trying to clean everything out
like it would be in my actual case he
paused to just you know house a system
inside of it now I have to take it all
apart I don't like that part at all one
of the things that is very important in
a case from you aside from the initial
assembly is disassembly which is just as
important this assembly comes in a few
stages is like if for example you have
to replace certain parts with you within
your Hardware within your system how
easy it would be to get access to those
things in a more conventional enclosure
where you have sort of everything
separated it's not a big deal
but in a less conventional
closer where things are source stacked
on top of each other where you have to
follow a specific procedure in order to
install everything properly inside a
case then this assembly is just as
important because you can think about
okay what can that happen if I have to
replace my GPU what's gonna happen if I
have to take out one of my hard drives
if it dies you know so all those
elements are just as important and I
realized that now so this is what I
received in 2013 the most valuable piece
of swag from Computex and what almost
three years ago now it's a screwdriver
it's magnetic so I can catch little
screws if they fall in between the
cracks it comes with multiple tips it's
super compact that can take opening
anywhere this always stays in my bag and
within reach when I'm building a system
this is the newest piece of swag most
valuable from CES 2016 this is a knife
from Toshiba as we visited OCC because
OCC is now owned by the Chiba
it's basically a Swiss Army knife with
an aluminum housing aluminum handles
check this out they match this is hi
recognizes Dimitri's piece of swag for
building computers man and post assembly
pre suite
so in the end after I finish you know
the disassembly I tried to put
everything back to normal I tried to
keep all the accessories that came with
a case that were used inside this case
and also the one thing that I always
tried to not forget is the i/o shield
because sometimes I have forgotten it
inside a case and I was then wondering
what the hell happened with my iron
shield so BAM IO shield and so in the
end the parts get a disassembled they
get put out on the table this case is
gonna go back into its box until we find
you know further future use for it and
we will move on to another case for you
so two things to take away from this
video one I used to build systems inside
a computer case review and really just
focus on the features and kind of yeah
how many drives or fans I can fit in how
in what spot in you know in the case for
you now it's more about the experience
how easy it is to build inside something
how easy it is to disassemble something
or swap and whatever so it becomes a lot
more about the experience now then let's
say two years ago with our case reviews
so it's evolving to become you know to
reflect on the actual what you we
working with the user experiences aside
from having just standard objective
features overview you know it's all
about how I feel and how it makes me
feel I hope that makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
