possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCIX one of the coolest pcs that we
saw at CES came from msi the vortex is
an engineering reminder that powerful
pcs don't have to be massive and it
looks like plenty of interior design
choices have been borrowed from the mac
pro but externally make look like in
gaming station no doubt there will be
those who dislike the gamer esque
look of the RGB strips on the front of
the enclosure with this wraparound
converging piece through the body with
complementing shape of the panels at the
top - and the illuminated logo at the
back but the idea of the vortex is to be
memorable and I think MSI has achieved
that perfectly
there is no built-in handle that would
make it a bit more move friendly but
that's totally fine and check out that
size it's really small for what it
offers and the most impressive thing
about this structure is the lack of an
external power brick the power supply is
actually built-in at the bottom so all
you have to do is plug it in hardware
wise it will feature a desktop sky like
CPU that you can swap up to four slots
of MDOT - SSDs dual GTX 980 graphics
cards which are the smaller than the
more efficient models of the desktop
GPUs up to 64 gigabytes of rams thanks
to sky league which you can access as
well and pretty much everything in this
machine is swap Bowl so you will be able
to replace the CPU the end the two
drives and in the RAM I'm not so sure
about the graphics cards just yet the
airflow is going to be great and I think
it's in the name with the large fan at
the top of the enclosure pulling air
through the case as large ventilation is
available at the bottom and then we
seriously cannot wait to test out the
temperatures and the acoustics in this
thing as for the i/o we have triple
audio ports four USB 3.0 dual HDMI dual
gear but Ethernet dual USB type-c and do
a mini DisplayPort so you can hook up
your g-sync panels if you want and take
advantage of those NVIDIA GPUs so the
vortex is such an awesome machine that
hopefully
ignites this trend within the PC
modularity that will also allow things
like this to be created by the user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
