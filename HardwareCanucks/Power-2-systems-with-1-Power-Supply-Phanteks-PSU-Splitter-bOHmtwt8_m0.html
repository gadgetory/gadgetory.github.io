possible without innovative fantex
world-leading Nvidia graphics memory
partner Corsair and retail partner and
CIX
along with silverstone and in wind back
in january we've reviewed the fantex
mini XL that allowed users to build two
systems inside the single case but the
main challenge then was how do you
actually power the two systems with a
single power supply and so fantex has
solved that issue with the release of
this power supplies splitter
so it's this module made for the mini XL
case but can be used with other dual
system configurations thanks to its low
profile nature as long as you find a
spot to fit it and so the way it works
is you get your source input of a single
24 pin cable and dual eight pin CPU
cables that splits the power of output
two to 24 pin cables and four four pin
CPU cables this will allow a single
power supply recommended of about 700
watt and plus to provide enough power
for your micro ATX and ITX systems
inside the case this would require users
to use 24 and 4 pin extensions coming
from the power supply splitter but the
most important part here is this option
to power two systems with one strong
enough power supply and give you the
option to either turn off one system
without affecting the other you will
still connect your drives directly via
SATA and the GPU will also be fed power
directly from the your source power
supply because once you cut the power to
24 pin cables the GPU will automatically
power off even if it's connected
directly to the power supply
they shut off this dual system setup and
the power supply splitter in action and
I think this is absolutely needed to
allow us to get outside the box of
strictly single system builds and give
us the option to build one main gaming
rig and maybe another streaming or a
server system right above we love that
fantex is being this innovative and we
certainly will utilize this in a future
build so if you have any suggestions put
them down in the comments below on the
type of systems and components that we
should build inside the mini XL case and
we'll give you an update once this power
supply splitter is finally long
