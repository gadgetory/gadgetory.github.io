efficient and powerful enough to replace
a desktop but that comes with the cost
for example in the past the most
powerful mobile GPU being used inside
notebooks ended up being cut down
derivatives of a desktop class graphics
card even the gtx 980m which was
considered to be powerful for its time
was based on a cut-down version of the
gtx 970 and that resulted in performance
primarily meant for notebooks with a
1080p display plus the frame rates were
a lot lower than its desktop
counterparts that's not the case today
because you can equip a notebook with a
desktop class GPU that has
specifications that are equal to or even
better than its desktop sibling but how
much of a performance increase are you
gaining over a previous generation
mobile GPU you'll have the answer to
that question by the end of this video
light up your build with hue plus by NZ
XD it fits into two and a half inch
drive slots comes with four individually
controlled RGB strips with plenty of
connection cables for best routing and
is wonderfully controlled through the
camp software get 10% off at NZXT comm
link in the description we'll be doing
all of our testing on this new notebook
from eurocom it's called the tornado f5
and under the hood we've configured it
with an i7 6700 K 32 gigs of ram a 256
gigabyte m2 SSD and a 1080p 60 Hertz
g-sync display the primary focus of this
video will be comparing the gtx 1070 and
the gtx 980m GPU in a true apples to
apple scenario using the exact same
notebook for both this is possible due
to the tornadoes MXM 3.0 interface and
relatively easy upgrade ability spec one
is the 1070 has 30% more CUDA cores much
higher clock frequencies more memory and
faster bandwidth compared to the 980 m
even when compared to the desktop card
this version of the gtx 1070 could be
considered faster since it has more
cores unlocked and ones that very
similar clock speeds you heard that
right
the notebook version is actually faster
than the add-in card you can probably
tell the 1070 is going to destroy the 90
DM - so what's the use of this video
it's actually to show how far we've come
in a single generation for notebook
gaming performance I'll be continuing
these head-to-head
comparisons as more mobile GPUs are
available and hopefully that will
include AMD at some point too because
they're very late with releasing their
Polaris 10 architecture into the
notebook space so let's roll with the
synthetic benchmarks starting with 3d
mark fire strike the tornado packed with
the 1070 performed nearly two times
faster than the 980 m you will notice
the Asus g7 52 V OC kept up really well
with the tornado and at some point
surpasses the eurocom since it boasts an
overclocked CPU alongside almost the
same specifications
moving on to some gaming we ran our
first tests at 1080p cranked at the high
settings and the gtx 1070 on the tornado
ruled throughout most of the titles the
980 m is trying hard to keep up but the
specs on it we're limiting it really is
amazing to see how far ahead the gtx
1070 really is in real-world scenarios
and something else to take into account
is that in some scenarios even with
detailed settings cranked the gtx 1070
is still cpu limited at 1080p 1440p
tests were performed on an external
monitor and the same story applies here
like I said the 980 m is not meant for
this kind of resolution because it was
targeted for notebooks with a 1080p
display but the tornado with the 10
sandy changes the story you can
confidently hope this monster to an
external 1440p monitor and enjoy the
graphics in many cases the 1070 actually
widens its lead here since that slice EP
bottleneck I talked about at 1080p has
been eliminated in DX 12 things really
changed in a big way it becomes obvious
the GTX 980 ms core architecture wasn't
all that well prepared for Microsoft's
new API and these results back that up
if you're buying a notebook with the
hope of playing dx12 games in the future
make sure you spend the money for a
Pascal based system let's talk about
battery life and as you can see the gtx
1070 gives about the same battery life
as a gtx 980m on the surface that might
not be as impressive but remember this
new card grants double the amount of
performance this is all performance per
one and in that regards Pascal rules the
day the tornado f5 from your compact
some serious punch under the hood the 15
inch form factor is not that bad for
portability plus if you're wondering
about upgrade ability it has you covered
as you can see there's an extra m2 slot
for storage expansion memories
accessible and most importantly the GPU
is upgradable to provided upcoming
architectures support the same form
factor the Graham spectrum keyboard by
Tesoro comes with a new mechanical agile
switch with low profile key caps with
super fast response and shorter
actuation distance plus all the
customization included with RGB lighting
and macros for a premium user and so my
concluding thoughts about the gtx 1070
and the gtx 980m is that this is just
the beginning
you see we're in time frame where
notebooks are loaded with dueling specs
that are neck to neck to an equivalent
desktop PC the only downside to these
machines are the massive size proper
cooling and the hefty price tag but I'm
sure that we solved some time in the
future but until then Pascal has proved
its performance and power efficiency
compared to Maxwell and if you're
thinking about upgrading do it as always
let us know your thoughts about this
comparison and if you have any
suggestions for future comparison videos

make sure to check them out
