checking out the antique one aimed at
entry-level builders with an attractive
price of $59 now it offers the basics
that this all you need when starting on
a new build so let's find out if this
one has the edge when it comes to budget
builds and starting with the size this
is one of the smallest mid towers that
we've looked at so this is an advantage
if you're thinking of a compact build
but there's plenty of compromises
because of this which will point out
later now you are looking at the
standard steel and plastic construction
with a decent build quality for such a
value chassis the front panel includes
your power and reset buttons 2 USB 3
ports with the USB 2 adapter and
coloured audio jacks right below are the
3 optical base and of course the front
intake area the panel is removable but
unfortunately we neither have the dust
filter nor the intake fan and this case
only supports the 120mm fan the top
panel includes the exhaust fan so there
has been a staple for Antec and we get
an extra 120mm fan port on the side
panel at the back we have the exhaust IO
area 7 PCI slots a little venting with
water cooling holes and then bottom
mounted bar supply that you can only
install in one direction
now unfortunately the PCI brackets are
not reusable but even for a value case I
feel they should be included what is
good news is the removable dust filter
at the bottom it's great to see this on
such a budget product the antic one has
pre-installed case feet that's slightly
elevate the chassis but because the
steel frame is quite thin the case might
not be properly leveled so wobbling may
be of an issue
and getting inside we have the tools
mounting for the optical drives and the
hardware cage below with this unusual
honeycomb design that allows for
ventilation on the drives then we have
this oversized CPU cut out along with
the cable management cutouts around the
motherboard tray the two fans included
at the top and rear exhaust and I
definitely recommend installing that
front intake for improved air flow also
natural fan intake can be installed at
the bottom but keep in mind the length
of your power supply must not exceed 150
millimeters for the fan to have
clearance also notice the lack of dust
filter on every intake so be prepared
for routine interior cleaning and coming
to the back notice the lack of the 8 pin
cable cut out meaning you'll have to
route the 8 pin cable underneath the
motherboard now we do have some cable
tie notches to help with organization of
your wiring and check out this rubber
bit it's supposed to provide that
necessary spacing between the panel and
the motherboard tray it actually came in
very useful during assembly now I really
wish entik widen the case just the tab
as there's practically no room for
wiring so good luck to you beginners the
3.5 inch drives are mounted using two
brackets and are quite secure when
installed and the cage supports a total
of 5 3.5 inch drives along with 2 SSDs
one which is installed at the bottom of
the cage and the other at the top so
moving on with the assembly here you can
get an idea of how this compact size is
a major disadvantage the top of the
motherboard practically touches the top
exhaust fan so clearance issues with CPU
towers may arise for many also routing
that 8 pin CPU cable from behind the
motherboard is possible but you must
pass the cable through before
installation of your motherboard now
this is a budget Tower so gamers likely
won't be installing ultra expensive
12-inch graphics card so we only have
10.5 inches of clearance for your GPU
but also keep in mind that graphics
cards are actually getting smaller yet
more powerful and there's a ton of
options on the market today
that are come
parable with smaller cases like this one
so everything wired up it's a pretty
tiny case to work in using hard drive
cage to store cables will come in handy
but it's quite difficult to clean up all
that mess at the front of your power
supply that will definitely have a toll
on airflow and so to wrap it up the
antic one chassis is an option for
budget builders as it hits the shelf at
an attractive price and a compact size
for entry-level builders this will do
the job with plenty of dry storage and a
decent amount of airflow options however
I feel the compact size brings in heavy
compromises with cable management that
will clog up the airflow and I wish the
case was one inch larger in every
direction that will allow that 8 pin CPU
connector to be routed properly and
having only 10.5 inches of clearance for
the graphics card is limiting also not
having any dust filters is a major
drawback and incorporation of such
features sets you apart from the
competition
so the entik one is entering a heavily
saturated four value chassis it offers
the basics and perhaps that is all you
need for your build but if you are
planning on beating up your entry level
gaming rig down the road it's not a bad
idea to explore your options by looking
at competitors and an take themselves so
thanks guys for watching let us know
what you think about the antic one leave

you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
