great technology selection and service
hey guys Dmitry here with hardware
connects and the razor blade Pro 17 is
one of those machines that's supposed to
make sense for professionals that rely
on this amazing blade form factor of a
computer but with a larger 17 inch
display and the hardware to match our
growing demands from mobile power the
new blade Pro 17 hits a whopping $3,000
that is really difficult to swallow
considering the blade 14 exists that as
a cheaper and a more powerful machine
and I think racers who have done a bit
more with this machine to make it
actually competitive not just within the
notebook sphere but for razor to offer
flexible options but without any further
ado let's see what it's got going for it
so hardware-wise you are getting a quad
core i7 4720 HQ with turbo up to 3.6
gigahertz 16 gigs of ram and nvidia gtx
960m video card with 4 gigs of v RAM and
128 gigabyte SSD along with a 500
gigabyte hard drive and then 802 2.11 AC
Wi-Fi with Bluetooth 4.0 now the major
disappointment here is the GPU for the
price we were expecting in 980m for a
machine of this caliber and having only
128 gigabyte SSD is again and punch in
the stomach for $3,000 now what's even
the bigger question mark is the display
razer has decided to include here it is
a 17.3 inch 1920 by 1080 P T and panel
raisers own plate for team sports and
eggs Oh 3k display so despite the lower
resolution viewing angles on the blade
pro are just horrible with a varying
contrast shift and that's not pleasing
to view and here's a comparison to an
IPS display from a machine literally
half the price it's really a joke that
Razer is marketing this for professional
use but let's lighten up the atmosphere
a little bit and talk about what is good
about the machine
so the form factor and the build quality
the entire frame is made out of anodized
aluminum that looks and feels gorgeous
with illuminated Razer logo on the lid
this is by far one of the best built
machines period following in the
footsteps of a MacBook the black is
gorgeous but it is a huge fingerprint
magnet it is very thin at 22 points four
millimeters and doesn't weight too much
either at only three kilos surprisingly
the included power brick was not huge
this is awesome for travel don't need to
spare much room in the backpack and
here's a nice comparison to an HTC one
however when the laptop is plugged in we
noticed the coil wine which was very
annoying especially if you are in the
silent environment opening and closing
the lid gives off a very satisfying feel
without any flex on the lid and since
it's made out of premium material the
weight distribution is on point which
means you can open the lid with just one
hand
without tipping over the entire machine
and we also have these rubber edges on
the screen that prevents dust and
particles from entering the laptop an
important element in the proper physical
hygiene take me a physical tour of the
IO you'll find the power input Gigabit
Ethernet HDMI 1.4 a that supports 4k
output at 60 Hertz 3 USB 3.0 ports and a
3.5 millimeter headphone and microphone
combo jack we would like to see them
separated in future revisions the
cooling vents are in symmetry running
along the top of each side but I'm a
little skeptical about the i/o placement
because on the right side there's only a
Kensington lock that will make the left
side of the blade Pro really busy with
inputs also seeing the DisplayPort
output would have been ideal to
diversify your display output options
opening the blade pro 17 we have the
power button that looks unique and it's
a quite stunning the engraved logo
bosses green when the machine is turned
on the speaker grille is sets right and
from the power button with direct sound
projection for the user it's pretty loud
with good treble but lacks body in the
base region let's take a listen
and moving on the slightly indented
backlit keyboard feels really premium
razer certainly has not skipped on the
build quality elements of this machine
the typing experience is really
excellent and I love how responsive they
are without standing Lea fast rebound
and the key caps also are built of
aluminum the trackpad is placed right
beside the keyboard on the right and
Razer decided to step up the tracking
experience with something unique it does
require a bit of muscle memory toe as
many times I would bring my hands
underneath the middle of the keyboard
expecting to find the trackpad there but
they have incorporated an LCD
touchscreen with the extra intuitive
user interface that they call the
switchblade UI basically you have ten
physical buttons right above the screen
that are specifically dedicated to
perform certain functions we have our
traditional trackpad feature then we
have the dedicated number pad along with
some important settings that pop up on
the buttons themselves the macro buttons
allow you to program keys to your
preferred button combinations might be
useful for gaming or actually for
productivity applications as well the
gaming mode button will disable the
windows feed dedicated web browser is
certainly not as responsive as it should
be something no one ever should use the
YouTube app is pretty basic that allows
you to watch content on the 480p screen
but since YouTube and Razer have not
updated their player we've experienced
issues with playback that does not
actually allow us to view any of the
videos the Facebook and Twitter app are
pretty straightforward but it's clear
that the development emphasis is lacking
here and using these apps on the touch
screen will yield unsatisfactory and
play out gimmicky and same goes for the
Gmail app that clearly needs an update
as the text is way too small as
and it's all slow to navigate through
the track by itself though is great with
a glass coating that allows smooth
navigation there is some attractive
design elements built in like the muted
Razer logo underneath and as you trace
your fingers across the screen a little
green afterglow follows and the left and
right click below the touchscreen could
offer better registration and just the
position of the trackpad on the right
side of the keyboard makes the buttons
kind of awkward to use but let's shift
gears and talk about performance the
thermals and the noise so Ebor take it
away
alright so reviewing the thermal footage
you can clearly see the blade pro 17 has
one major hotspot on the right side of
the keyboard
right beside the trackpad the heat is
noticeable throughout the chassis and
when typing transferring the heat on to
your hands so be prepared for the warmth
also notice the two jet streams of hot
air exiting through the exhaust ports on
each side the left side is not as
noticeable as right because if you're
using amounts your fingertips might be
right in the area of the exhaust and
again something to be cautious about
rear-facing exhaust would have been more
ideal idle temperatures are okay with 58
and 43 degrees Celsius on the CPU and
GPU respectively with high 80s during
load and a more efficient cooling system
maybe in order to fix the heat output
jumping on to gaming and the 960m with
four gigs of VRAM is not for ultra or
even very high settings compared to the
rest of the mobile 900 series GPUs the
960m is struggling to keep up with
adequate frame rates hovering around the
30fps mark on most of the titles but
with really low minimums that require
you to lower in game settings to medium
for better experience and so the Razer
Blade Pro 17 for professional use makes
no sense because of the TN panel and the
viewing angles are just not to par for
what you should expect Plus featuring
only a 960 m fields limiting for the
price as gaming performance is poor the
built-in apps on the touchpad is a neat
idea but the slow performance and
inconvenient usage makes it practically
useless the cooling system is loud and
the heat makes its way into a larger
portion of the keyboard really the
strongest part about this mission
is the form-factor the entire blade
lineup makes a confident statement in
the build quality department but with
the blade 14 out that 17 inch variant is
a hard sell regardless of the larger
form factor we need to see redesigned
cooling vents a 3k IPS display and a gtx
980m for us to consider the investment
even remotely worth it as a right now
the new blade pro 17 is a machine to
avoid and that concludes our review make
