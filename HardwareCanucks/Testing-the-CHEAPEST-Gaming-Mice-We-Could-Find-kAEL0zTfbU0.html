review more budget peripherals for
gaming always looking at something super
expensive and perhaps unaccessible
so that changes today and so what I
haven't found me are gaming mice that
there are around ten dollars ten fifteen
dollars and the only two outliers are
these guys which around $20 I'm guessing
is because of the fancy packaging on
this one and the green body and this one
because it's got a really good sensor
the PWM 3325 but I'm really excited to
see if we can actually find a jam or two
in this budget category let's review
right after this the new master keys MK
750 keyboard comes with a comfortable
magnetic rest rest
beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter
and perky lighting control with a
variety of Cherry MX switches and the
bottom type-c connection Coolermaster
doing it right check it out below the
one surprising element that I didn't
think I would appreciate when I ordered
these would be packaging so I mean sure
this one has no graphics on it
whatsoever just a simple box but it's
recyclable unlike the traditional style
for gaming peripherals is this which is
more difficult to recycle but of course
it looks fancier you can see what's
inside
but this one is the other outlier so
it's also a $20.00 Mouse but a nice box
with a sleeve of information so I really
like this approach see these guys are
stepping it up a bit with that rhombus
graphic but yeah I mean I appreciate
that I can simply recycle this after use
but some of these translations on
packaging is hilarious for example here
it says aggravating piece of design I
don't thing they mean to say aggravating
maybe they meant to say like aggressive
and gamer ish but on the back check this
out
tail box design stable movement and
accurate positioned positioned these
guys definitely don't know what they're
doing in terms of thought passion for
gaming II gross font but then mouse
where's the cohesion and your font
designer
this is hilarious so this is one of the
wireless mice that I received certified
packaging frustration-free
this is hilarious I've never seen a
frustration-free packaging label cool
cool and this one says it's designed for
office and gaming so their priorities
are both ways and yeah I'm really
excited to see if we can actually find
like a jam or two in this collection
so let's unpackaging and start testing
each of these now I realize the naming
scheme for each of these mice is a bit
ridiculous so I've labeled them one to
eight so it's easier for you guys to
follow and if you want to purchase them
they'll be linked in the description
okay so out of the entire collection
these are my favorite shape wise number
one and three number one not just
because it's green but because the
actual shape makes total sense we have
this beautiful thumb area where your
thumb can sit comfortably the right side
is curved perfectly fine for your hand
to stay there there's nothing poking you
nothing unnatural and the actual surface
texture it is slightly rubberized for a
more controlled grip really lovely on
number one number three it kind of
reminds me of a razer deathadder which
is a good thing it's like an iconic
shape for our gaming mice but this one
has an optical sensor so if you guys
like the death outer shape definitely
pick this one up but here we have
slightly textured top surface so even if
you have a slightly sweaty hands you'll
be fine with this one however the side
grips a little bit kind of glossy and
slippery despite having this sort of
like texture on stuff I wish that the
entire Mouse was coated with the same
material as the top surface where your
buttons are moving on to number two four
five and seven so these are like the
slightly lower tier in terms of shape I
still like number what is this number
two because it kind of reminds me of a
death out or two but the actual surface
material is quite slippery so if you
have sweaty hands it feels like you
don't have much control and just the
mouse might slip out and even though we
have the same sort of texture on the
sides it's still quite glossy glossy and
plastic
and has no grip support whatsoever for
number four this is an ambidextrous
designed but button layout is only for
right-hand use and I don't totally like
him that's just bodies but here I
actually don't mind it at all nothing's
poking me nice curvature on the body and
really nice sort of like contoured
buttons so your fingers and everything
just fits into place just fine from
number five this one is a bit wider and
I can see where they're trying to do
because I used to actually prefer wider
mice because they would support my
entire hand but here the thumb area for
example it has this like cutouts where
the light LED comes through but it's
very slippery the plastic material is
super cheap while on the right side
where the contours for your fingers are
are not angled properly so you have to
angle your hand instead for your fingers
to fit there properly and your end up
holding the mouse in the most unnatural
way possible so number five is not the
worst but it's also you have to like
have a particular claw style grip for
this thing to fit and for number seven
it is a symmetrical shape which I don't
mind here and while it may look like
something out of a spaceship with all
the plating and something being cooked
up inside and the radioactive symbol on
the body the actual contours and
everything like that is smoothed out so
the material choice is pretty good here
and yeah just like overall very nice
comfortable I think to hold and the last
to number six and eight are kind of the
worst in terms of the shape Department
so number six is actually the cheapest
out of the bunch it's only seven dollars
and while it may not look like it's
seven dollars because of all the fancy
lighting the actual form of this Mouse
is absolutely terrible so not only is it
not high enough so it feels like you're
holding something super flat like this
is probably Apple Magic Mouse level
terrible but the actual surface area is
quite smooth so there's no way to grip
the mouse perfectly fine the thumb area
is too curved so there's no way for your
thumb to sit properly and just kind of
escape that area and while I appreciate
them trying to make the mouse more
comfortable with this additional thing
on the on the right side it's just not
properly aligned to where you
and normally would sit so you end up
holding something that feels extremely
uncomfortable even for claw type grip
now for number eight
due to its symmetrical design the right
side feels unnatural and even the left
side where your thumb should go the
thumb buttons are way too low and that's
exactly where your thumb sits so overall
the height is good the curvature of the
top is good but the right side is not
the best even for like a finger claw
type grip just your these fingers don't
know where to go and it feels unnatural
all right so let's begin with buttons
and sensor so number one this one is
driverless and buttons are fantastic
with nice tactile response great
rebounds the thumb buttons have the soft
press with good travel amount and this
is one of the better scroll wheels two
out of the entire lineup with an
actually decent middle click too it's
not too hard to press and the DPI button
is behind it it's discrete with three
dpi levels and the brightness of that
LED determines which one you're on it is
using an optical sensor the pane 3509
and the liftoff distance is actually
very low so it's not an issue if you
lift your mouse like I do and so there
is no tracking disturbance while the
Mouse's either in the air or when it's
coming down
there's no weird behavior with flicks
either so the sensor is tracking
everything perfectly and the body is
well-balanced too you know it's not like
front heavy or back heavy it's just just
fine and overall for 17 dollars this is
a fantastic Mouse out of the entire
lineup so we definitely recommend it
alright so moving on to number 2 and the
primary left and right clicks are super
nice but the right-click body is kind of
wobbly and loose so I'm not sure if
we'll like fall apart over time these
scroll steps are pretty good but the
middle click is kind of hard so I won't
be using that the thumb buttons are okay
but the front thumb button is a little
too much forward so I have to readjust
my grip in order to reach it and you can
change the lighting effect with a button
on the top and we also have five dpi
steps which you can also change with a
button behind the scroll wheel it is
using a PWM 3325 optical sensor which
can go as low as 100 dpi although after
5000 dpi and you can change that in 100
DPI increments which is amazing the
liftoff distance is super low so
performance is fantastic all across the
board and for $17 I'm surprised that
this is like a complete package in terms
of like the shape in the buttons and
like the form factor however it also
comes with drivers which don't suck
which you can change your your button
layout you can change the LED settings
we have a macro manager so you can
record macros on here and of course
configure your DPI settings that are all
saved on the profile to the mouse so
that's pretty incredible
all for $17 this is awesome moving on to
number three this one is driverless and
I realize that I bought this on sale for
$15 but it sells for 25 normally so it's
a bit at the disadvantage compared to
the rest of value eyes but all the
buttons on here are awesome the scroll
wheel is one of the best in the entire
lineup with a nice light middle-click
tube and the sights from your standard
thumb keys there's also this fire key
that acts as your left-click with two
consistent clicks so it's actually quite
awesome for csgo when you need to
headshots to get a kill with like a
pistol or something the sensor is an
evaluate 50 optical with only 4 dpi
steps in 1000 increments so
customization is not present and you
know I usually like to play it like 400
800 dpi so having a minimum of thousand
is not a good thing for me
performance is great though no spin outs
and it's easy to control
but the liftoff distance is quite high
so it's not pleasant
if you reposition the mouse a lot like I
do so I would actually consider number 2
to be a little bit more superior because
the liftoff distance on that Mouse is
much lower than number 3 moving on to
number 4 the primary left and right
clicks are good the some buttons have
nice feel and location you can access
them easily the scroll wheel the steps
are a little bit undefined and the
scroll wheel also wobbles which is not
nice we have 5 dpi levels they change
with the color and we have full driver
support to with pulling weight
adjustment dpi settings and you can even
record macros and the main crappy thing
is the liftoff distance which is way too
high for me it's almost like 1
centimeter
causing lots of unwanted
when it's not necessary but if you don't
lift the mouse a lot the tracking is
actually quite accurate and the glide is
really smooth
these glide feet are actually one the
best in this collection also this is the
only Mouse without a braided cable which
is awesome I love the light rubberized
cables they don't kink as easily and
they don't like catch and other things
whereas the rest of these mice all have
some sort of braiding moving on to
number five this one is driverless now
the buttons are great and the scroll
wheel is okay and we have five dpi steps
but even though they say it comes with
an optical sensor it is extremely jerky
with precise aim which is almost
impossible and there seems to be also
acceleration built in and it spins out
way too easily so definitely a hard pass
on this one moving on to number six this
one is driverless and remember this is
the seven dollar mouse the cheapest out
of the bunch now both the scroll wheel
and something inside of it is rambling
and wobbling but the buttons are
actually okay and we have four dpi steps
and it has one good property precise aim
at lower dpi is surprisingly fine for me
so for casual games it's totally
possible and if you have only seven
dollars to spare in the mouse and you
like the graphic of this RGB thing on
the top this may be for you however the
sensor cannot track anything fast and
will spin out way too easy plus it's the
only Mouse that has no Teflon feet at
the bottom instead the feet are just
this regular plastic like the rest of
the body causing a somewhat harsh
movement moving on to number seven this
one is driverless and it's wireless with
a built-in rechargeable battery a cable
for that is included plus you need to
connect this dongle for the operation to
happen so it is not Bluetooth enabled
the light switch is easily accessible at
the bottom and I've already had to
recharge it in the last few days so
battery life is pretty short but you can
just simply have the mouse on without
the lights to preserve the battery the
primary clicks are super weird though in
that they're really silent and you
cannot hear them whatsoever and have
this very satisfying actuation texture
so if you need the completely silent
mount wireless mouse for either your
laptop your desktop if you're doing
anything at school and the one be
distracting this is actually a really
good choice the scroll wheel toe is
disappointing with really
mocchi steps but the thumb buttons are
totally fine Otto
they're extremely loud in comparison to
the primary clicks we have three dpi
levels and precise aim is kind of tricky
as the cursor has some jitter plus it's
unable to track flicks and you would
spin out easily but for standard desktop
use and for notebooks and some many
casual games it's actually not terrible
and for number eight this one is also
driverless and it's wireless too but it
needs one double-a battery which by the
way is not included which I found
strange but it has the same receiver
pocket on the body so you don't lose the
receiver it goes to sleep after three
minutes of inactivity to preserve
battery life and they claimed twelve
months of battery life which I highly
doubt the button mechanism is actually
quite nice aside from the really loose
scroll wheel but the middle click is
light enough there's also a fire button
near the thumb for the double-click and
we have five dpi levels and slower
tracking is actually decent not for
competitive of course as the sensor
spins out and it doesn't read fast
movement but for desktop and casual
games it's okay alright people so to
wrap things up I'm impressed at how
variable all these mice are in terms of
their build quality in terms of the
sensor performance and like you know
some have actually fool out fledged
style driver support which I wasn't
expecting in this price point so the
thing is that I would definitely in or
from this list a five six and eight
eight not because the wireless
performance sucks but because it
requires a battery and the shape is not
to my style six because it's the
cheapest out of the bunch and it shows
sensor performance is really terrible
and the body is just horrendous as well
and number five not because I mean the
body is a little bit uncomfortable but
the sensor performance is just not good
because it just spins out everywhere
even though they say it's an optical
sensor now the mice that I would
consider passable are three four and
seven seven because it's wireless and
I'm really blown away this whole like
silent switch operation so if that's a
priority for you plus
doesn't need a battery it has a built-in
one that you can recharge via microUSB
that's awesome number four I really like
the shape the balance of the body the
switches and the sense of performance
overall is great
but it doesn't have the greatest liftoff
distance so if you don't lift your mouse
a lot check out number four number three
is the most expensive out of the bunch
so I was assuming that it would win and
it has a really nice shape and really
nice switches and really nice RGB
lighting as well but it is driverless so
you cannot customize the actual DPI
which are in 1000 increments which for
me is totally not OK and so and also it
has that really bad liftoff distance
it's not super bad but for the price
point I was expecting more and now
moving on to the winners of this whole
round up number 1 and 2 I don't know why
I was expecting them to win but I kind
of lucked out and the naming scheme so
number 1 the shape is fantastic the
performance of the sensor is good the
buttons are great the scroll wheel is
nice and while you only have the three
dpi levels I think they are appropriate
for like even competitive gameplay being
the lowest at 600 dpi which for me I
play around 400 to 800 so it's kind of
like a nice balance but for number 2 I
feel like it's a little bit even more
superior because you have that full
driver customization not only for the
RGB support and that macro customization
but we also have those dpi increments in
100 dpi changes which is fantastic so
you can customize the dpi to exactly
where you want it and as you know I feel
like that's kind of like the key selling
point of this being also a really good
sensor to that you can customize that
and lift off distance is not bad so when
you lift it like I do it's not gonna
jitter when it's in the air and so
number one and to definitely check them
out if you're looking for a budget Mouse
all the links are linked in the
description and so these two are the
winners and they'll be moving forward
into the next round up which has a
higher price category which by the way
if you haven't checked out our best mice
under $25 make sure to check it out over
there
so that
like in this like the earlier video and
now we're moving into like the no name
brands and just exploring what the
market has to offer and the next price
category I think we'll be doing like 25
to 50 so if you have any mice
recommendations let us know in the
comments below I'm Dimitri thanks so
much for watching we'll see you that's
