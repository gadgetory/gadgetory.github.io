some of the most popular cases available
in the chassis market and when the half
series debuted in 2008 it became one of
the must-haves cases for enthusiasts
however in just two years we have come a
long way in our expectations of what
makes up a great case and while the 9:32
is still a great contender there's no
denying it could use a bit of a makeover
so here we have the half ex the latest
evolution in the half series that
promises to deliver the requirements of
the modern enthusiast and spice up its
looks it is expected to be available in
June 2010 and it's not completely out to
lunch with a price tag of around $199 so
let's take a look the original half
design had a very industrial sort of
look kind of like a piece of machinery
it was there to do a job and the design
was fit around its purpose it didn't try
to disguise itself by looking pretty and
1/2 X is no different in fact the hard
industrial look has been beefed up even
a little more
now given that it's a full tower it
isn't exactly small and actually
slightly larger than the original but
you'll see why shortly it uses cooler
masters typical solid construction of
steel and plastic making it weigh in at
about 31 pounds we first take a look at
the front where we have a removable
cover over the front 230 millimeter fan
and a welcome sight for many we finally
have dust covers there are two removable
hot swap bays that are very secure and
for external drive bays now here's
something I'd love to see a case
manufacturer that is adopting all of the
popular connections
there's USB 3 eSATA firewire regular USB
2 and audio behind this little slide
Ecover LED on/off reset and power
buttons there at the top of the case
there's two spaces to fit cooler masters
large 200 millimeter exhaust fans at the
side panel yet another 200 millimeter
intake fan and that tiny little square
window has been expanded but
unfortunately it doesn't show off much
more of the internals jump into the back
there are three water tubing holes the
third being a great way to add an
external field port to your loop the
40-millimeter exhaust van motherboard io
area and unprecedented 9 PCI expansion
slots exhaust ports and bottom mounted
power supply moving into the case you'll
see that the intake fan does have a dust
filter and it also includes the shroud
in order to direct air onto the video
cards we're going to take a quick detour
here to the accessories because
coolermaster has included a few
different items we have a USB 2
replacement cable 8 pin motherboard
extension cable wheels that can be
attached for the bottom of the case the
usual packet of screws and other bits
and their latest device a graphics card
bracket where you can attach a thin 80
millimeter fan and it's meant to hold up
your heavy video cards at first glance
something definitely looks off about
this interior you'll see two plastic
shrouds here the bottom is for the power
supply and it slides back and forth to
provide covering for all of your cabling
the other is a VGA fan duct to help with
cooling on the graphics cards then at
the front five three and a half inch
drive base and the red LED fan at the
back the nine expansion slots with thumb
screws exhaust fan CPU backplate opening
and only a single 200 millimeter top fan
is included the front five and a quarter
inch bays are reserved for the hot
swappable drive bay there are then for
additional drive bays with cooler master
screwless system this I foresee being a
bit of a hassle all of those front
connections mean all types of connectors
internally that are going to have to go
somewhere after we take all of the junk
out of the case you'll notice spacing in
the motherboard tray with rubber
grommets to help hide the wires as well
as the hot-swap module as we see one of
cooler masters focuses with this case
was to make it more water cooling
friendly notice at the top the bars
underneath the fans you'll now be able
to fit up to a 360 millimetre radiator
internally which is great news for water
coolers the top piece comes off with
just a few clips and hey it looks like
they've learned their lesson more dust
filters as well you're able to easily
remove cables upfront connections you
won't need in order to reduce some wire
clutter and one last look at the
motherboard tray for the back cooler
master has done a great job here a
perfect blend of different features an
open top space you don't even notice
from the front a CPU backplate open
and special not just use with cable ties
again the grommet holes and open space
at the bottom also the hard drive bays
have been set forward to allow for rear
mounted cables and cable storage as I
got started on the installation this
little piece dropped out it's a simple
socket adapter to help install
motherboard standoffs with a regular
screwdriver I gotta say it's pretty
simple but a very cool little bit to
include we get our components installed
and all set to wire up well not only
being an incredibly quick and pain-free
process the end result doesn't look half
bad either with relatively minimal
effort you can have a very very clean
looking system which is going to help
drastically improve air flow here's the
reason for those nine PCI slots the half
X is one of the few that is able to
support many of the new non-standard ATF
size motherboards with the advent of
Quad SLI and EVGA x' XL 80 X sized 4 Way
SLI motherboard more space is going to
be required for some of those serious
systems radon coolermaster for having
the foresight to make a case that would
be ready for it
speaking of larger hardware our dual GPU
HD 5970 at over 11 inches long fits in
just fine though it'll have to do
without the fan shroud so we finally get
to the hot swap trays which are held in
by two metal clips on the side of the
tray it easily comes out and you'll see
it supports both 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch
drives unfortunately it doesn't use a
screw less retention system the bottom 5
drive bays are a little more familiar
the system includes one two and a half
inch adapter and the sleds are cooler
masters usual to list design and to end
off the build we look at the back all of
the excess wiring has been bundled
underneath the cable cover in the front
so all that's left is the straight
wiring across the back
all right so I know it's been a long one
we'll wrap it up quick
there really is nothing to pick on with
the half ex Coolermaster has kept
everything that is great about the
original and then made adaptations based
on customer feedback and evolved with
changes in the pc hardware market it
truly is an awesome case you've got to
love the black interior the addition of
even more air and water cooling options
and all of the seemingly gimmicky
features that actually have a very
practical use and as with most
Coolermaster cases the price is exactly
spot-on for what you get the only thing
I could see going wrong for the half ex
is the design may not appeal to those
who are more concerned about smooth and
sleek lines over functionality the half
ex more than deserves our damn good
award and it's likely to be the best
case in its category that we review all
year thanks for checking out the
hardware canucks product showcase on the
Coolermaster half x and let us know what
you think about this case in the
