great technology selections and service
Alienware is one of those brands with a
distinct design and attention to detail
of various lighting effects that gains
you sort of a new sense of connection
between your machine and game and so
today we're reviewing the Alienware 14
where portability meets power with
somewhat competitive pricing depending
on configuration and that extremely
solid design formula specs wise we have
a GTX 765 M with 2 gigabytes of video
RAM and desktop equivalent would be the
GTX 650 Ti we have an i7 quad core 4700
mq at 2.4 base clock with a 3.4
gigahertz in turbo mode 16 gigabytes of
the memory dual drive setup so a 256
gigabyte mSATA SSD combined with a 750
gigabyte mechanical drive and this
configuration will set you back just shy
or $2,000 when fully decked out and that
might turn off many people based on
competitive gaming offerings from Asus
and MSI lately I find the outer shell
aesthetically pleasing with accented
illuminated strips and that staple alien
head and I also can appreciate the
direction to not include any brushed
aluminum instead robust plastic that can
be wiped down no problem the machine is
just over six pounds in weight with a
thick body but of course manageable for
travel bags and backpacks on the left
side we find a Kensington lock slot
happy to see a mini displayport for high
resolution monitors full size HDMI 1.4
to USB 3 ports and audio jacks and
notice how everything is well spaced out
to accommodate for all the connections
on the opposite side we get an Ethernet
port another USB 3.0 SD card slot and an
optical drive the power plug is located
in the back that's looma nated when
plugged in for that extra effect and
back facing exhaust so exactly where it
should be the screen lid opens wide with
the confident resistance and while there
is some flex on the panel it still feels
well put together and not like something
is about to snap a 1080p webcam along
with stereo microphones is included at
top plus the illuminated Alienware text
with the pretty thin bezels on the sides
and slightly more conservative at the
bottom now Alienware 14 by the name of
course houses a 14 inch IPS anti-glare
display with 1920 by 1080 p resolution
that looks excellent with high pixel
density and outstanding viewing angles
and next to my TN panel notebook the TN
panel looks pathetic colors are much
more natural and accurate on the L
anywhere plus the lack of contrast
shifting is a really huge bonus for
anybody who is into creative fields or
requires any visual work and also notice
the lack of green on the TN panel that I
wouldn't have noticed otherwise there's
just some brightness variance at extreme
angles and I don't think it's bright
enough at full power and the screen kind
of got lost while outdoors on the
opposite side in complete darkness while
at the lowest setting it was way too
bright so I'd really appreciate if a few
extra brightness levels were added
internals are fully covered in the
rubberized finish that's really nice to
touch and to the most part stays cool
and clean Otto does leave handling marks
the speaker grille is located right
below the screen with a really loud and
detailed stereo projection although
lacking heavily in the low end region
there's practically no bass in this
thing so let's take a listen
the power button is on the right side
complemented by its own illumination
that can be set up to indicate battery
life and on the other side we get LED
indicators for Wi-Fi caps lock and drive
activity Alienware really should be
praised for designing such an
outstanding keyboard that's fully
embedded into the body with respectable
travel distance absolutely no flex and
large keys but get a few function
shortcuts inside the F keys along with
the brightness and media control in the
arrow keys due to size limitations the
side numpad is missing but overall both
typing and gaming on this set of keys
was extremely satisfying the
illumination here just speaks through
the characters with a four zone color
control that can be adjusted through the
software and the trackpad is also well
placed right in the center away from
your left hand tracking is pleasing with
physical left and right clicks that also
have a satisfying response and also love
the illumination that's consistent and
of course multicolored plus the
illumination strips running on each side
curve nicely around the front corners
and adds to the distinct Alienware look
and of course plays a role in alien
effects the notebook stands on tall
rubber feet and notice two large intake
ports and when it comes to user upgrades
Alienware has always been excellent
allowing you to access your two memory
slots replace the M SATA drive and
underneath the optical drive is another
two and a half inch drive slot all
easily accessible and upgradable so now
how does it handle cooling and playing
watchdogs for an hour despite only
having one exhaust at the rear the body
actually stays cool and notice how the
left portion doesn't heat up allowing
your left hand to maintain sweat-free
nothing is exhausted through the sides
and all the hot air is blown away from
the user plus it helps to direct some
that noise away as the fan ramps up to
offer
the audible levels alright so with
everything covered let's get to the
benchmarks the gtx 765 m is somewhat
capable but don't forget about nvidia
geforce experience to optimize your
in-game settings for best global results
of course I would really love to see in
videos 800 M series graphics in this
machine Crysis 3 is very demanding at
high settings is basically unplayable
which are - with high is playable + it's
one of the games that supports alien
effects valued for at Ultra is sluggish
Wolfenstein new order maxed out is not a
problem and watchdogs at high settings
was actually playable and for relative
comparison 3d mark firestrike benchmark
scored over 2000 although these results
are below the average gaming notebook
and so it seems
and quickly optimizing the games and we
are back in business with playable
framerates so you can sort of squeeze
out the best results out of this machine
so the integration of alien effects is
sort of your cherry on top that changes
the lighting zones based on the ingame
atmosphere but of course the supported
game list is still very small plus the
API is not reliable in my experience and
to the most part I did actually disable
it the 14 inch form factor has been real
nice adjustment for mobile use auto
disappointing battery life with a 69
watt hour battery with just under three
hours of casual use in balance mode
gaming on battery lasted is surprising
65 minutes
although the GPU is under clock to 600
megahertz to keep up with in power
limitations so do expect a major hit on
performance plus the CPU clocks were
isolating resulting in choppy gameplay
that was really unpleasant
and so the Alienware 14 has got to be
almost the perfect compromise between
size performance and the price with an
absolutely amazing IPS display clean and
loud stereo speakers with excellent
keyboard and trackpad lighting
customization is pretty neat plus the
notebook body stays cool when under load
and I'm sure we can all appreciate the
user-friendly upgrade design for RAM and
the two Drive slots however very
limiting battery life
unstable gaming performance while on
battery still disappointing list of
games for alien effects and really my
major complaint here would be the
lagging hardware and videos latest 800m
series graphics is just so much more
appropriate and suitable for 2014 for
better performance power efficiency and
of course temperatures and I do hope
these roll out soon as otherwise there's
no point in investing in the aging
hardware regardless of the truly
enjoyable ownership you do get with an
alienware but what do you guys think of
this design and what are some of the
advantages you can think competing
gaming notebooks have that might
gravitate you away from the Alienware
line leave a comments down below we'd
love to hear what you think and if
you're interested in the bigger brother
the Alienware 17 make sure to check out
