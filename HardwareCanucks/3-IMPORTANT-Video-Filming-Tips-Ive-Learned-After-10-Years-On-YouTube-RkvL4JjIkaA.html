fantastic something very special has
arrived today the blue yetis now the
blue Yeti nano is a new one and I'm
gonna test it out just a second but the
blue Yeti the original blue Yeti is so
special to me because it is kind of
because of this microphone or with it I
started my own YouTube channel and
started making videos that have
eventually evolved and do what I'm doing
now with you Wow
so I had the original silver one but
seeing the blue command brings back
memories what about the nano what so
this thing is actually super tiny I love
the gold color and check out the size
difference the original Yeti and the
Yeti nano and so with the arrival of
these microphones has got me thinking
what am i doing today obviously with
some improvement because that comes with
time that I was doing exactly the same
way ten years ago and so in this video I
want to share my three main tips that
have carried over with me in my entire
YouTube / video making career that I
hope you might appreciate or utilize in
your own content creation give you
hardware the power deserves with be
quiet straight power 11 power supply
with a wire free internal design
fantastic cooling with silent wings
three fan a fully modular layout with
black cables and 80 plus gold efficiency
check them out below alright so tip
number one with these type of
microphones and really any other
microphone that's right in your face
recording you is that you always want to
be on a slide angles not directly in
front of it because if you're releasing
some air unless you have a really nice
pop filter that will be picked up but if
you're recording on a slight angle see
there's nothing and what you've been
listening to so far is the blue Yeti the
original now let me switch to the blue
Yeti nano that has only two recording
patterns instead of four it's slightly
smaller and yeah you'll see the quality
difference it is slightly cheaper as
well and it looks so cute so tiny
yeah let's change it now and what you
listen to now is that recorded by the
blue Yeti Nano and I have to lower
myself a little bit because it's like
you sure
and the main drawback for me with the
Nano is the fact that we have no gain
control which means that you cannot
adjust the sensitivity of the microphone
the good thing however is that the
microphone does not auto gain so if
you're like speaking really quietly it's
not gonna boost up that gain so that
you're louder so it's constant you just
have to be an equal distance to the
recording so that everything sounds the
same now the fact that we have a
headphone in here is super important so
you can hear what you're recording and
you can also adjust the volume of that
input which is super handy also do not
forget to make your own sounds and my
favorite okay sounds like rain you can
do lots of cool things with the wind and
moving on from audio my next step is to
use different color backdrops as you can
see is just a piece of paper stuck to
the wall but you didn't know that given
the composition of the first shot so I
have different colors and different size
of these papers here for example I have
the ridges the kind look cool and video
especially if these things are out of
focus but of course I have playing
papers as well and these are much larger
allowing me to put them on the wall and
like actually do head shots like away
from wearing headphones for example
which is super cool or to create the
Infinity loop by placing this side on
the wall and the rest on the table
and I love this technique because it is
super cheap this paper cost me a dollar
and that can buy 10 more of different
colors so diversity of backgrounds is
awesome you can also place this on the
wall giving the papers big enough to you
know to create different backgrounds for
people shots for product shots whatever
and yeah I use a slightly telephoto 85mm
lens to compress the backgrounds to
eliminate these edges on the sides for a
really beautiful effect in my last tip
for you is something that I'm constantly
evolving in terms of lighting and using
light angle to shape your face
and so I recently got myself this large
gigantic softbox because the larger the
light source the softer the light and
the softer the shadow spill depending
how close you are or how far you are
from the subject because my other
softbox was a bit too harsh and so you
can see the difference between something
like this the light domain II it's
perfect for my space I don't have that
big of a room but this gigantic thing
creates such softer light which is a lot
more pleasing for skin and so the rule
of thumb is to position the light on
angle so it creates shadows on your face
thus giving your face a bit more depth
instead of it being fully equally lit
which sometimes is perfect if you're
going for that like really soft ambient
look but majority of the time a little
bit of shadow even if it's just like
slightly soft shadow would deliver a
more pleasing result for that whole
depth formation of your face and then I
love using diffusion it's super cheap
it's like five and one comes with like a
reflector comes with a dark outside I
love this because it allows me to bounce
some of that main light onto this other
side to create a slightly softer effect
as you can see with it and without it
you can also put it on the bottom to
illuminate your under chin so if you
don't want any of the darker shadows
right directly on the chin although
sometimes it's good because it actually
creates a shadow and emphasizes the
jawline so yeah many ways to play up
with light because of the angle of the
light it being not directly in front of
you but on the sides and so it's really
interesting to think back and reflect on
how the original
blue Yeti microphone has basically
helped me start off my YouTube career
career career and I'm thinking the blue
Yeti nano might be the perfect
opportunity for many out there who want
to get into doing any recording work
doing any streaming work because it is
cheaper it just like the smaller and
quality is still pretty decent so as a
starting point I feel like it might
potentially kick off many other careers
but who knows I will link them in the
description below if you wanna check
them out thank you very much one of the
best gaming headsets is now available
through mass drop the PC 3 7x has
fantastic drivers incredible comfort and
the best microphone in class plus they
look awesome for a gaming headset check
out the drop link below and so I hope
you enjoyed this little throwback using
different color papers to create
backgrounds using light to angle face
and of course to use different lights in
the background to set the scene and
create a little bit more ambience so I'm
Dimitri
