powered by Intel Core i7 4790k and until
730 series as his d click the link in
the description to unleash your options
for true performance hey guys Eber here
with Hydra connects and a few months
back we took a look at your coms
&amp;amp; 5 pro a gaming notebook that set the
standard as one of the best performing
notebooks for the price today we're
taking a look at a revamped shark 4 from
their ultra portable series and it is
priced a little north of 1k and for that
you've got a quad core Intel Core i7
4720 HQ CPU clocked at 2.6 gigahertz
eight gigabytes of RAM 128 gigabytes m2
SSD along with a one terabyte 7200 rpm
hard drive and a gtx 960m
with 2 gigabytes of vram let's check it
out
all right so the shark force force an
excellent build the chassis is made from
premium plastic material that does not
feel cheap plus the front panel comes
with a soft touch rubber surface that
feels a lot smoother and comfortable to
hold in the hands and the same finish
has been applied to the palm rest which
surprisingly does a good job preventing
the heat from spreading to my palms
while gaming the screen does show signs
of flex when opening it up but it's a
lot sturdier than the m5 Pro it weighs
about two and a half kilograms which is
definitely not light and I'm not exactly
sure why your comm advertises them as an
ultra portable gaming laptop but
personally I don't mind the extra
thickness considering how well-built
this machine is and when you open the
lid you're greeted with a beautiful 15.6
inch 1920 by 1080 IPS display that's
stunning to look at viewing angles and
the contrast ratio are top-notch with
which colors and deep blacks Plus this
is an excellent panel for editing and
gaming as well the two front facing
speaker is powered by a few are angled
slightly this way the sound is projected
directly to the user and over the course
of my testing I noticed that the speaker
is lacked in the base region and it was
more emphasized on the vocals
considering how treble friendly it is
let's take a listen
and so moving through the aisle we have
a Kensington lock two USB 3.0 ports a
dedicated headphone microphone and spdif
digital jacks on the left side switching
over to the right we find a Gigabit
Ethernet VGA output a single USB 3.0
port memory card reader and yes a sim
card slot and I was very surprised with
the i/o placement on the backside which
includes a USB 3.0 port HDMI 1.4
DisplayPort 1.2 that supports 4k
externally at 60 Hertz and these
standard power in the keyboard on the
shark fort is great the tactile responds
and the keys are solid and the entire
keyboard is shifted downwards a little
bit which contributes to proper finger
travel distance the WASC keys are
highlighted with these red arrow marks
and the keyboard does have two stages of
backlighting that's very nice to see the
trackpad is very responsive the track
surface is smooth enough for zooming
tapping in much more I was disappointed
to not find an option within the driver
software to enable double tap for left
click but on a good note the dedicated
primary left and right click buttons
carry on that excellent satisfactory
feel and the included fingerprint reader
is nice feature although it's a hit or
miss sometimes requiring two to three
swipes to login internal expansion of
the shark four is flexible you can
expand the memory up to 16 gigabytes and
the m2 slot is accessible and it can
easily be upgraded to a higher capacity
SSD and this notebook does support
Samsung's sm9 51 series drives that
sports an insane 2 gigabits per second
read and write speeds the hard drive
slot is also accessible if you want to
upgrade the existing mechanical hard
drive to an SSD your club also provides
an optional hard drive caddy that you
can replace the built-in DVD drive for
even more storage options both the CPU
and GPU are cool in a dual exhaust
configuration with the heat directed
towards the exhaust vents our test
showed that the GPU idling around 30
degrees while the CPU at 57 degrees and
during load both the CPU and GPU topped
out
79 and 89 degrees respectively even
though both of them ran on the hotter
side the system ran nearly silent and
the fence only kicked in when they
needed to the shark for handles gaming
reasonably well and by that I meant that
the 960m was struggling to keep up with
its bigger brothers launching into gta5
a game that requires a lot of VRAM I had
to turn on the settings to normal to
achieve an average of above 40 frames
per second and the minimums dipping into
the low 30s mid alert shadow of mordor
at Ultra settings and we achieve a
little over 30 frames per second while
the minimums at 22 lore de Falla did
very high hovered around 25 frames per
second on average while the minimum is
were about 15 on a good note BioShock
Infinite at Ultra settings ran smoothly
over 70 frames per second on average and
the minimums dipped into the low 40s
Metro last light at high settings
averaged around 30 frames per second and
dipped into the low 20s I also took a
three minute premier project and
rendered it in our standard 4k export
settings on both the shark 4 and my 6
core workstation and to my surprise the
shark full rendered the task a little
over 8 minutes while the 6 core did it
in about 6 minutes the difference is
about 20% but the point is that this
laptop is not that far from being an
excellent portable editing workstation I
was also amazed with the battery life of
the shark for the notebook lasted a
little over 3 hours on our standardized
tests but with casual web browsing and
watching a few videos it got me through
a day so eurocom has impressed us once
again with their shark 4 gaming laptop
the chassis is well built to the specs
are reasonable for the price and we are
totally satisfied with the IPS display
bass performance great keyboard and
trackpad it's really hard to pass on
such a staggering machine for the price
and we're giving it the Harbour Canucks
damn good award so what are your
thoughts on the shark 4 from your comm
is the price to performance ratio
reasonable or maybe for an extra $500
would you consider the m5 pro that
houses a non-sentient let us know in the
