and welcome back to another behind the
damned episode today we're gonna be
talking about home automation and how
you could take advantage of all these
smart devices with just your voice and
thanks to Google because Google's smart
home implementation and they are support
with all these smart devices is actually
kind of fantastic I've actually hopped
into these smart home automation a few
months back and I've been really
enjoying my time controlling devices
with just my voice so yeah it's been a
great experience but I'd also like to
share that with you guys most
importantly Google did send me a care
package for the holidays and I've yet to
open it up it's just big white box and I
dunno what's inside I just haven't had
the time to open unbox it and like set
it up because I wanted to share that
experience with you guys in this episode
so yeah let's once without any further
ado let's just dive into it but first a
quick message from our sponsor we
capture our experiences to remind us of
the past with fantastic visual quality
but what about the sound it helps to
piece together the moment and now you
can with the Sennheiser AM be a smart
headset that doesn't just record the
audio it lets you feel and relive your
environment because the microphones pick
up sounds just like you would the end
result is a stunning capture of 3d audio
so you can visit the past again check
out and son Heiser and be a smart
headset linked below alright so got a
trusty knife out thanks google oh man
look at all these goodies this is a lot
actually let's start with this Philips
hue lightbulbs I actually have worked
with these before so there I have one
setting my studio right over there I
have one in my bedroom and all of them
is controlled through the hub that's
sitting underneath my desk it's the same
setup with this guy but I don't think
I'll be using them to hub because these
lights will automatically recognize or
the hub will automatically recognize
these bulbs as soon as I watch the app
so the setup process should be fairly
straightforward considering
have one of the studio but if you are
purchasing one of these kits do note
that you need this Hut the physical hub
to connect these lightbulbs next thing
is a nest thermostat this is a nest
thermostat II it's a more lower tier
version of the original lamp nest
thermostat currently in my living room I
do have the Eco be smart 30 thermostat I
felt like it was a lot better value than
what Nest had to offer I came with a lot
more features so I might just might just
used this when I moved to another place
later on we'll see the next package this
is a Wi-Fi smart plug so once you've
connected this to your standard socket
you can control whatever you'd like as
long as you you know have it connected
to a Wi-Fi network and if you have the
app installed the best part it is that
it works with Google assistant as far as
I know I hope so we'll see how that goes
it says its nest compatible but I'm also
hoping that'll to Google Google
assistant so the next item is the
chromecast ultra this would be an
excellent upgrade for my
first-generation chromecast that's in my
living room but to be honest after I'm
getting to the shield TV I'm never
actually taking advantage of the
chromecast feature because a shield TV
has chromecast built-in so I think I'm
just gonna save this for for future
purposes I've also got a little souvenir
here this is nice I can I can use this
with my desk set up school this is the
Aurora nano life smart lighting kit this
is an awesome lighting system I've
actually I've actually wanted to give us
a shot at some point but uh yeah I'm
super excited install this I'm thinking
of turning this inside out living room
or installing in my living room and you
know get that ambient RGB lighting in
there it should be really cool
yeah let's so let's go ahead and set up
some of things that we have over here
alright so I spend the last 30 minutes
setting up the devices and it was a
fairly simple process all you have to do
is just you know install them and
connect them to your Wi-Fi network and
download the unnecessary applications
perspective for that device so in that
case in our case we're using Philips hue
the remo smart plug and then we've
the nano leave lighting that's in my
living room currently it looks gorgeous
guys I mean the effects and just the way
how you can control the lighting with
Google is pretty amazing I'll do a few
demos here to show you guys how the
whole thing works let's kick things off
with the softbox that's actually fired
me right now so I've connected this
light to the Wemo switch that's plugged
into my main socket over there so all I
have to do is activate Google assistant
turn off softbox and it will turn off
the softbox yeah it just works like that
I can go back and trigger the assistant
turn on the softbox for back up and
running I could also do things like
changing the color for the Philips hue
bulb so I can activate Google assistant
and say change studio lights to green
isn't that amazing I think that's just
quite one of the greatest things I could
do with just your voice now I can also
do more things so I have the Eco be
three smart thermostat installed in my
living room so what I could do is
actually adjust the temperature and turn
on the heater or the air-conditioning
depending on the season with just Google
assistant because Google just recently
added support for eco beat it wasn't
actually supported for a really long
time and that was pretty frustrating
because the only way I was able to
control the smart thermostat was using
my iPad because the Eco be smart
thermostat worked with apple's homekit
which was kind of frustrating but I'm so
glad that Google finally supported that
ecosystem or the Eco B devices so
basically I can do the same thing by
activating Google assistant set the
temperature to 22 degrees yeah and it
just does that not sure if I like the
green lighting right now so I'm gonna
switch it up to blue change studio
lights to blue yeah I think this is
better it's more it's more low-key okay
so here's here's an interesting part
about the assistant I think this would
be a cool implementation my siblings are
downstairs are watching strangers things
and they're you know kind of making I
mean they're not letting me record my on
cam I asked them to shut up but there
I'm gonna do it so here's what I do turn
off TV it did it actually worked oh my
god that is amazing that's amazing that
is the power of voice search guys if you
have siblings around if you don't want
them to use certain things hey the power
of voice controls right here so
experience every pixel with the GeForce
GTX 1080 Ti and enjoy these awesome new
games and full 4k resolution at over 60
frames per second and get destiny 2 for
free for a limited time for details in
the description below anyways before you
pull the trigger on these smart devices
make sure to check compatibility because
some of these devices only support a
certain type of ecosystem so there are
so many ecosystems in the market right
now there is Google assistant there's
Amazon Alexa there's apple homekit
there's Samsung smartthings and of
course a variety more now most devices
do support all of these ecosystems so
that's great but just make sure that you
if you're using if you're thinking about
using Google assistant as your primary
voice control a hub you were much better
off getting devices that can support
that ecosystem and then rely on that
completely because the Google home app
is like a central hub it connects it
basically unifies all of these devices
into this one app and you can set you
know nicknames and assigned rooms it
just makes life a lot more easier to me
personally and I think I'm really gonna
have a lot of fun playing around with
these lights and all so now I can annoy
my siblings downstairs so I'm really
looking for that anyways that's about it
for this BTS episode I hope you enjoyed
let me know what you guys think about
home automation and are you considering
hopping onto that train let me know in
