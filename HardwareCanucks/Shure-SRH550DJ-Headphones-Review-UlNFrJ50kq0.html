great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry and welcome back
to another of our clocks review now I
love reviewing and testing headphones
because I get to listen to my favorite
tunes and explore the world of audio so
on my review table today is a pair from
sure so my ears sure better be happy
based on company's reputation with
legendary performance when it comes to
marketing professional DJ headphones
simply mean a flat and accurate response
with a bit of bass enhancements so think
of these as studio headphones but with a
little extra punch so these are the SRH
550 DJ designed for DJ mixing and for
personal enjoyment and cost just over
$100 aesthetically I like the settle
design with a smoky grey color tones and
model name insurer logo on each ear cup
plus the leather headband is always nice
specs wise these are closed bag dynamic
headphones with large 50 millimeter
drivers to deliver full sound with a
decent frequency range standard
impedance of 32 ohms and the very
acceptable sensitivity of 190 B if
you're looking for a light travel
headphone they certainly suit the bill
waiting only in 235 grams the 550 DJ are
quite flexible and very portable as you
can see the ear cups fold inside which
is very convenient for travel the
headphone is pretty much made entirely
of plastic which I don't particularly
like and it would've been nice to have
some metal parts for reassurance and
while the headphones feel quite solid
that plastic creaking sure is not very
appealing and online form suggests
cracking on ear cups is quite common the
cable on here is not removable and runs
into each ear cup as a wide splitter I'm
not a fan of the dual wire as it tends
to tango a lot and the cable is very
long at two meters so I did run into a
lot of tangles while on the go or simply
listening music at home comfort wise
these offer quite a bit of flexibility
in size adjustments plus the headband is
not so soft but it really doesn't bother
me
the leather cups are also very soft and
I was surprised that the quality of the
leather its
on genuine leather but it let my ears
breathe the ear cups also aren't too
small or too large I found the size to
be just right for a travel headphone but
they aren't that deep and while the ears
don't make contact with internals the
problem with the 550 DJ is the pressure
it applies on your ears and putting them
on they look great and they're very
light but I was sure not able to wear
these for long sessions I had to take
them off to release some pressure on the
ears and it will definitely take some
time breaking these in but the stuff
nature of the design perhaps should be
reconsidered and also very uncomfortable
if you wear glasses now these connect
through a regular 3.5 mm er jack and the
quarter of an inch adapter is also
included plus a leather pouch for travel
which is very much appreciated so now
let's talk audio quality I let these
burn in over 20 hours with white noise
very common technique and well the 550
DJ have a warm and smooth audio
signature meaning mid bass is more
forward the highs have a sort of a
roll-off so they're not too sharp and
vocal projection is also moved forward
the bass doesn't overpower and if your
base hand these won't satisfy but it is
very detailed and even on the low end
listening to angel from massive attack
delivered incredible detail of that
punchy bass and the slight low bass in
the background was very distinguishable
throughout the entire song the mid-range
and the highs are smooth yet the treble
is still crisp and detail and brings out
that needed popping tracks and I didn't
find it too sharp the maned range is
decent not as detailed as I'd like and
it is slightly recessed allowing the
highs and lows to really shine now these
are closed back headphones so don't
expect much in terms of sound stage but
stereo imaging is quite accurate
listening to a few cinematic orchestra I
could pinpoint where the instruments
were placed just the sound stage is very
closed overall I found you audio to be
pleasantly smooth I do like my mid-tones
more detailed than just the tab sharp or
treble but from an audio perspective
these certainly do not disappoint
especially with the hint of EQ to
fine-tune exactly how you like to listen
to your audio the major problem with
these cans is the pressure they cause on
your ears for a headphone that's
marketed for DJ
I could not see a DJ wearing these for
an entire day of mixing they just do not
provide that level of comfort but there
is walk around and since the ear cups
are removable people on the forums
recommend swapping the stock ear cups
with the ones from the 750 DJ that offer
improved audio quality and most
importantly are more comfortable now of
course to get the most out of your
headphone you better run them through a
dedicated sound card DAC or an amp and
then notice the big difference in audio
signature between using them on my Nexus
4 and my tascam DAC so they do really
shine with proper audio source and with
deeper bass and improve detail and to
wrap this up the 550 DJ are lightweight
and foldable which equates to
portability with a very pleasant audio
signature with impressive deep bass and
smooth highs an appropriate amount of
detail however the major issue here is
the all plastic construction that have
proven to not be durable and a very
tight fit causes discomfort so replacing
ear cups is something I would definitely
recommend and simply from an audio
perspective I was certainly pleased but
perhaps a better build unit would be
more attractive at this price point so
