great technology selection and service
hello everyone i'm dmitri with hardware
canucks and this is a pair of rocked
your alpha genus there's a trend
emerging and within ear headphones to
feature interchangeable sound filters so
users can tune in they're more preferred
sound signature a pair of these will
cost you a slight dip in the budget
under $100 and can be found for as
little as thirty dollars on amazon which
is a total steal the packaging is a bit
dull and even til you get a velvet pouch
when would you actually never use it i
can't suggest to rock joe one thing and
that is to have the actual solid plate
to mount the sound filters as otherwise
they're kind of difficult to remove from
the dense foam and i would like to see a
better solution something similar to the
mounting plate on the RHA headphones the
Alpha genus are an attractive pair with
a wood casing for the main frame so
expect some variance from model to model
and this is solid proof that wood
headphones don't have to cost a fortune
there's an aluminum frame on the front
that holds the sound filter that seems
to expand all the way to the rear of the
frame and there's another aluminium
piece to hold the cable at the bottom
and the cable I really like it's thin
and light plus has this interesting
shine and texture to it the 90-degree
connector is low profile it's not
exactly tangle free just because the
cable is so thin but that comes with a
shirt clip that I start using
immediately as this is not an over the
ear headphone and regardless of how
careful you are there will always be
tension and pull on the cable and with
the clip you can offset some of the
cable so it doesn't weigh down I'm a bit
disappointed a full inline remote is not
available we have only a single click to
change tracks play pause and answer
phone call but volume adjust is not
present there is a microphone on here
too and sorry to say but the cable noise
is really evident any contact the cable
makes with your shirt as you walk can be
heard inside the earpieces speaking of
which the ear tip selection is very
limited to
only this one kind that I tried to avoid
but to my surprise found the smallest
tip fit me perfectly and now on to the
sound filters first I'm really happy to
see the sound customization available on
the pair below $100 you have a black
reference filter that is more of a bass
heavy filter there's the gold neutral
one and a silver treble filter sound
signature is changed depending on the
thickness of the foam inside the filter
and I prefer the gold filter for my
style of listening now to the sound
experience and man was I satisfied
there's a clear base presence and the
ear tips helped to translate that into
appropriate hits but without booming the
sound and not significantly leaking over
the mid-range the vocalists are not too
far out but helped to create a sense of
space and a sound signature I like the
feeling of a soundstage being present
and the Alpha genius thankfully does not
cram the sound there's a clear
separation between elements and that's
awesome to hear and actually in
comparison to my RH 80 10 I that is a
$200 pair I actually preferred the sound
signature of the Alpha genus for vocal
heavy genres the mid-range is
beautifully presented the treble is
Chris put emphasize detail and overall
it's a really fun headphone and the
Hydra canucks
recommended and it's damn good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
