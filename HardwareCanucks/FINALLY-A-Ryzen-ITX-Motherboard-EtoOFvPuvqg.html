axe and welcome back to another video
here covering Computex and we're talking
about motherboards again but this time
it is in Intel's X 299
these are motherboards from asrock and
they use AMD's X 370 and be 350 chipsets
installed on two extremely small and
compact ITX form factor boards we'll
take a closer look right after this
this year's Computex coverage is brought
to you by FedEx coolermaster and msi all
right so as rod isn't the first
motherboard manufacturer to announce IP
exports with AMD's new m4 socket as they
won't be the last but there does seem to
be something odd happening with rice and
IKEA strategy originally Envy told us
that they had specific high-efficiency
x300 chipsets that was meant to be used
exclusively for small form-factor
motherboards it looks like asrock
biostar and a bunch of other companies
didn't get the memo since they're using
the higher-end x37 chipset as a basis
for their upcoming ITX boards the two
boards we are looking at here are the
fatality X 370 gaming ITX AC and the
fatality a be 350 gaming ITX NC they're
both very similar in some respects with
a 7.1 channel Realtek LC 1220 codec
wireless AC and two HDMI outputs even
their overall design is almost identical
with that usual black and red look that
azox fatality motherboards are usually
known for there's also a single end up
to slot behind the PCB which leads us to
an interesting observation due to the
high amount of space taken up by the aim
for mounting clips when compared to
Intel's LGA 1151 socket heating offers
there's no place to mount and our two
slots on the front of small form-factor
aim for boards that's really too bad
since rear mounting can cause
temperature problems on faster and that
two SSDs but what sets these boards
apart from one another
we're actually not too sure about that
you see there are a lot of differences
between be 350 and X through 70 chipsets
when they're used on larger boards maybe
350 has less USB connections fewer PCIe
lanes and secondary devices and no
compatibility with multi-core systems
but on such a small board with limited
connectivity and only a single PCIe slot
none of that willing
headers B through 50 even has the
ability to overclock arisin processors
so you know what I think B 315 may be
the perfect lower-cost fit for rising IT
systems so that's it for now but what do
you guys think are you excited for
rising ITX systems let us know in the
comments down below i'm Hebo rhetoric
