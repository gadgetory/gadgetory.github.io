going to be so awesome what's up guys
Eber here with hurricane axe and
normally if I were to receive a new GPU
and a i/o cooler or any other computer
related hardware it goes inside this the
NZXT s340 elite I love this case it's
one of the best chassis as you can find
in the market apart from the p400s from
fantex
this thing is compact and it houses my
ATX motherboard my 280 millimeter
radiator and my monsters GTX 1060 from
MSI perfectly I've been using this as my
test system for about six months now but
recently I did a video comparing the
auto overclocking capabilities of five
different motherboards and I've got to
be honest with you while the clock
speeds and the voltages were surprising
to me it was a nightmare tearing apart
my existing build and putting it
together like five times with the
respective motherboards now a quick
solution to this would be to acquire an
open test bench which would ease my way
into swapping components and believe it
or not I've been looking for one that
would fit my needs
fortunately Street College to us asking
us to check out their BC 1 open bench
table and what can I say it was like
Christmas to me when it arrived here at
the studio so let's dive in right after
this check this out the fans XP 400s
which is one of the best mint hours on
the market get a sexy upgrade now with
the tempered glass side panel with a
comfortable rubberized mount to show off
your gorgeous system with an RGB LED
strip included get your glass on with
the Fant XP 400s plants not included
alright so the open bench table is a
collaborative project between Street
comm HW bond and overclocking TV talk
about exceptional build quality and the
BC one does not disappoint it's crafted
from a single piece of custom anodized
aluminum but it's also aesthetically
pleasing to the eye weighing in at about
4 pounds it's surprisingly lighter given
the robust construction and it's super
portable because you can toss it inside
a backpack if you're a professional
overclock are traveling for events plus
the integrated carry handle is a nice
addition there are five types of screws
that come pre-installed on the main body
and they're the ones that we'll be using
to mount the hardware the assembly
process was fairly simple these guys
have precisely engineered the amount
hols along with storage options so it's
essentially a one-size-fits-all solution
building the bench didn't take that long
the first step was to remove the feet
attached to the main body by unscrewing
these four screws and then mounting them
back from the top through these enlarged
circular holes next I install the
motherboard standoffs which were a
combination of these pushpin and
standard variations this was done to set
aside a few for the standard standoffs
for the PCIe mounts which would later on
be occupied by the GPU however I'd like
to point out that the user might come
across leftover pushpin standoffs they
were ideally designed for the
motherboard but I just prefer using the
standard ones for a more secure fit what
do you guys think standard or pushpin
let us know in the comments down below
now these turnouts are fairly high
enough to offset the motherboard from
the main body and the reason I say that
is because the CPU backplate can be
easily accessed from the bottom so if
you're intend to swap coolers
occasionally you won't have a problem
with installing the CPU backplate the
power supply attaches directly to the
right side foot under the table it only
requires three screws for mounting and I
had PSU fan facing upwards for
appropriate airflow the BC one supports
dual two and a half inch or dual three
and a half inch drives they are
vertically mounted right underneath the
PCIe lanes and I was comfortably able to
accommodate my Corsair SSD and my game
library drive this is a brilliant design
by Street column and I appreciate the
idea of using the given space as
effectively as possible next up I
decided to install my all-in-one liquid
cooler from EVGA and during that process
I realized that the bench table only
supported radiators up to 240
millimeters the CLC 280 that I was using
featured a two eighty millimeter
radiator which the BC one didn't support
so I decided to swap that out for the X
42 from NZXT it features a 140 mm oh no
radiator and they were mounted through
these provided brackets which by the way
pivot in order to fit different spacings
there are a couple more brackets left if
you intend to use a hybrid water-cooled
GPU just like the ones you see here
finally all I had remaining to install
was the GPU and it was a fairly simple
process I aligned the card with the PCI
screw popped it in and tighten it with
the included PCI nut it was similar to
mounting the GPU in
a case you may experience clearance
issues connecting a display cable
towards the i/o because it ultimately
depends on the type of GPU you decide to
install I have no problems connecting it
to my monitor but be mindful of that
given the awesome build quality of the
BC one the test system after the
building process felt sturdy there were
no signs of wobbling apart from my desk
that wobbled when I placed the bench on
top of it but I blame the carpet for
that I wanted to touch base a little bit
on cable management because considering
this as an open test bench you can use
the cutout so inside the body to route
the cables but in my case I just ignored
that because I'm still waiting for some
custom sleeve cables
once those arrive I'll make sure to step
up my game in that department the open
bench table does occupy a little more
space on my desk compared to the s3 40
and that's obvious given its nature
because the s3 40 is a closed chassis
with a narrower base also note that just
like any other open test benches out
there these guys are prone to accumulate
a lot more dust than a case so there are
ups and downs to the product but it
ultimately depends on the end users
choice oh hey there NCIX comm is
Canada's leading a tailor for anything
your mind desires just keep it in those
categories which are plenty and get
tempted by the weekly deals visit ncx
comm for all those sweet deals well
there you have it my experience
switching over to the open bench table
I'd like to emphasize that this was a
collaborative project between Street
comm HW bank and overclocking TV these
guys have spent countless hours
designing and perfecting this beauty it
all started out as a community project
with one goal in mind and that was to
create the ultimate robust and portable
open test bench for enthusiasts and
overclockers who travel around for
events I love this thing and I'm happy
to have it to decide me because I can
quickly swap a components without going
through the struggle that I had to deal
with inside the S 340 or any other case
in this situation now I need to warn you
that this is an expensive investment
priced at $160 for you Silver Edition
and $40 more for the red and black
editions you may have to think twice
before buying the bullet it's not geared
towards every consumers out there but
rather people
work in the tech industry as reviewers
overclockers and enthusiasts may find a
justifiable this is a unique product one
that's very hard to find in the market
and it excels in everything we care
about in an open test bench so we're
giving it the hardware connects damn
good and damn innovative award good job
guys
so I want to hear your thoughts on the
BC one open bench table if you guys have
any feedback on the product leave a
comment down below and I'll make sure to
check them out I'm Eva with Harvard
