bungees for like two three years and
ever since using them I just can't stop
winning when I look around me all I see
is people wanting to buy their way into
the game with their fancy gaming mice
and mouse bungees you know they just
can't compete with my precise aim I'm
like a god all I need is a simple Mouse
simplicity is the key yeah we'll see
about that
the z9 neo-byzantine all the right
features on a budget with a large
windowed side panel five included fans
and the excellent interior layout with
super simple cable management get it now
link in the description below so what's
up everybody
Ivan here with hardware canucks and as
you might have been able to tell from
today's little interests kit this video
will be about Mouse bungees now there's
some differing opinions out there on
bungees as some people think they're
obnoxious and really a waste of money
however other people swear by their
precision and the consistency they
provide to the setup and the just
general reduction of hassle in your
setup we'll be looking at seven mile
sponges today and giving you comparison
for where best to spend your money but
first let's go over what a mouse Bungie
is obviously it's less like this and
more like this it's a pretty simple
concept the main goal is to keep your
mouse cord from getting caught on your
desk and to keep the movement consistent
usually the way this is done is by
having the cord thread through a rubber
guiding arm keeping it in place so why
would you want this
well wireless gaming mice are still a
while from being ubiquitous so in the
meantime we're going to have to deal
with cords if you're wanting to reduce
the wear and tear on your cord a mouse
bungee can help if you're wanting to
reduce the fraying and kind of damage
from scraping it back and forth well a
mouse bungee can help if your cord gets
tangled and in the way a bungee can help
and if you're someone who moves around
frequently especially for land gaming
tournaments then keeping your setup
consistent is important and once again a
mouse bungee can help with that you also
sometimes get extra benefits like USB
ports lighting or some other niche
features which might be compelling and
all that this probably sounds great but
there are some downside
the price is the biggest so a small
luxury as you'd expect a small price
however unfortunately some of the more
expensive Mouse bungees can range up to
$50 although most of them settle around
the $20 mark the other thing to consider
for many people is the aesthetics it
might not fit with your setup and that
can be an issue for some people when
you're using the Bungie make sure it's
set up properly to allow the cable to
reach fully to the edges of the mousepad
and you'll notice in bungees with
flexible arms you'll move with you at
the corners to make sure the Bungie is
relatively aligned so that the movement
is even now that you know what a Bungie
is and how to use it let's jump into the
roundup so today we'll be comparing
seven options as well as a little DIY
solution of my own now there's also some
links to purchase or just check
up-to-date pricing in the description
below
here are the seven competitors the
cheapest of the bunch is the basic
no-name brand Mouse Bungie which you can
pick up on Amazon for $8 stepping up
from here is the Cougar bunker available
for around $17 on Amazon then we have
the - bungee at $20 followed by the
Razer gaming bungee also at $20 we then
have an interesting option with the
Gambia's Aegis at 26 the Zoe come out is
in the middle of the pack at $28 but the
most expensive on the list is the extra
5b one coming in at a whopping $50 if
you can even get one in the u.s. so what
do we need to look at when comparing
bungees well there are four criteria
price effectiveness appearance and of
course features so the appearance and
feature set will be more subject to each
individual's needs however we can find
the best options for certain use cases
so let's do an overview of each Bungie
starting with the cheapest of the lot
the design of the el cheapo bungee is
very basic it has a plastic base with
this weird reflective ball and then the
flexible coil for guiding the cable as
well as clips to route it behind the
desk it's not the prettiest of the bunch
but it's fairly unobtrusive and the
price is obviously a selling point to
many however the effectiveness and
feature set of this bungee are really
lacking
there's no way to adhere it to your desk
and because it's quite light it's prone
to movement which is a big no-no for
bungees the arms are too flexible with
very little resistance which means that
it will lean
with just the weight of the cable it
doesn't keep the cable off the desk
effectively and doesn't guide it well
when you compare the coils with those on
the raiser bungee its poor performance
is apparent not much good and in this
case you do get what you pay for so
let's move on to the raiser bungee which
goes for around 20 bucks it's similar in
design to its cheaper counterpart but
the execution is far superior it's jet
black finish is far nicer on the eye and
the more angular approach appeals to my
tastes more the biggest difference is in
the performance though to make up for
its light weight
razor has anti-slip feet and a weighted
base meaning that it does stay upright
unless you're doing massive movements
with your mouse the metallic coil stands
are also far better than the no-name
brand Amazon bungee not only having much
more resistance and rebound but also
being more malleable to compensate the
cable direction which is nice it looks
good and is simple and effective which
is hard to beat but of course razor
isn't the only option Google provides
their own solution with the bunker which
takes a very different design approach
aesthetically the bunker looks really
industrial with its visible screws and a
slightly military designed to fit with
the name Krueger is opted for a rubber
arm which doesn't allow for as much drag
free mouse control when reaching the end
of the cable but gives a good control
when it's in the ideal range Krueger
also has the most secure mounting method
with a vacuum suction pad and a locking
method even though the bungee is very
light at under 100 grams once you lock
it down you will not be able to remove
it it's insanely strong and you could
probably lift like desks before you
could remove this the orange Kruger logo
isn't my favorite but if you like that
and the design philosophy at around $17
Krueger has brought a pretty solid
offering duskie board is up next with
their own gaming gear bungee it takes an
interesting approach kind of merging the
razor bungee and the Cougar one into a
little bit of an amalgamation however it
doesn't really succeed on impressing
visually some may like it but personally
I find the unnecessary angles and
protruding parts cluttered the design
performance is ok but it's quite light
and doesn't have a suction cup or a
weighted base which once again leads to
slipping even if the rubber feet try to
prevent it the arm is alright but it
doesn't allow for
heaps of drag free movement when the
cable is tighter so if you're doing lots
of flicks where you're moving long
distances you might have some trouble
overall it'll do the job but at $20 you
can probably do better now let's move on
to a more feature-rich bungee with the
Gumby F ages this takes a different
approach with a three-in-one feature set
instead of sitting on your desk this
device mounts right to the side of your
monitor and provides not only a bungee
but also four USB ports and a headphone
holder it's a cool concept and it looks
like a great value at $26 but I feel the
execution is lacking here aesthetically
the maroon red and black doesn't do much
for me the protruding pieces paired with
the gum Diaz branding just makes for an
in-your-face appearance which is an
issue as its prominent on your monitor
and a more subtle design would have
benefited it the Aegis mounts using two
adhesive strips which were nice and
strong at first but after a couple of
replications its worn down and no longer
sticks properly it can't hold my
headphones any longer which is
disappointing it'd be nice if some spare
adhesive strips were included I'm not a
fan of the implementation of the USB
ports either because they're on the rear
of the bungee it's hard to access them
which really defeats the purpose the
performance of the mouse bungee is even
worse as it has no arm or guidance it
only holds the cable this creates a
weird appearance of the cable has to go
up quite high and doesn't allow for any
flexibility without a flexible arm it
doesn't provide anything better than my
DIY option which I'll come to in a
second Gambia's tries to do it all but
fails in most categories now for the DIY
approach it's pretty simple all you have
to do is grab some tape and tape the
cord to the side of the monitor it
sounds stupid but it does work it keeps
your cord from tangling or fraying and
allows you to route it behind your
monitor obviously it has some key
downsides if you pull too hard the tape
can come out and because it doesn't have
any guiding arm it might be a bit rigid
at the far edges of the mousepad
if you're doing extreme movements and
you hit the edge of the mousepad
it's also going to have a hard cutoff
due to that lack of flexibility that
being said it's a pretty decent option
considering it's free and honestly I'd
probably recommend it over the $8 amazon
bungee
are pretty similar if not sometimes
better job and it's free I'd also
recommend it over the ages as you can
tape it lower on the monitor whereas the
agent has to sits very high which is I
don't know it doesn't do a great job for
me at least sir if you're looking for a
very very cheap solution try this if
you've got cash to blow though and you
want a more feature-rich option then
there's definitely some good products
for you now I'm going to hand it over to
the mitri to check out these Oh a
command and the extra five b1 oh my turn
Thank You Aidan so I've been using the
Zoe commodity so we have been purchased
by Bank u so now it's the bank use OE
commodity I think I'm pronouncing that
right but I've been using this as my
primary Bunji ever since receiving it
with a cup of Zoe mice and seriously
cannot go without it the base is nicely
weighted but still it can move around
the food by the cable so it's a good
idea to have the extra cable length
available for flicks and such things
the primary stem can be extended for
more flexibility to absorb by the spring
with this rubber tip holding cables of
different thicknesses just fine although
with really thin wires like on this
extra five mouse it simply pops out it
folds hard enough the second point of
the cable contact is at the back it's
meant to lock the cable to the bungee
without affecting user expansion of the
spring and it's perfect for sicker
cables but as you can see with slim
cables even from Zoe mice themselves the
this lock point is kind of useless as
the cable simply just pops out at 28
bucks though it's a quality product with
appropriate cable flexibility and
support it doesn't look ridiculous but
still a little bit pricey and doesn't
work with really thin cables and then
we'll walk around I found for this
locking point that the rear is to put a
piece of tape over the cable if it's
thin enough and they constantly pops out
this way it's locked the bungee as this
rubber piece would be able to hold any
thin cables just fine unless you really
pull hard on it with like a flick or
something it's well thought house and
moving on to the highest priced bungee
in this roundup is the extra 5b one just
like the gambia bungee it's also a USB
hub this one also has some unnecessary
illumination the lighting and color
scheme follows the yellow branding of
NIP so it looks kind of off in a normal
setup but the aluminum base is quite
elegant it's all you cannot turn off the
lighting so yes if you don't like the
yellow stuff lock the USB ports are at
the back to keep the front clean and
they're connected via a mini USB port
and I don't really like the pattern on
this braided cable they should have just
kept black or you know something more
simple the main cable stem tell is
flexible at the top with this small
channel to hold the cable and that needs
to be routed through the bottom opening
then which helps to secure the cable to
the bungee functionally the B one is
perfect with good flexibility on the
rubber but it is quite large and
expensive unless you need a base with
extra USB ports Aiden back to you for
the conclusions thanks for that Dmitry
now that's a lot of info to take in so
let's summarize it if you're looking to
cheap out don't bother the 8 dollar
bungee isn't going to do much for you
and you're better off with a DIY
solution in the 20 dollar price range
you've got some really solid options
with the standouts being the Razer
bungee for its simplicity and the Cougar
bungee for its insanely secure mounting
method unfortunately dust keyboards
option is lackluster and the aegis is
downright disappointing the extra 5 b1
is in its own class not only because of
its high price but also its features the
USB hub and lighting is nice and the
build really is in a class of its own
however I don't think many people should
be buying a bungee like this simply
because the features that you're paying
for are largely unnecessary the
effectiveness of the Razer bungee
against the b1 is very very similar so
you're paying for looks billed and
features in the end it's your needs
which determine the right bungee for you
but you can't go wrong with either the
offerings from razor or Cougar or if you
can spend a tad more then go with Zoe's
command so thank you for watching
