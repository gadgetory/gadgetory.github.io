great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Harbor
Canucks and welcome to another video
we've covered plenty of 980ti on this
channel and they will all be linked in
the description below for your viewing
pleasure
but today we're taking a look at the new
variant of the 980ti from Asus the Strix
gaming edition and this card is exciting
for multiple reasons first the price it
is slightly lower than competing
solutions from ZOTAC MSI and EVGA priced
at six hundred sixty nine dollars to USD
and it offers an attractive package for
enthusiasts when all things considered
and the factory overclock is plenty high
at twelve hundred sixteen megahertz for
the base clock and 1317 megahertz for
the boost with the just light
overclocked
six gigabytes of video memory and the
second appeal here is the new direct so
you three cooler design what this means
for the end user is an updated already
excellent direct to you foundation for
dissipating the heat that makes sense
for thermos and acoustics a third fan
has been added spanning the entirety of
the heatsink Plus these 92 member fans
utilize a new patented wing blade design
that allows the fans to spend slower but
deliver significantly more airflow with
higher static pressure than previous
generation coolers and for the rest of
cool design we have a couple of 10
millimeter heat pipes and a few smaller
ones spanning the uniquely oriented thin
array bring the card under load 274
degrees Celsius which is a fantastic
temperature and the direct cu3
squeezes the cooling muscle and as with
many other custom 980ti a fan shut off
completely when idle giving you totally
silent operation yet maintaining this
quiet profile even at load the red black
and silver shroud gives the card the
familiar but attractive character one
that spans just over 12 inches in length
and 5 and 3/4 inches for the height of
this GPU this is a very tall card
something to keep in mind as it won't
fit thinner cases and requires quite a
bit of clearance away from the side
panel this also means the dual eight pin
power connectors are not as accessible
and would most likely require you to run
the PCIe cables along the backplate at
the top for the cables to bend properly
and while we are on power the Pequots
for the test system was the highest
among our stack of 980 t is not
significantly higher but it's still
something worth mentioning the back
plate on this 980 i is awesome with some
Strix owl branding and this distinct
read GPU fortifier in simple terms it's
a thick aluminium piece that protects
this PCB area from high tension as the
heatsink is quite heavy the IO has not
changed from the reference card with
trouble DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI 2.0 and a
DVI output and so without any further
ado let's check out the benchmarks
now as you saw the gtx 980ti Strix is an
absolute powerhouse that maintain the
top spot among the majority of the
titles both at 1440p and 4k and really
highlights how awesome our options are
for the 980ti lineup as the asus strix
really is that top of the line card the
checks off every single element from
performance standpoint to aesthetics and
cool design plus let's not forget the
additional overclocking Headroom that is
available it's nothing spectacular the
core was overclocked to just shy of 1500
megahertz and to 8,000 megahertz on
memory that meets our expectations of
what we expect from a 980 TI and nothing
more
and here's the full rundown on how the
asus 980 TI Strix compares to the rest
of the 980 key ice and with 14% better
performance than the Titan X this is one
of the best graphics cards on the market
provided you can find one as
availability seems to be kind of scarce
but we're giving it the Huracan ax damn
car award and this concludes this review
video thank you so much for watching
