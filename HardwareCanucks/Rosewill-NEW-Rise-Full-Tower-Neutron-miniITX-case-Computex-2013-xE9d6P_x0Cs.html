booth I'm with the Patrick the global VP
for was roseville so Patrick tell us a
little bit about the company what's your
vision what is the direction for
computex and moving forward thank you
for such an opportunity and all the fans
in the gaming gaming world gaming
industry and the main mission admission
for Rose OS being the expert the expert
II Provine gaming experience from all
the related gaming devices including the
awesome case power supply mechanical
keyboard gaming mouse and we want to be
the global dominant player in that arena
right so you're providing cases
peripherals power supplies everything
gaming related exactly that's our heart
and soul call focus for the business
okay and what do you have here on
display right now we are told that is
the fastest assembled machine here at
computex exactly when you look at this
latest and greatest envidia titan si I
you know three ways as I I this is the
top notch best of the best you know
graphics and also with the cooling
system providers around with the Rose
wheeled case and also the mechanical
keyboard that we provide you know for
excitement and also performance well
balanced solution right hey AMI and also
right here we can take a look you know
off our very special handmade unique KU
Thrawn case series why the quite a
unique paint Charlie exactly right when
that demonstrate not just from the
function the firm all 20 log and also
all the segments installation inside
that able to provide weather for ways
for pieces of high-end graphics
top-notch 1600 watts of the power supply
by the power exactly that's all about
the gaming experience and the
performance
right and how many cases are being
released at computex 2013 4 well I'll
have our press provide a little bit more
detail later on but I would say close to
10 looks at the end the new products you
know especially in that arena so it
seems like you guys are very aggressive
towards pushing more providing us more
products giving you the gamers or what
do you want and you know it's always
great to have competition especially
with roseville giving us all the gaming
peripherals and giving products power
supplies cases for the market so thanks
thanks Patrick thank you really
appreciate it thank you so hey guys i'm
here with boo the product specialist
here at moes will one interesting really
cool case that we see here is the rise
because it basically takes up it's a
full tower but it is shrunken up into a
sort of a size of a mid-tower so boo
tell us a little bit what makes this
case so special given that this is of
course the the most powerful system here
at computex you thank you for that
introduction so one thing that a lot of
members here when they first see this
case is they think it's a mid tower and
I thought so myself but one of the good
things about this is that it features a
thin this form factor of an it's our but
the height of pho towers or you'll get
the full performance and features of
Futhark ace as you see here in this riot
system we wanted to incorporate and show
off what this case is capable of so here
you have to 280 water coolers on the
front and the top if you don't go the
route of water coolers you can install
either 21 poise in the front end the top
or 31 20s on the front and top their
support your long shank video cards a
hard cage here is removable so you can
notice in this case there's no hard
drive cage there but there is a
solid-state installed and there are two
slots on the back of the load board Trey
will allow you to install two solid
states to get your system up and running
it's easy as possible and of course on
the back of the room with the case we
did incorporate a removable fan and fan
filter for the psu and on the front the
tray cover just pop off by simple click
remove the mr. a wash it up install it
back in simple tools
so you guys are taking taking into
account obviously dustproof so both full
dustproof coverage one on top of the
front at the back of the power supply of
course now given this as open what's the
situation here with the are we given
given the window this is going to be
also other fan mounts is that something
in the works right now it's in the works
right now as you see here the side panel
is not wounded but we will incorporate a
windows on this system because this
system is a case you want to show up are
you components in and it's definitely
designed to be that way right so just to
recap hard drive cages removable still
too at the moment to 3.5 inch drives but
still in the works we may see more and
again what's the motherboard support
here here if we up to EA TX as you can
see at this motherboard is actually ET
expert support to dual intel xeon
processors right well thanks boo really
impressive case from roseville this is
the rise you know giving us the sort of
the full tower capability in the mid
tower size so some of you have asked us
to look at smaller cases here computex
2013 so we're here with the neutron from
roseville an interesting design as you
can see turning us around it's very
elegant kind of a very simple case kind
of also a little bit resembles like the
350 different course there on the side
here we have two USB 3s and two years be
two ports now what's cool about this is
that on the other side this is where
your power reset and your headphone jack
are located so what you can do is you
can actually swap this with the USB
ports depending on the location of your
case give us a little bit flexibility in
terms of positioning this inside your
house inside your desk we also have one
optical drive which is connects with a
tool-less connector also a great
addition but the optical Bay cover can
also be removed if you want to install a
radiator and on top this supports 140
and 120 millimeter fans so a dual
radiator will be able to be installed
either 120-millimeter france or with 140
same thing in the front as you can see
the case comes with 2 1 40 millimeter
front intake fans one exhaust to the
back as well but of course supports for
120 as well there is some spacing there
left
for if you want to install a 240
radiator or 280 radiator which is always
cool to see water cooling capabilities
coming these small packages now this is
a mini ITX case so only I txk board
supported we have plenty of clearance
for the GPU most likely won't have any
issues with the fans installed but if
you do install a radiator that will be
limiting so one comes to the hard drive
on this neutron this is the smaller
design it's not the final decision yet
they might change it because if all your
wiring is sticking out here it might be
a little bit difficult to close and
access all your hard drive so we're told
that the hard drives may be sticking out
this way which makes it be a little bit
easier to swap and to connect with your
power supply power supply it gets
installed on the side here and there is
plenty of ventilation here so that your
power supply can keep cool as you can
see no dust filter here no dust filter
on the front as well so when it comes to
the airflow and from the front as you
can see all will be sucked in through
these ventilation on the sides given
this the air flow will be sacrificed
because you know we have this closed
space it gives it elegant but we are
will be sacrificing an air flow as well
so this has been the neutron from
roseville this is a mini ITX case it's a
fairly wide case so may not be for
everybody but if you are looking for a
pretty cool water cooling setup this is
this might be the choice
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
