since we posted our first second
generation thread report ooh video and
I've been busy with a little bit of an
upgrade project that I wanted to share
with you guys and if you missed out on
our thread report to explain video you
can actually check it out right over
here but in a nutshell the potential
with these new processors are just
remarkable and for someone like me who
likes to explore and create an optimized
editing workstation PC this is a great
platform to look into in fact I can't
wait to do multiple rendering tests
between you know X 399 skylake X rise in
coffee light to see which one's actually
going to be the best editing experience
and most importantly rendering
performances well you can actually tell
about right now that I'm super excited
with what thread dipper 2 is bringing to
the table so I decided to put together a
build or my first build featuring this
new CPU in fact it's not like a new
build it's more of an update to my
existing thread Ripper 2 PC that I've
been thinking about upgrading for quite
some time so this just happens to be the
perfect time because AMD centers the new
sample and it's just a drop-in upgrade
because doesn't require a huge platform
shift so that's pretty awesome so let's
talk about the components right after a
message from our sponsor so you're
looking for something with class good
value comfortably populate an ATX
motherboard are you it's all about the
user experience and great airflow who
knew your temperatures would drop that
low route the cables behind the cover
illuminate your hardware with built-in
LEDs the age 500 I is for you to
discover this one's in real life not in
your dreams say hello to the link below
the age 400 series from NZXT is a go
alright guys so you may remember that
one of the first things that I ended up
doing after getting my original 1950 X
was building the ultimate productivity
PC well that performance monster was
working away until quite recently when
it went into semi-retirement after I
needed to clear out in space in my
office and two relatively large pcs just
didn't fit my intent was to minimize the
system's footprint and bring it back to
life and for those of you wondering all
the components in this video are linked
in the description down below all in all
my experience with therapure was amazing
I even did
bit of an upgrading by installing two
samsung 960 pro SSDs in raid and the
results were absolutely insane
I mean how could I keep something like
that tucked away just because space
didn't permit the Challenger was I
needed a bit more compact case that also
supported my existing asus rog x3 99
zenith extreme motherboard which happens
to be almost to 80 millimeters wide
that's where the first new component
steps into the frame say hello to the
fractal design to find our six with
tempered glass which is relatively a
compact case that happens to support
motherboards that are up to 285
millimeters wide it comes in this muted
black color which is what I wanted since
the Corsair air 540 looked awesome but I
prefer these stealthy black approach
with this case but the real start of the
show is of course the new threaded / 29
50 X which is actually a drop-in upgrade
as I said before for the zenith extreme
I provided you're running the correct
BIOS all I did was download the latest
version of 1303 before switching out the
cpus and it worked perfectly well
now about the 29 50 X just like the 1950
X it has 16 cores and 32 threads but
what's important to me is its base clock
and boost clocks are hundred megahertz
and 400 micro X respectively higher than
the chip it will be replacing that
should help
overall with performance in every
application even more importantly it
consumes about 180 watts at load so I'm
getting higher speeds without I hope
boosting power needs but what about
cooling this beast of a CPU well that's
interesting part guys because I ditched
water cooling for this build and decided
to go air cooling all the way and I
picked this the cooler master right
through / it's an awesome looking cooler
first and foremost it is ginormous I
mean this thing is a monster of a cooler
and it's I love the stealth design
approach with this cooler in the first
place and overall it should complement
the build really well and yeah hopefully
get those really cool temperatures as
well now you may remember this cooler
from a little while ago because it was
actually used to cool down the threat
upper - system aimed he presented at
this year's of Computex we ended up
getting some hands-on time with this
cooler and you can find that video over
here since then coolermaster have made a
few minor upgrades so it can now handle
an overclocked 229 50 X and it overall
fits at the black and wild theme of this
build really well
I can't discuss cooling temperatures or
overclocking yet but let me tell you
this I think you'll be pretty happy with
the results one of the main issues with
first-generation thread ripper and risin
parts was they're somewhat limited
memory compatibility basically if you
wanted to use higher capacity modules
speed had to be sacrificed but that's
been changed a bit with the simplest
architecture on second-generation parts
so i'm saying goodbye to my trusty 64
gigabyte g.skill kit and moving towards
this the Corsair Vengeance white RGB 128
gigabyte ddr4 modules this should give
me more than enough space for
productivity and setting aside some
space for AMD's new sense and my
technology that allows for memory and
physical storage drives to be combined
resulting in ultra fast access to data
even though the dual samsung 960 pro
passes decent grade for my original
build are still crazy fast they now been
split apart to create a secondary
storage drive for game files and
scratches for adobe premiere basically I
saw no reason to replace them since
they're that good I mean while I've
added this Samsung 970 Evo as my primary
boot drive not only is it fast but also
quite durable so it should serve
perfectly now this setup actually
highlights one of the advantages of
AMD's X 399 platform there is no problem
using all these nvme drives with top
crippling my graphics cards or other
attached storage devices and all of
these have it direct link to the CPU
Intel's X $2.99 motherboards can't
accomplish the same thing without
additional third party controllers
moving on to a bit more of a simple
upgrade I ended up ditching his single
gtx 980ti
and when with two founders edition cards
I know that moving away from the custom
Asus GTX 10 atti could mean higher GP
temperatures but I like the fact that
these cars exhaust hot air outside the
case now one thing that I should mention
is I'm not running these cards in SLI
because I decided to use two GPUs for
two separate tasks so while I'm
rendering a video and gaming I'll have
each GPU sort of do those tasks
separately while using both of them at
the same time because if you recall when
explored the options for core affinity I
noticed that running these cards in SLI
and doing multiple tasks could actually
affect performance and the results
really did speak for themselves so I'll
actually live leave or link that video
right over here so you can check it out
pretty cool interesting results so yeah
that's what I'm going
for this build just disabling hassle I'm
and going with just straight to separate
ten ATT is asked for the other
components I've stuck with the same be
quiet dark power 1000 watt power supply
and these amazing looking cable
non-whites Lieb cables which it again
really go well with our stop built so
with that out of the way let's put
together this beast of the PC and
another build done guys and I have to
say I actually like the looks more than
my original threat River build but what
do you guys think is the black and white
bill the bed better than the
predominantly white look from the old
one let us know in the comments down
below I also didn't go to fancy with RGB
lighting in fact there are no RGB fans
or even RGB graphics cards
I basically permanently disable that
except for the RAM modules and the
motherboard lining which I've set to
white to complement the black color
scheme in fact the lighting from the RAM
modules actually separates the cooler
with the motherboard and gives you a
cool depth effect and overall it just
looks pretty awesome and I can't wait to
do some tests on this new PC now I do
want to mention this cooling kit that
asu's offers for their ex we 9 +
motherboards and it's designed to
optimize the VR and cooling performance
if people want to overclock the WX
series processor it can also be used in
cases of high level overclocking on a
regular threader for CPU as well similar
kits will be offered for their other
boards too but it won't be included by
default in the box and you need to ask
Asus for one directly if you already
have an X - 9 + motherboard or buy from
a retailer basically for the zenith
board this cooling kit includes a small
bracket and a small fan that would be
mounted to the top mount v arm heatsink
there's also a secondary heat sink for
the SOC and that will need to be
installed I also want to mention that
this kit isn't necessary for
compatibility with the 2990 WX only 2970
WX but it's certainly recommended if you
intend to overclock those power-hungry
250 watt processors another thing that I
want to mention is some information we
didn't have a
for the initial explained video I want
included here so basically these are the
biases needed to ensure you're a smart
boy is compatible with the second
generation 34 CPUs the x2 minions tricks
and the prime x3 99 will require the 803
or newer versions while the zenith will
need the 1303 version or newer which is
what I'm using so what's next well it's
actually pretty simple because I still
can't reveal any of the results or
benchmarks for this new processor
because you'll have to be a little
patient just wait until next week until
the embargo lives and we'll have those
results for you guys I'll definitely
make sure to compare the 19th DX to the
Skydeck specie that's simply behind me
and of course to these new 29 50x PC so
definitely stay tuned for those
comparisons let's just hope that AMD
doesn't send one of those awesome 2990
WX CPUs but other than that our second
generation third upper content will
continue next week with some official
benchmarks and let me tell you this
these new CPUs from AMD are definitely
going to make Intel worried so that
pretty much wraps up this video guys I
hope you enjoyed the second generation
thread up or to build video but most
specifically I want to pass on a
question to you guys do you still
consider or would you consider buying
thread 2 / 2 knowing for the fact that
it would not give you a significant
benefit or boost performance when it
comes to gaming compared to rise in 2 or
coffee League or do you see yourself
taking advantage of this in your
particular workflow for example taking
advantage of all these course and do you
see value in that I'd love to hear your
thoughts in the comments
