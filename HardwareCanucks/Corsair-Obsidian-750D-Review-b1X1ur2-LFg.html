back to another Hard Knocks review the
Obsidian line from corsair sure is a
popular one without elegant design and
the high quality we've come to expect
with every obsidian the new addition to
the lineup is really meant to close the
gap between the 900 D and the chassis
that really started off a Corsair
the 800 d so you're looking at the 750 d
with a pretty reasonable price of $160
here is next to the monster 900 d for
size reference and it does appear to be
quite a bit smaller but don't forget
this is a full tower and anything
standing next to 900 d will look
miniature there are differences in built
quality tools starting with the front
element of the case that is actually
heavy duty plastic and not steel while
maintaining a very familiar exterior
design with a huge window panel and a
brushed aluminum finish on the front
removing the front panel it is plastic
with just tiny sheet of aluminum as the
front plate and we do get access to the
removable dust filter very convenient
for the case the 750 d also comes
equipped with two 140 millimeter fans
with an open style frame for appropriate
airflow penetration I am however
concerned of the limiting spacing
between the fans and the front panel as
it is quite small and it will definitely
choke the fans also another
disappointing find was that our model
arrived with a broken hinge that secures
the front panel it just wouldn't hold
the panel on one side and while the
mechanism have proven to be sturdy and
very convenient it does showcase its
potential downfall and the front of the
case no longer looks uniform all the
connections are located at the very top
with four USB ports audio jacks and your
PR buttons given the chassis is quite
wide many have expressed their concerns
with optical drives and how it disturbs
the front look of the case and I have to
agree the top of the case features a
large magnetic dust filter very simple
just peel it off and we do get a lot of
fan mounting options exactly the things
we'd like to expect from a full tower so
a 360 million rad support here is
possible there are also rubber inserts
for the fans that will help
means audible vibrations at the rear of
the chassis we get that extra venting
area for the top plus an exhaust fan
nine PCI slots and the power supply dust
filter at the bottom taking a look at
the very bottom of the case aside from
the dust filter we also get optional
bottom fan mounts but notice there's no
dust filter which is rather
disappointing but you'll see later that
this is not the only flaw for the bottom
intake and finally let's get inside the
case and first thing you notice are the
two Drive cages that are installed at
the bottom that allow resistance free
front intake these use standard flexible
drive caddies with SSD support as well
and the cage system is flexible with
mounting for example you can stack them
and install insert of the conventional
spot that clears up room at the very
bottom this allows users to get access
to the bottom intake slots with lots of
clearance until the bottom hard drive
cage both platforms are easily removable
but aside from not having dust filters
included I don't think coarser design
this wall has the closest fan mount is
practically touching the frame you can
see this with our 120mm fan meaning
there is no clearance for a 240mm
radiator as lengthwise it just wouldn't
fit this is questionable considering
this spot would have been ideal for a
240mm radiator without sacrificing on
storage as if you wish the Mount Rainier
to the front you do lose out on one of
the drive cages and turn the case around
there is a pleasant sight to see a lot
of cutouts especially for the bottom
mounted drive cage plus a whole array of
tools
SSD brackets and I'm happy to finally
see these integrated more and more into
the chassis so a really big thumbs up
for Corsair for this type of
implementation these are easily
removable you simply insert this as the
end plus you can secure the drives with
screws for extra reassurance the whole
mounting system seems robust then you
can further secure the bracket to the
frame with a single screw plus the drive
caddies are designed with cable
management in mind with appropriate
cutout to route your SATA cables plus
the drive cage is appropriately spaced
to allow SSD brackets to be installed
without any clearance issues there is an
inch of room in the back for all your
cables
we can tuck them at the very bottom so I
really was not expecting anything less
from Corsair and starting with the
assembly I notice that the one on the
bottom rubber grommets was almost
completely blocked by the power supply
this isn't a big deal but it wouldn't
have hurt to have them slightly more
forward and mounting in our ATX
motherboard you can see the chassis is
designed with larger boards in mind and
it does support a ATX and XL ATX
motherboards of course with water
cooling in mind we get almost ten
centimeters of clearance at the top
until the memory modules so fitting in
the top Brad certainly won't be an issue
especially since the top portion of the
internals is slightly wider to provide
better compatibility starting with cable
management the 750d feels very roomy and
certainly fits any GPU in the market as
there's over thirteen inches of
clearance until the drive cage and
flipping the case around cables are well
spaced and secured properly and every
time I've worked with the coarser
chassis it's always been without hassle
they've sure got the formula right and
they're sticking to it however there are
a few instances where you might run into
trouble one of them if you're using
larger boards like EI TX or XL ATX is
rubber grommets only extend to a certain
spot and might be fully covered by the
motherboard also this case is equipped
with nine PCI slots meaning four-way SLI
or crossfire as possible but you will
have to reposition the drive cage as it
does prevent clearance for the two
bottom PCI brackets and closing the
panel you get a very simple and clean
looking chassis with your Hardware just
peeking through the window so it
certainly has potential for awesome
lighting for you to show off and I'm
going to conclude by stating the newly
added obsidian is a very spacious
chassis with module drive cages
innovative SSD brackets and that elegant
yet simple look that many people desire
but I feel these 750d lacks flexibility
when it comes to water cooling
especially for the limited room at the
bottom plus there's no dust filter we
also have a kind of a destructive look
if you need to install any optical
drives or anything else in there then
the broken front panel hinge is
certainly not leaving a good taste
$160 price of course the broken hinge is
coincidental but also shows that coarser
needs to step up their game with quality
control overall I think the 750d has a
place within the Obsidian lineup
it's basically an enlarged 350d and
people have been asking for an ATX
version of that chassis but I was hoping
for better integration of water cooling
in the bottom so I cannot give the 750 d
and award just yet because of its
pitfalls but let us know what you think
of this new obsidian in the comments
below and as always thanks for watching
and we'll see you in the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
