axe and welcome to another video review
the fortress lineup from silverstone has
carried significant weight for
impressive cooling performance elegant
aluminum designs and a certain level of
functionality that could only be found
from silverstone now this latest
addition to the fortress line is the FTO
4 that tries to fill those same promises
but priced at $230 it might be a tough
sell considering how competitive the
enclosure market has become we recently
reviewed the latest Raven and the FT of
4 takes an identical internal frame with
a few things changed but as you can see
it takes a very similar form and shape
with a side window and a one-piece
frontal design a silverstone has done an
excellent job in minimizing the
footprint of the full tower without
compromising on features what's changed
is the door now aluminum instead of
flexible plastic and it is sandblasted
aluminum that looks exceptional without
all the fingerprint mess the FTO 4 is
also foam padded inside the front panel
and side vents angled to divert any
sound both panels are also padded so
there's plenty of emphasis on keeping
the FDF for as silent as possible
although I couldn't help to think of a
less ideal material for the side panel
window as just by handling it produces
unpleasant noises so vibrations from
inside the machine could potentially
resonate into audible vibrations of the
panel USB 3 ports and audio jacks are
located on the right side along with the
rather weak magnets that hold the panel
in place
I would have preferred some clips
instead power and reset buttons are on
the opposite side with additional
venting there are two five and a quarter
inch drive base with two fan controller
knobs for the fans below so controlling
both cooling performance and noise
levels so that's always awesome and this
is the impressive part of this design
the fact that incredible cooling can
happen with just these two 180
millimeter air penetrators these fans
aren't white though which is a little
strange it doesn't really go with the
black design but they are extremely
directional and will provide the really
effective airflow tunnels these can also
be swapped for a triple 120 millimeter
setup for
central 360 radiator there's also a fan
shroud for the top fan that we are told
helps to focus airflow towards your
blower style graphics cards the
silverstone is also smart about dust
filter design with a really fine mesh
that has minimal effect on resistance
but really effective against dust
particles at the top where the front
panel closes there's a small gap but it
does continue in the uniform fashion and
that's where the hard drive activity
lights are located because of the
chamber isolation power supply is
installed at the top sitting on some
more foam or the removable dust filter
so thanks for that followed by an upside
down motherboard layout with eight PCI
slots large venting for airflow to exit
and a 120mm fan mount so all in one
water coolers are not totally out of
question well that pretty much covers
the exterior changes the FDF form
unfortunately still has the same panel
design that shows a little bit too much
of the inside especially that the
sticking out drive gauge it was somewhat
acceptable for the Raven but it doesn't
suit to fortress line at least that's
what I think internals are identical to
the latest Raven the only difference
will be the added foam on the floor some
up top the fan is now white with
corresponding cables and one three and a
half inch drive slot is now hot
swappable so that's really good to see
so let's quickly cover the rest of the
features drive cage is padded internally
it's all tooless and it will support
five three and a half inch drives there
are two more slots at the bottom for
mechanical drives using this
quick-release system that's actually
very clever just pull on the strap to
release the drive there's appropriate
cutouts available at the rear for all
your cable routing there's also a CPU
cooler support bracket that can be high
adjusted for your needs and remove
completely if not needed the FTO 4 does
support SSDs but it's not a comfortable
process to get them installed you have
to first remove the bottom drive cage
and then you get access to two SSD slots
that you have to screw in place from the
bottom of the case and even without
anything in the system it was quiet
chromosome plus at all the routing work
that will follow so yeah it does support
everything that you need but it's not a
user-friendly process so the rotated
motherboard tray is very effective
within this case as it allows the
chassis to be
smaller since GPUs are installed at the
top without compromising on drive
storage the motherboard tray is also
removable that makes a huge difference
for assembly outside of the case but the
FT r4 still maintains incredible
stability with the tray removed that
just demonstrates the excellent build
quality of the internal frame and with
everything assembled silverstone has
done an excellent job for cable
management all the cables are pretty
much tucked away and additional cutouts
right underneath power supply are useful
connecting all the drives of course if
things are kept to a minimum would be
hassle-free
but I could see it being more
challenging as you start to populate
those SSD spots and three and a half
inch drive slots the case is ready for
long graphics cards with 13 inches of
clearance and that's with the shroud in
place and includes a GPU support bracket
for those saggy graphics cards so that's
an excellent consideration and what
silverstone has created here is an
airflow masterpiece and while you can
still mount a 360 right at the front
you'll effectively remove the best thing
from the FT or for those two air
penetrators now the FTO 4 is certainly
an upgrade in the way the chassis feels
thanks to the aluminum exterior
additions the case is truly impressive
for its cooling potential just from the
two front fans and everything else that
complements this airflow with great
chamber separation and clean cable
management a few functional additions
like the removable motherboard tray and
the support system for you CPU and GPU
are welcome there is an impressive
amount of drive storage potential here
in such compact footprint with one
hot-swappable slot and the added foam is
helpful to reduce the noise levels plus
the integrated fan controllers just keep
in mind they're pretty loud at full
power now I still feel they moved away
from giving us an easy case to work in
especially when it comes to SSD mounts
I'm glad we have so much potential for
drive storage I just don't think that's
how it should be done also a smaller
window would be more ideal to hide the
drive gauge and all the cables flowing
out of it I still think the best thing
about the FT f4 is the amazing cooling
potential for your system right out of
the box and it's really up to you
whether you value that
and a somewhat clunky SSD mound for the
$230 price tag a silverstone has managed
to cram a lot of features into the f2f
for and we're giving in the damn
innovative award as there's really
nothing like it but what do you guys
think of this latest fortress does it
send a chance within our current
enclosure market that's becoming
extremely saturated I certainly think so
but I do prefer more flexibility when it
comes to user friendly designs well that
is it for the FTO 4 make sure to
