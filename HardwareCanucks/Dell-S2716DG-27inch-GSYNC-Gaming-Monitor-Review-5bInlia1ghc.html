great technology selection and service
what's up guys Eber here with hardware
connects and while 21 by 9 curved
monitors are sparking a little bit of
attention these days the majority of PC
gaming enthusiasts still prefer the
27-inch 2560 by 1440 resolution monitor
because it's the perfect size for a wide
range of consumers as it offers enough
real estate for productive work and
gaming since all modern titles support
this resolution it should also be noted
that g-sync is slowly starting to expand
into most gaming monitors and gaming
notebooks remember this wasn't popular a
few years ago so today we're taking a
look at the Del s 2716 DG 27-inch g-sync
monitor priced at $800 the main issue
with that price point is the existence
of already established fantastic gaming
panels for less cash like the Acer XV
270 hu but if you can catch the s 2716
during one of Dells
numerous sales it could be a great value
let's get the specs out of the way this
is a 27-inch TN panel with a resolution
of 2560 by 1440 with a greater gray
response time of one millisecond and a
color depth of sixteen point seven
million colors that's a bit the main
highlight is the 144 Hertz refresh rate
with the G sync technology and we will
talk about that in a moment
from a physical standpoint Dell design
the S 27:16 for users that prefer a
simple and elegant looking monitor on
their desk there's no doubt this can
also be utilized as a work monitor
I love the edge to edge glass design and
the thin bezels plus the screen and the
bezel are flushed with Dells excellent
anti-glare coating that cuts the glare
without making the images overly fuzzy
The Stand comes in two parts inside the
box the first one being the base plate
and the second being a stand the
assembly was very simple consisting of
placing the stand on top of the plate
and tightening them with the included
screw on the bottom the stand offers 26
degrees of tilt swivel and even
landscape to portrait modes 130
millimeter of height adjustment and the
stand is everything we have come
from Dell solid stable and the flat
slightly angled top can serve to collect
items off your desk
input wise we have a four port USB 3.0
downstream ports two on the side of the
monitor an audio line out hdmi 1.4 and
DisplayPort 1.2 although I would have
preferred an additional DisplayPort and
HDMI for daisy-chaining
the physical buttons to adjust the
display settings are placed beneath the
screen on the right side which when
pressed reveals a small pop-up that
contains a short list of most used
features the on-screen display is a
classic in a phrase from Dell there are
eight main sections running along the
left side starting with the brightness
and contrast setting then moving over to
the input source where you can switch
between hdmi and displayport dow has
been solved three different color
presets with standard warm and cool with
the custom option available as well the
display section lets you set a response
time and play around with the ultra-low
motion blur abilities in case you do not
own an NVIDIA GPU you can also adjust
audio levels for the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and the menu section lets
you change the language set transparency
off the on-screen display and how long
it should stay on the screen with the
timer option the personalise setting
allows you to assign two shortcuts of
any setting to your preference which is
a very nice feature to have and the last
others section has the option to enable
or disable the monitor deep sleep now on
to panel quality and well the screen
itself is great for a TN panel picture
uniformity is surprisingly good contrast
ratio is fantastic power consumption is
in line with other TN monitors but even
still after a gaming match you can't
feel but slightly disappointed with the
very late 2015 release in 2014 this
would have been a killer product but for
now simply put the TN panel route was an
unfortunate decision for Dell as viewing
angles suffer when you're not directly
in front of the screen as in you lose
quite a lot of contrast and at $800 this
monitor is not competitive at all as IPS
144 Hertz options
having said that the faster one
millisecond response time delivers a
fantastic gaming experience compared to
a slightly slower four millisecond of
IPs competitors the combination of a
higher refresh rate and gsync equates to
a satisfactory time spent in
first-person shooter games you just get
used to smooth frame rate without screen
tearing and it becomes very apparent how
fitting this monitor is for competitive
gameplay thanks to gsync the s27 16 is a
great monitor in a wrong price bracket
if it was around $500 then this would
have been an amazing Buy so let us know
your thoughts on this Dell monitor in
the comments we have a more in-depth
review on a website linked down below
