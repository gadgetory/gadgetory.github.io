fancy-schmancy master made it Ireland
HD 6 X X collaboration mass drop and Sun
Heiser main mass drop is powerful the HD
650 s which these headphones are sort of
based on our 500 plus dollars and mass
job is able to get these in the mass
production 5,000 units for this first
run at $200 $1.99 that's incredible I
mean if some ties are so powerful I
suggest maybe next time they work on
something a little bit more high-end
like HD 800 or maybe 700 and I actually
used to own the HD 650 s the variant of
this but from the Sun Heiser version and
now I am super happy to receive
something like this that I've owned for
a while now but now the HD 6 X X there
are no longer gray but more like a
darkish just a hint of blue in terms of
the padding it looks to be identical I
love the interior padding over here that
in case your ear makes contact with that
interior wall it's still super
comfortable seriously the most
comfortable pair of headphones that I
have owned aside from the HD 598 alright
time to listen some music let's do it
the new NZXT s340 elite what makes it so
elite we've got a gorgeous tempered
glass panel extra vr ports improve care
management and an awesome magnetic buck
the name is fitting elite features at a
good price s340 elite check it out in
description below so what is it about
this iconic pair while the HD 650 is
regarded to be this classic pioneer for
entry hi
headphones there's this unmatched
balance of build quality projected
lifespan comfort level is fantastic and
a reference sound signature that's very
unique with full resolution fantastic
control of the base end smoothing out on
the high end so for example something
that sounds a little bit harsh on the
treble side on the HD 598 will be a lot
smoother on the HD 6xx but without
losing detail individual left and right
connectors are removable as on the
original but the cable length has
reduced to 6 feet instead of 10 and a
three and a half millimeter jack is by
default with a quarter of an inch
adapter included as for the open bag
design I understand the limitations of
them leaking sound so private listening
is out of question unless you have a
whole room to yourself hashtag work from
home
but recently I've actually started
running with my HD 598 which I love you
know they gave me awareness my
surrounding so I'm not totally zoning
out while still delivering plenty of
volume as for the better HD 6xx they are
more suited for like a home environment
plug into a nice amp turn up the volume
and simply is zoned out an amp would
definitely complement the sound
signature especially because they are
300 ohms impedance and I've been using
the objective + o DAC drive all my
headphones which is very clean and you
can also think of audio in the same
sense you would with PC hardware it's an
evolving ecosystem that you can upgrade
in the HD 6 x-axis fantastic foundation
to start with if you're looking to let's
say diversify your listening experience
you can add a cube amp down the line to
maybe warm up the lower end a little bit
or if you want something a little bit
brighter adding an analytical amp or DAC
would also do the trick and so now you
can own a pair for $1.99 which is a
fantastic deal I will link the drop in
the description below for a mass job and
if you're one the lucky few out of the
5,000 batch for this first batch then
that is really cool I hope you guys
enjoy them and seriously what else is
there to say I'm one those people to put
on the headphones blast out the volume
lie down on my chair and get goosebumps
by listening to something epic and now
you can too with the HD 6 xx I also want
to rephrase something I mentioned in the
beginning of the video saying mass drop
is powerful well I want to rephrase that
to say they are influential and they've
done a few epic drops in the audio
spectrum and this is just one of them I
hope this is a continuation of their
relationship with Sun hyzer
because they make fantastic products and
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video
good luck with the drop a link in
description again and we'll see you next
