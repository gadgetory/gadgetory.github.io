brought to you by NCIX technology
connected hey guys so we're here at
intel's booth preview at CES 2014 we saw
some incredible brand new jaw-dropping
tech and first and foremost were to
actually go and take a look at some of
the augmented reality now this is some
of the newest stuff that's coming up
from Intel and it's basically a really
fun application that has a lot of
applications in gaming and as a lot of
applications and product demonstration
whatnot and we took a look at a couple
of different options and a couple
different things you can interact with
different different cartoons and
different games and stuff like that we
saw one reconnect to use your hand to
save lemmings and another one we can
interact with these little globby things
and it was pretty pretty cool and pretty
innovative however it's not the newest
thing that we've seen so far today other
things we take one to take a look at was
the Intel Edison now this is a all it
looks like it's just the size of a chip
but it's actually a complete integrated
system now this system is being put into
place so you could have smart coffee
mugs but also there's a company out
there called MIMO that has gone and
developed a integrated child monitoring
system which is basically built into the
kids onesie it can control and actually
predict the sleeping patterns the
temperature breathing as well it
actually predicts when the child is
going to wake up and connects wirelessly
to a bottle warmer so everything will be
ready the second that your child is
ready to eat or drink another really
cool thing that we actually took a look
at today it was the gaming section now
we actually saw some pretty kick-ass
iris graphics displayed at 4k
resolutions now this was actually
playing on I think it was dota or dota
which is a massive online multiplayer
game and we saw it pushing actually
pretty damn good resolutions and it was
actually at a really solid frame rate
and right next to it we saw the sneak
preview of not the steam box I've been
corrected it's not a steam box it's the
steam machine so this steam machine is
running on the gigabyte brix device if
you actually took a look at yesterday at
gigabytes booth and right next to
was the steam controller like I like to
use the thumbs so guys this actually
looks really cool and we're really
excited to see exactly what intel has
planned later on for the rest of 2014
but so far iris looks like it's a
definite winner if you want like a
budget gaming system so guys make sure
that you like this video that you
subscribe and keep on following back for
more CES 2014 coverage and we're live
here at intel's booth preview</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
