know we have nice little welcome over
here and well look like Eber is already
here enjoying his time with what is this
what are we looking at we are looking at
the Phanteks Enthoo Luxe 2 it looks like
they've made a bunch of new changes and
the refinements on the locks - that we
originally saw at CES so let's check
this thing out and see exactly who this
case is for but first thanks to Phanteks
and SteelSeries for making our trip at
Computex post about it alright so today
let's talk about the Enthoo Luxe 2 we
saw the original one at CES and now it's
been refined and completed and they have
done some changes to the enclosure that
are important to mention and I think the
overall direction is good and I like
that there's focus with this enclosure
it's not just like a case that can
accommodate everything and you know you
can buy a standard ATX motherboard and
put a case put it inside the case here
of course you can but the whole point of
it is to utilize the size of the
enclosure to your own advantage because
if you're actually going for something a
bit smaller there are other options
available and I like that Phanteks in't
afraid to give users exactly what this
case is designed for so that means
gamers who want an extreme system with
water cooling and massive radiators
everywhere that could be professionals
who want something with more storage
that means people who want dual system
configurations with either an ATX
motherboard or dual socket motherboard
because the case accommodates that and a
small ITX motherboard below it that
means for people who want a really
powerful system with dual power supplies
so the case the interlocks do is quite
flexible in that regard so the main
changes when it comes to the physical
characteristics of the case include
they've removed the fabric that we saw
at CES so that high airflow fabric that
we see on P600's that looks amazing now
has been removed to actually improve air
flow because that was a restriction on
the front panel and the top and they
found that the airflow is better without
it
yet we still have this nice fine dust
filter that is superfine therefore
allows a lot of the air flow to
percolate through while not allowing any
dust to
the exterior is sandblasted aluminum
paneling for the front and the top
panels while the actual frame itself is
plastic so there is that dual material
combination
it doesn't look cheap but you might
definitely feel the difference while
handling the case as for the TG side
panels they are on hinges and they can
be secured with a thumb screw at the
front so if your transport in case it
won't simply fly open they also have
magnets and a pins so that the the panel
is nicely secured and there's no wiggle
room when it is in transport so nice
little thought put into making sure the
tempered glass panel gets to where it
needs to be without being broken as for
the interior the whole modularity aspect
is cool so aside from your standard
motherboard area you can have an ITX
motherboard right below it and you just
have to pre install the motherboard
standoffs and the actual ITX bracket is
already included with the enclosure that
is not sold separately however you do
have to buy the riser cable separately
and that whole bottom section because
it's so tall you can do a 360 rad at the
bottom when push-pull and the really
thick radiators if that is your choice
you can also mount hard drive cages in
that slot and mount them for stacks
which is awesome if you are going
towards the hard drive route the side
cover plates can be used for SSD
mounting on both sides so you can show
them off and you can also hide them in
the back and the grooves allow for some
cable management situations through the
back and you can also remove them to
install hard drive cages in there or
remove them completely to have spacing
for a 480 milna radiator so quad 120 mil
rod so the whole airflow section is
pretty unique so you can do 15 fans in
total which is kind of insane if you're
going for airflow or water cooling so
you can do dual 480 Newman radiators at
the same time Plus duo 360 mil radiators
at the same time so that is a lot of
water cooling equipment that you can fit
in the case at the same time and
speaking of water cooling we saw the
glacier d1 40 which is a universal
distribution plate that can be mounted
on any case that supports 140 Miller
rear exhaust fans and has seven PCIe
slots which means that that
vac can be occupied with more water
cooling components it gives the the
entire tubing a bit of a unique
aesthetic and has multiple locations
into which you can reroute the CPU area
the GPU area the fill port and the
exhaust port or the drain port as well
and while I'm not really much into water
cooling I feel like that whole direction
of mounting something at the back of the
case instead of a traditional fan or a
radiator the back looks pretty awesome
especially because it's transparent and
it is illuminated that thing is $99
definitely fits the Luxe 2 aesthetic and
what that is trying to achieve but also
fits basically any other case that will
have 140 ml fans and seven PCI slots
there is a fan control included behind
the case at the top nice position can
support seven fans in total either of
PWM control or SATA and the cool thing
is the case actually does not come with
any fans because with a enclosure that
is that large and so flexible what
they're trying to achieve is give users
the customization of what they're trying
to do without letting you waste any fans
because normally you populate your own
fans and not use the stock ones and this
allow them to reduce the cost by about
five bucks or so so the case is a
hundred and eighty nine dollars which
means that it still separates itself
from the evolv X or the P600's
enclosures and I would say that's a
pretty competitive price point for a
really hybrid chassis like the Luxe 2
as for the dual system configuration
because of the bracket that gives you a
chance to have two vertical GPU
orientations that's pretty cool to
showcase both them if you go that route
and the front I of course can be split
to power one system with a power button
and power the other one with the reset
button if you wish to do so and those
dual USB 3s can be again split into each
system and as for cable management at
the back you can see they've kept the
dual velcro channels and added a plate
in front of the power supply that hides
all that main cable exit and will
basically just make it appear like a
cleaner system from the back and that
panel has appropriate spacings for the
cables to exit and it's really awesome
to see the Luxe 2 in action
outside of having a simple empty chassis
we also had a full production machine
that was water-cooled with dual
quadrille cards and the insane dual
socket motherboard not necessarily sure
I would water cool a system like it but
it kind of shows you what is possible
with hard drive support as well of
course they had the full gaming setup
with dual system configuration both the
main ATX motherboard and the ITX
motherboard a water-cooled and just
gives you the options to think about
what you could do I would say the Luxe 2
is not for everybody but if you're
approaching the the route of wanting to
go full extreme in either direction you
can definitely have plenty of options to
do so and so the case will be available
in early August of this year for $189
which I would say is a competitive price
point for a case of this caliber I'm ok
and for them not including any fans
because you most likely be using your
own I don't like how they removed that
high airflow fabric pieces from the
front and the top I thought it looked
better when the CES enclosure even
though they said that performance is
better without it and they are targeting
towards the performance market what
still looks pretty decent I just thought
that the high airflow fabric added some
nice unique character to the case but it
still holds the true DNA of the original
and the luxe in terms of that curved led
soft ambient strip throughout the in
case that is also found on the interior
now to separate the power supply shroud
and I really like what they've done with
the design let me know what you think of
the luck stew in the comments make sure
to check out this other relevant content
and thanks much for watching I'll talk
to you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
