here and it's their first wireless
iteration within the cloud lineup and
I'm actually super excited to see how
this headset will change the perception
of wireless gaming audio in this
industry and they say this because the
entire cloud gaming series lineup has
been a really good example of what to do
in the gaming industry with the audio
stuff so you know they have never been
perfect but value wise it makes sense so
the question is does the flight make
sense at the hundred fifty nine dollars
it glides right over the corsair pro
wireless and the arctas seven from sale
series and matches in the price point to
the Logitech G 533 so let's review right
after this hi I'm looking for a case
well look no further I got this beauty
the H seven hundred by NZXT with all
steel premium frame with a side of
tempered glass - beautifully showcase
any cooling adventure you might pursue
and cable management system that you
wish you had earlier all this lit up
with integrated RGB lighting and
built-in fan control the aged 700 I this
one's for you I'll take it alright so
this being a wireless pair they had to
tone down some of the weight obviously
because of the built-in battery and
because of that it's a full plastic
basically construction aside from the
steel vent for the expansion of the
sizes and even the ridges inside of it
are plastic this to me feels more in
line with their stinger headset which is
in their budget category so you do have
to be a little bit extra cautious with
these especially because of the rotating
ear cups now on one hand it's awesome
because they can just chill on your neck
and make some super comfortable to wear
you don't have to take them off you're
not using them but on the other hand the
actual swivels they feel a little bit
too loose and I'm just afraid of this
snapping eventually if you know I mean
the headset is pretty light so it can
support the weight on the one joint but
if you potentially like throw them
around or something the joints alone
make the headset feel a little bit not
as premium as it should feel for that
price point
however comfort wise they're actually
better than the originals
I find there a lighter frame and the
expansion to be a more accommodating for
larger heads they don't have as much
clamping force which is awesome and the
materials in terms of the foam padding
feels identical to the originals and
unfortunately we do not get any
additional ear pads so the value added
from the original clouds has a little
bit of extra so if you do potentially
own a pair of original clouds you can
substitute the foam padding here I do
love that they have the interior foam
that is a bit extra thick unlike on many
other pairs and this helps to avoid any
contact that is uncomfortable with that
interior driver and so general comfort
wise I could wear these for hours easy
especially because they just simply fall
on your neck like so and allows it to be
still mobile and of course it
complements the whole wireless direction
I do like the exposed red cable for that
extra pop in color it's also super stiff
so no worries about dripping if it
accidentally catches on something it
will stay in place so that's awesome for
connectivity on the right side there's a
volume dial the scroll steps are very
soft making precise volume adjustment
difficult and you'll end up either
reducing or adding too much volume it
also does not have the click so this is
just a wheel only I do like their
approach to mic muting so this entire
side is basically just a giant button
and it doesn't take away from the
functionality nor the design element so
it's kind of discreet and it's very
large so you can easily access it and it
only is activated at the bottom where
the mic mute logo is located and we do
get a double beep when the mic is mute
below we have a power button it also
controls the logo illumination for
either breathing effect or off to
preserve battery life and the three last
ports are the microUSB for charging a
headphone cable for Wired listening and
the mic input which has a different
frame around the input so you cannot
accidentally plug the mic into the
headphone jack the headphone cable is
identical on each end so it doesn't
matter which way you plug it in but
notice that it's not a 4-pole connector
meaning when the headphone is wired the
microphone and the volume wheel do not
work there is no bluetooth connectivity
so it only works with a USB dongle with
your PC or Playstation 4 Xbox for some
reason doesn't work so you would need to
use the wired connection into your
controller and
I tried it on my Mac and it works just
fine and this makes it a simple
plug-and-play solution its driverless
it's hassle-free which is awesome but I
also see from the other point of view of
people maybe already expecting some sort
of driver software and EQ customization
for a hundred and sixty dollar pair the
competition offers that but the HyperX
flight doesn't alright so as for the
microphone quality because it's wireless
my microphone test has never been so
mobile in the past but I think it sounds
okay for wireless pair you know there's
obviously a lot of compression going on
it has built-in noise cancellation so it
tries to cancel out all the things in
the background and like your surrounding
so that your voice can be like the the
dominate thing that people hear but
because of the modularity and the
mobility you can do things like this you
can listen to music you can talk to your
friends and because the range is so good
there's absolutely no microphone quality
loss when you're away you can be away
from your studio your a room your office
whatever and still have the voice so
guys let me know what you think of the
sound quality of the HyperX cloud flight
in the comments below ok so now let's
talk about the performance elements so
the wireless range on this thing is
insane I was two walls away in my
bedroom without hearing any drops and
without perceiving any quality loss in
audio still a range no disruptions
whatsoever so that's awesome I haven't
had that experience yet with any other
wireless pair that I've reviewed so
that's awesome making this a
multi-purpose headset not just for
gaming but if you like to listen to your
music while you're doing things around
the house just keep in mind that the
actual isolation from this is excellent
and so if anyone's trying to contact you
while you're wearing these you will not
be able to hear them at all so that's a
good thing and also a bad thing too
now the sound signature being this
HyperX product is very similar to the
HyperX clouds original so a very nice
deep base that is present but it doesn't
overpower the mid-range which is really
full and detailed and the treble is just
emphasized just right it's not harsh
it's not muffled so you get all the
detail and a little bit base of punch
which is awesome for games this being a
closed design I was absolutely blown
away at the stereo imaging that these
deliver so that is hearing audio that's
not being delivered from your ear cups
but actually feeling it in front of you
like you're listening to a set of stereo
speakers and that was quite impressive
now the sound stage at how large the
audio environment is obviously is a bit
more narrow so that it is bit more
reserved but the actual stereo signal on
here is fantastic it's awesome for
competitive work it's awesome for just
hearing wind blow in the desert and so
just experiencing that and it's also
very good for directional cues because
everything is detailed and nothing is
like muffled by virtual surround sound
and all that this is a pure stereo
signal and it's fantastic for HyperX not
go the virtual surround sound route
overall I'm super pleased with the sound
output and these will be replacing my
game once and because of this whole
wireless convenience they will occupy a
spot on my case I'm actually very
surprised at the way how they sound
they're actually right on par with what
the HyperX cloud alpha gaming headset
sounds like there's fantastic detail and
highs mids are exactly what they need to
be there's also a good amount of bass
just to give you that extra emphasis on
the low ends when you're playing FPS
titles and whatnot and finally I'm just
really happy to have a pair of headset
that I can use to you know film around
the studio I don't have to you know
blast my music on the speakers to enjoy
that I can definitely do that with these
now I'm really enjoying my time with the
cloud flight gaming headset alright
enough of me talking back to a Timmy
tree and so the last thing to cover with
the battery life so the thing is you
cannot use them while they're charging
there is no convening
way to check your battery status and it
will only beep like a certain pattern
when you go below 20 percent which is
super inconvenient who wants to hear
that it would be so awesome let's say if
you press the power button three times
and the glow on the side will blink
every time you have 10% of the whole
battery so if it blinks six times you
have 60 percent left and just gives you
that much better visual and actual full
indication on the battery status instead
of waiting for the thing drop below 20
percent so they claim 30 hours of
listening at 50 percent volume without
LEDs so obviously the LEDs really hit
the battery hard you might as well just
disable them after you've experienced
your LEDs on a headset at least they're
not RGB am i right and for higher
volumes you're looking about 15 to 20
percent of continuous usage which I
would say is in line to what you can
expect from a wireless gaming headset
and over the last three days I've used
them for about 10 hours of continuous
usage at 80 plus volume and I have not
received the low battery beep just yet
now it does turn off after 30 minutes of
inactivity which is great to preserve
battery life but say you don't have the
LEDs enabled and then the headset goes
to sleep you still see it being
connected to the computer because the
dongle is receiving power but the
headset is not communicating with a
dongle so then you'd have to go in and
manually turn the headset back on in
order to continue your listening and a
good way to know if your headset
sleeping is that the receiver is
blinking red LED and right now if I turn
the mic on
we went back on line with a solid red
LED and so my final thoughts about the
cloud flight I think it's a really good
introduction into the wireless audio
from HyperX and they did a lot of things
right with this one but the lack of
surround sound is a bit questioning but
I'm so happy they didn't go that route
because most of the time it's really not
that great and you know you want to
stick with the stereo representation
because you get best details and just
best
directional cues as well but the lack of
Bluetooth is a bit questioning because I
could see this being a really good
multi-purpose headset not just actually
headphone without
the microphone for like listening with
your smartphone but they want the route
of this being you know connecting to the
USB hub only I'm also surprised at the
microphone quality it actually sounds
really good for a wireless pair so guys
that concludes my review of the HyperX
cloud flight I would give this in a word
but because of the build quality thing I
think they could have done a better job
in terms of delivering us a slightly
better plastic construction so that it
doesn't feel like I have to be cautious
with it and you know I have other
plastic headsets like this game one from
sanitizer it's also fully plastic with
that steel band interior just like on
the flight but this thing feels like it
can take a lot more feels a lot more
robust yeah that could be the main flak
HyperX receives regarding this headset
and so I'm super excited to see what the
cloud flight 2 might offer based on
customers feedback and reviewers
feedback so if you want to see something
change let us know in the comments and
just what are your thoughts about this
pricing structure and the feature set
which is kind of like bare-bones which
is nice but then again this perception
of value may not be the strongest point
here but I would say that this is my
favorite while as gaming had said that I
tried to date so guys thank you so much
for watching make sure to check out this
other relevant content and yeah let's
continue the conversation in the
comments I'm doing tree we'll see you in
