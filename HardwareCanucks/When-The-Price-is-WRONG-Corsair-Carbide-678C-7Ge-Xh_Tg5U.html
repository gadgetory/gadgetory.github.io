what we have here so this is the new
Corsair low noise case the 678C so
you know what guys I am rooting for
silent cases you know I want their
population in the market to grow a
little bit and this is exactly what we
have here with a 678C a very easy
name to remember
but of course minimizing your system
noise is a combination of things like
your fan rpm the rest of your hardware
and the case is at play as well and how
turbulent the airflow might enter and
might exhaust the case and just how
covered up your intakes are but then if
everything is covered up then you have
to increase the fan rpm in order to get
some airflow in there so let's see how
this $200 case stacks up for cooling and
noise right to this the legendary hyper
212 CPU cooler from cooler master now
comes in this breathtaking matte black
finish the included Silencio 120
millimeter fan delivers great airflow
and reduced noise plus you can pick up
an RGB version of this cooler as well
learn more about the hyper 212 Black
Edition and its RGB sibling down below
if you are feeling adventurous with your
wallet make sure to check out
description for all the goodies thank
you very much all right not to
disappoint you this early in the video
but the Carbide 678C feels kind of
lazy and uninspired especially for the
price point and this is where this whole
pricing conversation comes into the
equation which is so important because
the competition at $200 is fierce right
now so I feel like this is just
mispriced because maybe it's $120 this
would be like you know a nice general
standard enclosure but it's $199
instead and if you do want a low noise
case definitely pass this one because
cooling performance is just not on par
to other cases that are cheaper and have
better cooling and also about the same
in terms of sign
now for $200 were you expecting an
aluminum brushed front panel maybe but
this is just plastic perhaps you were
expecting some non-generic sound
dampening material nope it's pretty
standard here perhaps you were expecting
some tasteful integrated lighting nope
everything is bare I do appreciate this
movable tempered glass side panel that
you can remove for easier installation
however the front panel can only open on
one side and that only 90 degrees and
unlike what's practical design cases
where it can actually swap the panel to
open from the other side depending on
the orientation of the case here you are
limited to its default orientation and
for those who care this is probably one
of the only cases in 2019 to have a five
and a quarter inch drive bay at the top
maybe for a blu-ray player or something
like that and it is removable if you
need the additional clearance at the top
for radiators or fans now the case comes
with three 140mm fans running at 1300
rpm one intake at the front one intake
at the top in the center right beside
the CPU cooler and one rear exhaust and
this is probably the first time ever
where I see the top fan mounted as
intake well you probably can guess why
this whole front element is yeah it's a
choking hazard so there are no
ventilation strips on the side of the
front panel and the only sort of gap you
have is at the bottom and that's not a
lot of air for the front intake and thus
you kind of rely on the top intake
instead to deliver some that fresh air
for the CPU cooler with the compromise
that your GPU gets quiet toasty and
speaking of the top we have a magnetic
dust filter up here and with plenty of
airflow options with up to 360 mm
radiator support for the top and at the
front but here's a little feature if you
want to make a toasty oven inside this
enclosure you simply close off that top
section with a plate the benefit of
course is it will you know lower the
noise level in this configuration as
your components die in their own heat
and your ports are fine and dandy with a
Type C Gen 2 dual USB threes power reset
and the combo headphone / microphone
jack there is a massive dust filter at
the bottom that you remove from the
front nice and convenient and as for the
interior is quite roomy and I do
appreciate the slightly depressed
motherboard tray so the rubber grommets
on the side are slightly angled which
makes cable routing slightly easier I
don't like the frame around the PCI
slots where they're not cut out but
instead you have to fit your
screwdrivers through the holes which can
make for a really inconvenient
installation of your graphics card the
power supply shroud is perforated in
multiple sections with a front cut out
for the radiator to fit through and for
storage we have these floating drive
caddies that will further restrict any
airflow trying to get your main
components and they do remind me of
another approach from another company
but I'll just be quiet they are secured
with thumb screws at the back and the
unfortunate thing is that we only have
two of these covers that go in place of
the hard drive cages so for example if
you remove them then those holes will
still be in the frame with nothing to
put in that space and of course I had to
remove them for better air flow but
there's nothing to cover them so any
cables and everything else will be
visible that is behind the frame so that
makes things here you're looking kind of
messy and at the back we have this
single SSD cage with three slots that
are spring-loaded so a complete the
tools design but I sometimes like to
route my cables around like the middle
SSD so I like to remove that and put my
cables there but because it's one single
piece you cannot do it unless you remove
the whole thing and there's also a fan
hub for six fans which is nice it is
SATA powered and you can plug in the pwm
cable into your motherboard for all that
RPM control and so having this overview
in mind what makes this case so special
for $200 you know you'd think maybe
fantastic cooling or perhaps the
quietest operation possible well neither
of those is the case and so looking in
the system temperatures were the fans
running at a thousand rpm so we can
compare that to the massif is-2 and the
Phanteks P600s you can see the
Corsair 678C it doesn't do
that great in terms of CPU and GPU
temperatures in comparison to the other
two cases and even when I maxed out the
fans to 1300 rpm the GPU is still quite
toasty and the CPUs are hotter versus
the massif is two and a fantex cases
which are running at slower rpm which
leads us to the noise performance and
yes the closed front panel definitely
delivers quieter operation at 1000 RPM
simply because there is no air flow
turbulence that you can hear but when
the front is open especially at 1300 rpm
that side noise profile has got quiet
loud and actually that is because of the
top fan and I'm gonna let you listen to
what the top fan sounds like at 1300 rpm
with the dust filter in place and it
removed because there's so much
turbulence happening with the dust
filter that it's actually generating
some noise that is unpleasant versus
when the filter is actually removed
and I'm going to have to reinforce my
point again that this is a mispriced
case $200 it does not deliver better
cooling it does not deliver quieter
operation versus something that is $50
cheaper and those cases are not even
designed for a silent operation like the
you know the massif is do for example
and so in conclusion the carbide 6 7 8 C
is uninspiring it's bland its overpriced
kind of disappointed all around but if
you've ever built yourself a quiet
system
what has your approach been like trying
to brute force air flow into it with
increasing rpm because of all these you
know restrictions or go the other route
of lowering rpm but in a completely like
open enclosure so there is no you know
turbulent noise for the airflow while
still giving you enough cooling but yeah
let me know what you think about this
enclosure in the comments
let's you know try to be civil while
this thing is quite disappointing I'm a

sure to check out this other relevant

see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
