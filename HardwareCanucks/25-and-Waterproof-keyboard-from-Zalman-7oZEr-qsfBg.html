kinetics and I'm Eber with hurricane X
so I have a question for you well for
you and for the audience what is the
first thing that comes to mind when you
think about a 25-dollar keyboard that is
targeted for gamers but is also
completely waterproof is that ridiculous
is it completely pointless is it cool
you know huge thanks to our computech
sponsors for sending us out here shout
out to nvidia phanteks NCIX and msi so
we visited zaman today and their
keyboard with a very strange name Eva
what is the keyboard name it is the Z
mk6 50 WP Wow WP stands for waterproof
so this is a pretty awesome product
despite its sort of the stigma that
surrounds it cheap waterproof gaming
keyboards you know with a ridiculous
name just like that so it's a membrane
keyboard with a plunger switch the
plunger switch alone and that's a
hilarious name to me like toilet plunger
mean come on seriously obviously the
name derives from its functionality and
so we were able to experience the
keyboard full submersion in water which
was actually pretty awesome you don't
just sprinkle some water to clean it you
fully submerge it they've done tests for
under a meter for 24 hours without any
damage on the keys the circuit board is
protected by some three layers of film
that you know doesn't allow any water to
go through you try to switch what do you
think of it and I can see the potential
of using this keyboard in medical fuels
and construction businesses so people
who are working in dusty environments I
think this keyboard would be a great
option and it's $25 so Zaman's
definitely targeting the affordable
price range the one thing that you guys
see on the screen now is when i was
typing this was the first time I
actually laid my hands into the water
the cool thing is the switches I
actually really like they were
responsive the bounce back was fast and
I did not make a single spelling mistake
while i was typing in the water and
there was a computer hooked up to it so
you can see exactly what was happening
with that keyboard I think that's pretty
awesome now when the keyboard is
merged and when you take it out there
are actually drainage sports at the
bottom which is pretty cool Simon also
had a few other keyboards lined up
product name is actually called the k900
m and it comes in four colors we have
black blue white and yellow the white
one looks really cool actually so these
keyboards are using kale switches so we
have kale black blue green and they're
RGB switches to which is awesome so the
lighting was actually pretty fantastic i
would say comparable to strafe you were
mentioning that's pretty good the
keyboard is driverless no software
required all the things that you require
to do and the function are on the
keyboard so the manual is pretty
extensive got to go ahead and read into
that all the macros are built into it
and also a very cool feature the
built-in speaker the built-in microphone
picks up any audio source in the space
so if you're talking the background or
if you have music playing the lighting
effects actually start reacting to the
audio source so that has been our Zelman
