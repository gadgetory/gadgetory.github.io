great technology selection and service
before the review we are giving one away
use the link in the description to sign
up for mass drop or leave a comment on
what we should review next from their
recent drops enjoy hello everyone this
is Dmitry with hardware conducts and the
key cool 87 rainbow Hero Edition must be
one of the weirdest keyboards that we've
reviewed here on the channel well
because of the shape or the switches but
because of the rainbow backlight with a
different color per row it is priced
south of 100 dollars can be found for as
low as 70 and so it would all depend on
your appetite for something this
different this is a TTL layout no numpad
on the side there and I have been using
the Nova touch TTL as my primary
keyboard for some time now just because
I love the switches so for me the
transition wasn't so drastic plus it's
an excellent format for gaming and
travel purposes if you think rubber pads
at the bottom stabilize the keyboard on
any surface plus rubber raisers and
angle it with the proper cable
management strip to route the cable for
either side or the center and my only
point of concern is the connection
itself some users have reported this to
be faulty upon arrival or has
deteriorated over time under the caps
key cool is using Cale switches we have
the brown switch here they have a fairly
good reputation but they're also known
to be found on more affordable keyboards
to keep the price attractive plus they
are compensating with this awesome key
cap design along the row color variants
each individual key cap is laser edged
around the perimeter aside from the
standard lettering this gives each key
that awesome illumination for extra
highlights I'm not surprised many people
have actually been requesting to get
just the key cap set as the rmx cherry
compatible even the space bar has the
perimeter edging and given the location
of the LED on the switch the brightness
gradient is visible and that's just
something you have to accept this is the
hero edition so five extra key caps are
included with Batman Robin
Superman Captain America
spider-man logos laser edged with
excellent detail and that with hero up
your setup when installed as for the
lighting itself I was hoping for a full
RGB spectrum given the rainbow in the
name but the color is locked on each row
and that's what creates the rainbow
effect you cannot change the color so
this different lighting scheme is a bit
polarizing I'm still undecided if I like
it but let us know what you think of
this color approach with a comment below
this is a driverless keyboard just plug
and play and there are a few effects
built in like a waveform shooting out
lighting from each press key that's for
typing can be a little hypnotic there's
a snake mode form left to right moving
down but it doesn't build on it so I
find it completely useless and the last
one highlights only press keys with
immediate cutoff and I would have liked
to see for this illumination to fade
slowly after the button was pressed
there is a fade effect on the keyboard
but that's disappointing you can clearly
see the brightness steps it's not at all
a uniform fade and using the arrows keys
here you can also adjust the brightness
using the function key in the numbers
line you can create custom lit areas for
five profiles that span numbers 2 to 6
using the function plus 1 to cycle
between these different profiles so for
example you can create one for gaming
one for editing one for typing and
whatever else you can do
functions plus 7 to adjust the
brightness of these profiles and
function + tilde to disable the keyboard
you can also disable the windows key
with a function + f12 that illuminates +
caps lock that also illuminates when
enabled there are media controls built
in into the top row along with some apps
and you can also enable either a six key
rollover with function + insert or a 24
key rollover with function + home now
there isn't one particular killer
feature on the key cool 87 hero rainbow
Edition but everything is tied in nicely
to the price with a good balance of
lighting customization and I really love
the key cap design different color perot
is something different but the fading
effect is poorly done and I was kind of
hope
for a little extra complexity with a
snake effect and some other built-in
features but other than that it is a
unique keyboard in an extremely
saturated market space and perhaps
that's exactly the charm of the key cool
87 hero that may ignite your interest in
it so thank you so much for checking out
