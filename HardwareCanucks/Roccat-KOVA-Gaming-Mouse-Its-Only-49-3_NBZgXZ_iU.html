great technology selection and service
if you have not yet found your favorite
Mouse gaming or otherwise I feel sorry
for you because right now we have so
many options in the market that it may
become exhausting and intimidating
trying to find the best one for you and
let's also not to get costly trying to
pick up so many ones and some don't work
and you can check out our top 5 gaming
mice video here to get your options
flowing but there's one market segment
within the mice category that I still
feel needs development and that's
ambidextrious mice I say that because
one ambidextrous mice favor - of course
left hand gamers and that's awesome and
- the symmetrical shape usually
accommodates for a more diverse grip
style and that's a positive and this is
why the new Roccat Cova 2016 is under
review today I feel it has a lot of
potential considering it's only fifty
dollars yet it carries all the right
features that would satisfy FBS and mold
by gaming the Cobra 2016 comes in white
and black frames although the white
Edition may feel completely out of place
as even Roccat doesn't carry
complimenting white peripherals but the
place you can customize the RGB lighting
with a glowing strip at the back and the
scroll wheel although the brightness is
pretty weak and invisible unless in a
very dark setting and you can see it
firing down an ambient array at the
surface which looks pretty awesome but
place it on a dark mouse mat and this
becomes pointless rocket recognizes the
need to tailor the weight for FPS and
mobile users thus the lightweight body
at 101 gram which is very well balanced
I would say and is the perfect ballpark
for my own personal use I don't have
anything negative to say about the
materials used as I understand the need
to keep things light the coating is fine
it's less grippy than I would like but
at 50 bucks it's totally possible so
let's talk about the shape now I love
certain aspects of the frame like the
small curve right below the side buttons
that houses my thumb perfectly well but
because the same curvature is present on
the other side I tend to position my
ring and pinky fingers right above this
second set of side buttons and
accidentally press them while in use the
good news though these buttons are
angled inwards to prevent those
accidental presses and I just have to
readjust my grip so my fingers are out
of the way you also notice how the frame
is in separate pieces where the thumb
sits I don't like this design decision
at all I like the shape of the curve but
you can feel where the two pieces meet
and it's not a smooth transition for
example my favorite ambidextrous mouse
is the Zoe F key one with a very smooth
body that is also flatter and that to me
feels better for my palm hybrid grip as
the top hump on the rocket Cova has a
larger slant but having said that though
it's still quite a comfortable design
the mouse feet offer really smooth glide
at the bottom and the buttons are
satisfactory
the primary left and right clicks are
surprisingly heavy for a mobile and FPS
Mouse that feel the heaviest compared to
my two daily drivers the logitech g502
and the my onyx caster here's a sound
sample
the scroll wheel is surprisingly good
despite having almost weak scroll steps
and very thin rubber layer on the wheel
but I found my scroll control was right
on point and the middle click is totally
usable in game the Cova also features
dual buttons beside the primary and the
way they're also kind of part of the
frame but also easily accessible by
either your point or middle fingers they
are easy to press without disturbing you
aim and have a satisfying amount of
travel distance with a soft finish they
are really good for quick events in
games like Meili or throwing stuff or
even sprint if you're tired of
constantly holding shift I would say
they are a great addition on the $50
Mouse especially once you find good use
to them and lastly the dpi chef behind
the scroll wheel is perfectly accessible
and you have up to 5 settings just no
visual indication when the DPI is
actually switched the last piece of the
hardware is the r6
optical sensor with dpi up to 3500 and
with the software boost up to 7000 I
find that totally acceptable as my
gaming dpi is between 800 and 1,200
anyway and the sensor shows a no
acceleration so you can flick away no
problem we have smooth tracking and
likely no strange behavior for the 2
weeks I used it as my daily driver the
only thing I'm disappointed with is the
manufacturer set liftoff distance which
cannot be changed by the user
I left my mouse a lot so having the
cursor jump around when the sensor is
close enough to the surface is really
annoying and I would love to have the
feature to adjust my liftoff distance or
at least calibrate the sensor for your
surface the braided cable is of nice
quality with the visible branding on the
USB cable for easier differentiation
when it's plugged in to your computer
overall I enjoyed my time with the Cova
in FPS sensor performed great once you
learn the resistance on the primary
buttons it feels natural and so now
let's talk about the rocket swarm you
have all the needed adjustments like
vertical speed tilt speed which is not
natively present on the scroll wheel but
can be remapped to tilt instead of
scroll then the
dpi settings and 50 DPI increments all
types of functions inside button
assignments plus the easy plus
functionality if you have a rocket
keyboard to enable double functionality
perky and the disappointing part is that
you cannot assign any of the unused
buttons on the mouse as the easy shift
plus enabler rendering secondary
functions useless unless you have a
rocket keyboard in the Advanced tab you
can set polling rates sound feedback for
switching dpi or profile and hand
orientation which is very nice and
finally the most basic illumination
settings you also have this talk effects
feature which is supposed to deliver
dynamic lighting on the mouse or any
other peripherals based on what's
happening on the screen but supported
games are nowhere to be found and it did
not work on any of my games in my
library and finally you have the swarm
Kinect which does not work with the Cova
because at the time of this review only
the NIF app is available in the Google
Play Store which is meant to give you
dpi color control your mouse and all
types of other sort of control from your
smartphone
it's a gimmicky and super buggy app and
so the takeaway for the Cova is this at
50 bucks it offers great sensor decent
ergonomics and quality buttons which the
most part are done well so well done
broke at however there are few major
drawbacks that would make you think hey
I may potentially spend 10 or 20 dollars
extra to get a competing Mouse that
offers that gives me a little bit extra
control with the sensor like the ability
to adjust liftoff distance which with a
Cova you cannot do the manufacturer set
liftoff distance is way too high so when
you place the mouse down the cursor
jumps up and down it's becoming a random
and you cannot really fully take control
of the performance of the sensor and
that's disappointing even though it's
$50 it still should have been there
especially with all the added value
features like the rocket swarm Kinect
and the talked effects that are
completely pointless and the second
thing is you cannot actually map the
easy shift plus functionality onto the
mouse itself so you cannot use any of
the secondary functions unless
you have a complimenting rocket keyboard
it is an Okie mouse but with
disappointing flaws that for $20 extra
you could spend on the competing Mouse
that will give you full control of the
sensor which i think is totally worth it
so that is it for this review I hope you
