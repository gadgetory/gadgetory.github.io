creating an ad spot for COO master for
their H 500 T enclosure so come along
this should be fun I just finished
building this machine so I have to clear
out the space so that I can have the H
500 p.m. here instead because I still
have to capture some b-roll for the case
for the ad spot so the premise for the
shoot is to have some creative freedom
as we have with other coolermaster ads
in the past outside the box thinking the
H 500 P is not perfect
but it's got some really unique features
and that's exactly what we're
highlighting in this ad today and by the
way we have reviewed the case so make
sure to check it out over here to get
the full picture on what this thing is
capable of the master of vast curve
gaming monitor is now available
measuring in 35 inches with 34 40 by
1440p resolution at 100 Hertz and free
sink support with nice stand that can do
portrait mode because why not so join
the drop with a link in the description
below to get your game on and so the
idea for this shoot is a little bit
challenging because I want this whole
space behind me cleared because I'm
gonna be sitting here with a nice tight
lens so that things behind me a little
bit out of focus but I want everything
to be perfectly white so it looks like
I'm in like very pristine studio with
the case on the little pedestal behind
me so that's the setup and this is my
situation and I got cleared out
so it's at times like these that I wish
that I had more room because it feels so
good to have all the space cleared out
because I usually just have it as you
what you just saw but you know obviously
all these boxes are spilling it out
outside of the office and just kind of
occupying the rest of my house
which is not very nice but at least I
have this room to work with now in the
office so I can set up my interview shot
let's get that do that let's do that now
all right so the only thing left to do
now is bring back the box for the atria
from your P case because I think I'm
like wanted in a background on the ad
plus the box is purple so perhaps I
tried to create this color and brand
recognition so that if you see this
color scheme anywhere else it might make
you think about color master maybe so it
is six o'clock right now here in the
evening which is not great in terms of
productivity but I had to wait until the
Sun was on the other side of the
building so that way I get this nice
soft light coming from the window
because I'm trying to create that soft
natural white pristine studio look
inside this space and I didn't want any
exterior light interfering with my
lighting situation and white balance
here because in the morning we get so
much light in the studio that is
difficult to achieve that pristine and
controlled lighting situation unless of
course it's like overcast and then it's
fine but today it's a beautiful day but
in terms of productivity and trying to
shoot this thing yeah I'm a bit set back
I think that should hold in case you're
wondering I am shooting the interview
portion with the g7 it's again Panasonic
and I love that whole system it's such a
fantastic be camera for like five
hundred bucks on sale it's a really good
deal and bmh has them on sale every
december which is how i acquired this
one it's such a good secondary camera in
case my th5 with gh4 died or something
like that and i'm shooting this right
now only GH 5 along with the rest of the
b-roll but for the interview let's do it
with the g7 near the chair now one tip I
can give you in terms of trying to focus
if you're doing this by yourself is to
always use some sort of object on where
you'll be with the eye level so right
now I've set up my shots so that my
camera is right there and I pre focus on
the microphone so that when I sit back
down and adjust the microphone to be in
a proper position away from the from the
shot but a really good distance for my
mouth I know that if I sit like this
I'll be in focus I don't have to touch
the camera anymore
just as long as I memorize the sort of
my posture for when I'm on camera and in
terms of lighting I change that up a bit
because instead of lighting up this
whole place in pure white I decide to
use my trusty LED lamp right here firing
into the case cream that nice shadow on
the wall and also highlighting that
exterior texture that we don't otherwise
see when this whole place is just pure
white and so now I just got to get the
interview portion done so I have my
voiceover script ready but I'm gonna try
to be talking to the camera even though
not a lot of the footage will be shown
on the final spot only the audio will be
used but when you try to interact with
the camera you're a little bit more
natural and how you speak your
intonation and all that so that you know
it seems less scripted and more like I'm
talking to you guys in the ad spot so
hopefully it all turn out well
all right so the interview portion is
complete I did multiple takes of each
sentence so that in case there's some
intonation variations I can piece
together the best voiceover so it sounds
more natural alright so there are two
things that I enjoy throughout this
entire process one is obviously the
production side of things of clearing
out the space and making sure that I can
produce something quality in such a
confined space that's always been a
challenge for me at harbor canucks
because I've used to shoot videos out of
my living room and needed to let's say
flip over on my couch so that I can get
the shots and you know it's it's a good
exercise and working with what you get
and number two is the whole idea
creation on how do we advertise this
product without misleading the audience
if you guys see in my review there is
some criticism that I am open about and
the community has been bashing
coolermaster for you know releasing
something that they're not agreeing with
or they do not expect so what we're
trying to do instead with this ad is
bring up those positives that are truly
unique to this case and therefore not
really you know barring any of the
negatives in there anywhere it's more
like talking about why this case is
unique instead of bashing it off why it
isn't something that people were
expecting it to be so what I got to do
now is mount the GPU vertically so you
can actually see how that looks inside
the case and not just me mentioning that
as a feature
and so now that this part is shot I
gotta bring all those boxes back with
their damn corner so that I can have
room in the apartment
now you guys are probably aware that I
am running a risin system and I've
decided to give this whole AMD thing is
shot with both the CPU and the GPU
coming from the red side with the arts
Freddy the most powerful card that I
have from the AMD side of things and Wow
really sucks for rendering in Adobe
Premiere which is why I'm just gonna pop
in my gtx 1070 back in there so that i
can get the benefit of better gaming and
also much faster performance in
rendering and my third favorite parts of
this whole process is the editing when
it all comes together the footage is
great and despite having that little
hiccup with the lighting it's good to
evolve it and change it up based on what
feels right so all the footage is on the
computer so it's time to edit
all right so the Edit for this odd spot
is finished but one thing I normally
don't talk about in reviews is the
actual disassembly process of like
taking out the hardware and like is it
simple is it difficult on all master
case cases it's very easy and this one
is no exception all right the last piece
of the puzzle time to pack it away I'm
gonna love me a nice case bag here I
have it totally fit in this bag
and the reason it's so handy is because
you just take it over it done and so
that concludes this episode on behind
them where you get to I see my thinking
and my production process so here's the
finished spot enjoy so it was kind of a
love at first sight you know there's
really nothing like this exterior I love
the metallic color the tinted glass
panel the RGB fans at the front it's
basically a see-through case and who
doesn't love that your graphics card can
go vertical the top is radiator friendly
and the right side is so unique when
exposed
thanks to these cable covers so you can
show off everything you've got with the
