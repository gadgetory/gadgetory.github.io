great technology selection and service
hey guys Eva here with Harbor Canucks
and if you're in the market for a gaming
keyboard and one mechanical switches be
prepared to pay the premium over the
last tactile membrane keyboards the
general consensus within the gaming
community is to go mechanical but there
are still uses we're cheaper membrane
alternatives are the way to go if
finances are tight the Challenger prime
is one of those examples from tte sports
that retails for $30 but brings a
surprising amount of features for such a
budget keyboard so to kick things off
the build quality of the Challenger
Prime is all right with decent plastic
housing there is a flex if forces
applied on the frame but seriously
that's almost an expectation for just
$30 the aggressive design of the frame
might be just what you're looking for
certainly a gaming centric design the
wrist rest is built into the keyboard so
you can detach it but the slightly
rubber bits on each side offer a
surprisingly comfortable typing
experience at the bottom we have anti
slip pads that do exactly that and
smaller razors to angle the keyboard
membrane keys do respond pretty well
with tactile registration travel
distance is short allowing fast rebound
and quick actuations it took me a while
to get used to the way they respond
since I use a mechanical keyboard as my
daily driver and throughout our testing
we've encountered no struck keys and
that's great news
anti-ghosting is limited to 6 to 8 keys
but primary gaming zone is covered with
WASD keys spacebar left shift and left
control for the keyboard layout there
are six programmable macro buttons on
the left side that are within reach on
the top there are three buttons to
switch between profiles and quite
useless buttons for my computer your
default mail client and browser here we
also find dedicated media controls which
is nice to see especially considering
this price point and there is a game
mode built-in that disables the windows
key the cable is weighted and it comes
with proper logo at the tip to help
differentiate between other cables nice
the challenger's lighting is something
that I fell in love with at first sight
the keys are not individually backlit
but ignoring that it is refreshing to
admire full backlit keys
a $30 product we have three colors blue
purple and red and the large knob in the
top Center adjust the brightness of the
backlit that gets surprisingly bright
and will reveal through even in well-lit
rooms the driver software looks very
clean with three different tabs and a
physical layer of the keyboard with
three different profiles to choose from
and the option to create load and save
the profiles are always welcome the
macro setting tab allows you to program
the six t keys on the left side of the
keyboard to your preference and the
advanced setting tabs help you adjust
the polling weight the response time and
the color of the LEDs and the brightness
so in conclusion the Challenger Prime is
an impressive budget gaming contender
with the looks to satisfy that gaming
appeal if you're into that the membrane
keys respond well the six programmable
macro buttons is a welcome feature plus
full backlit system is a bonus finally
the clean driver software rounds it up
for a substantial list of highlights and
all at the $30 price point as for build
quality you get what you pay for and in
my opinion Thermaltake could not have
designed a worst looking keyboard
seriously let us know in the comments if
this appeals to anyone but the looks
aside those with good tolerance levels
will find it extremely appealing for the
price and loaded features for gaming and
we would recommend the challenger prime
since it's the best budget gaming
keyboard out there that deserves the
harbor connects damn good value award as
