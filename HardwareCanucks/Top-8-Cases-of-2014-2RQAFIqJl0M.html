great technology selection and service
hello everyone i'm dmitri with Huracan
axe and welcome to another video so
another year has passed we've seen so
many awesome introductions into the
chasis market and now it's time to do or
to pick our top favorite cases of the
year but instead of choosing the top 5
cases you know isolating a certain
product to towards a certain spot
because you know everybody has their
different needs for different builds
I've decided to do this differently and
instead doing top 5 cases I've decided
to do top 5 cases within each category
so we're gonna break it down and to top
our best budget case best mini ITX case
best silent case best cube case and the
last category is your most common the
most versatile category so you know you
can you can pick this up for water
cooling storage gaming anything type of
case so the umbrella that covers pretty
much everything and that chassis would
be the most versatile for any type of
build but Before we jump into our top 5
cases within those categories I also
want to do some honorable mentions as we
did in our previous 2013 video because
those cases didn't exactly make it to
our top list
but they still should be considered
because they are entering a very risky
category but being different and being
very sort of niche towards a specific
type of Builder that you are and those
my cases I think should be still be
praised and still be considered now I'm
sure there are many worthy
considerations out there that do not
make it on our list but this is because
I want to be as objective as possible
with our top 5 picks and so we only
include cases that we've reviewed on the
channel I'm sure there's plenty of cases
that we haven't reviewed yet but feel
free to chime in in the comments below
of what you think would be worthy of
consideration for both us and the
viewers that are watching for to expand
the horizon of what is available there
in this chasis market and starting with
the first honorable mention this would
be the in win 901 this is one of those
niche cases that's built for the high
class with tempered
side panels full aluminum frame and a
much better internal layout then it's
bigger brother the 904 if you get the
cash to explore this micro-atx direction
I'm sure you'll have no choice but to
feel pleased BitFenix pandora deserves a
shout out they have some interesting
design choices both in the good and the
bad direction but one thing is for sure
they're ready to listen to community's
feedback and make changes accordingly
in short the Pandora sacrifices on
user-friendly design and cable
management to be thin but despite that
we're very eager to see the final
consumer release Corsair 380 T is one of
those portable cases that stands out
with the help of the hub bumblebee
yellow plus that convenient handle and
despite its larger size for just a mini
ITX system I'm sure there are many users
who would take advantage of its
limitations for a kickass mini ITX
machine and the last case on the
honorable mentions list would be the m2
evolve this is how you do aluminum for
the first time there are so many
positive features but it's not perfect
and fantex needs to redesign the
internal layout to be more accommodating
for extra drives but it's still a really
awesome attempt alright and with that
out of the way let's move on to the
highlights of the year first category
the best budget case goes to NZXT s340
at 69 bucks with sales as low as $50 so
there's black and white options
available if you can look past the
orange peel paint job you'd be surprised
at how well this case is built it's
pretty much full metal it's got a window
to showcase the interior capable air
flow for intake and exhaust and
innovative cable management bracket to
hide your cables and no compromises for
neither the GPU nor the power supply and
60 should have included drive caddies
for three-and-a-half inch drives and
also be careful not to touch the side
panel window as it scratches so easily
but the NZXT s340 is my choice for a
budget build the next category would be
cubed cases which particularly focus on
chamber separation I have actually two
cases for this one the first is coarser
air 2
it's a solid choice with much better
chamber separation than the original air
540 with direct airflow delivery at the
front and exhaust potential through the
top support for pretty much any
enthusiast GPU and outstanding cable
management that makes assembly a total
breeze it complements a 120 and 240
millimeter all-in-one coolers at the
front with enough storage capacity and
my only negative point would be the
fairly thin frame design but other than
that if you are looking for a cube style
case you still should consider the air
240 I would also highly recommend the
note 8 or 4 from fractal design now this
chassis is wider and is more water
cooling friendly and that would be the
main advantage of the air for
over-the-air 240 plus you gain all that
extra storage in the passive chamber
cable management is absolutely wonderful
given the large cutouts now also there's
a slim optical drive slot integrated
into the front panel so for those who
want that it is there you will have no
problem fitting in the most modern and
to z/os GPUs and either cube case will
satisfy your dual chamber cube build but
a nice category we're talking about the
best silent case now this one is a
little bit tricky because hands-down the
most silent case on the market right now
given you full proper procedures to make
it silent is fractal design defined r5
as long as you keep those top margins
covered you'll be fine and dandy it's
built very well and that front panel
design is outstanding to allow
appropriate front intake but keep the
noise out the interior drive cage is
modular and cable management is
definitely one of the easiest for a
chassis of this caliber rivaling the
definer 5 however is the h4 40 from n 60
that actually allows utilization of the
top fan slots without adding much noise
to the system because of that top cover
however it has more crammed internal
structure but without standing chamber
separation for managing in cable clutter
and also it has more color options so
the age of 40 and the define of 5 are
the two silent cases to buy
the second last category on the list is
a small form-factor PC for Mini ITX
builds and this with the previous
category there are also two contenders
here as well first the Silverstone rvz
or one this is an awesome little case
with long GPU support thanks to that
dedicated bracket that can also actually
house a slim optical drive everything
from excellent air flow and enough
storage potential inside the chassis
would make for one rewarding build you
have to follow a specific build process
to get everything set up but if you love
to look and have the use for such a
machine for either portable gaming or
editing the RB zero one is one of my
favorite mini ATX cases at the moment
now following suit within this category
is corsair 250d the main advantage here
is it utilized a larger size to
accommodate for a 240 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler on the side
with also an optical drive support there
are no limitations for the power supply
and long GPU support as well and being
part of the Obsidian family you do get
that conventional square and elegant
look with the brushed aluminum bits at
the front and finally onto the last
category for the most versatile the best
price to features ratio case that will
satisfy any type of build welcome the
fan talks and two pro not only does this
case bring most of the competition at
this price point to its knees but it
really has set a new benchmark of what
we can expect to see at 89 and $99 price
point the enter pro may not suit
everyone's taste with the external frame
but it's what on the inside that counts
anyone right but I love the open format
that's separated into chambers with the
removable power supply bracket that you
may use if you desire exclusive rear
access to the drives with plenty of
airflow options at the front and the top
and the bottom even if you can sacrifice
wanna drive cages and can also be within
the limits of power supply clearance
we've got a PWM fan hub at the back
along with a single SSD bracket to stash
away that one boot drive and everything
about the case just screams quality with
a solid frame
extremely modular interior that you can
actually even disassemble so huge props
for that implementation for modding or
repainting or etc the side panel is
probably one the only weaknesses in the
quality department as it scratches way
too easily but one thing is for sure
ever since the release of the end to pro
it really has kept the spot of the
chassis of the year and we would highly
recommend this to anyone looking to
upgrade or begin with a new build in the
new year so thank you so much for
checking out our top cases of 2014 video
we hope this was helpful to direct you
towards a chassis of your needs and your
interests but do you agree or disagree
with our top spot for the case of the
year for the fantex and to pro if you
don't please provide alternatives for
what you think could replace the m2 Pro
as the case of the year with the comment
