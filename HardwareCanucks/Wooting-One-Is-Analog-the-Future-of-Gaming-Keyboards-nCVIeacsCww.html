problem but should one
so today we're checking out the wooden
one it's my first analogue keyboard I'm
super excited to see how it plays out
because it's very unconventional and so
you may be wondering what is an analogue
keyboard while different precious
sensitivities on the key relate to
various increments of movement so a
light press would mean very slow motion
in game versus a complete press meaning
full speed like on the regular keyboard
now you can compare them to the analog
sticks on the Xbox controller or a
Playstation controller where the lateral
movement on the analog sticks gives you
that different intensity of motion
whereas on an analogue keyboard pressing
down delivers that same effect of
intensities of motion in game and so
this is where the woody 1 analog
keyboard comes in they raise over 450
percent on their Kickstarter project
which really shows that keyboard
enthusiast who are willing to pray the
price which you know it's an expensive
package for either the basic or the more
premium package it's in the market and
people wanted so let's check it out
right after this Wow is this yours it
sure is but how hue hue hue hue hue hue
hue it pays off to stay loyal
NZXT Hugh plots now available in black
or white lighting up my air RGB fans to
complement the crack and cooler all
inside the beautiful Monta ITX NZXT
bring all those colorful dreams together
test your own imagination links for
parts in the description below now you
may be wondering what up with the name
let's talk about the naming woods first
see what I did there all right so the
acronym stands for we owned the other
team there's also Duvall loot and it's
also an older slang word for saying like
being victorious and their logo matches
the branding very well of being the
crown of following that victorious theme
feature-wise I would say this like the
perfect gaming keyboard with the Tiki
allowed with media functions on the side
it's a super simple design with good
angle adjustment and there's rubber feet
in the bottom so the keyboard is not
going anywhere
with a very sturdy build and reinforced
interior which gives me pretty much no
flex but the keyboard is surprisingly
light and the top plate is SWAPO for
that extra character we have a removable
USB cable and appropriate channels for
routing I'll tow the cable is braided
and not in a nice way that causes almost
permanent kinks the key front is
beautiful with RGB illumination per key
that shines only through the key caps
and not much is reflected off that matte
surface and I don't like the texture of
the key caps because they stain too
easily
but there are plans to replace them with
double shot ABS or PV T key caps instead
and I really hope this happens soon
because this is an expensive keyboard
and it's priced this way because of the
switches so aside from having that
analog mode that means you're actuation
has become pressure sensitive depending
on how far down you press they are also
swappable with this really good puller
tool included and so you either have
this fully linear red flare tech
switches or the clicky blue flare tech
switches and you can also mix them up on
the board for your liking and they do
have that MX stem four key cap
replacement I love the feeling of the
red variant they're super smooth with
excellent rebalance and require only 55
grams of force for actuation I'll tow
for me they feel a little bit lighter
than 55 grams for some reason I would
say they're more similar to like MX
speed switches versus MX Reds on how
feel while the blue switches have that
distinct click point at one point eight
millimeters and they feel significantly
lighter versus the MX blues and to me
that's a good thing and because these
are infrared switches you can actually
set the actuation point on where the
keyed registered so from anywhere from
1.5 millimeters to three point six
millimeters with four millimeters of
total travel distance and this is really
cool because if you like to bottom out
while typing increase that actuation
distance to three point six or maximum
or if you want to be very speedy put
that to one point five and in my
experience both actuation distances they
deliver very different so call most
having two keyboards at one spot but you
know it's all software based because of
that infrared switch now the blue flare
text which has a unique property in that
the actual clicking this happens at one
point eight millimeters but the
actuation point could be set to one
point five so you could theoretically
activate the switch without activating
the click first so the analog mode it's
clearly why this keyboard is so special
so it's recognized both as a keyboard as
a joystick and as a controller so I was
very excited about trying out this new
technique from motion so don't just fool
on a speed running but having that
almost precise control and how fast you
move based on how far down you press on
the key now the problem for me is really
the finger memory and how much you have
to press in order to achieve a certain
speed and you know don't be fully boring
out but having that a lot more control
and interacting with the keyboard is
just totally a different experience now
when this pressure sensitivity is at
play and the analog range is actually
quite short at only two millimeters so
you have to really train your fingers on
how far you have to press in order to
achieve a certain speed because
otherwise your mind is almost
concentrating on how far down you have
to press instead of being sort of
engaged in the game and we as gamers
already so accustomed to fully bottoming
out that having too
really little bit a little bit that
having to almost relearn how to play on
the keyboard is just plus the majority
of games already have the walk key
bindings anyway so I don't see the value
of trying to figure out slightly
different motion based on how much you
press in between walk and run and it's
actually very difficult to master
so it kind of counteracts the positives
of being able to move differently for
FPS games I would say it's completely
pointless even especially if you're
trying to stray from a corner and try to
see if there's anything happening it's
more effective for you to strafe
normally back and forth in order to
visualize something that's there instead
of trying to slowly creep out from
within that corner in order to see your
enemy and battle want for example
walking is not built into the game so
perhaps the developers didn't want the
pace to change but now with this
keyboard you are adding there's
different level of mechanic to your to
your pace but it doesn't fit the game
and there are many many other titles
like it where simply walking slower it
doesn't make any difference because the
game is not really designed for that for
driving games it's a totally different
story when you have a lot more control
about how fast you brake how fast you
accelerate and how fast you turn so it's
not simply just turning it this way you
have a lot smoother sort of motions and
in that sense the winning one and the
analogue switch really helps
and to switch between digital and analog
modes we have a mode button along with a
function and arrow keys to choose
between your three analog profiles so I
just discovered the downfall of this
being a three-in-one
a keyboard the joystick and the
controller so right now I'm in the
analog mode but the computer is still
detecting all the keyboard inputs and
that's you know that's fine that's how
it should be in case you want to do some
chat stuff and whatever and like
interact with the rest of the keys
that's fine but as soon as I hit one of
the keys that are mapped to the
controller look what happens a second
player showed up so the system is
thinking that there's a second player
with the controller and another player
with a keyboard
all right so interestingly this bug with
rocket League of in detecting the
keyboard and the controller at the same
time it's just a bug in the rocket
League all you have to do is either
restart the game or stop the computer or
reply the keyboard so everything's back
to normal now and I can use my wast keys
and they'll be registered
it'll be sorry recognized as analog
inputs instead of digital and I remap
digital to something else completely on
the keyboard so that they are not used
when I play the game and so now I have
very fine control and how I maneuver my
my car inside the game so I can either
have very precise acceleration or
deceleration and but most importantly
the little turns and just a smoother
rotation on my car will help in game for
sure and so for pretty much any game
that uses was you have to remap it to
something else that is not your wast
keys so you can use these wast keys for
your analog inputs instead but you know
this analog mode it's not entirely
pointless if you get good but I've been
trying it out in fps and it doesn't
really fit my style plus the amount of
customization that's available in the
utility and game settings as well may be
a big deterrent if you don't have the
patience for trial and error and to like
see what settings fits you best and
while not really abundant it's really
cool how you can load particular game
profiles that the community members
create and in woulding also created
Trello that you can follow the steps in
terms of the development of the software
and you can even give them suggestions
and see if they take your suggestions
moving forward now currently you cannot
name the profiles and you can
and anymore but they are working on
expanding that to infinity and also
obviously renaming the profiles on the
analogue side so that you know exactly
what you get into and their approach to
macro customization is kind of next
level so they're using that analog
arrange to create two functions per key
so depending on the how far down you
press that particular function will be
registered then you courser avoid pro
gaming headset is comfortable stylish in
different colors delivers fantastic
wireless performance even for
competitive gaming with an all-new
microphone for clear communications
check out the void Pro wireless or wired
in the description below and so that's
my experience with the woulding one it
definitely been an interesting way to
experience sort of new way of
interacting with a keyboard something
that I haven't really felt in the past
and to bring back that initial point I
mentioned about this being not a
finished product so if you would like to
be part of the development process then
maybe perhaps you know look into this if
you're a keyboard enthusiast and when
the experiment with the analog
situational stuff in games might be cool
it might be cool of course it's a really
expensive product as well especially of
being still sort of in development
process so you decide if it's worth it
to you and let me know if it is in the
comments below
and so thank you so much for watching
make sure to check out these other ellen
