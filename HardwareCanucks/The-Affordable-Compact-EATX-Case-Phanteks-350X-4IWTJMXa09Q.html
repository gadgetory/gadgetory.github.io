disappoints when it comes to releasing
of new cases with really specific and
excellent price points so today we're
gonna talk about that idea what's up
guys so fantex never disappoints when it
comes to cases and they had really
particular price points that they're
that feel excellent and really just fits
within the target audience and they
never overstep their own toes so the
case we'll be talking about today is the
P 350 X by the way huge thanks to our
sponsors by the way huge thanks to our
sponsors by the way huge thanks to our
sponsors for making this trip possible
famed X Corsair and Coolermaster boom
okay so this is the fan Tech's Eclipse
p3 50 X it's a $69 metal enclosure that
slides right in between the P 300 and
the P 400 so they're full lineup
saturates any perspective builder in
that 59 to 69 to $79 price points the
350 X structurally is quite similar to
the P 300 and that the tempered glass
only covers the main motherboard
interior area and the power supply
chamber is part of the frame and I love
the visual diversity this delivers plus
it allows fan --tx to experiment with
different lighting options like this
ambient strip running across the entire
depth of the case they've also added
these dual strips at the front that is a
bit unusual for fan textile but they're
beautifully integrated with ambient
spill and no obnoxious color effects
either just proper color movement high
twice it's the same as the P 300 so it's
nice and compact but they have added the
depth so it can accommodate dual 120 or
140 member of fans up top that are
covered with a dust filter by the way
and this also expands the area for GPUs
and front radiator combos also the front
mesh has expanded significantly allowing
for much better airflow because of that
side ventilation and extra depth from
the front panel the IO is basic with
just 2 USB 3 ports but the 2 buttons
control your lighting effects and color
for the 2 zones of the case the drive
cage is still hidden behind the front
panel just like on the P 300 and we have
same cable management bracket but it is
longer to accommodate the extra depth of
the case and you can install 240 or 280
millimeter radiators at the front and
the area underneath the motherboard is
open for cable pass-through and I'm sure
the whole assembly process will be
totally simple and enjoyable and the 350
X exists for those who want a slightly
deeper enclosure but want to remain
within a good budget and features
another cool introduction are the P 300
special edition releases and black red
and white
so the interior is fully colored in that
accented color and I would have
appreciated slight color accents instead
but these are the same price as the
original at $59 which is awesome and
finally they're launching in addressable
digital RGB controller hubs so you can
have the best color possible and more
control of each LED on the channel so
for example connecting the Halos fans
frames or routing any LED strip into the
hub that will then connect to the
motherboards addressable connector
alright so that's it for the P 350 X let
us know what you guys think about it
I think the $69 price point is just
perfect and it fits between the P 300
and the P 400 TG and I love the the
continuty of this whole Eclipse series
so let me know what you think of it in
the comments below thanks much for
watching make sure to check out other
relevant content from CES and we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
