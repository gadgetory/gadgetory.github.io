hardware connects and our CES 2019
coverage continues with some awesome
looking graphics cards from MSI but
first a quick shout-out from our
sponsors MSI fantex Corsair thermaltake
and razer without them our attendance at
the show would not have been possible
all right so let's start off with the RT
X xx atti Lightning Z because this is
one of the craziest graphics card we've
ever encountered ever since it was first
released the Lightning series have been
one of the fastest most overclockable
and extreme lineup of graphics cards
available while its official specs will
be released a bit later this month
there's a ton of stuff we learned while
visiting MSI let's start with the
exterior because it jumps out right away
the triple slaw heatsink shroud is a mix
of gold and carbon fiber meanwhile MSI
also added an OLED screen on the side
so that it can be controlled in MSI's
mystic lighting software that's the
interesting addition which could really
give your extreme PC build a touch of
personalization but I have to wonder if
the display output can be flipped in the
software for people who use inverted
motherboard layouts
unlike some other OLED screens on
components like a Souza's new a iOS this
one is monochrome so you won't be able
to add colored logos under that shroud
is a huge cooler with eight heat pipes
and more than enough capacity to keep
the overclocked RTX 28 core from
throttling I didn't quite like the RGB
LED effects on the fans but that's just
my personal opinion that huge amount of
cooling will be needed since Emma sighs
hoping they'll be able to provide a
somewhat unlocked v bios that would
allow the lightning Z to exceed envious
stock voltage and power limits honestly
though if Emma site can't pass those
limits lightning Z could be a very tough
sell especially since its price is
expected to be around $2,000 moving on
with our little tour there's also
voltage read points integrated into the
PCB that will come in handy for
overclockers supposedly the card is
built to provide up to 600 watts of
power since the r-tx 20 atti can consume
over 500 watts when over volton
that's just nuts guys and it means that
this card has three eight pin power
connectors that's right
three eight pin power connectors
meanwhile the backplate is pretty
interesting too since it also uses
carbon fiber and there's another heat
pipe which passes
with all these features and such a
massive heat sink the r-tx 2080 TN
lightning Z weighs a ton
so MSI's including an anti sag bracket
that attaches to your cases io slots so
a single lightning will take up five
slots and that could make installing a
bit challenging there were also to our
TX 2060 cars on display and they'll be
available to buying on January the 15th
make sure you watch our full review of
the our TX 2060 right over here okay so
let's start off with the Ventus OC since
it will retail for about the same price
around $350 as invidious founders
edition from a specs standpoint the OC
in the name doesn't amount to much since
it boosts clocks hit seventeen ten
megahertz instead of sixteen 80
megahertz on the referenced version that
won't give you any extra performance for
cooling the Ventus has a pair of MSI
Torx fans direct contact heat pumps on
the cooler and a great looking back
plate nice thing about this card is that
it doesn't have any hard gb so if you're
going for a stealth build this could be
a great addition that doesn't cost more
than the founders edition movie on to
the higher-end r-tx 2016 gaming Z and
honestly this card looks amazing with
MSI's tomahawk series motherboards it
will cost about $25 more than the
Aventis card but it also comes with a
boost clock of 1830 megahertz which is
115 mega Hertz higher than the reference
spec and that should get you some
in-game performance gains even though
that this card features more stealth
black and gray color MSI has added a few
RGB touches but nothing crazy like some
other GPUs on the market it also gets
the full Twin Frozr seven heatsink
design with the Torx 3 fans and the
ability to completely turn off the fans
when in idle mode so there you guys have
it what do you think of the Lightning Z
we all know that the RT X 2080 is
already super expensive but would you
pay even more for a GPU like this I
really hope that MSI can get an unlocked
BIOS for its overclocking won't be an
issue but anyways
stay tuned for more coverage from CES
2019 I'm Igor with hurricane X signing
off and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
