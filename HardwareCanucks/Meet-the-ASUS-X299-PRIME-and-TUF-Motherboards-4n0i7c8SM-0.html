motherboards are launching because our
skyline X platform that is launching in
only a few weeks and a suits of course
have to show off their rog editions and
also legendary tough ports and more
mainstream prime models too so let's
take a few minutes to look at those
model boards that don't fit into the rog
series but first a message from our
sponsors our coffee leg strip is brought
to you by fantex
schoolmaster and msi i know we usually
start off with a higher end but the most
interesting motherboard is actually the
prime x2 99 - eh honestly this
motherboard looks great while still
keeping internal features and many will
gravitate towards the - a since it is
supposed to be very affordable and like
more expensive motherboards it supports
up to three-way graphics configuration
across a trio of x16 slots you can add
vrock arrays via the optional add-on
cards from Asus but only if the two
onboard and the two slots are not enough
remember a seuss allows you to use
onboard and the two slots for vrock so
that will only come in handy if you're
setting up a simple to drive raid arrays
and even if the understated looks aren't
enough for you there are still plenty of
integrated LEDs and LED headers to put
out more than enough RGB illumination
there's nothing left out on the
continuity front with USB 3.1 gen2
internal header for the chasis front io
that supports the new 10 gigabits per
second standard plus type a and
reversible type-c ports at the rear so
if you're looking for a simple and
affordable X 299 board this may be a
perfect fit but what happens if that's
not enough well asus has a big daddy the
X 299 deluxe this is the board which has
everything and leaves nothing else on
the table it will also be one of the
most expensive motherboards in the ex
299 lineup it looks stunning with an
extensive heatsink shroud which keeps
with the usual white and black color
scheme the chips of heatsink also houses
the old new life - which is an
integrated OLED screen
capable of displaying valuable system
information and custom graphics and you
can see vital stats like temperature
frequency and fan speed without out
tabbing away from your games and when in
full screen live - can also display text
messages and graphics animations to set
your rig apart from the rest however I
do think that will only be useful for
people who use a window on their case or
the
and have a graphics card in that slot
that would cover this from the view on a
storage front everything is covered well
when they use a 2 port and dual m dot 2
slots
those two slots are pretty interesting
since one is covered with a chips and
heatsink for optimal temperatures while
the other is all the way up near the
memory slot and mounted vertically this
may sound like an odd and potentially
dangerous location but it's supposed to
help reduce the drive temperatures by
allowing for better cooling from the
system fans as usual the deluxe gets a
whole lot of RGB features with
integrated lighting zones and or a sink
but a soos is stepping things up with
next-generation LED support so this
board is compatible with upcoming
addressable lighting strips that offer
independent control over each LED on the
line which enables considerably more
advanced effect of course those RGB
headers are also able to power regular
strips as well
a Seussian integrated the next
generation dual band wireless at 8'o
2011 ad module which can theoretically
work up to four point six gigabits per
second and there are even adding cards
for thunderbolt ex3 and fan extension
included and the next boards are the
tough series let's start with the mark 1
the asustor series has a lot of history
behind it with good reason these
motherboards are built with very best
components and are then stress tested
for countless hours before making their
way to clients attacked by the board may
not be as feature-rich as prime series
board or the ROG board but those things
are replaced with longevity don't expect
the ton of RGB lining here guys this is
all about making a rugged stealthy
motherboard the latest board in this
range is the X 299 tough mark 1 and it
looks quite a bit different than its
predecessors since asus has designed a
new reinforced armor that covers most of
the PCB supposedly this protective cover
streamlines airflow from a dedicated fan
over the board and helps to
significantly reduce and the two
temperatures and prevents dust from
accumulating in nooks and crannies
there's even a backplate that's made a
fold of metal for reinforcement against
warping and included GPU holder that
supports heavy graphics cards and like
other products in the tough line up the
mark one has a ton of additional
temperature sensors to monitor different
zones on the motherboard and in your
system as a whole
tough detective is back in game 2 this
is a smartphone power troubleshooter and
monitoring utility was pretty good when
we first tested it but at this time it
doesn't
a USB connection rather all the items
are monitored wirelessly over Bluetooth
using the included USB adapter and if
you don't want to spend the premium
being charged on the mark one ASIS is
now launching the task mark two which
looks a lot like the prime X $2.99 a
basically it offers all the tough
upgrades in terms of components but
remove the extensive heatsink and goes
with a bit more stealthy look so if
you're looking for a good blend of
features and the motherboard that has
been tested to the max this one might be
a good option - and so that wraps our
coverage on Asus x2 99 offerings at
Computex remember all of these boards
will become available in the next few
weeks so stay tuned for our full reviews
on them until then keep watching don't
forget to subscribe for more coverage of
Computex and we'll see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
