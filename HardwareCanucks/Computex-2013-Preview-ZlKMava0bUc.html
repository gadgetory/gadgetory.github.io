so hey guys we are actually in taipei
i'm here with sam i was a very long 20
hour flight away all the way from
Toronto but seems like we are well I am
recharge than the big day tomorrow minus
one to the big show on Tuesday but this
is Sam finally get to meet the guy who
does all our news and post like that so
Sam what are your anticipations for the
show how you feel about it what are we
to see at computex 2013 we're looking
for a cpu showdown because in one corner
will have AMD with to mash and another
quarter will have Intel with pass well I
mean both are going for the low-power
mobile systems which is where the growth
is right because Intel they own the
high-powered x86 sector right at the
same time though it's not growing I mean
you can have these fast chips without
the growth there you've got no money
coming in so we're going to both see
we're going to see both companies going
for mid-range milk powered ships to
power the next generation of tablets of
smartphones and that kind of stuff right
what about gear tell me earlier excited
about Thunderbolt do you want to talk
about that yeah so last year from the
boat came out on pc Thunderbolt was also
on Mac at first with the new macbook
pros and imacs but we saw last year the
coming-out party thunderbolts on the pc
platform now the question is has it be
successful I mean can it compete against
the USB 3 USB 3 is you know well used
with with cameras with hard drives so
it's got that market down pat can intel
thunderbolt come out and take it away so
talking about Windows 8 I know windows 8
made its first appearance in computex
and 2011 so moving two years forward
where are we expecting to see with
Windows 8 what's the progression what's
the
anticipation so when those day was
supposed to be a hardware agnostic OS
right having those eights on the pc
platform on the mobile platform on the
tablet platform the problem is though
it's done well and PC somewhat you could
say but on the mobile side of things on
tablets and smartphones hasn't taken off
the windows service was a great platform
a great tablets the problem is though it
hasn't sold it's the question is fast
forward two years if I was 2013 Windows
8 is out it's mature OS now what will a
next-gen bring us we have better devices
by their tablets better smartphones
within those phone will really have
second-rate yoga devices that can't come
close to talk to your Android or iOS
devices right and we are we hear that
asus has something new to bring to the
table perhaps like a smaller tablet that
features windows 8 so very excited to
check that out will compete actually
become more or less a tablet and
smartphone show I mean there's always a
market for great motherboards I great
cases all that kind of stuff the problem
is though the growth is not in
motherboards I mean I love gigabytes I
love all these manufacturers but they
aren't growing yeah we see growth from a
soups we see growth from a stir because
they have a solid platform for tablet
applets and then pushing forward with
that because they realizing that that's
where the market is they there's there's
some enthusiasts who really want the
best motherboards and the best cases and
all but really the market isn't there
there so there it's it's a good thing to
see companies reach out for those
markets and they're here they're
realizing that the market is elsewhere
and they're tapping into that I think
the
big the bose this show will be the
eighth inch tablet or 7-inch tablets
with the nexus 7 it really pioneered
that form factor people don't want the
10 inch tablet sluggish tablet they want
that smaller 7-inch device and so all
these manufacturers will probably have
this show the next gen of their 7-inch
devices running perhaps on the Tegra 4
platform or the new Snapdragon platform
or heck even Intel's Atom platform and
so the next thing is aimed ease come
back I mean they were in a tough
position on the market share and so
we've seen that my main thesis actually
reached out and you know emerged from
the clouds really with some great
products and so what do you would he see
him these heading towards I see a head
towards Redemption look Rory readers
Te'o's Messiah he inherited the company
that was plagued with problems it lost
his bet staff it lays off its best you
know VP's and engineers yeah I know his
brother come the back you know it's not
uh it's making money it's still in lots
of debts but they have a very solid
lineup of mobile chips based on the new
Jaguar core so I'm looking to see all
these new AMD chips coming out in the
next gen of the notebooks of tablets
that current stuff right and so yeah
we're get a lot of that lined up for the
show which starts on jun 3rd tomorrow is
the pre-show so minus one will get to
see what's going to happen at computex
2013 but you guys stick around for the
main show starting june third and we'll
see you guys back here at hydro canucks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
