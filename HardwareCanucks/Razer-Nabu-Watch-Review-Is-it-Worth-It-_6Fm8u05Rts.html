they started out by providing a
notification platform for messages
emails missed calls and other simple
tasks and over the time they gradually
became even smarter with added
functionality to the point where simple
wrist-mounted devices could drive your
digital lifestyle and even talk
abilities of a SmartWatch have changed
over time the core essence of what this
thing's supposed to do has remained
constant and while we do have multiple
of smartwatches on the market right now
there are only a few ones that offer a
truly unique experience and today we
have something very different from Razer
let's check it out
meet the Razer Nambu watch this is
razors answer to the competition kind of
you see this thing is priced at $149 and
that price point is not even close to
Motorola Samsung Huawei and even apples
offerings and the razor is rather
approaching the number watch as a
regular watch that's smarter and that's
really interesting let's just start with
the design
at first glance anyone down the street
would think this is a G Shock and I
wouldn't agree with them its form is a
perfect throw back to the watches of the
past rather than the sleek designs that
other smart watches have taking a closer
look at it you find these green accents
around the body including the primary
four side buttons which brings the
Frasers design language into things the
outer shell is coated with a soft touch
rubber surface that feels solid but is
definitely prone to scratches from you
know occasional bumps and stuff the
watch display though remains scratch
free but cleaning the surface of the
display especially around the frame
protrusions remains a challenge razor
has equipped this with five ATM
water-resistant rating that over my
testing seem to hold up pretty well
there are magnetic pins for charging in
the bottom and while this may seem like
a surefire way to short out the charging
mechanism with sweat and any other water
that may get through there I did not
experience any problems after weeks of
intense workouts speaking of charging
the Naboo uses a proprietary USB based
magnetic
nectar to navigate the digital
chronograph you have four side buttons
with proper grip and a home button at
the top of the watch that activates the
smart module that I'll get to shortly
razer also sells a forced edition of the
number watch that features Machin
stainless steel buttons and a more
robust built for added durability and
that will set you back $200 so a $50
premium it was a comfortable experience
wearing the Nambu watch the dual clasps
do a great job holding the wristband in
place and I can guarantee you'll be fine
wearing the unit for the whole day no
problem and it's actually lighter then
it first appears to be the digital
chronograph who is pretty
straightforward the center matrix
display shows the time including the
seconds counting the top display shows
the date along with a day letter and a
Bluetooth indicator to notify you if the
naboo watch is paired to your phone as I
pointed out earlier there are four
buttons so two on each side of the watch
that can be used to navigate through the
chronograph the mode button cycles
through different modes like stopwatch
alarm timer and world time depending on
which time zone you have set up through
the app the adjust and set buttons are
basic and the light button lights up the
display for about eight seconds until it
fades out nicely and fortunately the
brightness of the chronograph is
actually uncomfortably low which
requires you to power up the light even
in darker settings and I also find the
font of the numbers to be kind of
difficult to read quickly I would love
the ability to swap the side buttons as
wearing the watch on my left hand means
accessing the light button is extremely
uncomfortable while having perfect reach
to that adjust button now let's talk
about this smart feature of the naboo
watch this is a 128 by 16 OLED display
and is essentially where the most of the
magic happens
since it's used for notifications it
also remains off until you bring the
watch upward to view it which saves
battery power the essence of all this
smart functionality truly lies in the
Nambu app available for both Android and
iOS and once the app is fired up you
have to set up an account with razer add
the number watch in the
app and follow-up the rest of the
process for installation you need to
have Bluetooth and location services
enabled for your smartphone to
communicate with the watch and the app
has a ton of customization so bear with
me
the details tab lets you check the
status of the number watch along with
battery life the option to update the
firmware and remove the device
completely from the app the notification
tab has a do not disturb mode which can
only be accessed through that app select
the apps that you would like to get
notified with then set the type of
vibration strength which regardless of
the setting is disappointingly weak and
then you can set the scrolling speed of
the ratification and choose which action
to dismiss those notifications the
activities tablet to turn on and off
these options plus you can rearrange
them to your preferred sequence which is
pretty awesome plus there is also a
phone remote control option that you can
set depending on your preference again
and this can be activated with the main
home button that's on top of the Naboo
watch the display tab is where you can
set clock style screen brightness screen
timeout set the wrist placement enable
wegg gesture and set what to display
when you look at the watch and as you
can see I've set it to display the time
because both the font and the brightness
of the chronal display is just very
difficult to read quickly while the
secondary display at the bottom is much
more visibly accessible moving on to the
watch setting you can sync the watch
time with your phone or you can set it
to manually the world time option can be
set here as well with any time zone
depending on your preference and finally
you have the option to toggle the watch
to chime every hour which is a little
bit weird and the best part is that once
these settings are adjusted it reflects
on the naboo watch almost immediately
which is very much appreciated you can
turn on sleep tracking manage alarms
directly within the app rather than
setting it off the watch and you have
three of them which is great then we
have sleep tracking feature which
measures movement during your sleep so
you can visualize your night rest but
the watch is isn't actually smart enough
to enable do not disturb mode during
night time so it results in annoying
vibrations on your
list because of incoming notifications
so you have to manually go in and enable
do not disturb if you want to actually
use the sleep tracking feature and not
be disturbed by all the vibrations the
number watch also acts as a fitness
tracker it's nothing too advanced like
the adidas fit smart that we reviewed
recently but it tracks things like your
daily steps distance traveled calories
burned how active you are and how well
you've slept and so in this respect it
did extremely well
though the watch is a bit bulky when
compared to other fitness trackers I did
not see any inaccuracies or huge
discrepancies and testing so it looks
like Razer covered their faces well here
so what was it like using the naboo
watch and I gotta admit it was a
pleasing experience overall
sure it's not as competitive or
feature-rich as a motor 360 or an Apple
watch but I feel that Razer did a
fantastic job implementing that smart
module into the naboo I get
notifications instantly and this
includes text messages phone calls
reminders Twitter mentions and even get
an update on my uber ride and the list
continues as there are plenty of
applications to choose from within the
naboo app the battery life was as
advertised the regular digital
chronograph is set to last for about
twelve months while the smart module
dies within the week and it can be
charged via that proprietary magnetic
USB cable and it charges fairly quickly
and that's right in line for an OLED
screen to last that long and apart from
all the notifications you get on a day
to day basis I'm pretty satisfied with
the end result the one thing that really
seems to be missing here is any type of
integrations for gamers and remember
that razor bills themselves as a company
that designs their product for gamers
but the Naboo app and watch don't really
include any integration or unique gaming
oriented features especially since this
is a wearable for gamers it literally
says that on the Naboo watch page it
would have been kind of cool to be able
to match the display color with you
other Razer peripherals if this thing
was RGB you know maybe show some gaming
statistics or have the watch display
your hardware temperatures which would
all be really kind of
Niq but they're not included and
hopefully razer will roll out with
things like this in the future and so I
feel like Razer has created a very
affordable answer to the SmartWatch
competition with the Nambu watch the
design language is not for everyone but
the smart module works as its supposed
to despite that tiny notification screen
the complimenting app is definitely okay
it's got plenty of features built in and
the battery life has been excellent
throughout our testing I just wish there
would have been a bit more focus on
including something for gamers since
this is a wearable for gamer so what do
you guys think about the Razer never
watch does it satisfy your criteria of
what a semi Smart Watch would deliver it
has some limitations and because it's
Razer this is going to be a heated
discussion in the comments down below I
can already feel it everybody's all the
keyboard warriors are coming out but I
totally understand your concerns given
its limitations for this semi SmartWatch
but leaving I'll leave your thoughts
