connects guide on how to build your very
own custom PC now whether you're
building from the ground up or you just
want to do a few hardware upgrades this
episode hopefully should help you do
that now we've split it up into a whole
bunch of very simple to follow steps so
you can either select any one of those
in the next frame or you can watch the
video in its entirety and soon you'll be
turning this into well hopefully one of
these hope you enjoy the tutorial now
before we get started there's a few
tools that you may want to have handy
you will need a Phillips head
screwdriver if you want to keep your
cabling clean some cable ties aren't a
bad idea and also an anti-static wrist
strap or anti-static glove probably
isn't a bad move or just be smart and
make sure that you ground yourself on a
piece of metal before handling any
electronics and you probably don't want
to do this on carpet
first we're going to go over one of the
more delicate operations of building
your PC and that is installing the CPU
on to the motherboard now I generally
recommend to do this outside of the case
because you have more of to work with
and it also makes it much easier to
install the heatsink now to actually
install our CPU will be undoing the
lever on the side opening up the metal
retention bracket and then be very
careful to remove the plastic cover over
the CPU pins do not touch those as they
can very easily be damaged now if you
take a close look at the CPU what you'll
notice is two notches up on one end of
the CPU as well as a triangle in one of
the bottom corners now if you move over
to the CPU socket you'll notice that
there's two posts that correlate to the
same area as the notches on the CPU as
well as in one of the corners there'll
be a little dot or an arrow that matches
up with the arrow on the CPU just so
long as you make sure that the arrows
and the notches match up you're
installing your CPU correctly now we'll
put our retention bracket back down and
take our lever there will be a bit of
resistance but provided you installed
your CPU correctly there may be any
damage push this down and underneath the
clip for part two or installing the
heatsink and fan which if you're lucky
already has thermal paste on the bottom
however if it doesn't you're going to
need to bring some of your own and we
just want to put a little drop a little
smaller than a pea-sized on the top of
the CPU depending if you're using a
larger CPU or not that is all you need
and then just make sure that the tabs
are situated to the back and clamps go
into the four holes all around the CPU
socket make sure that it's secure on the
bottom and just press these tabs down
and that's all there is to it so that's
how you do an intel system but what if
you're doing an AMD build just like
Intel AMD has an arrow on one of the
bottom four corners of the CPU this will
match up with an arrow on the CPU socket
and the CPU should drop right in without
any force the heatsink will fit on only
one of two ways just make sure that your
heatsink clamps fit up with the notches
on the CPU retention bracket and then
push down the lever
so while we have the motherboard out of
the case let's go on to how to install
your memory what you'll notice is at the
bottom of the memory stick there is a
notch that's slightly off-center and
this corresponds to a separator on the
memory slots on the motherboard this is
so that it's impossible to install the
memory backwards
you load us on the motherboard that the
memory slots are color-coded make sure
that you fill all of the ones in one set
before moving on to the next so to
actually install our Ram undo the
retention clips on the DIMM slots you
want to populate usually they'll be ones
on both sides of the slot grab your RAM
make sure that you match up the notch
with the divider on the DIMM slot make
sure you put it in evenly now there will
be a little bit of force required push
down evenly on both sides of the RAM
stick you'll notice a little clip as the
stick fits in again second one we're
putting into slot number three match it
up slide it in evenly and push down
evenly until you hear the clip of the
retention bracket going back into place
and that's all there is to it
in general there's no strict order for
the components to be installed into the
system I typically choose to go with the
power supply first because it's the one
component that all of the others are
definitely going to use and it also
allows for much easier cable routing now
how hard this setup is largely depends
on the case that you go with and the
power supply that you choose if you go
with a mid-sized Tower or even a
full-sized Tower like this 800 d you
have a lot more room to work with inside
also we've gone with a muskan modular
power supply which allows us to add in
cables only as we need them this reduces
our cable clutter improves our air flow
and cuts down on the installation hassle
by a lot depending on your case you'll
either have a top mounted or bottom
mounted power supply the one thing to
keep in mind is that your power supply
fan always needs to have a source of air
whether it's from inside the case or
like in this scenario we have venting at
the bottom so we can install our power
supply seemingly upside down with you're
installing the power supply upside down
or right side up installation is the
same match up these four holes with the
holes in the power supply put your
screws in and it's on to the rest
let's move on to installing the
motherboard now you want to make sure
that you've installed all of the
standoffs on to the motherboard tray
already and make sure that where you
place them corresponds to the size of
motherboard that you have whether it's
ATX
em ATX or EA TX in fact there should be
little H markings on the motherboard
tray stating exactly where you should
put each standoff
you don't want to have any extra ones in
places they're not supposed to go
because it can cause serious headaches
later on down the road I usually find it
easier to install the motherboard with
the case laying on its side now the
first thing I want to do is install your
i/o shield which even for experienced
builders this process can be a bit of a
pain in the
now for the actual motherboard
installation we'll put it in very gently
so that the rear i/o connections match
up with the space and the shield and
most importantly so that the space is in
the motherboard match up with the
motherboard standoffs now very rarely
will you find these align perfectly so
you'll generally have to hold the board
in place while you install the first few
screws I usually suggest to go with the
diagonal three first and the rather six
will fall into place
for a build we're using a solid-state
drive which actually fits perfectly onto
the drive caddy for the hot swappable 8
under D now for those who don't have a
caddy or a system that fits a solid
state drive naturally you may be able to
use a three and a half inch to two and a
half inch drive adapter alongside our
hard drive we'll also be installing the
optical drive which if you're lucky your
case will support a tooless system
otherwise we'll be using the good ole
fashioned screw and screw driver just
make sure you consult your manual to
find out precisely how to install all of
your drives
finally we have probably the most
important piece of just about any
enthusiast system and that is the
graphics card you'll want to install the
graphics card in the topmost PCI Express
slot as well make sure that you take out
the appropriate rear expansion card
brackets you want to make sure that the
graphics card connectors fit completely
inside of the expansion card slot and
that you can get your retention screws
in without a lot of force if you're
going to be removing your graphics card
watch out for the retention clip at the
back of the PCI Express slot when you're
taking the card out make sure you either
unclip or hold this piece up while you
take the card out otherwise you may just
break it off and void your motherboard
warranty or worse break the card
now all of our components are installed
into our system but that's not the most
tedious part of building a computer that
is getting all these into there let's
move on to cabling to start we're going
to get all of the connections from the
power supply hooked up to their
respective components for starters we
have the 24 pin or possibly 20 pin power
connection which hooks up to the
motherboard usually you'll find the
socket for this somewhere along the
right side of the board in the middle
make sure for all of the connections
that a little clamp on the side of the
power connection matches up with the
knotch on the board connection now all
of these will probably require a little
bit of force to get in but once they're
in they should be fairly snug the next
connector you're likely to run into is a
4 pin or a 4 &amp;amp; 4 pin connector for the
motherboard this fits up in the top left
hand corner of the motherboard and you
want to make sure you don't get this
connector confused with an 8 pin PCI
Express power connector which is usually
defined by a PCIe on the back of the
actual connection next come the 6 pin
PCI Express power connections for
graphics cards now for certain high-end
cards you may find that it requires 8
pins which you can often find is an
extra 2 pin attachment on the side of
the cable these plug straight in to the
graphics card either on the side or at
the back you'll also be working with
serial ata connections for your hard
drives or optical drives you'll notice
they have a bit of an L shape to them so
they fit into the device only one way
and of course we can't forget molex
connections which are usually used for
older devices or most likely fans you'll
have both a male and female connection
which when paired together fit in rather
snugly you want to make sure to install
all of the serial ata data cables which
again have that little L shape from the
device onto the appropriate space of the
motherboard after the device is
installed in the computer of course the
final piece is getting all of the front
panel connections such as your power
reset USB and fan connections hooked up
to the proper place on the motherboard
make sure that you consult your
motherboard manual to find out exactly
where the proper headers are so ends our
brief tutorial on the basics of how to
build or upgrade your PC one thing to
keep in mind is that the installation
procedures for some of the components
may be a little different than what
we've depicted in the video so always
make sure to read over any manuals that
come with the hardware in the event that
you're still having a little trouble
feel free to hop over to the hardware
canucks forums and ask away
if you have any tips tricks or questions
about PC building leave them in the
youtube comments and as always thanks
for watching we hope you found this
video informative and we'll see you next
