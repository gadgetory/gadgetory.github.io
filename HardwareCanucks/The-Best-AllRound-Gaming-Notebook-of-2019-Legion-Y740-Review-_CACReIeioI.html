Eber here with Hardware Canucks and this
is the Lenovo Legion Y740 a heavily
requested notebook that you guys wanted
us to check out it's finally here in the
studio now this thing is on a crazy sale
right now in Lenovo's website actually
this particular model is going for
around $1,600 with all the coupon codes
applied and all that kind of stuff
because the spec that I have here comes
with an RTX 2070 Max-Q a core i7
processor sixteenths of RAM you have
nvme SSD and a hard drive it's a really
respectable II happen for a really good
deal now full disclaimer Lenovo Legion
is one of our channel sponsors but that
won't hold us back from giving them
critical feedback whether if it's good
or bad since there is a lot to discuss
about the Y740 some of them that are
really concerning so let's dive in right
after this damn what they provide the X
system you run and this is an ATX
machine you mean micro idea no no
full-size ATX components it's just a
small package they can still satisfy the
Q 500 L by Cooler Master and affordable
and the pretty compact enclosure for all
your regular hardware would perforated
exterior and PSU bracket the chips up
and down flexible side IO and awesome
cable management's the Q 500 l a compact
frame with full ATX satisfaction check
it out below okay so I love what Lenovo
has done here with the y740 it has a
really nice industrial look to it rather
than it's screaming gamer II the grey
sandstone iron gray finish on the front
panel is very sleek and minimal with the
Allegiant logo on the side that gives it
a nice low-profile look the same can be
said with the interior I'm glad that
they didn't go with a brushed plastic
material like some other noble
manufacturers do the build quality is
really good especially for the price you
pay I mean you get a nice combination of
hard plastic and aluminum materials that
gives it a nice robust feel and I really
love it
Allegiant has definitely stepped up in
the design and build quality department
especially with their notebooks right
now compared to what was being offered
three or four years ago
so I'm really happy about that and from
my little preview back in North Carolina
regarding their next-generation 50
series design again it's a complete
visual overhaul and I can't wait for you
guys to take a look at it once they
launch sometime in 2020 the keyboard
layout is pretty compact you don't get a
dedicated numpad but they've added
additional keys on the left-hand side
that gives you instant access to the
Vantage software game capture a few
macro keys and lighting adjustments the
keys themselves feature a good amount of
travel distance they're almost identical
to my razor blade 15 you get a really
nice solid feedback as you're typing but
personally I still like the one on the
air 15X because it has a little bit
more travel distance and that's my
preference overall RGB lighting has also
made its way into the Y740 lenovo did
team up with corsair on the lighting
department with the IQ software and it
certainly looks gorgeous you have a
handful of lighting effects to play
around with the trackpad is pretty good
it features Windows position drivers so
you can take advantage of all the
gesture controls baked into Windows 10
but I'm gonna be very honest I'm
actually really spoiled by the glass
surface found on the ways of late 15
because the surface on that is smoother
compared to the slightly more resistant
surface that are getting on the y740's
the webcam is located at the bottom and
the quality is not that impressive I
mean for one it is at an odd location of
pointing at your nose but the other
thing that really surprises me the most
is the quality because if you look at
smartphone cameras especially the
front-facing cameras they are miles
better than what you can get on a
notebook so I just don't understand why
brands don't dis tend to cheap out on
webcams on premium gaming notebooks I
hope that changes sooner than later
because you know people use webcams same
port selection is well thought out on
the Y 740 in fact the majority of them
are located at the back so you get
Kensington lock power in a couple of USB
3.1 gen2 unforce Gigabit Ethernet HDMI
and a mini DisplayPort on the right-hand
side there's an extra USB 3.1 port and
on the left you'll find a Thunderbolt 3
type C port and a headphone / mic jack
unfortunately it does not have an SD
card reader now if you plan on hauling
the Y740 to school and your workplace this is
definitely something that you have to be
mindful about the power brick it's huge
it's like this this is a comparison to
my s10 it's the regular size s10 and
it's math so it's almost half the size
of notebook so yeah it's a 231 adapter
it's actually one of the biggest
adapters that I've seen so yeah
just let's keep noted that the speakers
are located at the bottom unfortunately
they don't sound that great especially
when you compare to the front-facing
speakers on the blade 15 I was able to
notice a few distortions especially
during the lower frequencies so from an
audio perspective it's just not that
great moving on to the display and this
is where things get a bit interesting so
it's a 1080p IPS screen with a refresh
rate of 144 Hertz and the cherry on top
of that is that it features in videos
g-sync technology so it gives you a
tear-free gaming experience when playing
fast-paced titles the color reproduction
is excellent for content creation and
consumption it's not a super bright
panel because it comes in at around 300
knits so outdoor visibility may be a bit
challenging but the faster refresh rate
paired with g-sync really gave me an
awesome experience when gaming and doing
other tasks but there are certain issues
with this configuration that needs to be
addressed but before again to that let's
quickly go over the specs so the model I
have over here comes with a 6 core
eighth generation Core i7 processor 16
gigabytes of RAM running in dual channel
mode at 26 66 megahertz it also has a
256 gigabyte nvme SSD that boasts read
speed above 3.4 gigabytes per second and
writes around 1.7 gigabytes per second
and the star of the show is the RTX
2070 max-Q GPU in terms of upgradability
you can easily get access to the
components inside so you can easily
access the two RAM slots that can easily
be upgraded up to 32 gigabytes there's
also the two and a half inch hard drive
bay right beside the battery that can be
swapped out for a standard SSD if you so
desire and you can also access the nvme
SSD on the right-hand side speaking of
the battery it's only a 57 watt hour
unit and the battery life is very poor
as you can see I did a light
test essentially refreshing a Chrome web
page on a loop until the battery
completely depleted and the system only
lasted for about three hours switching
to a heavy load test I ran real bench on
a loop and the system lasted for about
15 minutes so it's certainly
disappointing especially compared to the
competition but you may be wondering why
well there are a few things to consider
for one it is a smaller battery so that
is one of the expectations short about
enough of course and the other thing is
that out of the box lenovo has g-sync
enabled so it's basically running off
the rtx 2070 for the most part because
Maximus is not turned on and by default
you HD Graphics is also completely
disabled so you can't really take
advantage of quick sync when you're
rendering a video and that is certainly
something that raises some red flags
especially as a content creator now
there is a hybrid mode built into the
engine software that disables g-sync and
it basically enables Maximus switches
between new HD graphics and the RTX
2070 but I ran into a lot of instances
where quick sync with Adobe Premiere
just wouldn't work at all I mean I tried
running this test multiple times and we
started the system no luck it just
doesn't want to work so there's a lot of
driver optimization issues at least with
my model so I mean if you are an
existing 140 user and if you've been
experiencing some of these rendering
issues especially with cling sync or
trying to get quick singh to work I'd
love to know that in the comments down
below but I'm overall not really happy
with the modes or the different
performance modes on this laptop the
other thing that I wanted to mention is
that the clock speeds were consistently
above 3.8 gigahertz regardless of the
scenario so whether if I was you know
browsing the web or gaming that kind of
got me to thinking whether or not if
intel speedstep technology was enabled
on this notebook and the fact the matter
is I tried going to the BIOS I tried
looking for that setting and I just
couldn't find it so basically if you're
on battery mode regardless of plugged in
or plug without it having plugged in
it's gonna run those higher clock speeds
that is definitely one of the factors
contributing to the lower battery life
with that out of the way it let's
actually get into the performance
segment so the six core twelve thread
CPU
is a strong performer for rendering the
consistent four gigahertz clock speeds
Thompson charts compared to the air of
50 next and my razor blade 15 now taking
a look at rendering performance again
like I said before quick sync just does
not want to work on the y740 so I took
the same 13 minute 4k project I exported
it to the YouTube 4k preset and it uses
the RTX 2070 to render the entire
video and it took over 24 minutes to
complete that task compared to you know
less than 50 minutes that I get on the
air 15X and the razor notebook
now gaming on your hand was as expected
really good you can easily push over a
hundred pins per second in most triple-a
titles at the highest preset and again
when you pair this up with the 144 Hertz
producing display there's nothing really
to complain about now taking a look at
temperatures on a full synthetic load
using i-264 the CPU did get relatively
warm at around 81 C with clock speeds at
3.8 to 3.9 gigahertz on all six cores so
firmly this notebook does a fantastic
job cooling the chip at those speeds the
RTX 2070 max-Q did peak and semi 3
C which is a coolest that I've seen on
an R X no above and the clock speeds
were shifting back and forth between
1300 and 1500 megahertz which does align
really well within envyus spec sheet fan
noise is also surprisingly really good
it doesn't you know sound like a jet fan
compared to the Aero 15X but the one
thing that I do want to bring up is that
I wish of lenovo actually gave us a
custom fan profiles to tweak within the
Vantage software because you know even
during idle scenarios you can still hear
a little bit of that hum and I think
that's again partly due to you know the
cpu running at 3.8 gigahertz
consistently so it has to cool that
processor at that clock speed so I guess
this brings us to the conclusion and
guys you know I was really excited when
I got the y740 in the studio because I
thought this was gonna be the notebook
that I would completely switch over to
because you know it the specs are quite
amazing and I love the design it's it's
a really well-thought-out notebook but
there are things like intel speedstep
and of course the hybrid mode and the
switch to that it really does consume me
the most especially when quick sync if
it doesn't work when rendering videos as
a content creator it's just really not
going to benefit me at all so
that really does suck and the shorter
battery life things like that but when
you look at the price of the Y740
it's actually one of the cheapest RTX
notebook that you can buy right now in
the market with an RTX 2070 and with
that crazy sale going online I don't
think you can go wrong with a notebook
like this but again be aware of all the
limitations with this notebook and if
your existing Y740 user I would love to
know your thoughts about your experience
with it I mean bar with harbor connects
