two-time case of the Year winner fantex
the always incredible Corsair and NCIX
now this is spatha we are the issues
booth here and very interesting mouse
directions here so they're talking about
developing their the world's first
wireless optical mouse now this is still
an unknown direction so we would like to
hear your comments whether or not you'd
like to see a wireless optical mouse to
be actually built by a soos but this is
sparta this is the initial preliminary
design it's very wide there's got all
the types of ergonomic supports got this
six buttons on the side with the rubber
smooth textured padding the lighting
will be RGB behind the buttons which is
cool so you'll be able to have a little
bit customization here the scroll wheel
will have RGB lighting there's two
buttons you know the primary left button
right button is longer which is great
because your middle finger is longer
some mice messed that up don't show it
at the here the front you have the micro
USB connection just like a standard
Gladius mouse which they released
earlier but it will be also wired and
wireless option the only thing that
they're still unsure about is whether or
not or what sensor to use so they want
to hear your feedback button behind the
scroll wheel is your dpi change they're
not sure if this can be RGB yet or not
but hopefully and overall this is a very
interesting design direction they will
have a base for charging kind of goes on
very standard stuff so yeah this is the
spot
next thing is there our G Sica Mouse so
it's wired mouse important thing about
this one is that it will have
replaceable armor switches behind left
and right click just like the Gladius
did but they've changed the way you open
the mouse and replace those switches
because that was a really big annoyance
on the Gladius where you have to
actually peel off the Teflon feet this
will not be the case here with a seeker
you'll actually be removing a screws
from the side take off the body not
having to deal with anything at the
bottom really cool stuff it's in the
symmetrical mouse fairly economics nice
little body here also it's gonna have
red lighting for the
logo and the actual color accent will be
similar or actually be the same as the
Gladius sort of this metallic dark gray
kind of glossy and not the standard
matte black last thing to finish off is
there new RG white stone mouse mat
because people are apparently were
complaining that their mouse mats think
so they developed this new thing instead
of having a rubber surface on the bottom
they actually have it's a silicon
surface so it's washable it's very
durable and doesn't sly it's very anti
slip but the most important thing is the
actual top surface that has a very silky
smooth to the touch surface that makes
the Mouse glide super smooth and I'm
actually looking forward to getting
myself one of these so this has been the
ROG peripherals lineup this is sort of
in development the biggest thing is this
pata whether or not which optical sensor
to use so let's go ahead and check out
the rest of the stuff that they have
here they use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
