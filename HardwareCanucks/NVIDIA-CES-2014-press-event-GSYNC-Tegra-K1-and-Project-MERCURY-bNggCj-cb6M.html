brought to you by and say XCOM
technology connected hey guys so I'm
three tree we just finished off with the
nvidia 2014 CS press conference and they
announced a few awesome features new
awesome line of products that we were
going to talk to you about some of the
things that they did also bring up was
game stream so the ability to stream to
your shield one awesome aspect was they
brought up the whole cloud streaming so
they were streaming batman arkham
origins all the way from friends pewter
and friends was rendering out this game
and streaming it to shield here in Las
Vegas there was a little bit of lag that
we that was visible but this technology
is still very impressive for the
potential future of this game stream
technology for gaming next thing is
g-sync obviously it gets rid of all the
tearing and there's no lag so it has
very interesting implications for gaming
and what analysis and quarter to they
will be 27 inch 1440p monitors available
which is really interesting and really
excited to see finally those high
resolution g-sync monitors to be
available on the market the next big
thing is the Tegra k1 it's a processor
with 192 cuda cores based on the kepler
architecture they showed us some few
demos and they looked amazing for a
mobile chip like this they will be
releasing a dual cpu based off the
denver cpus which will be the arm v8
64-bit processor so allowing better
multitasking it's going to be a little
bit of faster mobile chip processor but
again the showing where this whole Tegra
architecture is going it will be
interesting to see how many OMS will be
taking this technology taking the Tegra
k1 processor and incorporating it into
the mobile world but from what we've
seen it's a very powerful chip and also
since the next Unreal Engine the Unreal
Engine 4 will be
used with the Tegra k1 so that's very
impressive the graphics on this engine
is again on a mobile system was very
interesting to see and it looked great
shaders physics diamond dynamic volume a
lot of particle effects and all that
stuff and look look really good for a
mobile chip now the next thing for
nvidia is they're pushing towards the
automobile sector and they've announced
that the gay one the TK one will be used
in a lot of the cars particularly for a
digital dashboard so allowing you to
customize the look of your dashboard the
type of textures it will have so you can
have rubber can have concrete you have
glossy you have a tons of color
customization to match the color of your
interior to match the color of your car
all that implications and in total of
four processors will be used inside a
car but not only this will be sort of
powered for the digital dashboard and
just giving you a better experience for
user interface inside the car but this
also has implications for driver
assistance so it will detect it how far
away from a car in front of you it will
be tackling the lanes you will provide
warnings when you are sort of closing
close to the car in front of you it will
detect the speed sign so you're aware of
what the speed limit is in your zone so
a lot of driving assistant features will
be incorporated and will be run all on
this Tegra k1 processor so very
impressive things from Nvidia here at
CES 2014 so now let's actually go ahead
and take sort of a closer look and how
this digital dashboard will work and how
this k one processor is incorporates a
das or this assistant driving for your
car all right guys so we're here taking
a look at something that is completely
brand-new that we're seeing here at CES
2014
and that's the nvidia k1 now one of the
things we want to take a look at was the
a das system can you give us a little
bit of a breakdown it's exactly what
we're seeing that sure a task so it's
also stands for advanced driver
assistance systems is something that's
becoming a part of more and more cars
today things like blind spot monitor and
lane departure warning adaptive cruise
control are starting to appear and some
pretty high-end cars and even moving
down into the mainstream I think the
difference is when never car makers put
those features in the car each one
requires its own special box with a
special processor that's a lot of costs
of the car it adds a lot of extra wiring
that's a lot of extra power consumption
the power of the new Tegra k1 with 192
cores is that it can perform a lot of
functions that are used in a TAS
computer vision and in this case what
we're seeing here on the screen is a
forward-facing camera feeding a basic
video feed into the Tegra k1 and we're
analyzing that video detecting where the
lane boundaries are we're detecting
street signs as they pass by so we can
alert the driver what the proper speed
limit is we're able to recognize other
vehicles and so we can detect whether
the car is approaching us at a high rate
of speed or slow rate of speed or
accelerating away from us and based on
that information then the car maker
would take appropriate action they may
do a beep to alert the driver there may
be a warning that would flash where the
car may automatically break itself if it
was a collision avoidance system now do
you foresee this as being like a
standard safety equipment that you can
automatically update going forward is it
sort of like future-proof that's one way
to look at it can the our module so the
Tegra k1 is a mobile processor again
with 192 super course
the vcm is a visual computing module so
we have an automotive grade version of
our mobile processor that means it can
sustain very low temperatures like minus
40 Celsius 85 celsus so kind of extreme
temperature environments you have in a
car but also then it's able to do very
high end processing so you can envision
the software in the car being updated
over the life of the car to add new
capabilities awesome another really cool
thing that we saw today was this stuff
right over here which is basically
you're able to customize your experience
in the vehicle by everything you can see
on the dashboard can you give us a
little bit more information on this so
over here again we're using that same
Tegra k1 processor but in this case
we're using the GPU to do really
advanced rendering much like car
designers are using our quadro
processors to in their workstations do
all the styling and design in
photorealistic rendering now we're
enabling that level of graphics to
appear inside the car and so here in
this instrument cluster that's being
shown we're customizing using different
materials so over here is actually a
material Explorer so you can select
whether you want titanium brushed metals
or carbon fiber glass or plastic or car
paint and all the different elements of
the graphics then are applied and
rendered photo realistically so
essentially you could customize the look
and feel of your own vehicle now would
this be done in in dealership using a
tablet it that's one scenario sure of
dealerships could enable you to kind of
build your own custom car but once you
have the vehicle there's no reason why
you couldn't on a smartphone or your own
tablet design your vehicle interface or
choose the materials you want and upload
that into the vehicle itself so in other
words this technology is basically
enabling everybody to have
endless customizability of their driving
experience that's right I think what
we're going to see is a movement toward
a software-defined car it was a very
powerful computing platform made by
Nvidia that ends up powering a lot of
different features in the car could be
the instrument cluster could be the
infotainment system here it could be
rear seat entertainment systems and also
then the advanced driver systems so a
lot of new processing technology coming
into the cars as we announced we have
over 4.5 million cars on the road today
with NVIDIA processors inside and a
pipeline basically of another 25 million
more to come that were contracted for
over the next several years so guys
that's some pretty big news and chance
are that sometime in the near future at
least you're probably gonna be buying a
brand-new vehicle with probably
something as strong as this in it ok
guys so taking a look at this g-sync
monitor from AOC it's a 1920 x 1080 but
one of the biggest things that I'm going
to tell you about this monitor is that
it's life changing I I don't know if
there's any other way I can explain it
you need to see it for yourself as a
gamer this is chick that changes
everything everything that I knew about
gaming and tearing and stutter is gone
alright so do to really demonstrate the
power of the Tegra k1 processor they're
here they're running a real-time face
works demo on the tablet so you can see
exactly what type of effects are like
oily skin so it turns it to into sort of
an animated face into an almost real
realistic looking face all rendered in
real time still no a choppy at like 30
FPS and drops at some points but still
and the mobile mobile platform it shows
the true potential of where this tegra
processor could go right behind me to--
is what's even more impressive this is a
Tegra k1 running dual 4k TV so this is a
I guess a more much larger 4k TV but
that one is also being rendered so dual
4k TVs being rendered in real time
simultaneously without any hiccup very
impressive again for this chip that's
able to run this much of resolution much
run at these high resolutions with these
displays and you're in videos come on
the ball with CES 2014 introductions so
take a k1 has a lot of implications not
just for mobile computing but as we've
seen for the automobile industry so
again you guys make sure to subscribe
for at the rest of our CES 2014 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
