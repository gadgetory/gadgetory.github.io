wrecking axe and I'm here to talk about
chairs more specifically why I'm
ditching my gaming chair because I've
been using this guy for the past two
years and it was quite an uncomfortable
experience but I've sort of left it out
of the equation now never even thought
about it until now because it's almost
affecting the posture that I'm you know
normally used to be sitting at and it
really is concerning to me so I'm ready
to get rid of this guy and look for a
new one and so follow me along so this
will be a two-part series video the
first part would obviously be me talking
about why we don't do gaming chairs and
why you know you watching a gaming chair
of you doesn't really give you the full
picture because there is a lot more than
that
so let's get into specifics right after
message from our sponsor then you and
there Mack slick fusion is their first
addressable RGB all-in-one cooler with a
standard 240 ml rad an absolutely
beautiful RGB ring elimination on the
fence and the pump to highlight that
unique flow indicator through the
transparent top check out the lake
fusion down below okay so let me
backtrack here for a second so this is
the verdict your PL 6000 gaming chair it
was sent to us by board agir as for free
as a review sample so let me get into
how this has held up so far
first up physical aesthetics I mean I
haven't noticed any wear or tear with
materials it has stayed up really well
for these past two years there are no
rips or anything some sort the one thing
that I did notice over that was sort of
recurring you know these past days is
that I've noticed creaking here and
there it was it's just something that
I've been noticing for for a while and
it gets a little bit annoying especially
if you're recording on cams like scripts
or something like that if you just make
a slight movement with your chair that
obviously the microphone picks up that
sound and it kind of kind of ruins the
whole thing so that's one of the things
I have noticed with the PL 6000 I've
definitely started noticing creeks here
and there so that's that now in terms of
comfort well that's the most discerning
part about this gaming chair in fact
it's the one reason why I'm willing to
get rid of this as soon as I can and
look for something that's a little bit
better so I'm going to start with the
bottom because the PVC leather option is
certainly quite durable but it
didn't have proper breathing space so I
noticed he'd buildups very fast as very
rapid so if you're seeing in something
like this for really long periods of
time especially during summer your
bottom can get really toasty so it it
gets a little weird obviously becomes a
little gross too so it comes to a point
where I have to physically just get out
of the chair
start kneeling on the carpet and do
things on my computer especially when it
comes to editing and something like that
so it's definitely not a effective works
workflow in my opinion so it's just it's
one of those things where I wish had I
had something that I can comfortably sit
on and unfortunately on the peel 6000
with the PVC leather material at the
bottom it's just not doing any justice
next up is the backrest so it is a
completely flat surface meaning there is
no proper lumbar support for your back
which means if you're trying to lean
back you kind of have to get to a point
where just there's a little gap that's
filling or it's just left there out of
nowhere so you really can't comfortably
you know sit back and just relax and do
your work it's just not the case here
vertigo does include a lumbar pillow
that you can put on the bottom but to be
honest it's way too thick and it almost
gets to a point where you have to it
pushes you forward without a cup you
thought you sort of getting into a
comfortable position it just doesn't add
up that well so that was definitely
something that I did notice of course it
was definitely concerning and it almost
got to a point where I'm sorry he's
slowly starting to slouch forward which
makes it totally uncomfortable and
sometimes it's just not even healthy
because I can notice the back pains
coming here and there and that
definitely is you know quite concerning
so a lack of proper lumbar support is
one of the reasons why I'm also willing
to ditch this gaming chair I should also
mention that proper posture is very
crucial you want to be able to sit back
straight and edit comfortably or just
work at a desk comfortably without
having to worry about back pains or
anything like that constant or
occasional back pains that come up here
and there so it is very crucial I mean
back pains is again a very dangerous
thing if especially if you're working at
a job where you need to maneuver around
in my case I have to move around for
shot for composing shots and stuff like
that and of course filming here at the
office so if I have a back problem then
definitely an effect content and you
know if I don't get proper support at
the back then it's just it's it's
ultimately it's gonna affect my back and
it would obviously end up with me not
being able to produce any content so I
don't want to do that that's not what
I'm looking for so as I mentioned
earlier the lack of proper back support
or just proper lumbar support at the
back is definitely a noticeable thing
and over these past few years that's one
of the things that I've noticed because
you could comfortably lean back
it's just then you know when you lean if
you're working on a desk it just you're
getting to a point where you have to
obviously slouch but you can't
comfortably rest your lumbar at the back
and that kind of it just doesn't add up
so that's one of the reasons why I'm
looking for solutions now this next bit
of the video is definitely gonna be
quite an interesting conversation
starter because I'm gonna be talking
about chair reviews in general because
personally I find them to be pointless
I know we did do one back in the past or
probably a couple of them probably three
or four of them back in the day but
there is a sole reason why we have
stopped doing gaming chair reviews here
in the channel at least these days
because you know over the course of
these years we've slowly come to
understand where the industry stands in
terms of providing just things in
general I guess features exclusive
features mostly on gaming chairs because
right now we're seeing gaming chairs
with RGB lighting which is completely
just pointless I have no idea why we're
seeing something like that in 2018 but
it is it is existent it is something
that we have to deal with but most
importantly if a brand reaches out to a
youtuber and if they ask you to so you
know if they're asking you to review one
of their gaming chairs and if they
accept then obviously the first step
would be to review that chair give an
unbiased opinion about it but it almost
gets to a point where someone who's
watching that review would base their
purchase off that opinion and I don't
think that's right simply because you
know you as an individual you haven't
put in the effort to try out that gaming
chair or non gaming chair in general but
the chair by itself in general at a
store to make sure that you're
comfortable sitting on it because I have
had friends who have tried Herman Miller
embody chairs and they absolutely hate
it so you know you could be someone who
absolutely fell in love with
a $50 chair an office chair basic chair
versus someone who just won't be able to
take something like that and might want
to go with something a little bit better
spend a little bit more money and get
something of a higher quality and be a
lot better with that and of course feel
a lot comfortable sitting on it if
you're looking to invest in a chair I'd
highly recommend trying it trying it out
at stores rather than buying things
online based off the chair reviews it's
just that's just my take now trying out
different chairs at different stores
might be a little bit of a challenge for
people who are living in remote areas so
my suggestion would be to do as much of
research as you can narrow down your
results spend a day or two just
traveling around trying out different
stores maybe if it's a 30-minute drive
from your place dick take the time to do
that because trust me that $30 or $50
investment or even a thousand dollar
investment can play a huge role when it
comes to your posture or just your
health and channel because it really
does the chair really does affect your
your back the health the way how you sit
and the way how you just work in general
so if you if you just decide to cheap
out on that investment if you if you're
if you're looking to take compromises on
that part well ultimately it is gonna
affect your health and that and that
isn't cool your chair purchase
ultimately determines the quality of
life you lead moving forward because if
you invest on a chair based off someone
else's opinion that you read online then
you know the next thing you know it
shows up at your place you assemble it
you sit on it and all of a sudden you
realize that it just doesn't feel right
to you it doesn't feel comfortable you
don't feel like you're just relaxed when
you're working at a desk or if you're
just sitting in it doing other
productive things so that's a complete
fail in my opinion and I hope a lot of
you guys can relate to this I just want
to point out that this isn't a takedown
on gaming chairs but rather it's a
process and I'll obviously have to go
through not just with gaming chairs but
just chairs in general to find out
what's suitable for me next so this is
probably why we're not gonna be doing
any chair reviews here in the channel
because I don't think anyone should
again as I said in the beginning and the
end should base their opinions or make
their purchasing positions on chairs in
general based off someone else's
opinions so that's it for me guys
I hope you took away something from this
video I think the
things obviously I'm gonna be ditching
this gaming chair and looking for
something else I'll make sure to
document and vlog my journey or my path
to find the next chair here for the
office and yeah let me know what you
guys think about chairs in general in
fact are you satisfied with your chair
purchase if you've invested you know
fifty dollars or thirty dollars or a
thousand dollars let me know the
comments down below if you're satisfied
with your purchasing decision even if
it's a gaming chair let me know in the
comments down below I'm you bore with
Harvard connects thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
