great technology selections and service
so New York is a wonderful place to
visit for the drinks and for the foods
with the busy busy streets and an urban
experience like no other and one word it
is unique and to complement this unique
environment Nvidia invited us for the
debrief on something they've been
cooking for the mobile community the
Tegra note 7 and particularly the shield
have provided an interesting take on
Android gaming and integration of PC
gaming that fast became one of the
coolest ways to casually play PC games
off your couch and today they are
announcing the shield tablet featuring
many interesting implementations for
gaming but NVIDIA has made sure to cover
all the grounds with regards to this
being an appropriate tablet experience
first and by their words it's a tablet
first and a gaming device after all so
don't underestimate the power of this
thing as it is quite capable pricing is
$2.99 for the 16 gigabyte plus Wi-Fi
model and $100 premium for the double
the capacity and LTE support which is
extremely competitive in our opinion the
shield tablet features a gorgeous 8 inch
IPS display with 1920 by 1200 resolution
stare your front-facing speakers with
nice aluminum housing something that has
carried over from the Tegra note 7 the
speakers are very detailed with the
sub-base boosters on each side for more
full range like representation and from
what we've heard they are outstanding a
5 megapixel camera is both at the front
and at the rear why not
the rear cover is slightly rubberized
with a shield text embedded that has a
very anti slip surface that I found
satisfactory for handling and the 8 inch
4 factor isn't anything new and the
curvature of the frame feels comfortable
to hold nothing unusual stood out on the
right there's a power button and the
volume rocker with tactile response
micro SD card slot for expandable
storage I know all further down is a sim
slot for the LTE version it also
features mini HDMI out micro USB
headphone jack and the magnetic insert
for the optional case that's low profile
unlocks the screen when opened and
allows different orientation
of the shield tablet there's also a
passive stylus included no need for
batteries with accurate pressure
recognition palm rejection and pretty
interesting implementation with the
hardware that allows real-time
simulation of oil painting or watercolor
something that we'll cover in the full
of you to come and now onto the best
part it is the hardware it's rocking
NVIDIA k1 this is a quad core SOC with
192 CUDA cores and so the interesting
part behind the k1 is its rockin Kevlar
architecture same as found on the Nvidia
Titan or many many enthusiasts desktop
GPUs and with this power the shield
tablet is fully capable and gaming ready
with full OpenGL 4.0 support so running
half-life 2 and portal that have been
ported to Android with excellent high
res textures and smooth frame rate we
saw a live demo of Unreal Engine 4 being
run on the tablet in real time with
pretty impressive dynamic lighting
particles and physics and to take
advantage of all this horsepower is
invidious new $59 Wi-Fi controller it's
not bundled with the tablet as gaming is
optional
remember Nvidia designed this to be a
proper tablet first this is not
Bluetooth so latency factor is reduced
by a factor of 2 X and supposedly
improved battery life of the controller
as well over Bluetooth 4 controllers can
be connected to the shield tablet at the
same time for some multiplayer and the
tablet will ship with trine 2 that looks
gorgeous and is actually a lot of fun
the controller very much resembles the
original shield controls with two
joysticks directional pad buttons and
triggers and shoulder buttons they've
added capacitive controls in the center
for Android navigation and the mic for
voice commands and an actual volume
rocker at the bottom it does have a
built in battery rechargeable via a
microUSB port and the headphone / mic
input for audio and voice basically if
you've held a shield in pass you'll be
right at home with this controller and
so the shield tablet with the controller
would come in handy for game stream that
allows you to stream a game off your
Keppler powered computer as you set on
your couch or just use the controller
for simple Android gaming with the
shield tablet propped up on
stand it can also be used in console
mode thanks to the HDMI out for either
gaming or entertainment like Netflix HD
and all you twitch lovers you can stream
720p without the performance hit very
cool NVIDIA has always been great with
Android updates the shield tablet
launches with 4.4 KitKat running in a
smooth as expected and we don't have any
solid information on battery life so
that will come in the full review and
with the introduction of these new
devices the shield family gets specific
with the original shield now the shield
portable as the shield tablet and the
shield controller and through the
marketplace and from the time you've
spent with the controller / tablet combo
we were very impressed it seems like the
tablet side of things have been covered
very well plus the gaming capabilities
are also a huge bonus as it is a
seamless integration of the shield
ecosystem that is already seeing massive
growth in the game easier but what do
you guys think of the shield tablet from
the gaming perspective and from the
tablet form factor and is this something
that tickles your gaming side or perhaps
that's completely not what you'd ever
use is always let us know in the
comments below don't forget to subscribe
to be notified when our full review of
the shield tablet and shield controller
comes out when we put it through the
hardware conducts paces thanks for
watching we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
