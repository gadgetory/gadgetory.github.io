hardware conducts welcome to another
video
I feel like CPU tower coolers have gone
a bit stagnant over last awhile as
consumers and enthusiasts even have
started to shift towards all-in-one
radiator coolers over the standard air
coolers because the whole water cooling
aspect of cooling your hardware
definitely has its merits so cool master
in my eyes is trying to challenge that
type of thinking with the master air
maker eight CPU cooler they're giving
this new 3d vapor chamber try added a
few modular aspects that are pretty
unique over the price of $130 and
usually this price tag is not associated
with air coolers and so this will
eventually hurt the spread of the maker
8 first let's start with the packaging
which is way over the top in my opinion
surely everything is organized and
labeled beautifully but this is so much
packaging material you know you're
paying $130 and a good chunk of that is
for the all the packaging that you see
here plus there is a very bulky box just
for an extra piece you know I wonder
what happened with being environmentally
conscious company and trying to sort of
sell that to us instead of drowning us
in all this cardboard
so moving on in the package we received
both AMD and Intel brackets this plastic
housing with all the needed mounting
hardware an additional aluminum top
piece for the cooler where the stock one
is this glossy transparent one and you
can also download 3d printing templates
for customization of your own moving on
to the cooler itself so first we have
two 140 millimeter cylinders your fans
so good quality there that moved quite a
bit of air and have a fantastic static
pressure they are illuminated in only
red color so your color coordination
inside the case must be thought about
but check out that gorgeous top the
heatsink with lit up middle cooler
master logo and the end tips for the
eight heat pipes so if that's the number
in the name as it features eight heat
pipes in total so there's four heat
pipes that are soldered onto the base
which is the sort of the standard
profile for and you know CPU coolers
while the other four are part of the
cooler masters new 3d VC or 3d vapor
chamber design where there there is
coolant inside the base and the four
heat pipes and as the coolant heats up
it turns into gas
you know travels through the heat pipes
get cooled by the heatsink and the fans
and then it turns back into the liquid
form and the cycle continues so the
cooler base isn't totally polished and
in fact it is actually more textured
than what we normally see from most
high-end CPU towers now the fans are
mounted on brackets so they are easily
removable by pressing these clips on
each side and in fact you need to remove
the fans during installation but it's
not comfortable if you need to swap the
fans inside the case because these clips
are at the base and sometimes there may
be difficult to access especially if you
have fans at the top there's no way to
pass your hand there or perhaps you
cannot remove the top panel at all so
this simple clip and slide mechanism
doesn't really help here and if for any
reason you'd want to swap out the
included fans 120mm fan brackets are
included which grant you extra clearance
for memory modules and we'll get to that
in just a little bit now installations
from my perspective with a z170 board
was pretty straightforward you secure
the backplate
it's all manual no screwdrivers required
then you pop in some thermal paste which
is included lower the cooler in place to
match the to secure points on either
side and bam then you gain a screwdriver
to tighten these two incredibly tiny
nuts which is so weird given the massive
size of the cooler itself but luckily
the heatsink is shaped to allow a screw
driver to access that spot which worked
just fine now this was of course all
done outside of the case but I imagine
the process to be a lot more tedious if
performed inside a case and you should
also be mindful that the cooler is giant
and heavy it's one point three five
kilograms and 172 millimeters in height
so case clearance need to be double
checked for sure I actually didn't
realize just how tall the cooler was
until a good portion that was sticking
out of my system and
I couldn't close the panel and also if
you move the fan position in the top
slot cooler high grows by about 12
millimeters which means only full tower
accommodation is possible but why would
you want to raise the fans here you
might say because unless you have some
really low profile Ram
you definitely encounter clearance
issues not only does this fan cover two
memory slots but it's practically
touching the middle portion of the
memory and lucky for us this Corsair lpx
modules don't have that heatsink right
in the middle
raising the fan to the second position
would give us enough clearance for a
taller Ram but then you might have this
weird-looking top panel for the CPU
cooler so the last piece of insulation
is cable management which is connected
via this single four pin connector to
your motherboard and it splits for the
dual fans and the LED power it's long
enough to route to any CPU header on
your motherboard but oh man it's not
flexible at all and there's a good thing
that the heatsink is so large it's large
enough to simply hide this cable out of
your sight
and this is what the default plate looks
like on the top then there's no plate
and then the aluminum plate in the end
and I personally love the aluminum
finish as the plastic piece shows finger
prints way too easy so now let's start
calling performance and this is by far
the best performing air cooler we've
tested to date the numbers speak it all
and the package with this cooler seems
to be full with the 3d VC great fans and
a dense heatsink surprisingly the status
quo does not change when we compare
against popular 120 and 140 millimeter
all-in-one coolers it's still the best
performing but keep in mind that some of
these own ones are half the price but
it's when we move into the 240 and the
280 millimeter all-in-one radiator
territory this is when the master air
maker eight starts to show some weakness
despite being in the same price bracket
it's doesn't cool very well or it
doesn't cool as well as most of these
coolers noise wise it's in the middle
it's good to see that you have the
potential for a quiet system with the
maker eight
so concluding words is simple the master
error maker ate it cools well it looks
awesome and I do appreciate these you
know customization element with the top
plate that allows you to 3d print your
own and really customize to whatever you
feel like it
however there are two things you have to
be mindful of RAM clearance and case
clearance one of them because the the
cooler is so large that you will not be
able to fit it in most mid towers
especially if you're raising the fans
and you're most likely we have to raise
the fans because RAM clearance is just
unless you're using really low-profile
modules you'll not be able to fit the
cooler with its stock position however
the biggest issue for many would be the
price as it swims in the same territory
as two forty and two eighty millimeter
Oman radiator coolers that outperform
the maker eight easy and you can achieve
similar cooling results with single on
one radiator coolers so yeah but that is
it for this video thank you guys so much
for watching and I have a question for
you if you are thinking of upgrading
your cooler or using a cooler and your
next build would you do air cooling or
you know all in one enclosed water
cooling for your next build and if you
are choosing the air cooling route with
the the maker 8 be attractive for you
leave your reasons down below love to
encourage this conversation to find out
how the consumers are reacting towards
this type of direction from cooler
master and creating this very advanced
and high-end air cooler but that would
be it for this one I'm Dimitri with
Harbor Canucks thanks so much for
watching we'll see you in the next video
ah you hear that listen
okay I can't do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
