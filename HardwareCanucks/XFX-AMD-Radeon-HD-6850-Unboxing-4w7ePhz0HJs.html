hardware connects coverage of AMD's
Radeon 6800 series now make sure you
watch the full video review for more
details benchmarks and our opinion also
check out triple W Hardware Cox comm for
the even more extensive written review
let's get into it here I have the Radeon
68 50 by XFX and we're going to do a
brief unboxing on it now the card itself
has reference specs but XFX has been
known to take some creative leisure with
their design
now the 6850 is scheduled to be released
at about $179.99 USD which makes it
incredibly affordable for the
performance all of them are going to
carry the standard features hdmi 1.4 AMD
eyefinity PCI Express 2.0 unsupportive
the a do video Specialties 7.1 surround
HDMI and 68 50 has one gig of gddr5 and
memory so let's open it up and take a
look at XFX is version of the ati/amd
6850 a whole bunch of material here
first we have the Do Not Disturb door
hanger but was like this about XFX they
include these little things with every
card you can put your username and
password for your XFX account as well it
gives you the serial number information
for your card so you don't have to open
up your case every time you want to get
that and XFX they do their own power
supply's check them out if you want
something a little different we have the
driver installation guide which is
excessive and then the driver CD now if
you're buying this fresh off the shelf
on the first day you will probably want
to use this otherwise make sure you head
over to am DS driver download website
and get the latest we have the quick
install guide on how to install the card
and we have XF X's North America limited
warranty XFX offers a lifetime warranty
which is pretty cool but you have to
register within the first 30 days that's
pretty much standard for all
manufacturers with a lifetime warranty
otherwise it defaults to two years I
don't think no there's no accessories in
this one onto the card itself the real
meat
the way so we have the unveiling of XFX
6850 and just looking at it there we'll
the first thing you notice is it's a lot
shorter if I hold that there and pull
out our 58 7 you can see that the 6850
is only 9 inches long whereas we have
the rather large 5870 up above there a
lot of people found that that extra
length to the 5870 wouldn't let them fit
it in their case so people looking at
wondering is this going to fit you'll be
just fine no worries what we have is the
XFX it's they're using a flower design
heatsink here with a fan right over top
at the GPU you can see it hopefully
right underneath and the fan shroud is a
little actually it's a lot different
normally you get this generic looking
fully covered fan shroud but we have a
little bit of style around it some holes
in the back which should be really good
for air flow actually we have the PCI
Express the power connection in terms of
the output ports we have a dual DVI we
have HDMI we have DisplayPort and XFX
has put their logo across the exhaust
point which is kind of cool overall that
is the card itself XFX has really done a
great job with the design you won't see
it a heck of a lot but I think it should
be very good for airflow and that's it
the 6850 make sure you check out the
full performance benchmarks and the
written review for more details</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
