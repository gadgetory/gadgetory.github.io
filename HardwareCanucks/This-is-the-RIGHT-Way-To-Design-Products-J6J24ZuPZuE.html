connects and i'm here with michael AKA
sky mt l in Beijing for Lenovo now they
were actually kinda have to invite us
over here and sponsor our trip to check
out some of their upcoming products for
2019 but also give them some honest
feedback on those products on certain
things that could potentially help
improve or that potentially they could
improve on that could fit the end users
they were also able to invite some other
influencers as well as some professional
eSports gamers to give them feedback on
some accessories as well which is pretty
cool and before we get into that I need
to describe this whole situation over
here that's taking place in Beijing so
as I'm recording this you may probably
hear cars honking in the background and
a whole sort of noisy environment pardon
me for that but you know it's definitely
certainly an interesting experience but
even worse is that you know since we are
content creators on YouTube China
actually has some restrictions when it
comes to accessing YouTube and Google
associated services so in order to
combat that we partnered up with
expressvpn which is a solution that can
help us bypass the IP address here in
China and then of course get access to
YouTube and other services by actually
using different locations
all right so coming back to Lenovo I
need to finish this video man now the
setup process is actually very
straightforward expressvpn is available
on every platform that's out there right
now so that includes iOS Android Windows
Mac or Linux once you've signed up for
the service all you have to do is
download the program choose your access
point upon which they actually give you
a lot of options to choose from whether
that's within the US the Europe any city
you want and then you can start your VPN
service right away now interestingly
enough we actually had to upload our
r-tx 20 70 review from Beijing and
expressvpn was really helpful in that
regard but the most important part is it
actually didn't throttle our table hotel
Wi-Fi speeds that much so again it's a
great service and we're I'm actually
really happy enjoying it while I'm here
now you can also sign up for expressvpn
for less than $7 a month with a 30-day
money-back guarantee also find out how
you can get three months for free by
clicking the link in the description
down below
that's expressvpn comm /hw see once
again expressvpn comm slash hwc for
three months with a
one-year package now just to be clear
you can use Express VPN anywhere in the
world provided you have an internet
connection plus it also gives you the
benefit of browsing the web safely if
you're connected to a public Wi-Fi
network or even access content from
other countries for example if I want to
access us-based content on Netflix I can
just head over to the United States
choose a random city through the
expressvpn app and I'll have instant
access to content that's just available
exclusively in the United States and I
think that's an absolute bonus with a
VPN service alright so coming back to
Lenovo over the next few days we're
actually gonna be going through a few
workshops where they'll actually take
the take us over through a variety of
their products including their laptops
their desktops their accessories and a
great example would be their legion
Wi-Fi 30 which i think is a fantastic
notebook for the price because it
doesn't sacrifice on the build quality
department but it also offers the
performance that you need for just you
know casual gaming and stuff like that
but we'll also be going over a bunch of
other things specifically on how they'll
be testing some of these upcoming
products by taking a look or taking a
quick tour on their different test
facilities within their headquarters so
I think they'll be pretty interesting
with that being said let's head off to
Lenovo I'm gonna go right now
all right so the first thing we realized
when arriving at the Lenovo headquarters
was the legion team was taking this
whole thing very seriously there were
people from every product team on hand
and every single one of them wanted to
know what we thought of their products
there was everyone from product managers
to folks who designed their products and
the first thing everyone said was not to
hold anything back and that's exactly
what happened our first day was pretty
much dominated by notebooks and desktops
both of which are very important to
Legion strategy for example the c5 30
that they meet reviewed not too long ago
looked good from the outside but it's CP
cooling was pretty terrible and caused
the entire system to throttle the legion
engineers realize that a little while
ago and are already working on cooler
designs for the next revisions they
later showed us what the next generation
of cooler would look like and it's a
huge upgrade water cooling will be used
for their overclocked systems as well
for notebooks there was a pretty heated
discussion about the direction things
should go we obviously needed a bit more
focus on the thin and light segment that
focuses on productivity and supposedly
lenovo will be addressing that very soon
of course we also mentioned things like
Windows position drivers for the
trackpad and keeping things simple with
their designs and versatility is pretty
important but what do you guys think
other than pricing what features do you
guys look for in a notebook let us know
in the comments so after day one of the
workshop we actually spend the rest of
the night getting to know the other
influencers a little bit more and we
also had some fun
so the second day started with Intel
explaining how they'll be approaching
the competitive gaming market in the
near future
basically eSports is one of the
fastest-growing markets right now and
Intel's making a huge push into it
rather than focusing on products this is
all about building brand awareness
through the creation of Extreme Masters
Tournament and their participation in
other events okay so back to the
interesting stuff because there was
certainly some great discussions around
peripherals and monitors
did you know Legion produced a
peripheral lineup we actually covered
their keyboard and mouse and let's just
say there was a long way to go and
honestly that hasn't really changed one
of everyone's favorite Mouse was
actually the Logitech G 400 so we
actually set off to find one and well
this is what happened at the new big
review new athletic mouse 400 or you can
actually I've been working in retail
like my the dead the dead do not matter
did so other than a little cockroach
infestation probably the most
interesting thing about what happened
was our tour of lenovo's amazing product
testing facilities one of the reasons
why lenovo has been well known for their
high quality products is that every one
of their designs is put through a
rigorous process to see how far it can
be pushed before failure that means
things like putting them into high
humidity and temperature chambers for
hours or subjecting them to
electrostatic shocks
there's also several massive acoustic
testing chambers that are set up to
measure exactly how much noise is being
put out inside of those there are some
of the most expensive tools in the
entire building these are actually
designed to test exactly how the human
ear is able to hear different sounds
each of them is jam-packed with sensors
that can read over 10,000
data points in parallel it's really
amazing to see it in person but legion
isn't all about the typical products
either and some of their designers are
working on some seriously cool projects
this is the Star Trek build that may
actually make its way into the market
sooner than you may think inside of it
there's a miniaturized Z 390 motherboard
with an i-9 9900 K and a GTX 1080
founders Edition not only that but the
upper saucer can also be removed and
used as a wireless speaker / projector
combo alright so I'm gonna be quiet for
a few seconds and run a few more shots
of this amazing Lenovo system
so after all of that it was time to
unwind and I have to say Beijing and its
suburbs may have almost as many
residents as all of Canada but it is an
amazing city to explore the electronics
markets have to be seen and to be
believed since they have everything from
countless cables to GPUs to older CPUs
trying to navigate them is crazy but boy
did we find some interesting stuff and
the Forbidden City well let me just say
I was astonished by just exploring that
part
well guys that pretty much sums up our
four days in Beijing visiting Lenovo I
just want to take a few seconds to thank
the legion team for paying for our
flights and accommodations while we're
there but also being such amazing hosts
it's just amazing to see a company like
Lenovo that's willing to listen to you
know what users have to say and allowing
us to use your comments in our videos
and give them a real voice I think
that's the best takeaway from this whole
experience you know because we read all
of your comments in our review videos
and if a company like Lenovo is willing
to you know listen we use what you have
to say as a guide for feedback and I
think that's how the whole process of
good product design happens anyways I
think that's it for now I hope you guys
enjoyed this little bit of a different
video compared to our normal stuff and
if you have any feedback for Legion or
us feel free to let us know in the
comments down below
until then I'm signing off and I'll see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
