latest KB Lake processors featuring the
i7 7700 K and the i-5 7600 k and while
these new chips didn't offer a
significant increase in performance
compared to their predecessor the
skylake platform people who are looking
for an upgrade from their existing Sandy
Bridge or Ivy Bridge systems could
benefit from new features and noticeable
performance gains while many of KB likes
true benefits will only be realized by
people with older systems or those who
absolutely want support for intel's
upcoming option technology there are
still people who will see value in these
new cpus today we're taking a look at
yet another cable ache processor but
this time one that costs less than $200
and this is it the i3 73 50k now you may
ask what's so special about the CPU well
it comes unlocked for easier
overclocking and I feel like it's a pre
reaction to a in these upcoming writes
and architecture rather than a favor
being done for budget-minded
overclockers so let's dive in and take a
closer look at this little monster from
Intel but before we move on a quick
message from our sponsor choose be quiet
to join the silent revolution designed
and tested in Germany they're meticulous
passion for quiet PC components ranges
from premium power supplies CPU coolers
and fans and innovative PC cases all of
which aim to achieve one thing is this
thing even on that's right
totally quiet power supplies even under
load silent Lynx fans deliver awesome
airflow with noise that doesn't reach
your ears all enclosed in the package
designed to be quiet now before we take
a closer look at the CPU I want to get
something off my shoulders you see many
here at Harbor connects still believe
that the i3 6100 was one of the best
options during the skylake generation it
had two physical cores clocked at 3.7
gigahertz along with hyper-threading and
it just costs $120 while it may not have
been a chart topper in synthetic
benchmarks or high-level rendering its
performance and games was extremely good
the i3 73 50k follows a similar
tradition but it offers a few extra
goodies that budget focus overclocking
enthusiasts would love to play around
with but that comes with a cost
now the specs on the 73 50k CPU are
pretty
thing the 4.2 beginners base clock speed
aligns perfectly with the $245 I 570 600
K a processor that also features 4
threads though across a native quad-core
layout also remember ikely processors
don't have access to Intel's
photographers technology and comes with
very limited cache so don't expect
performance metrics to match the 7600 K
CPU despite the clock speed similarities
turbo-boost max maybe the biggest
omission here since without it the 73
50k won't be able to consistently remain
at higher frequencies so what will the
difference be well we'll find out about
that during the benchmarks one small
hiccup in this equation may come from
the current pricing of this processor
even though Intel says it's supposed to
cost about 170 US dollars actually
finding it for less than $190 is a
challenge right now price wise that
causes the i3 1750 K to compete against
the i-5 7500 and as you'll see in a bit
later that's a site it just can't win
another factor that most people should
take into consideration is compatible
motherboard pricing right now you need a
Z 270 motherboard to at least take
advantage of the overclocking
capabilities of these 7350 k and these
boards are not cheap they're almost as
pricy as the CPU which really questions
the price to performance aspect it's
already obvious that Intel's higher in
unlocked K be like CPUs reach the 4.9 to
5.2 Biggers mark provided they're
adequately cooled in the launch review I
was easily able to hit over 5 P curves
with both the 7700 K and the 7600 K but
realistically speaking you're not going
to spend $150 on a CPU cooler to cool
$170 processor it just doesn't make any
sense so with that in mind I approached
overclocking from a slightly more budget
focused mindset and used a natural Nhu
12s which cost between 40 to 50 dollars
the end result was that the i3 70 to 50
K was easily able to hit 5 gigahertz
with just a few tweaks within the BIOS
and it was debt stable during our
six-hour I 264 system stability test
which is our gold standard for
determining whether or not an
overcompensating to note is that even
though 5.1 gigahertz and even five point
two gigahertz were stable for many
benchmarks neither was able to stay
over the long term so how does the
reference clock in overclock 7350 case
stack up with other CPUs we've reviewed
over the last few years we try to
equalize the test systems as much as
possible with all memory GPUs etc
running at the same speed
note that slightly older video drivers
were used since this allowed us to
standardize testing procedures across
multiple CP generations so let's get on
with this and start with basic synthetic
benchmarks as you can see the 1750 KS 5
gigahertz breaks the barrier between the
lower end a 360 100 and the mid-range I
5 6400 CPU there isn't a massive
difference between the stock and the
overclock speeds but later on in the
test it stacks up really well against
the very popular I 546 70 K CPU which is
an old clock by the way now I can't say
exactly how this processor would stack
up against the i5 7500 but as you can
see even when overclocked these 70 to 50
K traits below the shot I 5 6500 this is
likely due to the limited amount of
cache becoming a bottleneck in some
scenarios moving on to single toilet
testing where multi-threading and cache
don't matter as much as you can see that
the i3 70 to 50 K both some amazing
results this will likely translate into
some very competitive gaming results -
there's no doubt this chip will perform
really well in programs that are
emphasized for single threaded
performance mind you the other high end
CPUs were not overclocked for our test
this is just to give you a rough idea as
to how well $870 overclocked dual core
for thread CPU performs against its much
expensive counterparts that is
particularly true in the real world
benchmarks you're seeing now many of
these tests stress all four threads with
the only exception being our dolphin
emulation that uses a single thread to
process a simple game scene while
overclocking doesn't speed things up
significantly the premium you pay for
the k-series chip doesn't translate into
performance that can consistently beat
Intel's ëyesí processors gaming on the
other hand was a pleasant surprise our
initial tests use a lower 720p
resolution in an effort to take the GPU
out of the equation and allow the
processors to shine on their own as you
can see the 5 gigahertz 7 350 K CPU
stacks up amazingly well with Intel's
Broadwell II CPUs
and the gap between the stock and the
overclocked frequencies is pretty
significant to what's important to take
away from these results is that not too
many games properly use more than two
threads so these 70 to 50 K is able to
climb its way near the top of the charts
and now on to 1080p where most people
are gaming here we can see that the GPU
becomes more of a bottleneck and as a
result many of the processors aligned
with one another
overclocking makes a very little
difference so while it might look good
to be running at 5 gigahertz in reality
it doesn't really change frame rates
that much now this situation might
change as multi-core aware API is like
Vulcan and dx12 become more popular but
for the next little while at least if
you're on a budget it doesn't make sense
to pay a fortune for your processor
instead put that money towards beefing
up your graphics card I mean seriously
just do that
power consumption was just as expected
running stock it's actually quite
impressive almost tying with the i3 6100
but when overclock things shift a little
north the 73 50k consumes a lot more
power than the i5 6500 but it offers
similar multi-turreted performance so
there's a give and take policy here oh
hey there nc XCOM is Canada's leading a
tailor for anything your mind desires
just keep within those categories which
are plenty and be attempted by the
weekly deals visit ncx dot-com Hold Em
sweet deals so what can I say about the
i3 73 50k to be honest it's a very
confusing CPU because you see the
performance is fantastic when compared
against Intel's other AI 3-series chips
and the ability to overclock does give
you some benefits in many applications
what bothers me the most is the price
that you pay for this at $170 it's
already pretty expensive and with
current pricing hovering around $190
there are far better options out there
that don't necessarily need overclocking
to grant you amazing performance not
only that but it's also the other
components like the motherboard cooling
GPU Ram etc that all come into the
equation if you're going to z2 70 you
might as well spend an extra $75 and
pick the i5 7600 K CPU because you get
fantastic multi-threaded performance
when overclocked and if you want more
power you can easily up
to the i7 7700 kctu at this price
there's very little value with the 73
50k especially if you have to pay over
$170 for it
if budget is first and foremost on your
mind when amazing option might be the I
Sai 7500 or I 5 7400 alongside ap-250
based motherboard with that combination
you'd be able to invest in a much better
graphics card and still achieve CP
performance that's similar or better
than an overclocked
I 373 50k and that's what I'm going to
end this review what do you guys think
of the i3 73 50k does the performance
justify its price tag or would you spend
the extra cash on a much powerful
processor let us know in the comments
