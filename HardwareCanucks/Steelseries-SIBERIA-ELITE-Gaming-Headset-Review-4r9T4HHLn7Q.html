oxen welcome back to another video
review the Siberia line from steel
series is still one of the most popular
within the sphere of gaming Audio the
company has made sure to fine tune the
drivers for gamers and from our
experience they have done a fantastic
job now because of this popularity for
the Siberia had said steel series has
gone ahead with the elite version of the
product bring in a bunch more physical
features but also a few revisions under
the earcup so today we going to take a
look at the Siberia elite gaming headset
and because of the added premium
features it is priced quite high at $200
so I guess you can ask yourself whether
or not these gaming features are all
appealing to you as there are headphone
alternatives available within the price
range then I would certainly recommend
it still carries the iconic superior
look with over the head suspension
system and instead of the plastic
support band
it is now steel so the build quality of
the elite is nothing short of amazing
plus add in the leather work they've
done here on the ear cups and on the
headband and you start to put together
as to why these costs so much now they
are available in both black and white
the white version can get quite dirty
easily and for sure it will pick up a
few blemishes here and there the left
ear cup contains the retractable
microphone with built-in LED to indicate
when mute and on the other side a
headphone pass-through for connecting an
additional headphones perhaps if you're
using this on the go for music and want
a friend to join in the tunes but as you
see from putting them on they are far
from low-profile and I don't think I
would use them for on the go the large
aircrafts don't exactly articulate into
place and leave small spaces at the
bottom so you have to sort of angle them
slightly forward for a more snug fit
now personally I don't find them as
comfortable as the original siberius and
while the ear cups are somewhat thick
after about an hour I could feel the
uncomfortable pressure settling in but
on a better note no sweaty ears thanks
to actual leather surface they do use
anti tangle cord that is not removable
and at the end has the SteelSeries
proprietary jack that you can either
connect the microphone the headphone
splitter the 90 degree headphone jack
and also included is an extension cord
volume control is located on the right
ear cup which is very convenient no need
to reach in for inline controls and on
the left ear cup we have the mic mute
function now of course you really notice
the lighting feature which is something
unique and adds to the premium of the
elites the illumination is very bright
with multi color options and different
notes available but since you never
really see the headset while it's on
your head it doesn't really make a
difference plus it only works when
plugged in using the SteelSeries
connector into the included USB sound
card the included USB sound card has a
very minimalistic menu where you can
change the color and the effective
illumination enable dolby surround
adjust the presets and manually play
with the equalizer activate mic noise
reduction and compression and adjust
microphone volume and you can also
create profiles that will auto launch
with an application so that's always
convenient now I was expecting a bit
more clarity out of the microphone for
the $200 headset but I guess they sort
of make up for it in the mic noise
reduction so turn that on it reduces the
amplification and actually makes the
microphone quieter and we also have
compression turn that on it auto levels
the microphone for a more uniform volume
now some of the advantages of using the
USB sound card or to adjust your
equalizer and enable Dolby virtual
surround but the sound card included
with the elites lacks the power to drive
the headset to higher volumes and
SteelSeries drivers are really nicely
tuned for detail and USB soundcard just
doesn't showcase the elites and its full
glory
enabling Dolby surround sound does
expand the soundstage so your audio
environment is a bit larger but things
do sound more Hollow and less details so
there is some lost potential and so I
plug the elites into our audio engine
DAC and right away the drivers sounded
much much better
SteelSeries are known for bright sound
with excellent emphasis on the highs and
detailed mid-range without having the
intense bass now because the closed type
design the soundstage isn't very large
and audio elements do feel a little
cramped in but they do make up for it in
the detail so hearing somebody running
up behind you or behind
wall is what the elites do best I love
the clarity this produced without any EQ
tweaking now because the thick and large
air pads I was expecting there to be a
dominant presence on base which took me
by surprise because the base was almost
non evident the air cups would
experience slight vibrations in the game
but without any complimenting base which
was just very strange I did manage to
bring the base slightly forward with
some EQ adjustments for just a more
fuller sound but the way the driver is
tuned seemed to complement more the
mid-range and the sharp treble which for
in-game detail is awesome but I wasn't
entirely happy with the weak base
response and I will conclude by saying
that this is certainly an upgrade in
terms of build quality we have the
volume control and mic mute function is
well integrated into the headset and
steel series drivers are nicely detailed
without overpowering bass so positional
awareness of audio elements around you
is one of the best things about this
headset now when it comes to utilizing
Dolby Surround through the included USB
sound card it sounds as very unnatural
and Hollow and even at the hundred
percent volume up lack the power to
drive the headset to its full potential
so both detail and volume the soundstage
is quite small due to closed design and
the illumination effect is only
available through the USB card which I
wouldn't recommend and all of this for
the $200 with the USB dongle is a little
bit too high considering audio
reproduction is quite poor so using a
DAC or a more appropriate sound card to
get the best out of the elite is
recommended so guys this includes our
view of the Siberia elite let us know in

this illumination effect thanks for
