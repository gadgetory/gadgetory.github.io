brought to you by and CIX
technology connected one of the great
things about attending CES is that you
get to sample some things that you
probably would never actually expect and
one of the great things that we're
seeing here is some amazing high
fidelity
HiFi cans we saw some at Sennheiser and
now we're actually here at Stax and one
thing that we can tell you is that these
are some of the most real and airy and
concise set of headphones that I have
ever tried on they are by far the most
premium that I've actually put on my
head and that includes the Orpheus I
actually am a huge fan of this specific
technology now what it was explained to
me is that there they are
high voltage which basically means that
the actual system is fed into a very
thin set of foil which is packed between
a couple pieces of metal now it's
similar to what other people are doing
but the way that the foil vibrates with
these guys is that it vibrates very very
tightly so you're gonna get a tight and
real sound in comparison to other people
where it's a very there's a lot of
movement so it's not necessarily as
accurate these have an incredible sound
signature
they have incredible staging and are by
far some of the best cans that I have
ever ever put on now they have IMS or in
ear monitors that range from 550 and
they also have a set of cans that could
go anywhere from a couple thousand to
6500 dollars now the majority of these
sets are exactly that they're sets and
include docks
they're incredibly high-quality decks
and you know I consider myself very
lucky that I've had the opportunity to
listen to these and you know what guys
if you have a chance to listen to him I
definitely recommend it alright so guys
we're gonna take a look at the
progression of stocks headphones in just
a couple of seconds but this is the sr3
now this specific model is from the 60s
and we're gonna go on to talk about a
couple other ones that are further down
the chain but there is an SR one and as
of right now there's only three to be
known in existence one is with the
collector the second one is in the
factory and the third one unfortunately
was stolen on the way here to see us
2014 really
unfortunate story it really sucks and I
don't even think the person realizes
what they have in their possession
because it's really a piece of art now
moving on from the 60s we're going to
take a look here at the SRA which is
representing the 70s and the 80s the SR
double-oh-seven
mk2 which represents the 90s and 2000's
and these here the SR double O 9 which
are the current in model cans now guys
these are by far some of the best
electrostatic cans are over ear
headphones that you could possibly buy
in this market and you know what I feel
incredibly privileged to have the
opportunity to see these and listen to
them today so what I would like you to
do is I would like you to take a look at
everything else that we have here on
Facebook for our CES 2014 coverage like
