great technology selections and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Herick
max welcome to another video and in this
episode we'll be doing a what's in my
bag type of explaining what type of
equipment I carry with me whenever I go
on trips like Computex and CES but some
of you may know that I have relocated to
Berlin Germany for four months until
January yet I still have to produce all
the awesome content that we put out on
the channel and therefore some of you
you know posted a little Twitter image
and Instagram to see if you guys would
be interested in seeing what's in my bag
and therefore we get that awesome
positive response and this would be an
interesting video so I want to show you
because this backpack can fit a lot of
equipment that I need to you know to
produce to film to edit and to put out
the content for the herb Knox YouTube
channel and therefore I thought those
would be interesting because it is an
incredible amount of equipment that can
fit inside this bag as I put laid it out
on the table I was actually very
surprised myself as to how much really
stuff that I brought with me so without
any further ado let's get on with this
what's in my bag video and so starting
with the bag the most important piece of
this segment
is my lower pro pro runner 350 8w for
its build quality the external features
and the internal flexibility this offers
that allows me to carry as much as I
need to
we have extra safety straps on each side
to make sure nobody gets easy access a
tripod holder in the center that I have
utilized countless of times when
traveling to Computex and CES as well
plus there's a built-in the rain cover
to keep your expensive parts all nice
and dry so seeing this fully packed
let's start with a slider that I have
attached in the center that I can
actually carry on my back as it is
compact enough and it's also light
enough this is the sin of a doozie with
really solid build quality plus carbon
fiber rails so it's not as heavy as this
looks the carriage does not wobble in
any way and movement is extremely smooth
you just have to learn how to come to a
smooth stop it is made in Canada and
was an absolutely needed investment for
this trip for my tripod that is also
made in Canada and it's also carbon
fiber as the goal was to travel as light
as possible
it holds the camera and a slider very
well it has Center elevation adjustment
aside from the elevation adjustment from
the legs obviously but my favorite
feature is the built-in ball head that
allows proper alignment when filming on
uneven surfaces now for my head this is
just a simple amount photo 7:01 HDV
video head and to come back through the
bag on the side we have the Sennheiser
HD 650 s I just can't go anywhere
without them opening the first slot of
the bag we find an in wind aluminum
mouse mat a sweet leather business card
holder for my trips a flashlight is
always handy in darker situations and
the last piece in this pocket is my
Nvidia shield tablet and now moving on
to the main compartment but first let's
recap at just how much stuff I was able
to compact into this bag it's a little
intimidating now that I look at it
here's a more organized view of all the
ingredients that create my portable
workstation possible so starting with
the cover in the lower pocket I keep all
of my cables so I know where to look if
I need any that includes all of my USB
cables my headphone cables because they
are detachable from the headphones
themselves plus an Ethernet cable just
in case in one of the top pockets I keep
my USB 3 card reader and the camera
strap along with many rubber bands to
help with smoother pans and tilts on my
tripod head I also do carry around a
lens cleaning kit so a microfiber cloth
and air blower cleaning liquid and a
small brush to get rid of the dust on
the glass and getting into the main
compartment actually the heaviest piece
and this whole thing is the base for my
microphone stand it's just full iron
it's not very pleasant to carry around
followed by a metal pop filter and of
course a screw driver you can't build a
system without one next I bought my USB
d3 DAC from audio engine that's compact
and produces clean their audio than my
onboard sound of
notebook of course I need a shark filter
for my recording mic a 1080p webcam to
record the damn good show my audio
technica at2020 I used to record all my
videos it is also located in the
protective leather pouch a metal pole
for the microphone stand followed by the
shore in earphones also protected from
the equipment elements in this bag
it sits in its own pouch and our antlion
mode mic 4.0 that i yet have to review
now one of the last recording pieces
there's the scarlett 2i2 it fits well
inside the top pouch that is used to
record the voiceovers a little piece
hiding in the corner is a hot shoe mount
and that is used for various purposes to
mount lights microphones and sometimes
even external monitors next I have a
polarizing filter for my main lens the
zoom h4n is nicely cuddled right decided
and below them are my two primary lenses
so the bauer 35 millimeter t 1.5
cinestyle lens and a sigma 105 f 2.8
macro my two most used lenses for our
videos so you may already know that I am
recording this with the 5d mark ii and
my travel pancake lens from Canon the 40
millimeter F 2.8 that adds almost
nothing to the size nor the weight of
the system and this just stays on my
shoulder when I travel the pop filter
for the zoom covers my wireless mic
system from Sennheiser
that gives me that convenience of course
free recording next is a simple card
pouch for extra CF and SD cards then we
see the HD 8 DJ headphone from
Sennheiser that are folded nicely to fit
inside the bag and they cover my
favorite optical mouse the my onyx nail
7000 so we're almost done here the
neighboring compartment holds two
external drives to which footage and
project files are transferred for backup
next is the battery compartment for the
camera and a few rechargeable triple-a
batteries and lastly the micro USB
charger for my phone and the tablet and
my notebook power brick that luckily is
thin enough to fit into the bottom of
the
aggghhhhh and finally there is a side
laptop pocket where i stash away my 15
inch notebook and that's basically how
my portable workstation fits inside my
pro runner I'm very impressed with
myself at how I can transport all this
recording gear inside the back plus my
audio equipment and video equipment that
I just can't go without and all thanks
to proper compartment separation
although I will admit that it's a
complete pain to carry around this fully
loaded backpack and so that concludes
our what's in my bag video if you enjoy
this make sure to leave us a like and
let us know if I forgot something
crucial for my four months trip as
