know I am always excited about new
wireless peripherals especially gaming
headsets to complete my perfect wireless
gaming set and up until now I've been
using the cloud flight from HyperX and
this has held my the title of my
favorite wireless gaming headset so
let's see if the new courser HS 70 can
take its spot right after this the new
master liquid ml aia liquid coolers from
Coolermaster come in both 120 and 240
millimeter variants now with addressable
RGB LEDs both the fans and the pump that
can be controlled via this hub with
options to adjust the lighting effects
and speed along with the ability to
control them through the respective
motherboard software check out the ML
120 and ML 240 are a iOS down below and
before we begin check out our ultimate
wireless gaming headset comparison right
over here it's pretty epic
I guarantee it and of course pricing
available for anything in discussed in
the video will be linked in the
description all right so this is the
wireless HS 70 following in the
footsteps of the HS 50 that is my
favorite budget pair at only $50 that
has this beautiful blend of features
build quality sound quality and the age
of 70 carries that momentum forward so
from a build quality perspective it's a
sturdy and the no creek design which is
awesome you can flex it without hearing
anything moving on the frame we have
good size extensions and confident
movement on the ear cups for that slight
readjustment on your head and from a
design perspective it's super simple so
basically just an all-black body with
this gray thread on the headband that I
think is the best-looking one out of the
three models available we have a volume
control dial and the mic mute button and
the microUSB port for charging and the
power button on the right side so there
is no RGB no glossy plastic sticking out
which is I think is a great departure
from their previous course avoid RGB
headsets now comfort wise I would say
it's a comfortable pair the clamping
force is just balanced but the ear cups
could be slightly thicker to create a
better seal but generally the low
profile nature and the lightweight
nature of the frame means there are no
pressure points and while it is about 15
grams heavier than the HS 50 I have not
experienced any discomfort
throughout my two weeks of using
this guy now the one thing I appreciate
are the audio cues powering on mic on so
when you mute the microphone or when you
enable surround sound surround on it's
awesome to hear that but the most
important ones for me has been the auto
shutdown feature so if you round the
headset when it's going to sleep you'll
be able to hear that through the headset
which is awesome so you're aware that it
is going off and you can turn it back on
when you're going to be using it again
and I do like that you can set the
amount of minutes after which the
headset will shut off by itself if there
is no audio playing which is awesome to
preserve battery life now for
connectivity you need to plug in the USB
receiver it will work with the
PlayStation as well so that's awesome
and you can also listen to the headset
while it is charging which is great now
for wireless range no issues in my space
about five to six meters away in my
bedroom with two walls in between no
interruptions potentially the signal
quality may drop but I have not
experienced any drops which is awesome
now for sound quality I want to compare
the HS 72 the cloud flight because that
has been my favorite wireless headset so
far but the HS 70 is built better I
would say it's more durable in the long
term because the cloud flight is a bit
more plastic it is lighter which is more
comfortable as well but I feel like it's
got more rotating joints and the size
extensions don't feel as sturdy as the
HS 70 so in that regard I would say you
can be a little bit more rough with this
guy then you can with the cloud flight
so first the volume output on the HS 70
I feel is more powerful versus the cloud
flight which is a good thing if you
really like loud music but the
definition and the overall clarity of
the sound signature on the cloud flight
is better because with the age of 70 I
feel like it has a slightly more open
sound stage therefore things don't sound
as detailed as a really closed sound
stage on the cloud flight and I feel
like that is by design with the age of
70 because it's kind of like a semi-open
headset so you can have a bit of sound
leakage and you can still hear the
external environment you know the
isolation on this headset is not a
hundred percent but the benefit of this
semi-open design is the sound imaging
and like this really good
directional awareness of your
environment so for example with quake
champions this whole verticality of
gameplay is awesome because you can hear
a player above you and anticipate his
movement I was able to pinpoint exactly
where things were coming from with the
age of 70 which is awesome you know you
can still hear everything with the cloud
flight as well but with the hsm of these
things are slightly more expanded
without sacrificing too much on the
detail and which is why the treble on
here is slightly boosted now the bass
response on these is kind of Airy and
flat in the default eq profile we do
have the bass boost profile that really
does enrich the lower end and makes the
whole sound signature a little bit
heavier but because these don't create
like a super seal around your ears the
bass response on the cloud flight is
better because the seal is also better
and so I would classify the age of 70 to
be like a technically open sound versus
the cloud flight that is more fun but
with a closer soundstage
now as for surround sound it can only be
enabled through the actual software you
cannot enable it through the headset
itself which I guess is fine you kind of
make up your mind to enable it and just
forget about it
and in here I actually don't mind it it
does expand the soundstage so everything
feels a bit further away but because of
that additional treble you know boost on
the high end you still receive a lot of
detail and it doesn't sound too muffled
so surround sound on here is actually
pretty decent now from a battery life
perspective I'm pretty happy so they
recharge quickly and now and a half to
100% which is awesome and number two
they claim 16 hours of battery life so
eight hours and one day eight hours next
day then recharge which has been sort of
my experience the only crappy thing is
there is no easily accessible battery
life indicator you have to go in the
software click settings and only there
there's a tiny little battery % it
should be nice it was front and center
so you know exactly how much battery you
have left so you don't run out of juice
in the middle of the session alright so
what you're hearing now is the
microphone from the HS 70 it is quite
flexible it is also removable but it has
no windscreen which is kind of
unfortunate for this price point
let me just hammer out on some keys
these are reds or browns but you know
you can still pick them up it does mute
the sound there
a bit of compression it's not as
detailed or clear but for wireless
headset I would say it's totally
possible and you know you can still hear
me and there's good amount of
sensitivity on the microphone so I don't
have to be yelling into it for you to
pick up any volume the cloud flight so
this one sounds the same in terms of
compression but it has a bit more bass
or the sound is a little bit more full
in terms of compression of the actual
switches you let me know which one you
think sounds better in terms of
cancelling out those keyboard stuff but
this one is a bit more expensive so yes
the microphone here is better and this
one also has no windscreen on there so
it will pick up all the breath yeah all
right so to conclude EHS 70 is an
awesome pair for the price you can pick
up the wired version for literally half
the price if Wireless is not a priority
for you but these will be replacing my
cloud flights because they have gotten
way too loose over time especially the
swivel joints it's great they can sit on
your neck but I'm just worried for
longevity of something like the cloud
flights because the age of 70 is just
built so much better and I would say
they would last longer as well and it
will now join my wireless set with the
k63 keyboards and the g3 or five mouse
they each of 70 is now part of the whole
wireless family thanks for watching make
