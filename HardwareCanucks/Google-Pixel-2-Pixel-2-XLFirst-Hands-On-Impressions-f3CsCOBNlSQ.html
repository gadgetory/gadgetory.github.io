smartphone is finally over Google has
bestowed upon us two of their flagship
smartphones for 2017 and let me tell you
the competition is getting tougher which
is a good thing and I can't wait to give
you guys my full review on these two new
devices so what are we looking at well
say hello to the pixel 2 and the pixel 2
XL these are successors to the very
popular pixel and pixel accel
smartphones and interestingly enough
Google is taking a completely different
approach with these smartphones
unlike the competition by combining AI
software and hardware and we'll talk
about that in a bit I was fortunate
enough to get my hands on these two new
devices so here's my initial take on
them but first a quick message from our
sponsor the Graham spectrum keyboard by
Tesoro comes with a new mechanical agile
switch with low profile key caps with
super fast response and shorter
actuation distance plus all the
customization included with RGB lighting
and macros for a premium user alright as
always let's talk about the design and I
want to kick things off with the pixel
to excel because I feel like a lot of
people might end up leaning towards this
guy over the pixel - and I'll elaborate
on that a bit later the excel is crafted
in an all aluminum body but on top of
that they've added a premium hybrid
coating material that kind of resembles
the texture on my IKEA desk I'm not
joking it seriously does feel similar I
can't technically describe the exact
material being used here but it really
does feel similar which isn't a bad
thing to be honest though in fact both
the pixel 2 and the pixel two Excel
feature the exact same material they're
built really well and I preferred this
design over clasp backs found on other
flagships offered by Samsung and LG the
downside to an all aluminum body is the
lack of wireless charging and
unfortunately both pixel phones don't
support that the display on the pixel to
excel spans at 6 inches and it features
an 18 by 9 P OLED display with a
resolution of 28 80 by 1440 so it's
similar to the resolution found on the
LG G 6
meanwhile the pixel 2 features a 5-inch
1080p AMOLED display now to be honest
I'm really not liking the design on the
new pixel 2 smartphone because it just
doesn't fit in with the rest of the
smartphone flagships of 2017 the thick
bezels
Stane doubt mean it stands out in a
weird sort of way because if you'd
compare it to the competition like the
Samsung Galaxy s8 the LG g6
it just doesn't fit in I mean if the
smartphone was released like two years
ago I wouldn't mind the design at all
because it would then fit in within the
standards pack of the day but now that
we're so much into admiring the design
from Samsung and LG it just stands out
in a weird way
now the pixel to excel is a completely
different story I absolutely love the
screen to body ratio on that phone
compared to the pixel - it does come
with an 18 by 9 aspect ratio and it did
manage to squeeze a 6-inch display so
that's pretty awesome I really can't
wait to get my hands on that phone
compared to the pixel - so Mike spike in
my excitement level is a lot more higher
on the pixel - Excel versus the pixel -
that's just my opinion now one of the
major advantages to this design is the
implementation of front-facing speakers
and Google did manage to fit two of them
on the pixel - but interestingly enough
it's also available on the pixel to
excel despite the almost bezel-less
design and that to me is pretty amazing
now when you compare the excel to
something like the Galaxy Note 8 you're
obviously going to notice the difference
in bezels it's hardly noticeable on the
note 8 but I think watching content on
the pixel excel - is gonna be a lot more
appealing since you won't get those
weird distortions at the edges wrapping
up the rest of specs both the pixel 2
and the pixel to excel feature the
snapdragon 835 cpu 4 gigabytes of frame
ip67 water-resistant rating 12 megapixel
rear-facing cameras which we'll talk
about shortly
both variants come in 64 and 128 K by
variants but unfortunately they're not
expandable really Google you you really
have to do that take away the most
important feature that we all cherish I
mean if you look at the competition the
galaxy s safe and don't aid the LG G 6
the V 13 they all come with storage
expansions why not this phone I don't
know but hey they're at least giving us
unlimited storage for photos and videos
in original quality for three years and
high-quality storage unlimited after
that coming to think of it it's actually
a much better deal than paying for
iCloud storage for iPhone users so Apple
if you're taking notes then this is a
great thing to add a nail
okay so let's talk about the camera it's
a 12 megapixel shooter with an F 1.8
aperture and it comes with optical image
stabilization as well as electronic
image stabilization so this should
complement low-light photography as well
as video recording which by the way can
shoot up to 4k at 30 frames per second
1080p up to 120 frames per second and
720p up to 240 frames per second there's
also a portrait mode that blurs the
background to make the subject stand out
and here's the most interesting part
unlike other smartphones that utilize
two separate cameras to emulate that
portrait effect Google is heavily
banking on AI and it's machine learning
capabilities so what's happening here is
that Google is using their dual pixel
technology to create this depth map that
distinguishes both left and right pixels
and then it across check Sid with their
image database that contains facial
analysis and the ability to identify
objects once that process is complete it
then refines the edges of that subject
that you've shot and it blurs out the
background now after playing around with
it I was pretty impressed it does seem
to do a pretty good job isolating the
subject from the background without
portraying any weird artifacts again
this all depends on your lighting
situation the composition and how
complicated the shot is this also
applies to the front-facing camera so
I'll definitely be testing this out in
depth in my full review so stay tuned
for that now supposedly given the great
camera hardware and the combination of
AI Google was also able to implement
google lens which is a feature that's
baked into Google assistant so
essentially what happens is you can use
this to point at subjects using the
camera and it'll pull up appropriate
results so in my case I was able to
point it at a camera and it was able to
identify what type of camera it was and
you know where I can purchase that
camera with all the appropriate links
within Google's search engine and I
guess that's what I'm looping back into
my first point that I mentioned in the
beginning of this video where Google is
taking a completely different approach
unlike some other smartphone brands
where they're combining AI software and
hardware to create this seamless
experience to make your life easier
again this has to be validated so like I
mentioned the beginning like just can't
wait to get my hands on the pixel to
accel smartphone and test out some of
the AI features that's built in Google
has also implemented a squeeze
functionality on the pixel 2 and the
pixel
to excel essentially when you squeeze a
smartphone it activates Google assistant
regardless if you're on the lockscreen
or if you're just using the phone in
general I don't think I'm probably gonna
use this feature
I do wish that I was able to remap this
command to something to open up a
certain application or some sort but I'm
so glad that there is no dedicated
button to activate Google assistant
because that would be such a
disappointment I'm just so glad it's a
squeeze functionality it can be turned
off so that is something that I'm so
grateful I should also mention that this
is a Google device meaning it's gonna
run stock Android you know how much I
love stock Android you don't have to
worry about custom skins or whatnot it's
just pure Android it's gonna help a lot
with performance because you don't have
to worry about
bloatware applications and most
importantly it's gonna receive updates
force online when compared to other
flagship smartphones from Samsung and LG
also if you were wondering Google did
decide to eliminate the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the pixel 2 and the
pixel to excel it's a sad day for
everyone I did not expect this at all
but it's something that we have to
accept as a reality and at least you
know they've included a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack adapter within the box so
there's that and I want to wrap things
up with pricing for these two new
smartphones so the pixel 2 starts at six
hundred $49 for the 64 gigabyte variant
and it comes in three color options
there is just black kind of blue and
clearly white yeah those are the color
options it really the pixel to excel can
be picked up for $849 and this is for
the 64 gigabyte variant and there are
two color options so there is just black
and black and white so let me know your
thoughts on google's announcement on the
pixel 2 and the pixel to excel what do
you guys think of the design the specs
and just the whole Google ecosystem and
more specifically I'd like to hear your
thoughts on the camera do you think it's
gonna hold up that well with Samsung's
live focused feature the iPhones
portrait mode and even the oneplus fives
portrait effect I'd like to hear your
thoughts leave them in the comments down
