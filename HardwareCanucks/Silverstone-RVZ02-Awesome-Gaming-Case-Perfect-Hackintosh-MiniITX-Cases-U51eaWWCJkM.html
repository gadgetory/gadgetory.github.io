two-time case of the Year winner fantex
the always incredible Corsair and NCIX
so I'm sure you guys are aware of how
much praise Silverstone receives for
their innovative and space-efficient
designs so at CES they showcased the
Raven rv0 to build wood even slimmer
layout but surprisingly without too many
compromises in fact they've improved on
many internal brackets to make the
assembly process even smoother you can
see just how thinner the re Co 2 is
compared to the rv0 one
so what they've done is remove the
intake fans on both sides so now your
GPU and the CPU coolers are left
completely on their own but because
they're so close to the side panel they
should not need any additional airflow
support only problem you can see is the
plastic window on each side that doesn't
allow for a fan filter to be installed
and that in my books should be fixed
somehow for the final consumer release
the rv0 2 of course being part of the
Raven series looks the part
now with the subtle angular shapes on
the exterior with a pair of USB 3 ports
along with audio jacks hiding behind
this raven cover so stay tuned for our
full review of the rv0 2 when we finally
get a sample silverstone also showed off
some other mini ITX iterations of their
new storage cases built extremely well
out of full aluminum that's really thick
so pricing is to be expected to be
really high we're talking about high
niche cases for very specific use the
chassis itself though is beautiful with
a single power button in the front along
with activity lights and a muted
embedded Silverstone logo in the corner
that's barely visible and those that
want that Macintosh feel for sure will
find these spinning the main difference
between the two versions of the case
would be the storage component as both
require and Mini ITX boards both have
the same GPU compatibility that require
a low-profile PCI adapter so one of the
cases comes with 6 hot swappable 2 and a
half inch drives that you simply pull
from the top and you can see the hot
swappable module underneath plus there
are two additional two in half inch
drive brackets behind the main cage
while for the other version we're
looking at two three and a half and two
the half-inch drive supported that isn't
much so you can make up your mind about
what Silverstone is trying to do here
perhaps some HTPC or a kick-ass looking
server machine there is a single fan at
the bottom the channels airflow up that
is dust proof but from what we can see
this is a beautiful aluminum chassis but
with very specific and you can say
limited functionality</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
