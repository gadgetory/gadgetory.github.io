today we'll take a look at an exciting
solid-state drive that really challenges
the concept of consumer spending per
gigabyte of capacity these are the adler
320 and 640 gigabyte models along with
the SSD to go pro for external SSD
solutions now these are from an Austrian
company angel bird that are just now
making their way into our North American
market and priced at a premium of 150
per gigabyte and 190 per gigabyte
respectively these consumer-oriented
drives may hit some roadblocks as such
luxury items may be hard to justify
given the existing competing SSDs are
almost half the price so then what do
these drives bring to the table and the
main part of the equation is the new
controller from Nova chips called named
Bugatti maximum i/o ops for the other
drives are rated for 70 K read and 60 K
rights with 530 and for 50 megabytes per
second respectively housed an incredibly
robust aluminum casing angel bird makes
sure to deliver quality for such a
premium inside we find twenty-ninth ICS
instead of the conventional 16 with heat
path to complement the cooling now one
of the disappointing aspects of these
drives is angel bird opted for slower
and the end which is reliable but
competing drives at half the price use
more superior and faster and named ICS
so angel bird is really counting on the
new controller to win over those few
enthusiasts so the new nds 3600 a
arm-based controller aka the Bugatti is
more concerned with consistent and
larger performance and deeper queue
depth than just burst performance this
is because the new 10 channel design
instead of the conventional or the
typical eight that has incredible
advantages over consistent speeds
regardless of capacity former has also
been redesigned for more efficient
performance meaning no cycles are wasted
on low-level tasks and instead the
controllers workload is dynamically
adjusted based on the real-time iOS
tres each adler SSD also has a moderate
7% capacity
set aside so this spare space can be
used for bed blocked replacement for
example but most importantly allows for
access to free and clean blocks
whenever the drive is at almost full
capacity the SSD to go pro 2.0 follows
the same steps with an extremely robust
aluminum frame and elegant design for
those that need reliable external
storage now one unique aspect of this
drive is the flexibility for
connectivity incorporating both USB 3.0
and eSATA options with appropriate
cables included now finally let's take a
look at the benchmarks and one
interesting aspect of the bugatti
controller is revealed here as the lower
capacity SSD performed basically in line
with the 640 gigabyte model this is
unusual as normally larger capacity
drives are marginally faster now while
the results are very good you can notice
that the adler drives do not dominate
within the synthetic benchmarks this is
because the older and slower names but
it does reveal the potential of the
bugatti controller as it's able to
maintain performance much better than
most drives the slower USB 3.0
performance on the SSD to go is the
result of the Osmania USB controller
with stock drivers but this drive really
shines an eSATA mode as you can see it's
almost on par with its internal
counterparts so I gotta say that angel
Burt has done many things right
with the new adler drives and the SSD to
go pro 2.0 starting with the excellent
build quality and incorporation of 20
NAND ICS instead of the typical 16 the
biggest selling point of these drives is
the new Nova chips controller that has
been redesigned basically from the
ground up to deliver consistent
performance with the 10 channel
architecture instead of typical eight
and our performance results reveal
exactly that that's almost on par with
competing drives that use the fast
renamed the SSD to go pro is also an
extremely attractive external solution
with very good performance simply
because there's nothing like it on the
market
now obviously angel bird's choice of man
here is not optimal and the Adler drives
just can't dominate because of that and
that's something I'm an expectation at
such a high price per gigabyte having
said that the bugatti controller is
impressive and we're giving the new
adler SSDs the damn good award while the
SSD to gopro is certainly one unique
external solution with basically nothing
like it on the market and deserve to
damn good and damn innovative words well
