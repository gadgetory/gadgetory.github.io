Knutson welcome back to another view
within the sphere of gaming the audio we
are usually bombarded with intense bass
so your head can Rumble when you enter a
firefight but I think what comes to
gaming headsets there are usually three
things to look out for and that's
Comfort soundstage and frequency
response so two for shout out this
review I'm happy to report that these
are all things funk has taken into
account when developing their first
gaming headset this is the HS 260 and
they are entering the market with a very
interesting and quite attractive price
point of $80 start with the build
quality they are made of plastic but
aren't in any way flimsy they actually
very flexible and obviously size
adjustable the ear cups are rubber
coated the same type of coating as found
on their MK 460 keyboard it feels nice
but as you see it does leave visible
finger marks the perforation on the ear
cups is also just a design feature these
are not open style headsets
although funk does include two sets of
ear cushions that are really easy to
swap so we have the valor cups that
offer a more open audio environment with
wider soundstage but in turn less
isolation it actually helps to cool your
ears slightly better while the leather
cushions provide a more isolated sound
and a slightly more pronounced bass
response the HS 260 is an over ear
headset actually they are comfortable
and lightweight only at 370 grams and
while the headband has this leather
padding I wish it would be slightly
softer and deeper as after a few hours
of gaming it's the only pressure point
that I certainly felt the left ear cup
has the volume adjustments a super
convenient to adjust without needing to
reach for inline controls and the very
unique feature of the HS 260 is this
interchangeable and swappable headphone
/ microphone port the microphone is
detachable and social flexible and also
has the mute function at the bottom
there as you get here it's actually
quite clean and clear audio now it
doesn't fully cancel out the background
noise but it would be totally acceptable
for gaming now depending on the
orientation of your setup you can
connect the detachable cord to either
left to right
in my case I was using the audio engine
DAC for testing which is on my left so I
used the left ear cup for the cable and
the right ear cup for the microphone the
cable is long and is braided but one
thing I wanted to point out was the lack
of indication whether you're using the
mic or headphone jack eyesight from the
small color tips at the end there it
would have been nice to include the
standard sort of graphic for easier
separation for which cable is what the
HS 260 features 50 millimeter drivers
and a pretty standard impedance of 32
ohms and from what I've been told
specifically been designed or tuned for
the most optimal sound resolution and
detail for gaming so here is the
frequency response graph that isn't as
flat so don't be expecting the best
audio fidelity but for a gaming oriented
headset the bass response is dipped in
the low end making gunfire and rockets
that much more evident with tight and
deep bass especially when using the
leather pads the bass doesn't drown out
the mid-range detail and was actually
very impressive for an $80.00 headset
moving on to the main range response
where they show here is a slight boost
in the upper portion so basically speech
enhancements to be able to hear your
teammates clearly but the mid-range is
likely recessed resulting in less detail
and somewhat muted response listening to
September from Earth Wind and Fire and
those background instruments are almost
non evident and instrument
differentiation was lacking however
nothing is lost a little magic from the
EQ to wake up the mid-range and you're
back in business I was very surprised at
how well the drivers could handle a
little extra push on the low range so I
pushed the bass more forward without any
noticeable distortion the high range on
the HS 260 is pretty excellent with nice
sharp treble but not overly bright so
hearing that sniper fire just missing a
head is extremely satisfying as the
drivers are capable of handling trouble
without too much brightness and but I
actually do prefer slightly brighter
sound and as I said earlier playing with
a EQ to really fine-tune the drivers for
your own personal preference can't be
done without destroying the balance of
the overall frequency and I have to give
it to funk for an overly nicely tuned
drivers that make a gaming experience
fun with ex
on stereo imaging so being able to
pinpoint direction of audio elements but
when it comes to soundstage and
positional audio I think in the entire
gaming audio realm we could use more
open style or semi open style headphones
or headsets for a large and open
soundstage now due to the limitations of
this closed type design found on the HS
260 your audio environment isn't very
large but funk tries to mitigate this
with the extra velour ear questions then
don't concentrate sound within the ear
cup but instead a lot for more
distortion resulting in while soundstage
and further improving positional
awareness but I did actually prefer the
leather cups more for gaming to get that
really tight and deep bass that I love
every time an explosion went off by me
but most importantly it doesn't
sacrifice on the detail throughout the
frequency range so that's very important
and I'm actually quite happy with the
outcome of funks entrance into gaming
audio the interchangeable ear cushions
and swappable cable and microphone are
all excellent features for user
preference and flexibility on headset
volume wheel is always convenient and
the HS 260 are very comfortable drivers
have been tuned for gaming and that's
exactly what they deliver with tight
bass an excellent treble response
mid-range has been tuned for in-game
voice but is slightly muted causing some
loss in detail separation but nothing a
little equalizer can't solve but I do
find that the lack of any indication on
the mic headphone jacks aside from the
color on the tips there's just a slight
oversight that perhaps could easily be
fixed and I will conclude by stating
that I do like this simple approach with
the HS 260 without overly flashy designs
and really standing behind the slogan of
functionality perfected as this
certainly is a damn good headset that
has a lot of potential with a pretty
decent value so thanks guys for watching
