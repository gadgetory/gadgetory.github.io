like I haven't done the case review in a
very long time so let's change that
no no I'm coming for you fainted shift X
no no no no no no no but first I gotta
clear out my space did you guys know
that all faiths and cultures come double
box to protect the case inside and if
fred was real he wouldn't approve Wow
look at that size difference this is the
mesh if I see nice and compact ATX this
is the p300 it tiny bit smaller also ATX
so is it worth the $59 let's check it
out oh the cooler master MS 120 brings
an affordable keyboard and mouse combo
to your gaming setup with mechanical
like switches and clicky feedback
beautiful RGB support with plenty of
lighting effects and a gaming mouse that
is both comfortable and has excellent
tracking check it out in the description
below so this my friends is the new fan
Tech's Eclipse p300 enclosure it's the
cheapest case fantex has put out at only
$59 and it's got mainly excited for its
tempered glass integration simple full
metal frame and even built in RGB
illumination on the side that is
tasteful with options for expansion if
you buy the LED strip and on paper the
p300 is the budget case to buy with ATX
motherboard support it fits up to a 280
million radiator in the front and it's
fully dust proof with removable filters
of all the air flow channels so the
power supply area top exhaust and two
small filters on the front panel it
almost seems too good to be true in the
package this compact and here it is next
the s340 elite mid tower on my current
mid tower of choice the mesh fic from
practical design all right so this price
point that $59 is appealing for the
market
we love temper glass side panel we love
the full metal body but exactly how much
are we sacrificing when we reach that
low budget price point well you know
what the compromises here are actually
minimal for example the bottom portion
of the case which has the power supply
shroud is also part of the exterior
frame and this way we have a smaller
temporal glass window that saves on cost
without sacrificing the structural
integrity of that full metal frame it
still looks good with a shroud exposed
like that but of course a full glass
panel looks more uniform and I would say
even more premium like on the s340 elite
the mount here is very basic with four
thumb screws and we have this tiny lip
on the bottom on which the glass can sit
to help with the mounting procedure and
that's highly appreciated the other side
panel is fully solid with captive thumb
screws and I'm so happy to see that
becoming the standard even with in this
price category for airflow a single 120
mil exhaust fan is included you could
populate one more at the top and the
front of the case supports a 240 or a
280 millimeter radiator of course with
their respective fans without entering
into the bottom chamber so the power
supply shroud is fully closed off except
for those small cable cut outs
underneath the motherboard all right so
radiators my giant ek 280 moment
radiator does not fit it is simply too
tall and the frame cannot accommodate
for 320 millimeters in height for a 280
million radiator so that's out of the
equation it too for my radiator fits no
problem so that's good however my X 62
from NZXT the kraken x 60 tube is 315
millimeters in height and that has
compatibility issues as it's bumping
into those front power connectors and
fantex realize this mistake and they'll
be releasing a new power and connector
module for the top so you don't have to
worry about compatibility issues with
your 280 moment radiators so the X 62
and others will fit but of course with
the current patch as long as your
radiator is 27 millimeters in thickness
or shorter than 311 millimeters in
height you should be okay and the i/o by
the way is very simple with dual USB 3s
there's the audio jacks and a button to
cycle colors for the side
or the optional LED strips or even the
Halos RGB fan frames and for storage the
drive cage is accessible from the front
when you remove the panel the caddies
are SSD compatible and they face the
front of the case to create enough room
around this area for cable management
this also means that power supply is
longer than 160 millimeters might have
trouble fitting in but the drive cage is
removable if you need that extra length
for clearance and if you do remove it a
single SSD bracket will save your day
it's included at the back so what is it
like building inside a $59 enclosure in
2017
let's find out also the accessories box
don't include much
and so the assembly was pretty much
flawless I do appreciate the little
things like the middle motherboard
standoff that catches the motherboard or
appropriately small cutouts on the front
of the case to pass the fan cables into
the rear and to me this portion looks
very good we have seen a similar layout
from the mesh fic to guide all your
cables vertically near the front of the
case and it works really well here with
velcro straps and a few cable tie points
spread around the back to flatten all
your cables the lack of rubber grommets
on the metal cutouts is not really a big
deal especially at this price and they
look to be well positioned for routing
in the 24 pin or the SATA cables and
when the side panel is closed it will
block out the cutouts anyway space
underneath the motherboard is good to
route the front IO so the layout is as
simple as you can get without any
glaring oversights
although I do have two complaints so for
one I dislike this PCI bracket I don't
know why it has to be here it just
becomes more difficult
installing GPUs or anything in your PCI
slots so yeah it's just an additional
piece that you have to worry about
and my second complaint is with the top
section here with the cutouts so there's
only a single usable one and the corner
here which you can route your 8 pin and
maybe some other things but there is a
second cutout right here but it's
completely covered by the motherboard
unless you pre route things before
inserting it so this cutout is pretty
much useless right now there is one in
the front section but it's a little
further away from this whole top area so
if you have to route anything from the
top of the motherboard to this rear
chamber you have to use this corner one
or you have to use this thing but you
have to keep in mind to pre route things
beforehand and to finish off this video
the p300 is a well balanced budget
package that carries the usual staples
from fantex like the built-in RGB
support and the user-friendly assembly
it's not super fancy but the exterior is
quite nice for $59 and we're giving it
the hardware canucks damn good value a
word if you're strictly on the budget
seriously take a look and the p300 whoo
all right so I got my fill of a case
review hope you did too let me know what
you think of the P 300 in the comments
