ox and welcome to another video on our
view table today we have a very unique
chassis from n wind now they are known
for producing quite interesting cases
and I was actually very excited to get
my hands on this in wind 9 to 4 I mean
look at it it looks kick-ass and that
price tag
well that's questionable but what we
have here is a full aluminum
construction very comparable to that of
K slabs Plus that one aluminium piece
that shapes the exterior is quite
elegant and that seems to be sort of the
main selling feature
now you also notice the side panels that
are fully glass not a lot flexible
acrylic this is tempered tinted glass
that you should handle with care but why
does this thing bring a bill to new
heights when it comes to aesthetical
elegance who cares if it lacks
functionality this is a piece of art the
glass side panels are secured by four
thumb screws and are held on these
rubberized standoffs to prevent damage
from any micro vibrations so that's
covered the 904 is within the mid tower
size and as you can see the front
element is completely solid so all the
front panel connections have been moved
to the side where we find four USB 3
ports audio jacks and a power button
this open space at the bottom is also
utilized for air intake with a magnetic
dust filter included and here you also
get the single optical slot with a
removable cover now one thing the actual
optical drive may be a challenge as the
space is completely enclosed from both
sides and you get mounting holes so you
can secure the drive and then the bag
there is a small opening to route your
SATA and power cables it just seems a
little more difficult and then it should
be coming around to the back it's a bit
of an unusual sight as the rear i/o is
actually hidden behind this piece of
aluminum it does however still carry the
elegant appeal with those square cutouts
the large opening in the bottom and
smaller ones on the sides so the four
thumb screws that hold the panel in
place are sort of built into the panel
so you never lose them and what we find
behind is a more familiar scene with
bottom mounted power supply with only
one possible orientation 8 PCI slots and
a 90 millimeter
mount above the fan mount you see
there's an additional cutout so in case
you are using an all-in-one water cooler
either 120 140 millimeter you'll still
be able to pass the tubing through those
ports and installing the fan and
radiator on the outside it is a bit
unconventional and there are no
designated fan mounts but the square
holes will allow fan installation and
tubing would be passed inside through
the top cutout now the whole idea of
this rear design was to eliminate cable
mess and provide a somewhat organized
machine so if your water cooling on the
exterior shell it kind of defeats the
purpose now this whole aluminum piece
continues at the bottom as well with
rubber pads attached to prevent
scratches and provides a bit more
stability and now that we have exterior
covered let's pop these windows off and
check out the internals the first thing
to check out is the only fan intake that
attaches to the fan bracket which
support for both 120 and 140 millimeter
fans and the fan basically sits on top
of the front panel connectors so the
intake isn't completely open and will
experience some resistance from the
cables so basically don't expect any
jaw-dropping temperatures with the 9 of
4 next up is the hard drive cage that
utilizes three hot swappable brackets
with both mechanical and SSD support
that is excellent to see the space above
the drive cage is however left
underutilized and that is unfortunately
considering how expensive the materials
are to produce so for this case you
would assume the design would be more
thorough on the front panel I'm very
happy to see two additional SSD brackets
removable with thumb screws and again
the screws are mounted onto the bracket
so you don't accidentally displace them
power supplies up to 180 millimeters
will fit but it's going to be tight
depending on cabling and graphics cards
of any length will fit as there's
practically no obstructions and as you
can see over 14 inches is available the
motherboard standoffs are very close to
the top but there is the 8 pin CPU
cutout and due to the width of the
chassis CPU coolers up to 145
millimeters are supported and nothing
larger and coming around to the back
it's quite open and bare with multiple
our cutouts and instead of conventional
cable tie holders there are these just
larger holes that you can pass zip ties
through like what you see here since the
94 is sort of an open-concept design
with the glass all the cables are nicely
sleeved in black which is always a nice
touch and beginning with the assembly I
took off the back panel for easier
installation later on and got our
motherboard in place and pre routed all
the SATA connections from the hot
swappable drives underneath the
motherboard for a cleaner plugin now one
very disappointing aspect of the
interior design was a lack of any space
for your 24 pin cable the cutout is
there but there's no way for the cable
to fit underneath standard ATX board and
this is where you look at all this space
for example around the drive cage which
could be relocated to allow additional
clearance around the motherboard and if
not there the space in the rear between
the i/o and the panel is around 7
centimeters so I guess you can see
there's a lot of wasted potential with
the 9 of 4 which is just so unfortunate
for example without a motherboard the
CPU placement is quite high so the
proximity to the top in the case would
mean very limited selection for your CPU
towers and moving on to the power supply
we are using a 170 memory unit and right
off the bat I would recommend installing
the power supply in the beginning before
the motherboard as the motherboard does
prevent a clean insurgent from above and
because of this hinge on the side simple
slide in is almost impossible and
finally after the power supply is
installed I was very happy you do wonder
why so many limitations exist simply for
a cleaner exit of the cables and the
rear the multiple compromise is greatly
outweigh the single elegant feature of
the back panel and taking a closer look
at the finished internals things look
alright but I can't help to be thinking
about the very uncomfortable process
that took me to get there with the power
supply that 24 pin cable that I couldn't
route properly the resistant and the
only intake plus all this wasted space
beside the drive cage perhaps there's
some hope left during the 94 round
you can't really do much but scatter the
cables in the most efficient manner and
once the panel is closed because of the
tint you can't really see much so that's
a bonus and now finally coming on to the
last piece of this puzzle InDesign the
rear aluminum panel to hide all those
cables it sure works but now your access
is completely blocked so if you need to
swap a USB cable or anything in the i/o
it's definitely going to be a procedure
and not a very pleasant one so I will
conclude by stating that the in win 904
took me by surprise with its elegant and
gorgeous design with tempered glass and
full aluminum excellent build quality
they did some things right with hot
swappable base and this is the brackets
plus long GPU support but the limited
internal length and width is just a huge
compromise on user friendly assembly and
space efficiency that is just not on par
for the price you pay which is
disappointing and I know this case
wasn't designed for water cooling
enthusiasts or just enthusiasts in
general so there was a lot of emphasis
put on appearance but England should
have taken more time to polish on the
functionality aspect to justify such a
high price perhaps to be catered to the
enthusiasts so what do you guys think of
this line of four and I think let's all
provide critical feedback to in wind
because I would love to see more
practical internal layout with this
beautiful exterior so leave your
