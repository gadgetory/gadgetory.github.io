is brought to you by and see IX
technology connected hey guys so we just
finished taking a look at some of the
kick-ass notebooks from MSI now let's
take a look at some of the components at
they're gonna be using specifically to
badass gaming motherboard so can you
please tell us a little bit of what
you're holding right now hi this is
going to be our new AMD gaming series
board that's releasing soon I think I
know that a lot of MSI fans are
complaining like how come we've been
releasing a lot of Intel stuff and
nothing new gaming especially for the
AMD side so as CES this year we're
announcing that we're releasing two new
models for the gaming side which is the
a 88 XM gaming and also the ax g45
gaming and this is the standard and
other ones the micro now just by taking
a look at the board I can see that
there's quite a few new innovative
features that are being added into it
specifically I'm seeing right here audio
boost now I'm assuming that this is your
integrated audio car truck yes it's a by
realtek but it's also had all the
capacitor to ensure that it has
stability better frequency and this is
exactly like what we have in the Intel
of z87 gaming series we implement all
like audio boost the military class for
you can do course crossfire and OC genie
now just taking a look as well to
there's probably some incredible
overclocking features that come along
with Kaveri and the sport as well so can
you give us a little bit of an
explanation or run down its exactly why
this board is going to perform extremely
well um the reason why this form will
extreme real well it has a 8 plus 2
power phase which give you the room to
overclock easier and especially right
now we have to click files for so I
think before like yeah it's it's more
easier to do overclocking you know when
you read the wick with the cliq bottles
for and we also have OC genie which is
like for all you know
newbies who doesn't really like know how
to do the adjusting for overclocking you
can just press a button and there's
automatic overclock for you awesome and
taking a look over here this is the matx
version of the board itself it has the
exact same features but I guess if you
hold it up can I write you want to hold
it up it actually has an illuminated
line to show you exactly where the audio
passed through as from the o with let
Allah okay so you can see exactly where
the audio card is actually broken off
into the board which is actually really
cool and innovative feature I'm guessing
there's gonna be LEDs mine all right yes
of course so yeah guys this is the new
and the greatest a 88 x m gaming series
of boards now let's go and take a look
at some of the GPUs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
