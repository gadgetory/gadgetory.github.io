so NZXT should certainly ring a bell the
company that brought us the switch 810
which in a way brought the competition
to its knees due to an innovative design
inside and out however it wasn't long
before the Phantom 820 swept the market
with its awesome appeal and enthusiast
options although it wasn't exactly
wallet friendly so this new phantom 630
brings pretty much all the functions
found on the 820 but at the much better
price so let's take a look and as you
can already see the exterior does
resemble the p8 20 as the outer shell is
practically identical of course you do
not get any fancy LED lighting but it
doesn't mean you can't go and
personalize your rate with some cat
holds the front panel opens up to reveal
for optical baked covers and an SD card
slot for the top now check this out
there is a cat out on the panel meaning
you can still close it with the card in
place the front panel can be removed
noting usual here we haven't included
200 millimeter fan and dual 120 and 140
mm mounts are available a removable dust
filter is available both at the front
and at the bottom now looking at the top
is slightly different setup than the 820
we still get the usual audio ports and
for USBs power and reset buttons are on
the other side with the power buttons
feeling kind of flimsy we also have the
rear i/o LED button and a 3-speed fan
controller and removing the top panel
completely we get these large 200
millimeter dust filters now NZXT does
include a 200 millimeter exhaust fan
which is always great and we have many
other mounting options now one thing I
will definitely change are these dust
filters there's no need for them to be
attached to the fans and they cannot be
mounted to smaller fans a simple
removable filter attached to the top
would be a lot more user-friendly
the side panel does incorporate a window
also with a fan mount with a third 200
millimeter fan so you will definitely be
keeping cool even at stock
configurations at the back the exhaust
fan can be repositioned based on your
top cooling setup and both standard
sizes are supported there are nine PCI
expansion slots and some venting on the
side and also a removable dust filter
for the bottom alright so finally
getting inside there are quite a lot of
things that have been modified so let's
see what has changed first the duelist
system has been swapped for something a
little different but it still does work
very well the module acacia system is
still user friendly and does provide a
bit more flexibility in terms of your
setup and allows the users to install
only the amount that is needed for
example just look at how many different
options there are to install these cages
and you don't have to worry the are
secured with several thumb screws at the
back and holes are pre-drilled for any
type of setup and of course knowing NZXT
and their continued strive towards
improving the industry standard
expanding the users water cooling
options is a must so removing the bottom
mounting plate and all the cages a front
dual rat is possible of course it's not
ideal so mounting arrived at the bottom
instead is more practical which will
allow a couple more cages to be
installed and looking the back it seems
like NZXT is really pushing the
boundaries with an excellent and smart
design when it comes to cable management
there are many quality rubber grommets
spreading around and not one but four
different cat outs for your power supply
there's lots of space to work with so
cleaning up your wiring is a piece of
cake now one really neat feature are
these two brackets for your SSDs that
are mounted behind the motherboard tray
is a very simple and hassle-free
installation and we also get these
cutouts right underneath for easy cable
routing now this is a very smart user
space especially for a case of this
calibre another awesome consideration is
the fan
you can control all your fans using the
speed adjustments at the top it is
secured with screws which I do prefer
over the velcro method which was seen on
the 810 you simply add up to 10 fans
into the hub and utilize the cooling
when you need it most
now the 8 pin cable cut out has been
replaced with smaller cutouts at the top
and I did have trouble fitting in that 8
pin CPU cable and I hope NZXT enlarges
these cutouts otherwise you'll need to
reroute your cable with an extension and
moving back inside an optional fan can
be installed onto this angled bracket
it's a really great way to add extra
cooling for your internal components now
the drive brackets are still very flimsy
and I don't know why as XD still uses
them they can snap easily and are the
weakest link in the overall design so no
surprise handling long graphics cards is
absolutely no problem and clearance up
to twelve point eight inches is
available with the pivot fan installed
and once everything is wired up the p6
30 really shines at how well it handles
not only cable management but also
enthusiast hardware the modular cage
options are brilliantly executed and
allows for a variety of water cooling
options the rear fan hub along with the
SSD brackets are extra icing on the cake
and the stock cooling should be
sufficient enough right out of the box
and of course at this price ends xt has
done it again in terms of delivering an
exceptional chassis for the enthusiast
market although I would like to see
slightly larger cutouts at the top
without a pin cable and improve Drive
brackets but with so many awesome
features you can certainly overlook the
negatives with this damn good case and
while it may not be in everyone's budget
the 630 offers really good value for
what you get so thanks guys for watching
our review on the NZXT phantom 630 let
us know what you think about the whole
setup between the Phantom 826 30 and the
switch 810 so thanks guys for watching
and see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
