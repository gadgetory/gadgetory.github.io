CES Corsa is launching a ton of new
products but we were able to try out a
few of them before the show basically
these three mice showed up a few weeks
before they were announced and while one
of them is a revision to a classic the
other the other two are just brand new
but first a message from our sponsors
because without the help from corsair
msi razer fantex and Thermaltake none of
this coverage would have been possible
all right so let's start with one of
Corsairs most interesting announcements
and that's their partnership with Pixar
to create one of the most accurate Mouse
sensors on the market the pmw 33 91 it
is a native 18,000 DPI sensor that can
actually be adjusted in one dpi
increments honestly I'm not sure why
anyone would want that amount of
adjustments but hey it's a cool
marketing point that sensor is actually
the main reason why the M 65 RGB elite
is around since it basically uses the
same anodized aluminum body and adds the
3291 sensor it so cost $60 - so no
premium here we actually looked at the M
65 Pro RGB a few years ago and came away
thinking that it was a good Mouse and
you can actually find that video right
over here the cool thing is that it has
adjustable weight system that can be
used to reduce weight to 97 grams or
increase it to 112 grams nothing else
has really changed with this one but be
aware that the M 65 is a low and wide
Mouse so it is only suitable for certain
grip styles the next month I wanted to
talk about is the new harpoon Wireless
which basically uses the classic harpoon
shape and as a bunch of new technology
this mouse can operate in one of three
notes be a wired USB ultra-low latency
Bluetooth or 2.4 gigahertz slipstream
which delivers extremely fast Wireless
response times battery life is rated for
up to 60 hours if used without any RGB
but when abling RGB and slipstream will
cut that life down to about 30 hours
another improvement over the original
harpoon is the 10,000 dpi PWM 3325
optical sensor instead of beat 6,000 dpi
sensor they have been a few other minor
changes to improve handling and quality
but overall it looks like this version
has a
going for it there's a small storage
compartment to store the 2.4 gigahertz
wireless receiver when it's not being
used and this is pretty convenient there
are some downfalls to adding wireless
technology and those focus mostly on two
areas weight and pricing the wired
harpoon is known as one of the lightest
mice available at just 85 grams whereas
the wireless version is 99 grams as for
price this mouse will go for around $50
versus $30 for the wired version in my
time with the harpoon wireless there
were a few issues first it absolutely
needs surface calibration through IQ
because the default lift off distance is
just way too high for my liking I also
noticed that the right click button
hardly needed any effort to press that
meant quick flex to left sometimes
caused an 800 right click ok so finally
onto the last of this bunch and that's
the brand new iron claw RGB and let me
tell you this is one massive Gaming
Mouse course they are specifically
designed this for people with large
hands or those who prefer a palm stock
whip based on our experience it can
actually be quite uncomfortable for
someone who doesn't fall into one of
those categories so this is definitely a
try it before you buy epic Mouse like
the m65 RGB elite the iron claw uses the
new Pixar pmw 30 391 18,000 dpi sensor
but it uses a completely plastic body
the benefit of this is a despite a huge
size it actually has a weight of just
105 grams there are also seven
programmable buttons which could make
this Mouse a good option for mobile
players the onboard profile storage and
a dedicated button to cycle through them
is pretty much I must have for a mouse
these days and considering alternatives
like the Razer Naga the iron cost $60
price point makes it a more affordable
option for people with larger hands so
there you guys having three new mice for
the start of 2019 and we'd love to know
your thoughts about them have you ever
owned a Corsair Mouse before and if you
did what was your experience like is
there anything else that you'd want to
see from their peripherals let us know
in the comments down below any bar with
Hydra connect stay tuned for more CES
2019 coverage and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
