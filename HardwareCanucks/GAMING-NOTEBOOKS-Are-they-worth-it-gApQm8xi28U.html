hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Harbor
Canucks and welcome to another video
notebooks today are getting quieter
they're getting cooler they're getting
more powerful and they're also getting
slimmer so very thin machines on the
market right now may be very impressive
but this is possible thanks to the
hardware advancement but also the new
cooling systems that are being
integrated inside these machines and if
you're in the market for a gaming
machine gaming notebook then you
stumbled upon the right video because
they will be comparing invidious Maxwell
900m serious GPUs against each other and
versus the desktop counterparts so you
get a better idea of how they perform
and the general performance sphere and
also give us a like if you'd want us to
compare them to the radio on mobile GPUs
in the future and we'll make sure to
deliver and so in this comparison we got
quite the range starting with a razor
blade Pro that has a gtx 960m
with 4 gigabytes of vram moving up a bit
the gigabyte p35 kv-3 with a gtx 960 5 m
that has 4 gigabytes of vram as well
then the eurocom m5 pro with a gtx 970m
a 3 gig card on our model and finally
top the line asus g7 51 the latest model
with g-sync
and has a beastly gtx 980m with 4
gigabytes of video memory and i also
like to point out that the cpu on all
these notebooks is the same the core i7
4720 HQ @ 2.6 gigahertz with turbo up to
3.6 gigahertz the games were installed
on the 7200 rpm disc and the only
difference between these machines is the
system memory with 24 gigabytes on the
Asus model 8 gigabytes on the eurocom
and the gigabyte machine with options to
upgrade and 16 gigabytes of the
razorblade pro and so here's the full
spec sheet comparing all these GPUs now
this table tells us only part of the
story but based on the coup de coeur
count you can kind of tell how these
will perform in games in comparison to
each other and first firing up 3dmark to
establish sort of a base for
synthetic benchmarks and the difference
between the graphic score is fairly
significant and I wanted to see how the
mobile GPU compares to the desktop
lineup just so you can get an idea of
what we're dealing with here and the
desktop cards are shown in orange for
easier distinction and you can see here
the 980m lends itself wall between the
gtx 970 and the 960 and having that type
of power on the notebook is still pretty
impressive and the 970m is just below
the gtx 960 which I would say is still
totally playable for the notebook
standard now let's jump into some games
and while I was testing everything with
high settings just to see how much
performance could be squeezed out the
interesting thing to notice are the
performance gains that you get once
going one level higher through the
lineup and while the lower end models
the 960 m and the 965 M seem to struggle
a little bit to keep up with playable
frame rates you have to remember
invidious GeForce experience that
optimizes in-game settings for playable
framerate so the 960 M is more of a low
to medium GPU the 965 M is a tier higher
for medium settings the 970 m is your
high settings GPU and the 980 m would
allow you to just max out your game with
a few settings tweaked for constant 60 +
FPS now for temperature comparison this
is not exactly fair just because each of
these machines utilize different cooling
system but from our testing there isn't
a particular pattern this just
highlights though that the performance
of our 960 m inside the razor blade Pro
could have been hindered by the high low
temperatures while the incredibly silent
and efficient cooling on the Asus model
allowed us to squeeze all that available
power out of the 980 m and I think the
Europe come when the gigabyte machines
offer sort of a nice balance of
incredibly thin notebooks with
appropriate but slightly louder cooling
and so what we can take away from this
is the future of mobile gaming looks
really promising and already
satisfactory the performance of the 9
and the 970m is really on par with the
desktop counterparts like the 960 and
higher and that is very impressive
considering you can literally have all
that power in your backpack as you're
gaming without any compromises now don't
forget that achieving satisfactory
gaming experience on a notebook is a
balancing act between setting the right
settings for the hardware it's not all
about just maxing out the settings and
seeing how things perform and I hope
that this limited - in the video mobile
GPU showdown has been helpful if you're
in the market for a mobile gaming
machine now you sort of have the base
comparison on which GPU performs at what
level compared to the desktop
counterparts and compared to between
each other as well and give us a like if
you'd want to see us bring in some
Radeon notebooks and compare that to
them have two maxwell GPUs and see how
they perform and seeing what the
temperatures like and etc so if you
enjoy this content give us a like and
thank you so much for watching make sure
to subscribe because we'll have a lot
more cool content coming up in the
future and we'll see you in the next one
