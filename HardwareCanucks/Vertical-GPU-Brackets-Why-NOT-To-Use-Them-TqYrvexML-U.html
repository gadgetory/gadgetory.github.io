so in the past year we've noticed many
cases that come included with the dual
vertical PCI slots beside your normal
ones or some sort of space to
accommodate a vertical PCI bracket for
your GPU and it looks great when it's
mounted facing you but are there any
benefits and temperatures and exactly
what are the benefits and drawbacks with
vertical PCI brackets let's talk about
that right after this the new master
liquid all-in-one coolers are available
in 120 and 240 millimeter stylish
radiator sizes with air Balance fans
included for best air flow and RGB sync
on the pump and the fans that are
controlled via this hub or through your
motherboard check out the ML 120 ln 240
L down below okay so this is a pretty
relevant topic because more and more
cases now can support vertical mount for
the GPU and you gotta pay extra premium
to have all the appropriate mounting
accessories that generally involves a
PCI extension cable and something to
mount it to the frame securely for my
test setup I'm using the latest EVGA
case the DG 77 check out that review if
you haven't already and I've removed the
front glass panel because that is a
choking hazard for the fans I am testing
two style of graphics cards this dual
fan GTX 1084 the win with all the shiny
lights on the shroud so you can observe
and customize how it looks facing you
and then he found this edition gtx 1060
which is still a pretty shroud but a
blower style cooler so we can observe
the temperature differences in vertical
and standard positions I also have two
coolers for testing the corsair h 100 IV
two mounted at the front because 240
millimeter all in ones in this spot are
quite popular but because they blow warm
air into the case because of that
radiator I've also got a pure rock tower
from be quiet it's a small enough one to
not interfere with the vertical GPU
mount and I would say it's about the
size of an average CPU tower and I'm
also replacing all the fans with silent
wings 3 so once for exhaust and 2 for
intake with nothing up top so my total
fans and the system remains the same
when I swap the coolers so Cosmetics is
the obvious advantage when you go in
vertical you're not just looking at the
top of the card but a full shroud design
and four cards and have no back place
this is a huge visual advantage it
helps to fill in that empty space of a
case and you have you know your graphics
card basically the center of attention
now you have to keep in mind the power
cables on how they're routed and also
what is the card blocking on this case
it's far away from other PCI slots so
you can put stuff in there without
interfering with the vertical one but
the extension cable is on the top PCI
slot essentially blocking access to
everything else of course you can
reposition the extension cable to a
lower PCI slot in order to install
anything else
and also this mount has to happen after
you route all your front of your cables
and anything below that motherboard
otherwise the access is pretty limited
and the mount is usually pretty close to
the side panel sparking questions for
airflow so let's get into that now my
room temperatures remain constant with
less than one degree fluctuation I'd
removed
EVGA SDG tuner so the cards are
operating within their factory
parameters and they're not being
overclocked and each load state lasted
for 20 minutes in Doom so we can heat up
the interior of a case and I also
recorded the noise levels of each
configuration and starting off with the
1084 the win we had 82 degrees Celsius
with tiny bit of fluctuations and both
configurations and constant just over
2,000 rpm on a fan curve but check this
out core clocks in the vertical mount
are around five percent lower so I'm
thinking the proximity to the glass is
impacting its cooling potential and
therefore it's a slightly throttling
itself for the blur style GTX 1060
temperatures are slightly better in the
vertical orientation with only slightly
lower rpm on the fan but the clocks are
exactly the same leveling off at
eighteen thirty five megahertz switching
over for the air cooler and the GTX 980
stays at 82 degrees Celsius with the
same fan speed in either orientation and
again we're running into lower frequency
on the core in the vertical mount by
around three percent but the lack of
warm air entering the case from the
radiator gives us that slight boost in
clock speeds for the blower style gtx
1060 we're seeing five degrees celsius
cooler temperature in horizontal
position most likely due to better
airflow delivery from that front fan
that results in lower fan speed on the
card but surprisingly
over time remain the same at eighteen
thirty five megahertz with this unusual
dip by the end in the vertical
orientation and aside from seeing worse
temperatures we're also seeing higher
noise in vertical orientation because
the card and its fans are facing the
window and therefore the noise isn't as
absorbed by the interior alright so what
have we learned so number one vertical
orientation is great if you want to
showcase your graphics card and the
shroud and customize the color of the
LEDs if you are into that but also it
fills in that space that is otherwise
void so they're all visual advantages
but from a performance standpoint you're
running into a slightly harder GPU
because of that proximity to the side
panel it is also slightly louder and it
creates a bit with inconvenience if you
need to access anything on the bottom
side of the motherboard because it's
just there's so much stuff now in front
of there and also in terms of the
performance on the core clock front we
are seeing about a five percent
reduction in core clocks which will
impact gaming performance not in a good
way but that of course can be
counteracted with an overclock that will
diminish any of those differences in
whatever orientation and so I hope this
clears up some questions regarding
vertical GPU mounts and if you are
thinking of going that route let me know
in the comments below I'm at the be tree
thanks so much for watching we'll see
you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
