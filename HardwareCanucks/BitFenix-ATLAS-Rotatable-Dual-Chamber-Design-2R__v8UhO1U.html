you by fantex
nvidia corsair and CI x silverstone and
in win make sure to support them for
helping us bring this great content to
you
hello everyone let me know if you agree
but I would say dual chamber cases are
becoming increasingly popular and one
unique chassis we noticed at Computex
is the beat Phoenix Atlas I would even
go ahead and say this is the next-level
dual chamber design and I'll show you
why in the moment but first the Atlas is
symmetric and the entire frame is
incredibly solid with these massive
chunks of aluminum on the front panel I
initially thought it was just soft touch
plastic and my perception of quality
changed as soon as I found out it was a
lumen emplace the case is extremely
heavy the mesh underneath reveals the
fan intake and I personally love the
design of this front panel taking a look
at the back this is what makes the Atlas
so special so first notice how each
chamber has a rear fan mouth but
BitFenix design the interior to be
modular so using these aluminum handles
you can slide out the chambers that sit
on Rails for easier installation of the
motherboard off the case for example or
invert the two chambers so instead of
the system being showcased on the left
side like you see here you can set up
the Atlas with the system being
showcased on the right side with a
rotated motherboard layout it's a unique
way to give users the control that would
be based on orientation of the case so
whether you want the main system chamber
on the left side or the right and on the
inside you can see the space is not
limitation cable management should be
easy considering the large chamber
behind and you can get direct front
intake of the triple 120mm fans there's
a large opening at the top between the
two chambers that would come in handy if
you need throughout any water cooling
tubes and each side can support triple
120mm fans as well given the Atlas
massive water cooling potential not just
at the front but also at the top and
this is what the rear chamber looks like
you get the easy to fold and forget all
the cable mess with plenty of cable tie
points
and rubber grommets leading into the
other side the hard drive cage sits
behind this door that is well padded to
avoid any vibrations and there are only
four Drive caddies in this case it seems
way too limiting for something of this
size you can still install drives on the
floor of the main chamber but I really
hope that we'll see at least another
drive cage somehow integrated into the
rear compartment for us to consider the
layout to be space efficient I was happy
to see a PWM fan hub integrated here so
that's good news and that is the general
trend with the BitFenix atlas windows on
both sides USB c-type very nice would be
awesome for water cooling and swappable
chambers to allow users to showcase
their systems based on their orientation
so now at $399 what do you guys think of
this price point for a case of this
caliber and remember that aluminum
exterior frame adds to the cost which i
think is totally worth it and if only
they end up adding more drive storage
capacity to the rear chamber for this to
be even more future proof</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
