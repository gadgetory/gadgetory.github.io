of things came in let me show you what
they have in terms of upcoming content
so I finally received a wireless kit
from Corsair this is the ML 1000 with
the dark core Mouse and I'm comparing
with the Logitech G power play and the
whole combination so make sure to check
out that video right over here and with
the entire wireless kit from Corsair
cane this guy the survivor USB stick but
in order to put it through its paces in
terms of its durability I had to travel
elsewhere and video on that shortly if
this does not get confiscated at the
border I hope not oh my god that would
be terrible
and so I'm trying out the whole wireless
set on my desk
hopefully it plays out well and so I'm
very excited about the k63 because it's
tkl I love small form factors especially
for MySpace it fits so well it's got MX
red cherry switches blue a lighting so
no RGB here I have dark core that is
currently charging on the M 1000 and so
the thing is you lose two cables so no
more cable for the mouse no more cable
for the keyboard but there's one thick
cable for the mouse mat and it's not
very pretty and to continue with the
whole wildest direction I'm getting into
the mindset of like a potential consumer
who would want and wireless keyboard
wireless mouse and obviously a wireless
headset another Thresher
I guess they send me to maybe a like for
a giveaway Wow I am very excited for
this lineup and of course the testing -
the goal is to find the best wireless
gaming headset so we got the SteelSeries
arctas 7 and I got 2 from large tech the
g5 33 and the gene 933 that's like the
older one so we can see how this
generation shift has improved anything
and I'm hoping it has this is the latest
one who have reviewed the HyperX cloud
flight really liked their direction in
terms of sound quality and comfort but
the construction is a little bit on the
flimsy side then we have the Corsair
void Pro RGB and I'm really looking
forward to seeing how the microphone
stacks up on all these and last - our
razor obviously they had to compensate
with the biggest packaging ever but it's
because we have a headphone stand inside
and lots of people have been requesting
the Man O'War this one's actually quite
old I thought it was new but because of
just the sheer amount of comments people
asked to actually check out this
particular headset and from what I can
tell they're not compensating for
anything at all with this big packaging
versus something older
which one of these do you think will win
in terms of sound comfort microphone
what else is there a build quality yes
yes let me know in the comments below
but not to worry I have some very
exciting case content coming up shortly
let me show you now recently I did a
cable management video inside the 500d
giving you my basic cable management
tips and so that's a fairly easy case to
work in so inside here is an enclosure
from 2011 which should prove Kayle
measurements a lot more challenging let
me show you I think there are two in
here I've never received two cases in
the same box pretty cool case King
pretty cool a handle is convenient and a
very secret case in here too but that is
for later Wow a blast from the past this
is from air cool it's called the cyclone
it's supposed to be a cyclone too but
look at this upgraded version with USB
3.0 be cool be air cool look how weird
this thing looks lovely handled by the
way oh my god the remember acrylic side
panels there they have fan filters and
feeling very nostalgic right now why do
case manufacturers no longer produced
such beautiful designs for the front
panel it says star cruiser on the side
yeah on both sides I feel like I'm gonna
have fun with this one
yeah so I finally had to get a proper
stand for my light it's heavy duty but
that allows me to exceed my new would
the light over objects and create shots
like these one before I forget my cable
management tools for this case a
bazillion zip ties my velcro straps and
also the little cable type points
because the case I don't know if it has
any so that should be fun to work inside
the cyclone and try my best in cable
management I've never actually put that
much effort into it but as you can
clearly see I'm going to be prepared and
in terms of cooling I have the inner Mac
slick fusion 240mm radiator it's the new
one with a really beautiful fans really
excited to see that and I'm gonna be
comparing the silent loop 360 with the
Corsair H 150 I Pro 360 mm they're all
in one really nice slim pump hopefully
the performance is good too and one last
thing we recently did budget gaming mice
around $15 roundup where I took eight of
them and actually some of them are
pretty decent check out over there so
this is where the archive sits for those
mice and I have a new pile that start to
form right over here for the next
iteration about the budgets for like 25
to 50 or something like that so if you
have any mice recommendations for that
video let me know in the comments below
and one more thing I got my first drone
the Maverick air look at this it's the
size of my hand here's the 1 + 5 t for
size reference as to where the drone
sits
that's incredible with the blades are
quite sharp and let me know if you want
to see a review of this guy from a drone
noob like me and I'll make sure to
deliver I'm not sure how I feel about
remotes you know I was a keyboard the
mouse type of guy
all right so I think that's it for my
little update let me know which piece of
content you want to see first and if you
have any suggestions and tips as how not
to crash my drone let me know in the
comments and if you have any other
suggestions on what we can do for you
guys
we're always listening and open to
feedback thank you so much for watching
I'm Dmitry and we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
