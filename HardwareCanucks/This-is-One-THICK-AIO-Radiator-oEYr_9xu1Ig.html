enter max they actually showing a few
cool things so let me guide you through
those but first huge thanks to clear
master fantex and thermaltake for making
our trip possible all right let me show
you what they got all right so first
let's start with the coolers enter max
is changing the game for all-in-one
coolers because I moved away from a AOS
two air coolers because these things
just don't deliver enough cooling
capacity and are much louder but and
their max is changing the game with lick
tech 2 because we have a now much larger
pump so these are almost like equivalent
to what you would use on a custom water
loop so the pump itself is much stronger
it can deliver look at this seven times
stronger flow rate compared to our
traditional all-in-one pumps so 65
versus for 50 liters an hour on these
new ef-1 pump systems so this is the new
one it comes in to 40 to 80 and 360
moment radiators there is a white
version which is awesome and look at
this they're working on making sure that
the white fan and the white radiator
bracket is actually matched in color so
when you install this there is no color
mismatch I appreciate it now for the
standard 360 TR for one they will have
simple black fans so the 240 radiator is
there now much thicker at 32 millimeters
versus our traditional 27 on something
like this so that's pretty awesome and
check this out they even have a little
test setup to showcase what our
traditional pump does in terms of how
much like what this thing can put out
versus the new EF one pump too so let's
do the demo alright let's start so the
liquid start to flow so here we have the
new EF one pump here is our traditional
pump I'm gonna step back a little bit so
you guys can see what the difference
would be look at that this is much
faster and we're almost done here boom
that is the power of the new pump so it
is really cool to have this visual to
see what the difference is between the
flow of like our standard pump versus
the EF one but also there including this
new central cold plate that has a
central passage in the middle that makes
your
exchange of heat 30% more efficient so
in the combination with this much better
pump that is more powerful thicker
radiator for 240 radiator sizes while
the 360 are large enough they don't need
to be expanded to maintain that cooling
capacity I feel like these new ni max
lik tech to all-in-one coolers are going
to be quite popular okay so I just
realized this but the entire animagus
booth is two fans connected with
something right there there's another
one and in the middle look at this power
supply cool alright obviously there is
an RGB power supply it was only a matter
of time this one's called the revolution
RGB it is fully modular and I do like
how these cables have that nice pattern
on them it's not just simple black so
it's a semi family's design which means
the fan will stop spinning when the
power supply is below 30% so if you're
under that threshold you got the totally
silent system we get RGB on both sides
and they are rotated to accommodate for
the orientation so if the fan is facing
up we can see that RGB there plus the
revolution RGB text here but if you are
to rotate the power supply like this you
can see the text accommodates that this
thing can be connected to your
motherboard because it has addressable
RGB so you can have that full sync with
your motherboard or there's a button you
can simply change the lighting this way
if you don't want to go through the
software actually quite like this
approach and I'm guessing that is the
future of power supplies it was only a
matter of time and now into case is
something that we haven't really covered
on the show here I'm kidding
we have the new saber II in white so
we've covered this one at CES it's
actually pretty cool because you can
remove the front glass plate and replace
it with the mesh which is a top so these
two plates are interchangeable and they
do include an additional mesh piece in
the box so you can have mesh on top and
the front this one is the original black
one it comes with three RGB fans at the
front but the white one has new
addressable RG fans and both of them
will come with three at the front this
is 180 dollars this is 160 so the $20
difference for the white model seems
appropriate but so the new things here
are the addressable RGB LED strips on
top and
front now for the interior aside from
having a radiator support up top and the
front we do have that side radiator
installation too for either exhausting
the fans or radiator if you do at 284
you know for your cooler also the side
panel does accommodate that exhaust
which is awesome the interior seems to
be pretty safe nice long power supply
shroud cutouts for the GPU cables nice
little cutout for the front if you do go
with the radiator and the low hard drive
cage does not stick out so you don't
have to remove it if you're going with
the radiator at the front so there are
GP implementation is actually pretty
good all the controls are at the front
so you cannot you only change the color
and the effect but you can also have
three brightness levels which is awesome
because these things go incredibly
bright like blinding and bright
check this out all right there yeah
there we go
imagine this in a really dark
environment yeah so that's awesome
all the controls at the front and the
i/o includes four USB ports nice so they
did tell us that they will focus on
making sure the white is uniform and
also matches other white components that
are coming out and potentially include
some form of perimeter on the glass so
that actually does not reveal the frame
behind it alright guys so that's it from
animatics let me know what you think of
those cases and would you like us to
review one the RGB power supply of
course was inevitable but I'm happy with
the implementation and their new al
cooler with that the stronger pump will
deliver better temperatures across the
board thanks much for watching I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
