special new game technologies to reveal
to you the first one is called K Street
rich displays are showing up everywhere
rich displays are showing up in your
hand mobile devices pcs TVs
simultaneously computer graphics has
been generated and a lot of various
devices it's being generated on your PC
it's been generated in your cloud you
can enjoy beautiful graphics on pcs with
GeForce beautiful graphics of grid and
cloud beautiful preference of the shield
and our belief is that you should be
able to enjoy video games the way that
you enjoy digital video today some that
you've downloaded then you're playing on
the device natively something you're
streaming from another device some that
you're streaming from the cloud
something you're sharing with somebody
else at the core of that to make that
possible we created a fundamental new
technology for remote graphics remote
graphics suggests that you can have the
ability to interact with the graphics it
is remotely processed compressed and
stream back to you so fast that you
barely notice that it was far away you
barely notice that it was far away that
in fact it's basically the same
experience it's completely interactive
this foundational technology we call
gain stream in fact you've seen us
demonstrating parts of it pieces of it
in all kinds of demonstrations we've
been giving streaming from thread to
shield
use game stream streaming from geforce2
shield we use game stream I want to show
you a few other examples of how game
stream is going to be used the first one
is game streaming from a pc to shield
this is one of my favorite ways of using
game stream and the reason for that is
because the single best game machine
that we all have is our pc and we're
about to see some amazing new games on
the other hand my favorite display is my
84 inch 4k sony TV it's just that my pc
is far away from it it would be utterly
incredible if i could get the beautiful
graphics from my pc with titan geforce
tight inside strained to my 84 inch sony
4k television now I I don't think I'm
the only person who wants to do that you
guys all have wonderful HD displays are
on to house your gods all have wonderful
pcs they're currently likely in two
different rooms with gang stream we can
make it possible for you to enjoy your
pc games whether you're sitting in front
of that pc or sit in front of a TV why
don't we show it to you all right here
my demo babe does you just you guys know
you just don't you come up your demo
baby like the a brown version away
alright demo babe first of all this is
shield this is the ultimate android
gaming portable it does everything
android that is pure Android and it was
designed specifically for playing games
our philosophy about shield is the same
philosophy that we have about owning a
smartphone as well as a tablet used a
smartphone because it's a mobile device
but when you're home and you're sitting
in front of your TV if you want to enjoy
some magazines or read you know read
some magazines play few games browse the
web watch a few netflix movies while
your family's watching something else
you pull out your tablet but if you want
to play game the ultimate way of doing
that is really to do it shield now
she'll as you know as Tegra 4 inside a
chair before as a fantastic processor
for all kinds of things and today what
we like to like Tegra 4 to do is to be a
receiver to be a receiver for geforce pc
and so all you have to do is turn turn
shield into a game console you close the
lid you turn it into a game console this
is now in the game console mode while
it's in game console mode shield is
still active obviously it has the
receiver the sophomore client that
transmits the controls low latency
controls to your g-force PC there's also
the receiver of the compressed
transmitted stream now one of the things
that really makes game stream special is
the low latency a ribbon but also the
high quality of service picture of it
this is an area of no
was fine-tuning and optimization great
science and art and dealing with
compatibility and network quality issues
and we've been working on this for some
time I'm just really really proud of the
team and the work that they've done
right now you're in game console mode
when we go into the shield games them so
the way we know we're in the same
possible is if you look on the top left
hand corner you can see that bull shield
icon that shield icon lets us know that
we've now gone in console so what I have
here is my co controller so I just now
weird my co game controller needs to the
Bluetooth up top there which is now
paired so what I'm doing here I mean the
first time I saw this you need to really
understand the magic so the chain horse
pc is over there we're going to the
shield but i'm now using this wireless
Bluetooth controller along this so
that's all coming off the piece now we
worked with the guys at nine code to
make sure that their controller latency
is as short as possible if you simply
can't afford and we don't want to
tolerate any possible leg and so we work
with the controller companies to
optimize their controllers to producing
the lag between their bluetooth and the
bluetooths back on Android Android
shield okay so at this point what's
happening is we're launching scheme as
you guys know steam has a new mode
called big picture and one of the things
that we love about steam is this is our
library of games we're now in Steve and
we're launching the most amazing game
ever batman arkham origins this is
running of course on a geforce titan and
is streaming over Giggy when you strike
over Giga you can get full 1080p if you
stream over Wi-Fi you get 720
okay so you're looking at 1080p on 4k
display so the game we're going to show
here is batman arkham origins showed off
yesterday and the thing that I really
love about this is because it's coming
off the pc everything that you know and
love about this game and enjoys all the
things that we talked about yesterday
txa a the dx11 tessellation the physics
the HBA oh they're going to get all of
that is it's coming from your pc but now
you get it on your big screen TV does
that amazing guys look that this is the
best graphics anybody has ever seen on
their TV and the beautiful thing is that
you don't have to move your pc you leave
your pc in the study we all have
ethernet flores running around the house
and if you don't just run in Wi-Fi light
on here so if you look this is finally
my favorite scenes look at the detail on
too soon for that we normally
I play this kind of game you usually see
Jackie's like that is perfectly speed
1080p streaming here's that man i'll go
down here half man so get a little girl
fighting no jaggies no follies
super low latency so that you can still
have a fight and win I love this game
for once in my life I can feel like a
minute

spooky see quality graphics without
having a driver pc i'll just do a quick
round is this amazing you guys okay good
