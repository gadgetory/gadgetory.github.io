the keyboard warriors are going to be
coming out and they're going to be
either attacking or agreeing or
encouraging insightful conversation
let's do that Oh Mac versus PC this is
not what this video is about so before
everybody starts to jump off their
chairs and start to defend one camp or
the other make sure to watch this video
first instead I wanted to explore all
the hype surrounding Final Cut and using
that to edit your videos with an Apple
product and compare the workflow and
render times versus my maxed out
extremely powerful workstation PC using
Adobe Premiere now this was all stirred
up by Linus and his initial video to
test out the possibilities of 4k video
editing on an ultrabook
which then proved to be you know it had
some challenges but it's still a
possibility but then that video was
challenged by Jonathan from TLD
explaining his workflow in Final Cut
using an extremely underpowered 12-inch
MacBook and so those results and final
cut that that Jonathan revealed really
spiraled out my curiosity for final cut
and so I went out and bought a MacBook
Pro so the one I picked up was the
Retina 15-inch MacBook Pro the 2.5
gigahertz Edition so it comes with a
dedicated graphics cards the AMD r9 M
370 X 16 gigabytes of system memory and
a 512 gigabyte PCI SSD and it all comes
with a fairly compact package I was
incredibly surprised at how light and
just well built a machine was compared
to my previous sort of workstation
mobile notebook the eurocom m5 pro now
to start things off I totally understand
the arguments from both sides the PC
master-race claims the value per
hardware and per dollar and the
performance is so much better especially
if you build your own it's all modular
its customizable you can do things with
it
while on the Apple side of argument one
dominant feature that really arises
and that's optimization and that
optimization is what got me so excited
about testing and Mac for video editing
despite being an incredibly expensive
machine I wanted to see what type of
benefits you could get with Final Cut
especially when you're talking about a
software that's optimized by Apple
working with hardware that's been
optimized by Apple as well to create
this cohesion that me as a PC user can
only wish for for my main workstation PC
here and to bring this comparison onto a
level playing field for video editing on
the go I'll also be including results
from my mobile workstation PC the
eurocom m5 Pro which is maxed out to the
teeth and is so much more powerful than
the MacBook but does it matter okay fine
enough about all that chatter let's talk
render times so here's a three-minute 4k
project inside Final Cut when a timeline
is idle Final Cut will render that stuff
in the background as you proceed with
the Edit so giving you absolutely smooth
real-time scrubbing without lag or
dropped frames and it's a fantastic
feature that I do sincerely miss with
adobe premiere in the final render time
with color correction on this project is
just 2 minutes and 15 seconds when we
bring the exact same sequence into
premiere the MacBook Pro struggles with
an extremely lengthy render time of
almost 22 minutes while the m5 pro
render is much faster almost half the
time in just under 11 minutes all thanks
to the more powerful in video GPU and
bring out the big guns my workstation PC
just eats through the render time with 7
minutes and 11 seconds for the final
export as soon as you can see Final Cut
is so much faster and exporting that
little project versus Adobe Premiere
even much faster and almost factor of 3
X versus my workstation PC but how about
other elements that we as video editor
is required to do like stabilization and
camera tracking so we tested
stabilization effect in Final Cut that
is complete in 42 seconds versus sick
minutes and 35 seconds in premiere for
the exact same clip using warp
stabiliser on the MacBook Pro the
workstation PC finishes the
stabilization in just under 6 minutes
and surprisingly the more powerful m5
Pro hardware-wise struggles with a
lengthy stabilization of 8 minutes and
26 seconds which is much slower than the
MacBook Pro with premiere jumping into
After Effects I use track camera
function constantly to create this
motion text and here the analysis on the
MacBook Pro is complete and almost at
the same time as the workstation PC but
takes a few more seconds to complete on
the m5 Pro now my workflow with Final
Cut is almost the same as with Premiere
but scrubbing and playback is so much
smoother with Final Cut it makes an
obvious choice for video editing on
location now I gotta say my expectations
with Final Cut continue to grow as I
start to work on an actual review
project inside Final Cut which was 10
minutes in length and the export time
was just over seven minutes which would
normally take up to 20 minutes or over
on my workstation PC and this video is
really not meant to you know spur that
argument a debate of PC versus Mac and
what is better but instead potentially
highlight the improvements that are
needed on the adobe side of things to
improve things like quick sync or enable
quick sync so that you can have
rendering things in the background as
you work or other things that help with
driver or hardware or software
implementation so that cohesion of
software and hardware is much better
than before
now of course render times is not
everything when it comes to video
editing and I am still a thousand
percent more comfortable working with
Adobe Premiere than Final Cut but I'm
slowly starting to catch up to Final Cut
and getting more comfortable with that
type of workflow because again the
render times are just so much faster I
can export and scrub in the real time at
4k video without any hiccup whereas it
would slag and stutter
even on my workstation PC
sucks and so that is it for this video I
hope it was insightful for video editors
or potentially users who are looking to
see what the performance difference
would be you know PC versus Mac and
Premiere and Final Cut versus Adobe
Premiere on the MacBook Pro versus an
extremely powerful sort of gaming or
workstation PC in my case but I'm
