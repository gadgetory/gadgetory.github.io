hierarchy Knox at CES 2017 and as we
went through gigabytes booth we can
cross something very interesting this is
the gaming GT it's about the size of a
Playstation 3 and carries the shape
that's very similar as well to it but
housed within its small frame as some
serious gaming class hardware that can
even be upgraded let's take a closer
look after a message from our sponsors
big thanks to Nvidia gigabyte fan Tex
and NCIX for our CES coverage so let's
start with gigabytes GT exterior since
it's quite distinctive you have a
roughly oval shape that minimizes the
footprint of the Oval chassis and the
section of RGB LEDs on top which are
controlled through gigabytes ambient LED
programme above the chassis is a pair of
louvers which will open upwards to allow
more airflow into the case when at load
and temperatures are increasing during
gaming sessions meanwhile all the cables
are routed through the base so they
remain mostly hidden from the view
connectivity was a key concern for
gigabyte since anyone who buys a
pre-built system needs this to be future
proof and taking that into account the
gaming GT has 5 USB 3 ports a Gen 2 USB
3.1 type a and the combination of
Thunderbolt 3 USB 3.1 type-c ports and
gigabytes intend for the gaming GT is to
sell it as a complete system and it
certainly has specifications to back
that up in this prototype we have a core
760 700 K which will be later upgraded
to KB like processor now a GTX 1080 g1
gaming graphics and the 32 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory at 240 gigabyte SSD and a
one terabyte two and a half inch hard
drive and this is all powered by a 400
watt flex ATX power supply so the
pricing for the gaming GT hasn't been
announced but I'm curious to know what
you guys think of these pre-built
systems do you like this approach that
gigabyte went with in terms of the shape
and the color design with these you know
green perforations let us know in the
comments down below and we'll get you
more information as we get closer to
launch another thing gigabyte was
showing off was this prototype or as a
brand in gaming notebook called the x9
while it may have been just a prototype
it will be coming into the market in
just the next few months so not only
does it have a completely new design
with sharper lines and RGB accents but
there's also a full me
conical keyboard here built-in with
brown switches it's very nice to see low
profile keys which are you know with
very popular brown switches although I
didn't really feel like cherry switches
so perhaps they're using something on
the kale side and even on this early
prototype the soft touch material felt
really good the build quality was very
nice and while they have expanded the
body size thickness it's still a fairly
thin for the hardware packs but the i/o
is still quite minimal but we do see
dual USB type-c connectors which most
likely will be USB 3.1 gen2 and like the
game GT we just looked at the real star
of the show are the specifications there
will be a 4k option which is awesome for
a 17-inch panel and overclocked in Tokyo
like processor and the most importantly
compatibility with dual card setup for
an upcoming graphics cards from Nvidia
so SLI in such notebook is so cool
gigabyte is actually waiting for that
unnamed 2 GPU to launch before releasing
this beastly notebook of course we will
expect a bunch of fastest as the options
in here as well and to cool everything
we're told the fan system has been
upgraded and so in the past we have come
down pretty hard on gaming notebooks for
their high price and lack of upgrade
ability when compared to desktops
however is laptop hardware continues to
approach what's available on DIY systems
it isn't hard to see why these portable
powerhouses are becoming more and more
popular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
