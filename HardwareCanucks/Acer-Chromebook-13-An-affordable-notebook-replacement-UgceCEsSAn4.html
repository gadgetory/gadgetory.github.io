great technology selection and service
hey guys
Eber here with hurricane ax and the
Chromebook has been around for a few
years now and with the release of new
and more efficient chips to run the
system it is an excellent incentive to
revisit the Chromebook and see how far
we've come to satisfy a growing desire
for online media consumption and
productivity work so today we're taking
a look at the Acer Chromebook 13 that
has finally been launched in Canada
priced at an affordable $400 price point
and while he can find $400 laptops at
that's your total budget the Chromebook
in this instance may actually provide
better value with overall better
experience the white hard plastic
chassis feels surprisingly good with a
slim minimalist design that after a
while picks up every single dark blemish
and signs of wear starts to appear
almost immediately it weighs about three
pounds that feels a little heavy for
what it is but it's only 0.7 inches
thick so carrying the Chromebook in my
bag was not a problem plus everyone
should appreciate the small power brick
although these need to get down in size
and Vidya joins the game as this is the
first Chromebook to host the Tegra k1 a
quad-core processor clocked at 2.1
gigahertz four gigabytes of ddr3 LSD RAM
a 32 gigabyte SSD and a 13.3 inch 1080p
matte display since 32 gigabytes is not
that much for storage Acer includes a
free subscription of 100 gigabytes on
Google Drive for two years just note
that you have to pay monthly after that
time period taking a physical tour of
the Chromebook on the left side there is
a single USB 3.0 port along with an SD
card slot a power jack and a headphone /
microphone jack on the right and an HDMI
port and your second USB 3.0 port on the
back I personally do not like this USB
placement at the rear since it might
annoy most users when plugging in their
USB devices there are two LED
notification lights right below the
screen that indicates when the system is
on or off and if the battery is fully
charged the keyboard layout is excellent
to satisfy any functionality for Chrome
OS the top row has dedicated shortcuts
for return forward and refresh page
maximize your window a multi
button that explodes your open apps
brightness and volume control and
finally the power button the caps lock
has been replaced with a search button
that once you are aware of this comes
into constant use if you plan to rely on
Chromebook for a lot of Correspondence
such as email schoolwork Google Docs etc
I'm happy to report key bounce and
travel distance feels extremely
satisfying but the palm rest offers
plenty of room for comfort and I really
enjoy typing this review without any
hiccups the touchpad is pretty
responsive for your day-to-day tasks but
if you are working with applications
that require pinpoint accuracy I would
recommend using an external mouse the
1080p display is sharp enough to view
content on the color reproduction wasn't
as accurate compared to premium IPS
panels or AMOLED displays but
considering the price point I've got to
give a shout-out to Acer for including
this resolution one thing that I found
interesting is an option in the settings
to set the display to scale all the way
up to 2400 by 1350 I'm not sure why this
wasn't advertised but if you want to
work with extra pixel density you have
that option as well although there are
no options to enable text scaling on the
display for a better viewing experience
but I got used to it eventually there
are two speakers hidden at the bottom of
the chassis the audio really surprised
me for the price it's clear I didn't
notice any distortion with volume at
maximum level however the base was
non-existent and the audio tends to get
muffled when listening to music with a
Chromebook on the lab here's a listen of
how the Chromebook sounds
the battery life was all over the
marketing materials when the Chromebook
13 was released thanks to the power
efficiency of the Tegra k1 chip
however under heavy use sort of your
worst case scenario it lasted a
disappointing 5 hours and 47 minutes
that's at 100% brightness and a constant
reverse cycle running a webpage and a
YouTube video on a loop again with
casual usage a full day lasted no
problem into the next with 8 plus hours
of runtime with browsing the web reading
and some Google Doc work the standby
time during sleep mode was exceptional
and the battery levels dropped only 1%
after 2 hour break the Tegra k1 did keep
up pretty well in terms of performance
streaming HD content and music on the
web was not a problem but I noticed
occasional freezing with 15 tabs open on
Chrome so serious multitasking just not
might be a positive for the Chromebook
my experience with Chrome OS was
surprisingly good I was able to learn
the basics quickly and spending most of
the time browsing the web and using
Google services constantly all my
settings and preferences were synced
perfectly you can use the Chromebook
offline and most of Google's
productivity apps like Google Docs
Google slides and Google Forms worked
fine and synced up when going back
online
so in conclusion Acer truly stepped up
their game with the Chromebook 13 at the
outstanding price point with acceptable
build quality and slim profile the
excellent keyboard and a reliable
touchpad turns the Chromebook into an
exceptional productivity tool the
included HDMI output could come in handy
and the Tegra k1 is an excellent chip
for day-to-day tasks although I wouldn't
go crazy multitasking with it the 1080p
display is appreciated at this price
point but the colors aren't the best for
viewing content the battery life was
outstanding from what I've seen so far
compared to regular PC laptops and
personally I would recommend the
Chromebook 13 for students and
individuals that can get away using
Google Apps and are content with the
simplicity of Chrome OS so this
