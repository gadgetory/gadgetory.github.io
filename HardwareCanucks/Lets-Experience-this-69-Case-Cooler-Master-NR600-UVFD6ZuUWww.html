original N600 was one of my favorite
cases under $100 so we're checking out
the NR600 sort of budget $80 mint hour
which follows a similar front panel
design as the rest of the end serious
cases well look what we have here some
Harbor connect stuff filters but that's
for another case and I'm really curious
to see what Coolermaster has done with
this series are they improving on it or
are they just digging themselves in a
hole now the good thing about this
enclosure is that it's only six to nine
dollars so it isn't within that budget
territory competing with the likes of
the P350X for example and like the H500 from NZXT so is this thing any good
let's find out right dudes hello I'm
looking for some fans well are you
married yeah I have a ring what is your
favorite number I would say 3 do I have
the perfect fan for you this is the new
thermal tech ring trio 12 fans with good
static pressure for radiators it is a
beautiful frame with double side and
center ring illumination with soft and
super bright spill with razor chrome and
compatibility control it through your
smartphone the RGB plus software on the
PC or Amazon Alexa well I'm gonna take
these home perhaps you should to check
them out in the description below
alright so what we have here with the NR
600 is cool masters attempt to compete
with the P 350 X and the NZXT HR hundred
because physically it kind of reminds me
of those two cases so on the exterior
for example the whole boxy approach is
very reminiscent of the NZXT th 500
while the built-in power supply shroud
into the actual frame and reducing the
tempered glass side panel size is that
what the P 350 X is known for it is a
little bit boring I'm not gonna lie but
if you're going for the whole subdued
and simple aesthetic here you have the
NR600 and the only physical
differentiations between this case and
many others would be the tiny little
punched in cooler master shape on the
power supply out at the back and of
course the ventilated front mesh panel
without glossy section on the right and
so this mesh I would say is the star of
the show
cause there's nothing blocking airflow
there's not even a dust filter behind
the mesh that is kind of your built in
dust filter if you may it is metal and
it will allow majority of the airflow
versus what you'll see with many other
cases that have some sort of metal mesh
and a dust filter so that's a good thing
that's for cooling we have two fans
included one in the front one in the
rear and for the front installation you
can do up to a 360 or 280 milliliters up
here and the power supply shroud section
of the front is cut out enough usual
three inches so you can fit the radiator
and the set of fans and because the fans
are installed outside of the frame
because there is no dust filter up there
you could do push and pull which is
pretty nice also I will say I'm
disappointed at the build quality of the
front panel the frame itself is plastic
and only the mesh is metal so there is
plenty of flex going on as you can see
and that's for the top you can do dual
120s or 140mm fans and interestingly the
dust filter comes not installed by
default it's actually magnetic and
attached to the side panel so I would
recommend installing it to allow for
better air pressure to that hole like
from the front to the back and it's not
exactly radiator friendly up there
simply because that entire cooling
section is moved all the way to the back
and there isn't that much clearance
between the motherboard the i/o here is
pretty basic with dual USB three power
reset button and a combo mic / headphone
jack both side panels use thumb screws
for the mount and I appreciate the dual
step procedure for the tempered glass
removal first you have to pull it out
and then angle it and remove the little
hinges at the bottom so you could
install the tempered glass panel without
using thumb screws now as for the
interior for 69 bucks we're not
expecting miracles and I'm kind of glad
that there is no sophistication going on
it's pretty roomy interior so if you are
installing anything in the front for
radiators there's plenty of space until
you hit the ATX area but of course if
you're not installing anything in the
front then that whole section looks kind
of empty that's for the power supply
shroud we have three SSD locations and I
actually appreciate cooler masters
approach to completely tool is designed
here so you insert these rubber pegs
into these holes and mount these little
excerpt I guess from the SSD or three
and a half inch drives and you simply
put the
the into the rubber peg very simple to
install and you can maneuver your drives
all around the enclosure so there's two
spaces the back three on the power
supply shroud but we also have this
individual drive cage for three and a
half inch units that you install with
these individual caddies the good thing
is it does not interfere with any
potential radiator that you might slide
however it is riveted so it is non
removable which may cause issues with
your power supply so if your power
supply is anything longer than 160
millimeters then you will not be able to
fit the power supply and your cables and
I'm guessing its riveted so it could
provide structural rigidity to the frame
itself but it is a big limitation for
longer power supply units and especially
if you're not using any three and half
inch drives then that whole space is
completely unutilized and you cannot
even stash any cables into it because it
completely blocks whatever is the front
of the power supply all right I think
it's time for the build sequence
I'm kidding this is in slow motion and
so outside of that hiccup with the power
supply mounting because of the extension
on the frame I don't know why they can't
just simply cut it out so you could
simply slide the power supply in without
needing to jam it in the assembly
procedure was pretty straightforward
kind of what I would expect from a $69
case but yeah no real issues over here
and that's for temperatures compared to
my most three recent case reviews the
CPU temperature is pretty on par versus
like the P600 s so that's a good thing
but the GPU gets a little bit toasty and
I'm guessing it's because the front fan
while it is right and centered they're
delivering more of that fresh air for
the GPU I guess it doesn't deliver as
much air as the other cases as for
system noise levels the side and front
profiles are actually pretty identical
and it is like the quieter on the side
versus like the fantex p6 from s for
example which is a good thing but from
the front it is slightly louder because
of course that whole mesh thing is open
and because the fan is right against the
mesh it does create a little bit more
turbulent noise profile but otherwise
it's a pretty quiet case with full rpm
as you can hear it is going right now
and yeah that's pretty good and so in
conclusion I feel like the NR600 is
very much needed case for the $69 price
point because they need to compete with
the likes of fan tanks and NZXT and I
would say the HR hundred it would be
like my favorite in terms of build
quality because this one feels a little
cheap in the front plastic panel and all
that steel here is quite thin and when
you're working with it it does feel kind
of cheap but in terms of like the
airflow perspective and noise profile it
is pretty decent the P 350 X from fan
tanks does give you a little bit more
visual candy with that light bar on the
side and the front while here you could
spice things up because the front mesh
and the interior is totally visible from
the front and of course because a temple
a side panel you could experiment with
some interior lighting so that it would
be visible on the exterior as well and
so I'm not disappointed but I was hoping
for a little bit more just so that it
could bring it above the competition
because right now as it stands
doesn't really do anything different or
better versus the rest of the cases but
at least it is not an airflow hazard and
that makes me happy all right guys let
me know what you think of the NR600 in
the comments below if you recall the
original N600 with that whole side
fan profile I wish they could revive
that and just modify the frame to meet
the modern expectations but instead we
have this I'm Dimitri thanks so much for
watching we'll see you in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
