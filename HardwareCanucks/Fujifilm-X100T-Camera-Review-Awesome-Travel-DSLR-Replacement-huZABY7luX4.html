the description for pricing and
availability hello everyone I'm Dmitry
with Haruka Knox and the fujifilm x100t
is a unique piece of gear because it
combines this retro looking type of body
with old-school handling elements but
with an aps-c size sensor and tools for
both neo Pro photographers and amateur
photographers or amateur consumers to
take excellent images with very
satisfying operational mechanics you
know once you learn the camera and this
all adds up to a hefty price that I
initially thought might be a total
turnoff but that soon changed once I
began to sort of explore the full
potential of the x100t and the joy of
shooting with something like this and to
get the specs out of the way it captures
sixteen point three megapixel images
with the aps-c x-trans two sensor with
the ISO range of 200 250 1000 3 inch
screen at the back Wi-Fi capabilities
and the whole lot of other features that
make this experience even more complete
now I recently traveled to Panama to
escape the miserable winter of Toronto
and to get some Sun of course that I
brought back with me but that soon
changed once the snow started falling
again we're in spring now but anyway
what a better way to test out the camera
than to actually take it on the road
with you and see what it can do
and as you can see the camera is
gorgeous many people thought this was a
film camera at first and if you are a
traveler I want to sort of minimize
attracting attention I would say this
would be a considerable choice also a
full black version is available but
there is something about that division
between the silver bits and the textured
midsection I love this look now one of
the reasons I said this camera may
improve you as a photographer is because
of the fixed prime lens this 23-member
optic will make you move your feet how
to capture the perfect shot no longer
can you rely on the zoom from our
versatility standpoint the lack of zoom
can be seen as a negative especially
since the lens is fixed you cannot swap
them for like a zoom for example but I
was happy with the wide field of view to
capture your scene plus the lens has
manual clipped aperture control if you
haven't yet worked with the manual
aperture it's really awesome and dialing
in that auto settings will enable
aperture priority furthermore the lens
is a really smooth focusing ring that is
a positive although it is kind of
awkward to reach and I think it's
totally unnecessary but I was really
surprised to find that you cannot remap
the ring to change any of the settings
so it's locked to only control the focus
and I would much rather have this set to
perhaps changing your ISO on the fly or
choosing different creative filters if
you go into that effect and I'm
surprised that it's not available in the
former maybe that will roll out sometime
in the future because the x30 camera
which is much cheaper and we reviewed
earlier has that option you're able to
choose what the lens ring does instead
of just controlling the focus however on
a positive note the controls are very
well laid out
starting with easy to access power
switch that surrounds the shutter button
so you kind of never miss a moment
fiddling around to turn on the camera
the two dials beside it are your shutter
speed with an easy to distinguish auto
mode and exposure compensation to the
right that has come in handy multiple
times while outdoors the switch on the
side is very important to remember this
is your focus set between manual
continuous and se
I love that we have this feature not
buried somewhere in the settings but
easily accessible right on the body on
the other side behind this door is a
mini mic and remote jack micro USB for
data and charging and micro HDMI for TV
playback the rest of the controls are
laid out just fine surrounding the 3
inch 1 million dot screen with clicky
buttons plus an extra dial for your
thumb and that is my other negative
point on the x100t regarding operational
mechanics it's way too loose scroll
steps are not defined and it's very easy
to miss dial your desired settings now
one of the unique features of the x100t
is the dual viewfinder that you switch
using this dial thing and the front you
can either have an electronic viewfinder
this automatically turned on when you
approach the eyepiece and there are many
positive features on it like gridlines
showing you all the settings histogram
and etc but the color is really an
accurate contrast is way off and you
seriously cannot judge the final image
with the electronic viewfinder I would
say it's only good for composing your
shots and when you're outside and bright
sunlight the optical viewfinder however
is a bit different but also far from
perfect as it doesn't work when in macro
mode so make sure macro mode is disabled
composing your shots will prove
inaccurate and difficult regardless if
framing assist is enabled and then just
ended up using the electronic viewfinder
when outdoors to get my composition
right and to get a sense of depth of
field that you don't get with the
optical viewfinder because you're
literally just looking into that corner
of the camera body
it doesn't fully represent what the lens
is seeing so don't use it just use the
electronic viewfinder or the screen the
back handling feels normal however the
textured mid section is more slippery
than I like and the lack of a thumb bit
at the back should make you accustomed
to being more careful and handle the
x100t with two hands for support but
enough about the camera let's talk about
what you can capture with it so first
the focus is fast even in low-light I
was impressed the burst mode gets up to
five frames per second in the lowest
quality JPEG and of course much slower
when capturing raw and the ability to
shoot raw is a must for this day and age
and this price point and look at how
vibrant the colors are captured the
dynamic range is excellent and having
that f 2.0 aperture for really shallow
that the field is awesome complemented
by a large aps-c size sensor that can
handle high ISO pretty well all the way
up to 6400 where digital noise starts to
appear but the detail is still there and
having that F 2.0 lens pays off
beautifully for evening photography and
I really enjoyed shooting with the x100t
even though I think the EVF should have
been much better but the body size the
pancake lens turned this into almost
ideal camera for travel because once you
learn the field of view and how far you
need to be away from your subject for
that perfect capture you kind of forget
about the drawbacks and be in the moment
of getting awesome pictures the battery
life is nothing outstanding spending
half the day on the beach drain the
battery completely and I didn't even
fully fill my SD card the video modes
got 1080p at 60fps and on paper sounds
excellent but look at that footage it
looks terrible
seriously they could have made it better
for camera that cost this much that's
not okay so the x100t is not the most
versatile camera and it certainly has
faults with the viewfinder it lacks
needed ergonomics for comfortable
one-hand operation and the video mode is
a joke and battery life is too short but
after reviewing the pictures and
reflecting on how much fun I had
shooting with it it all seemed to go out
of the window because the lens and the
sensor combination on the x100t is
brilliant because in photography despite
the tools that we use it's the sort of
the final outcome and how you feel when
capturing those moments that really
matters and I feel the fujifilm x100t
captures that essence of just going out
and taking pictures and enjoying
yourself while doing so perfectly with
this camera and so that concludes this
camera review we hope you enjoyed and
let us know which of the pictures you
enjoyed the most with the car
