with cases and I'm actually quite
surprised at what thermaltake just
launched with the new a 500 an enclosure
that looks absolutely beautiful I think
this is the most beautiful thermaltake
enclosure that I've ever seen but before
we get into that huge thanks to thermal
take cooler master and fantex
for making complex possible so this
thermal take a 500 case it surprisingly
does not even have any logos and it
really felt nice too from a build
quality perspective because there's
absolutely no plastic anywhere on the
case unlike on many of their previous
cases that use plastic paneling and you
know acrylics here we get an aluminum
exterior steel frame and of course
tempered glass the aluminum is
sandblasted so they don't catch any
fingerprints and the color of the
aluminum is on the darker side so like
space gray which looks awesome and I
love the whole design language from the
steel mesh ventilation up top and the
front to this cool angular glass design
on all three sides so the glass actually
follows the structure of the frame
instead of being you know a boring
rectangle it swivels to open
has magnets and the turning knob at the
front instead of the traditional thumb
screws I like this implementation there
is no type-c up top just four USB ports
and all the panels are removable so at
the front you can access those triple
120-140 mounts and the same thing goes
for the top and it's really nice to see
that the i/o is attached to the frame so
here we can do another 360 rad with
super flexible mounting points you can
see there's plenty of height available
above the motherboard even with the
radiator and a set of fans installed and
on the interior everything is pretty
much standard with proper ATX support a
power supply cut out to show the model
name vertical GPU mount is possible
although it is fairly close to the side
panel but it does leave enough room for
other PCI slots so you can populate
those no problem and Thermaltake is now
using this new mounting system for the
hard drive cage on the interior so you
can basically change the height of it
and behind the case cable management
seems ok but I would like to see a
tinted glass panel here to at least hide
this area but velcro straps and plenty
of cable tie points are available all
over the backside I would not mind
seeing additional panels to cover up
these cables especially because that
side is totally transparent
but here yous gonna have to do your best
cable management job to you know be
satisfied with that look and overall I'm
pretty happy with this new a series
especially the elegant exterior so then
what is the catch ah the price it's a
bit more premium than I thought it's
going to be priced at $229 and so what
do you guys think about that price point
and given everything that we've shown
you today about the a 500 you know would
you pay that much for a case like that
it might be challenging given the if
antics evolved ex just came out at $1.99
so potentially thermaltake will need to
think of a better pricing strategy in
order to be competitive with the eight
500 so let us know if you'd like to see
a full review of the eight 500 when that
launches thanks much for watching make
sure to check out this other relevant
content and we'll see you in next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
