brought to you by and say XCOM
technology connected alright a very
unique and innovative product here at
Corsair booth at CES 2014 is there MX
Jerry RGB keyboard so how about we come
over here and let's start I start
talking about there's a lot of things to
cover one of the first things that we
want to mention is that courser has the
exclusivity of MX cherry RGB switches in
2014 now as you can see they are very
vibrant there's a lot of color options
and so as the MX cherry is and the label
this is RGB so it will put purp it will
display a lot of many millions of color
combinations and options so each Key has
an LED built into the PCB and there's a
lot of sort of engineering that goes
into designing something like this
because it is very difficult to
manufacture something that will deliver
to that consistent MX Jerry's feel that
we've come a custom to with this RGB
switch so there is a lot of things that
went into designing the switch so one of
them is the actual LED is built into the
PCB so it will be it will withstand any
static that might come from the keyboard
it has a lot of features so the actual
wiring is built to withstand any
vibrations because if you're pounding on
onto the keyboard so it is gaming
reliable so if you pound your ass
keyboard a night they are telling us
that it will withstand this type of this
type of how to use alright so one more
awesome feature that we were just
notified about is this open API software
that is within within the keyboard so as
you can see right now there's this
ripple effect going on and this is going
to be integrated into the Corsairs
driver software but like we said the
driver software is going to be
completely open for that enthusiasts
gamer who you want to so for example
instead of it rippling this way it can
ripple up and down and that is the type
of customers ability that you will have
because it's completely open you can
basically design for the keys to kind of
go in this snake pattern you can design
your own state game where you perhaps
press one key and it's going to keep
going forward until you know you can
combine so it's a very cool thing I
do you like that coarser is leaving the
software open for those enthusiasts
gamers to experiment exactly how far
they can take this to a whole new level
when it comes to one of these lighting
effects now obviously everybody is very
interested in how this looks maybe you
guys can't see on camera but on in
person the actual keys are very vibrant
the brightness of the LED switches is
amazing and you have a lot of sort of
obviously a lot of color options but a
lot of these ripple effects so you'll be
able to sort of configure the speed the
ripple distance and the ripple size
based on where you're pressing so kind
of like what ducky has but this is going
to be sort of a more I guess a more
Corsair side so as you can see there's a
lot of those ripple effects and a lot of
very unique options here for the color
options and they are telling us that
there'll be a new driver to exactly for
this keyboard that will allow you to
customize those ripple effects that have
ripple distance obviously these the
color of these and each each Key has an
individual LED so you'll be able to
customize each single LED as well of
course the it won't be included with MX
cherry red blue and the brown switches
which are the most popular for gaming so
that's awesome providing those gamers
that flexibility depending on the switch
they prefer this is going to be released
in mid-2014 so I'm really excited to
finally get yet a hand test these out
and you know this is going to be a more
premium product obviously because these
McSherry RGB switches are more expensive
to produce there's there's a lot of
engineering that one behind to producing
this type of keys so it will be more
premium price than your than the m95
keyboard which is one hundred fifty
dollars so this is going to be a lot
more expensive a little bit more
expensive so I guess that's the price
that you pay for such a such a premium
product from course there if you want
that color customization with each
individual key so very cool things from
Coursera in this suite so now let's
check out some other gaming stuff
