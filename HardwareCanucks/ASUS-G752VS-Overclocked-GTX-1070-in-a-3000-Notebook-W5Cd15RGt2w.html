XD it fits into two and a half inch
drive slots comes with four individually
controlled RGB strips with plenty of
connection cables for best routing and
is wonderfully controlled through the
camp software get 10% off at NZXT comm
link in the description it was only a
matter of time until Nvidia's Pascal
architecture finally arrived on
notebooks their high levels of
efficiency virtually guaranteed a
perfect fit within the mobile product
spaces and we're now only starting to
see what the GTX 10 series can offer
gaming notebooks and so far things are
looking pretty impressive today we'll be
taking a look at the asus rog g7 52 vs
overclocked edition which has a hefty
price tag of about 3000 dollars but it
incorporates leading edge technology and
it really doesn't cut any corners while
there is no nonsense gaming platform is
it reasonable to spend this much on a
laptop rather than building a kick-ass
gaming PC let's find out a quick glance
of the specs you're getting a quad core
8 web skylake core i7 6820 HKS CPU
clocked at 2.7 gigahertz 64 gigabytes of
ram running at 2400 megahertz
a 512 gigabyte Toshiba nvme SSD paired
with a one terabyte hard drive spinning
at 7200 RPM there's also a matte 17 inch
1080p g-sync displayed with a refresh
rate of 75 Hertz and started to show a
fully fledged desktop GTX 1078 gigabyte
video card The OC Edition tacked on to
the models name points towards an
out-of-the-box overclock which you'll
pay a premium for this means the CPU
goes up to a maximum of 3.8 gigahertz
memory at 2400 megahertz rather than its
standard 21 33 megahertz and the gtx
1070 s core clock boosts 15 mega it's
faster and these settings are default
but they can be scaled back by switching
to a Souza's standard mode within the
rog gaming center app the ology line of
high-end gaming notebooks is quite
popular within the industry
thanks to their numerous
price points and well-designed rugged
chassis seriously this is by far the
best-looking and well-built notebooks
we've come across in a long time
asus has tastefully blended their
typical color scheme into the chassis
and as you can see it's looking hot
I love the eliminated RG logo as well as
the two strips on the side and it looks
gorgeous and dark there is a bright red
grille at the back which hides a serious
new cooling assembly which consists of
an advanced 3d waver chamber and a
special final design that nearly
eliminates dust buildup in key areas the
downside is that with all this tech
under the hood it's not a portable
laptop by any stretch of the imagination
weighing in at about nine pounds I will
guarantee you will have issues lugging
this thing around to school work or even
travel so that begs the question is it
really worth buying a three thousand
dollar gaming notebook if it is even
portable but that's not a conversation
for another time the 17 inch 1080p
display uses an IPS panel and comes with
a matte coat finish Thank You ensues
it's a beautiful screen that produces
great colors with excellent viewing
angles but the 1080p resolution coupled
with a 75 Hertz refresh rate is on its
way out since will soon see notebooks
with 120 Hertz g-sync
IPS screens considering the 17 inch form
factor a 1080p resolution isn't that bad
and the gtx 1070 has no problem pushing
every game past at 75 Hertz mark I also
like that asus has reinforced the screen
extremely well as it barely flexes under
my testing you get a full sized LED
backlit keyboard with wast keys
exhibiting a subtle dread highlight
which should help locating them when
gaming the keys have great travel
distance and tactile feedback comparing
it to the SteelSeries keyboard on the
gt72 from msi it doesn't feature RGB
lighting or any lighting effects which I
don't mind
considering how Asus is sticking to the
ROG color scheme but is it a real deal
breaker let us know in the comments down
below
just a bit north of the keyboard you'll
find five programmable macro keys and
they can be assigned via the ROG gaming
center this is an odd location because
it's going to be challenging to access
them in the middle of an intense
gameplay and there is plenty of space on
the chassis to the keyboards left the
six button activates the xsplit
gamecaster software
plus the allergy button within the
numpad activates the ROG gaming Center
this brings me to my next point
typing experience while I appreciate the
tactile response along with a soft touch
surface for your palms to rest those
sharp edges on the lower part of the
chassis were so uncomfortable they made
typing almost impossible on a flat
surface take a look at my hands yeah not
so good I highly recommend an external
keyboard the trackpad is good the
surface resistance is minimal making it
easier for finger movement along with
primary physical left and right buttons
which provide excellent response however
palm deduction is missing even with
Windows drivers working at their best
but this can be fixed with an update
given the bulkier chassis expect a lot
of IO ports on the left you'll find a
Kensington lock a pair of USB 3.0 ports
and a blu-ray drive towards the right
there's a power in a Gigabit Ethernet
and HDMI 2.0 connector followed by
DisplayPort 1.4 a pair of USB 3.0 ports
a USB 3.1 type-c connector and the usual
headphone and microphone jacks I hate to
say this but the integrated speakers on
the gt72 V are horrible I blame the
placement on the speaker grills they're
located behind the screen hinge which
blocks the sound completely and trust me
it sounds muffled and unclear you're
much better off using headphones for
better content and gaming consumption
accessing the bottom part of the
notebook for in-place upgrades has never
been this easier there is a single screw
covered by a rubber flap that holds the
cover opening that up gives you quick
access to the RAM the hard drives and
there's a metal plate covering two PCI
slots but there is a free slot available
for expansion Thank You Asus for not
including a volunteer if removed sticker
alright so far I've had mixed feelings
about the design of this notebook but
does paying $3,000 do any good in terms
of performance let's hop into it
starting with the SSD test the Toshiba
nvme SSD dished out a little over 1,600
megabytes per second on read and just a
little over 1,100 megabytes per second
on writes let's move on to gaming
pretty much most adults at 1080p were
dominated by the G 752 V notebook even
topping out the $5,000 x9 sporting dual
980m GPUs the same story applies at our
1440p tests and expected this because
Pascal is no joke
with new GPU architecture comes better
power efficiency but it was not a
significant increase compared to Maxwell
remember NVIDIA is focused on
performance per watt or achieving
acceptable battery life while boosting
overall performance that's exactly what
happened here under light use including
writing the script and watching a few
videos I was able to squeeze just a
little over three hours so if you're
planning to lug around this notebook
around which I highly suggest you don't
make sure to carry the power adapter
which unfortunately is also on the
heavier side the advanced 3d vapor
chamber did a fantastic job calling the
1070 and the 68 20 HK CPU I never
experienced any traveling issues and by
the results it's clear that Pascal cards
are perfect fit for the notebook space
okay so what do I consider the ROG G 752
V gaming notebook to be I would call it
an optional desktop replacement because
for one you would have a tough time
lugging this monster around I'm serious
the typing experience on it was simply
terrible due to the sharp edge at the
lower part of the chassis
although the keys were excellent and the
speakers were not the greatest given the
poor placement these issues can be
solved by plugging in an external gaming
keyboard mouse and speakers and throw in
an extra monitor you're set to achieve
close to a desktop great performance but
does that make it a semi desktop it's on
desk footprint also takes up more space
than some compact cases I've seen the
gtx 1070 is a true star of the show it's
such an awesome GPU you won't have any
issues gaming on it and given the
impressive temperature and acoustic
results of this notebook you're
guaranteed a solid computing experience
even if you wanted to use an external
1440p or 4k screen it won't have any
trouble keeping up would you rather
consider this notebook as a desktop
alternative or would you rather build a
custom desktop let us know in the
comments down below i'm eber with
hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
