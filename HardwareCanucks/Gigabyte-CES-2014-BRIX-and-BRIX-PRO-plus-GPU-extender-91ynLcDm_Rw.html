to you by and say XCOM technology
connected alright guys so we're here
with gigabyte and we're gonna be taking
a look at this guy right here this is
the bricks bro so this is an incredibly
small form factor for what is actually a
pretty decent budget or entry level
gaming device so what we're looking at
right here is actually bf4 playing on a
Brix pro and it actually does come up
with a couple different trim levels and
stuff it actually does this one right
here is actually gonna be running the
AMD a8 apu but one of the cool things
about this is that it does have the
ability that can push out decent
graphics performance we were just
looking and I was actually just playing
a little bit at 720p resolution so it
does have the ability that can push out
standard and pretty decent gaming
graphics at medium levels so little
stuff that low is that actually a medium
it's not gonna play high so it's not
gonna be like a at mid-range gaming
device it's actually for somebody who's
on the budget that wants actually a
whole integrated solution rather than
actually putting something together for
themselves but one of the cool things
about these devices that they are
upgradable you can just unscrew four
screws and you can actually update the
the RAM if you want to and you can
upgrade a couple of different things
like the storage so this is a pretty
neat little device for those of you who
do want gaming on a budget price so now
taking a look at the back of the device
yet it's got multiple different
connectivity ports so I mean it doesn't
skimp on what you can connect to the
brics pro we're gonna have multiple
different USB ports as well some of the
models will come up with at least two
HDMI port so you can connect multiple
monitors to it if you want taking a look
at the front if I can flip it over
without dropping it this specific model
is gonna have two USB 3 ports as well as
a audio out or headphone out port so
this does actually have quite a bit of
good connection options if you decide
that you want to use this type of device
for your gaming experience also it makes
a pretty cool device we want to just
attach it to the back of the monitor
using the included face mounting
bracket now one really cool thing that I
forgot to mention a little while ago is
that one of these devices is actually
powering this seiki 4k monitor so it
does have the ability they can push out
4k resolutions as well too if you guys
want to have something on the back of
your PC that can operate a little bit as
an HTTP C so it's another really good
use alright guys so taking a look now at
some of the little brothers to the Brix
Pro is the Brix itself now this actually
comes from multiple different flavors in
different formats we're taking a look
right now it's really really tiny all
unintegrated options which some of them
actually use Haswell CPUs now what type
of use case would be actually with this
fit and actually makes a lot of sense
for those who just want like a little HC
PC without the actual gaming performance
so you just want to use it as like a
little media box it actually does have a
quite a few uses if you just want
something that's really ultra small
Deacon tied behind a monitor for just
doing basic web browsing and Internet
Options and stuff like that as well -
and some of the devices are upgradeable
as well so you can actually just pop off
the top like I said with the Brix Pro
with a couple of screws you can upgrade
the RAM as well as upgrade the well the
storage space some of them actually have
space for a two and a half inch hard
drive so as you can see these are all
really cool options but another really
cool thing is that these two devices
right here are completely fanless so
they're all passively cooled alright you
know what now that we're here at the
gigabyte overclocking event and their
little booth here set up let's actually
go in bug see if we can bug some of the
professional overclockers let's go Mike
make an ask a question about this
it looks like paint what the hell you
putting on it it's liquid tape
electrical tape so what would be the
purpose of putting this on there to
insulate the board from water so you
don't have like if you have water
build-up it doesn't get into any of the
contacts or anything like that so what
type of clocks you open together this
one depends I'm gonna do four-way
benching so it's a pain just to get that
setup running at all
so we'll see probably most likely heaven
or a couple different benchmarks maybe
like already stuff like that are you
expecting any world record to be broken
today oh definitely see some over all
right go things like your timing it
smells like paint and one of the coolest
things that we've seen here today is
basically an external GPU expander
solution now this is very very very
early prototype and it's actually
connected to a Brix gaming system using
a mini SAS HD connector port now this
actually uses two cables and like I said
this is very early prototype the actual
goal is to be able to use a thunderbolt
or USB or USB 3 in the future so that
you can have that throughput and
everything but the coolest thing is is
that inside this box that has a 600 watt
power supply is a GTX Titan so the
greatest thing about this little box and
like I said early prototype little box
is the fact that it actually has the
ability that you can put a high end GPU
and attach it to something as small as
two bricks or maybe even an ultrabook
later down the road if you want that
extra horsepower to play some games one
of the other cool Brix devices that we
found here at a gigabytes booth and the
overclocking event is the Brix mats now
one of the really cool things about this
specific compact and I want to state
that it's a very compact device is the
fact that it's a network solution or a
network storage solution it's a media
center solution
it's a entertainment solution for lack
of a better word it's basically that one
little device that you want to have in
your living room that will connect all
of your media it'll act as a that's like
a cloud so you can actually stream your
content
your Android devices you can control it
with this awesome little remote here
that actually does have a keyboard on
the back so basically all you have to do
is you just swivel the keyboard around
it controls the mouse on the screen
itself now this specific device has for
two and a half inch drive bay options so
you can actually have quite a bit of
storage especially to consider that
Western Digital and Seagate have these
awesome little one terabyte two and a
half inch drives with a built-in SSD as
well too so this means you can actually
have a pretty powerful and a pretty
substantial amount of storage in such a
compact device sitting in your living
room specifically for your storage and
your media consumption and why don't
they bother stopping why did I even
bother snapping okay hey guys oh hey
look it's Linus look it's Linus</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
