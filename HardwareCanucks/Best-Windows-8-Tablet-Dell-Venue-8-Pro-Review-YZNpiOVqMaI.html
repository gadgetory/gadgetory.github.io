great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is dimitri with
hardware canucks
and we are finally seeing windows-based
tablets come down in price to compete
with Android and iOS offerings the Dell
Venue 8 Pro is under my review cap today
as we take a look at how it functions as
a Windows tablet and whether or not you
should take your $300 elsewhere if this
is the form factor you're after I think
there is a right in the wrong place for
Windows tablets within the market for
general purpose tasks like media
consumption and social interaction
I think Android and iOS may be more
fitting is there a little bit more
user-friendly however there exists that
certain demographic that needs two full
windows experience while on the go
however that market segment is much
smaller under the hood the Venue 8 Pro
is running an Intel Atom BHEL trail
quad-core chip with boost frequencies of
up to 1.8 gigahertz there's two gigs of
ram and then comes at both 32 and 64
gigabyte capacities now the number 8 in
the name stands for two things first
this is an 8 inch tablet with 1280 by
800 resolution which i think is adequate
as doing any precise navigation on the
screen is already difficult using touch
in such a form factor the second meaning
is it's running full windows 8.1 32-bit
so yet the entire proper windows
experience you can run any executable
files and this makes the entire windows
ecosystem that much more seamless
between devices the IPS display is
exceptional with excellent viewing
angles and vibrant colors with deep
darks and I personally find the 8 inch
size perfect mix between meeting
something larger than your phone but not
going overboard with the size it's thin
and lightweight and that's exactly what
we need I can hold this perfectly well
with just one hand in portrait mode and
well enough in landscape thanks to the
rubberized cover at the back that both
is part of the design and
functions as anti-slip we have a 1.2
megapixel front-facing camera that's in
the corner
allowing decent composition and either
orientation of your Skype calls but the
front viewing angle could be wider for
note so in your face video chat a 5
megapixel shooter at the back is OK
leave your phone to those pictures it
does record the 1080p but really nothing
to write home about up top we have a
headphone and microphone jack that's
combined into one a physical windows
button I'm glad there's no capacitive
windows button in the middle of the
tablet as a simple swipe on the screen
reveals the start logo anyway right on
the side there is a microUSB for data
and charging power button and the volume
rocker with great clicky feedback and
there's also micro SD card slot for
expandable storage that's very much
needed on any windows-based tablet as
without a 32 gigabyte model only 23 is
usable out of which less than 10% is
available after installing a few games
from the store app and Microsoft Office
so you definitely need extra storage for
any media or games you might want to
store on the device the speaker is at
the bottom it's ok but we seriously need
to see integration of front-facing
speakers instead on pretty much every
mobile device thanks to HTC now one of
the very appealing aspects about this
tablet is the inclusion of full
Microsoft Office Home &amp;amp; student edition
I actually broke this review on the
tablet with the inclusion of this
Bluetooth keyboard that you can buy
separately or $100 it's totally opie
it's certainly much easier for typing
but it's not perfect the keys are not
wide enough with a tiny left shift and
because the keyboard is so thin doing
any long projects would be a pain for
your fingers it does magnetically
attached to the optional case that's an
additional 40 bucks but no clip to
secure the hold so it's just an OK
all-in-one package but it could be
better also the case allows only one
viewing position with the Venue 8 Pro
and sort of really uncomfortable to
actually hold the tablet and use it with
the case attached
you can purchase the Dell stylus pen
that's absolutely needed as desktop mode
and Windows is absolutely a pain to
navigate using touch and my overall
experience with the Venue 8 Pro has been
satisfactory to a point I love that one
sign then into your Microsoft account
everything is synced up to my apps and
my theme for that seamless transition
where I don't have to fiddle around to
set up the tablet for use
performance-wise playing games from the
store app was flawless with just a few
minor hiccups and different frame rates
and sometimes browsing the web was also
snappy and lag free I did that the
camera app crashed on me a few times
while installing Windows updates and
unresponsive chrome and other windows
that I couldn't close for some reason
but generally I really could see this
being in mobile replacement from your
conventional laptops or even tablets
where the foam factor over ways
everything else the 18 watt hour battery
life with a hundred-percent screen
brightness and browsing the web the
entire time served me only under six
hours that's pretty short lifespan but
of course it is limited by that battery
capacity now you could do a lot more
with the Venue 8 Pro then your standard
Android or iOS tablet but that is really
up to the user as you know Android and
iOS devices may be more fitting in some
instances while the Venue 8 Pro could be
the complete driver for your social
media and on-the-go business and to
conclude there's a lot of positive
starting with the excellent display and
resolution just the right form factor
with thickness weight and the 8 inch
size for one hand holding included MS
Office is a big one with smooth
performance and lag free gaming and
browsing the web as well Oh at the
reasonable price of $2.99 for the 32
gigabyte model of course there are
things we don't like such as the awkward
side mounted speaker the stylus pen must
be purchased separately even though I
feel it should be included because of
the clunky nature of touch navigation in
desktop mode and also battery life is a
little bit disappointing this is however
an attractive windows-based tablet for
users who are not sadist
with Android or iOS offerings and the
incredibly competitive price point from
Dell with The Venue 8 Pro scores it
Harbach Knox damn good value of Word now
we realized that Windows tablets are not
as popular but taking the Venue 8 Pro as
a total package will you consider
getting one over say and Nexus 7 that is
similarly priced and sized let us know
in the comments below of how you might
use the Venue 8 Pro as always thanks for
