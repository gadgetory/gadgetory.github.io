great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry with Herick NOx
and today we've got the Acer Iconia w3
with Windows 8 tablets slowly emerging
onto the market you've got to ask
yourself - why they matter and who are
they competing against with iOS and
Android dominating the tablet and
smartphone scene there's still plenty of
reasons to opt out for a Windows 8
machine is your alternative portable
device well because you get full office
suite which is included with the
iconians and on the limited version
found on iOS or Android and you can
finally work with Windows 8 OS the way
it was intended with touch the Konya
double three is an 8 point one inch
device the smallest in its category and
one of the least expensive Windows 8
tablets out there retailing for 299 for
a 32 gigabyte version and 369 for the 64
gigabyte model this is about $200 less
than the competing devices from Asus
Lenovo or same song which makes w3 an
attractive choice because of the size
but also the price it is slightly
thicker than similarly sized tablets
weights about 500 grams but absolutely
fine for one hand holding now it's not
the most hideous stomach out there but
the black screen bezel and the white
plastic frame around and the metallic
plastic at the bottom just seemed out of
place now it's nice there trying to be
different from the conventional black
style but perhaps the simpler the better
it is a responsive and flu tablet the
Metro UI running until atom dual-core
1.5 gigahertz and with 2 gigs of RAM for
browsing the web YouTube playback and
working on documents it will do just
fine plus a few casual games here and
there
wake up times are good but there is that
occasional hiccup with apps given the
screen size precise navigation is more
difficult at times frustrating having to
constantly miss the desired location on
the screen no wonder we haven't seen
8-inch Windows tablet yet also w3 gets
quite hot in the top portion of the
device near the front-facing camera that
using it and landscape mode gets quite
uncomfortable and reverting it into a
portrait mode to keep your hands cool is
the only option the flower storage
included with the device it's quite slow
running
HD tomb the transfer rate is slower than
your regular 7200 rpm drive so just
something to keep in mind all of the
buttons and connections are scattered
around with power button microUSB for
data only you're not able to charge the
tablet through this port and micro HDMI
located at the top stereo speakers
headphone and power jack located at the
bottom and volume rocker plus a microSD
card slot on the side now watching
videos in landscape mode and you get
that one sided audio effect because the
speaker location it is not ideal and
quickly gets annoying for any video
playback now the biggest issue with the
Akoni ow3 is the display the resolution
on this tablet is perfectly fine with
1280 by 800 but it's the color
reproduction and the very visible grain
in the panel itself that makes this one
of the worst displays I've ever seen on
tablet if not the worst the grain is
especially visible on lighter
backgrounds looks almost like digital
noise it gives the impression of a
pixelated screen which it is not at 186
PPI text look sharp and perfectly clear
with the size of the screen and the
embedded grain in the panel is
completely an acceptable decision from
Acer this is by far the biggest turnoff
with the w3 and I'm surprised this was
released like that the color
reproduction is not as vibrant as we've
come to expect from tablets and has a
very warm overtone on the white
furthermore the viewing angles are very
limited there's a huge contrast drop
with vertical angles especially when
leaning tablet towards you in portrait
mode it resembles a very poor TN panel
side to side viewing is much improved
however with no contrast job or color
shift but still I questioned a sirs
decision to release a very competitive
device like this with such a terrible
display yes it is more portable than the
competition and yes it is slightly
cheaper but I would rather see a non
grainy and usable screen for a bit more
cash of course Windows 8 is huge
thank God we have a micro SD card slot
and micro USB for additional storage as
out of the box our 32 gigabyte model is
full with just over three gigabytes of
free space by far the best thing about
the tablet which surprised me was how
long it lasted with a
milliamp hour battery pack I got over
eight hours of mixed use with medium
brightness plus a really fast recharge
rate is always a bonus honestly in the
Akoni double three feels rushed and
unpolished a better screen would have
turned things around for this Windows 8
tablet as its portable factor more
aggressive pricing micro HDMI port
decent battery life and the included
office suite are all irrelevant when the
basic feature of a handheld device such
as the screen is so terribly designed
stereo speakers are completely out of
place and having only three gigabytes of
free space out of the box is so limiting
I wonder why the 32 gigabyte capacity is
even an option while the performance is
acceptable with the Atom processor if
your main tasks include browsing the web
entertainment and social media there's
absolutely no advantage going with
Windows 8 unless you seriously require
that full office suite the concept of
packing a full desktop experience into a
tablet is very appealing it's the
execution with the a Konya w3 that is
not and your best to look elsewhere so
thanks guys for watching we'll see you
