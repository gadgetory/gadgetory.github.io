one of our fastest AMD gaming /
workstation PC this build solely
revolves around AMD's x570 platform
which is their latest offering as well
as embracing their brand new Ryzen 9
processor which is an absolute beast and
taking advantage of their flagship 5700
series GPU so this build is gonna be
epic until a new drivers crash on me now
I do want to take this time to explain
why we haven't posted our Ryzen 3000
series review and that simply because
we've been experiencing some odd boost
behaviors with the motherboards that
were sent to us there were also other
reports reported online as well so we
weren't 100% confident in publishing a
review until we were you know certain
that these new CPUs perform as per AMD's
spec now we decided to instead publish a
build video featuring one of their new
processors to give you a snapshot in
terms of what you can expect in terms of
performance so if anything changes we
will definitely make sure to give you
guys an update on that so yeah
definitely expect a lot more rise in
content coming in the next few weeks now
coming back to the build I do want to
make this visually appealing without
adding too much RGB into the mix but
rather unify the color of individual
components inside the system so I
believe all the components that are
sitting in front of me fit that criteria
so let's get started but first a quick
message from our sponsor the newbie
quiet dark rock slim cooler offers high
physical clearance for any memory module
thanks to its slim heatsink and the low
profile 120 mil airflow optimized fan so
you get great cooling low noise easy
installation and no issues for high
profile Ram check it out below at the
heart of the system lies the writes in 9
3,900 X this is Amy's first 12 core 24
threaded processor for the aim for
platform the boost clocks go as far as
4.6 gigahertz
according to AMD and it has 64 megabytes
of l3 cache intel has certainly left the
chat our motherboard of choice is the
asrock x5 70 Taichi and this thing is
packed with features like a metal
backplate an entire thermal armor that
also acts as a heat sink for the 3 PCI
Gen 4 slots so this should definitely
help improve
dissipation for the Chandpur drive that
will be popping into one of these slots
more on that in just a bit the IO is
loaded with USB three-point to Gen 1
ports a couple of USB 3.2 gen to 10g
ports and more Plus this board does
support Wi-Fi 6 which is awesome also I
love the effects of this board and it's
not shy while we're clocking to asrock
has implemented their best power phase
design so it's very refreshing to see
motherboard manufacturers not skimp on
enthusiast level features on the m4
platform cool nd 3,900 X is the Animax
lick tech 3 60 millimeter a aia cooler
it is white in color so it definitely
fits the theme that were going for in
the first place as for RAM I chose
Corsair Vengeance RGB 2 times 32
gigabyte kits so total of 64 gigabytes
and we're populating all four dims as
for storage or has hooked us up with a 2
terabyte Gen 4 and me me drive and
what's special about this particular
drive is all for starters given that it
supports the latest PCI Gen 4 protocol
the read and write speeds are off the
charts I mean we're talking 5 gigabytes
per second read and over 4 gigabytes per
second right now it's not gonna yield
you higher FPS but in this case given
that it is constant find as a Gen 4
drive cooling is certainly an important
factor to consider but it looks like
Oris has figured that out because
they've actually included a copper heat
saying that goes on top of the drive and
I could admit this thing is as heavy as
my smartphone which is just absolutely
insane this thing is a tank guys you
really have to you know hold it and kind
of feel in your hands but unfortunately
in our case I won't be able to take
advantage of this particular heat sing
because the thermal armor on the azure
motherboard is geared for all of those
two slots so we're just going to wait
and see how that can efficiently cool
the Gen 4 Drive given its rated speeds
moving on to our graphics card and we
chose the rx 5700 XT and as I'm opening
the box it's not there because it's how
my test bench and I have to get it out
for the build but nonetheless I'm pretty
sure a lot of you guys know about what
the GPU is and what can what it can
offer in fact if you're interested in a
full performance review you can check
out our link right over here we compare
it with our TX super cards and what
anybody has to offer so that is what
we're going with powering our entire
build is beak
straight power 10 700 watt 80 plus gold
modular power supply this thing is
plenty enough to power the 3900 X and
the 5700 XT we're also pairing this PSU
with cable mods mod flex white and black
kit it should suit our color scheme
pretty well our case of choice is the
fractal design measure Phi s 2 and we
went with the white and black variant
with the tempered glass panel and it
looks absolutely gorgeous I mean this
case doesn't skimp on things like air
flow and it can comfortably accommodate
our 360 millimeter high or cooler so
that's awesome in fact if you're
interested in a full in-depth review you
can check out Dmitry's video right over
here so with all that out of the way
let's put this thing together
so the build is finally complete and I
have to be honest it's one of the
coolest looking pcs that are built in a
while simply because the color of
individual components blends in really
well with each other the 360 monaro
matches perfectly with the case so does
the memory modules I think the only
issue that I had was with the LED
lighting of individual components so the
azrog motherboard actually outputs a
white that isn't white there's actually
a little bit of a purple hue on top of
that so I had to play around with the
RGB channels to match the memory modules
so that that certainly took some time
and it was a challenging process but if
there is a motherboard vender thinking
about an all-white motherboard I am so
down for it the red Radeon logo on the
5700 XT does add a nice accent color to
this entire build I mean I wanted to
throw in something that screamed or
something that added that team red
finish so it happened to do the job just
fine also let me know what you guys
think about the vertical GP positioning
of that graphics card do you prefer it
that way or should I switch back to the
standard horizontal mount let me know in
the comments down below alright so now
it's time to evaluate the performance on
the 3900 X and the 5700 XT now do keep
in mind that I ran all of these tests
and stock setting I'll be it I did
enable precision boost over drive
through AMD's rise and master software
and I will touch on the overclocking
experience with this processor in just a
bit but let's start off with some
synthetic tests starting with cinema r15
the multi-core score was over 3,000
points and to give you a little bit of
context my 8,700 case called 1630 when
overclocked to 5 gigahertz and this is
the processor that I used for my
everyday video editing workflow and
compared to my previous AMD bill which
is a little bit more on the affordable
side featuring the Ryzen 5 2600X yeah
it's where we expected it to be now
moving on to blender running the BMW
benchmark the 3900X took less than
three minutes to complete that task and
when I compared to something like the 87
Andrew K overclocked to 5 gigahertz that
took well over 4 minutes and the 2600 X
took over 6 minutes to complete it so
this 12 core 24-hour CPU is an absolute
monster when it comes to multi-core
performance
moving on to our Adobe Premiere Pro test
and boy
interesting stories of statite this is
an all AMD based system it is running
AMD drivers so as I was playing back
this 12 minute 4k project it is our
standard benchmark for Adobe Premiere
Pro the program monitor was completely
glitching out on me and as you can see
it is not pleasing to the eye and it
certainly isn't feasible for content
creation or just the experience as an
whole but as soon as I hit the spacebar
key which stops the playback it displays
the image just fine so it's definitely a
driver optimization issue with Adobe
Premiere and AMD and this is a big red
flag especially if you're considering
picking up the 5700 XT and if you're
thinking about you know both gaming and
doing a little bit of content creation
and if you plan on using Adobe Premiere
Pro yeah not so well but but this is the
most fun part it actually managed to
render the entire project without a
problem using Adobe Media encoder and
here are the results and as you can see
my 8700 K is still faster and that's
thanks to Intel Quick Sync but that
being said the 3900X is not too far
behind it still manages to complete or
render that video just a little over 12
minutes but to give you a little bit of
context if I were to compare this 12
cores here to a 6-quart 12 30 2600X the
difference is pretty significant and
that's obviously due to the thread count
but I also want to mention that if
you're planning on building a system
specifically for Adobe creative
applications I would highly recommend
Intel going the Intel platform because
QuickSync can come in super handy for
those Suites but if you're planning on
building a system for say DaVinci
Resolve or other applications that can
take image of multi-core horizon is the
way to go
moving on to gaming performance and I
noticed a major issue you see for some
reason my 3d mark 5 strike scores were
so low so I decided to monitor my GPU
clock speeds and I noticed that it
wouldn't go over to 70 megahertz so
basically it wouldn't switch from 2d
mode to 3d mode when it's doing
something graphically intensive now we
assume that the graphics card and the
motherboard would switch automatically
to Gen 3 mode and given that we're using
a gen 3 riser card but that wasn't the
case because it was ultimately a signal
interruption issue so if you plan on
building a system with an x570
motherboard and if
d7x t he planted vertically mounting it
you are definitely gonna run into this
issue now if you're using the 5700 XT on
an X470 platform or something that
doesn't use the pc engine for interface
you should be okay but luckily the as
romp x5 sunny tech she had the option
within the bios to change the x16 the
top slot to gen 3 config so that's what
I did and everything turned out to be
just fine with all of that sorted I was
finally able to run some gaming
benchmarks and as you can see this
system is an absolute beast
most replayed titles will comfortably
hit over 100 frames per second like
battlefield 1 overwatch and apex legends
these are all at the highest percent I
shadowed the Tomb Raider far cry 5 and
Warhammer 2 where slightly depending on
the 5700 XT but it was completely
playable I do want to quickly touch base
on the gen 4 SSD from Oris and as you
can see it just flies I mean we're
talking 5 gigabytes per second read over
4 gigabytes per second right
it's crazy fast I mean if you are
someone who can take advantage of all of
this bandwidth then the gen 4 SSD is for
you but I also wanted to monitor the
temperatures and the tunnels of this
drive and I used my thermal camera and
it looks like it does the job pretty
well the thermal armor on the asrock
motherboard seems to cool or efficiently
dissipate the heat coming off of that
drive it is a hot spot but it seems to
do the job and finally I want to wrap
things up with my overclocking
experience on the 3900 X so I was able
to get this 12 core 24 32 CPU to 4.25
gigahertz at one point three seven five
volts and I did make sure to run prime95
at a 64 stress test even ran some
synthetic benchmarks to make sure it's
stable and as you can see by these
multi-core tests there isn't a
substantial improvement over stock
settings single core performance does
take a hit and that's because the core
frequencies are constant at 4.20
gigahertz so they don't boost because if
I switch back to stock settings the core
frequencies actually fluctuate between
4.1 and 4.2 Hertz
they never hit 4.6 gigahertz which is
what AMD claims that the CPU hits but I
never saw it hit that frequency so that
is certainly something that we want to
investigate in the future so definitely
stay tuned for that honestly if you want
my opinion
I would just leave the CPU at stock
settings it performs like a champ
and if you've paired up with some faster
memory you're sent you wouldnt have to
worry about temperatures or anything
like that
so that's that's my take on overclocking
for now speaking of temperatures they
wear under control under low during both
stock and overclock settings I didn't
see them rising over ADC so that's nice
the new hydro x-series from Corsair is a
full water cooling eco system with
transparent blocks for RGB goodness and
built-in flow indicators with soft and
hard to being available and the full
array of fittings so you can design the
perfect loop for you hide your X by
Corsair everything's linked below so
that's the build guys let me know what
you guys think about in the comments
down below are there any specific
components or alternative components
that would have better fit this pc most
importantly are there any other tests
that you'd like us to run on this
particular system I'm curious to know
about that in the comments down below
again stay tuned for more content on
risin 3000 we certainly have a lot of
digging up to do but that about wraps it
up for now thank you so much for
watching make sure to check out some
relevant content over here subscribe to
our boot sequence Channel I'm signing
off and I'll see you guys in the next
