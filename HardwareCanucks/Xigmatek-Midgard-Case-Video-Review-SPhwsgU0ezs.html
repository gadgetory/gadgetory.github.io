connects product showcase what we're
looking at today is the Xigmatek Midgard
with window option another well known
for their innovative CPU coolers and
they've now dived into the realm of
computer chassis the Midgard is the
first case from the company and an
incorporate sort of a unique exterior
design as well as a few internal
additions that supposedly
make this case very easy to use now it's
priced in and around $100 so it could be
classified more on the low end of the
mid range cases in terms of price but as
we've seen with some of the previous
product showcases that is definitely not
always an indicator of quality so the
question is with their focus on cooling
and generally good quality with CPU
coolers translate into a really good
computer case well here's hoping so
let's take a look we move first to the
outside out on the top we have the power
and reset switches and activity LEDs
five drive Bay covers with dust filters
and four external connections audio
jacks a two USB and eSATA below that
there is a hundred and twenty millimeter
LED intake fan which also has a dust
filter wrote into the side panel there's
a rather jagged cut plastic side window
and space to install any of the popular
fan sizes from 80 millimeter up to 140
at the back of the case at the top
they've included two holes for water
cooling another 120 mil LED fan along
the side there's two other optional
holes for water coolers well there are
also seven PCI slots and a bottom
mounted power supply flipping it to the
bottom you see rubber feet on the top in
order to reduce vibration and to pick
the case up off the ground there's space
for a hundred and twenty millimeter fan
inside the case and these screws can be
used to remove the bracket if need be
then at the bottom underneath the power
supply area is a removable pass filter
and some tiny feet now the included
accessories are fairly simple with the
usual assortment of screws a motherboard
speaker as well as some cable retention
clips and then they've included a
backplate fan controller with both three
pin and molex adapters
now unfortunately we found that the
metal construction of the case left a
little to be desired as you can see here
with the front panels it's not very
rigid and there isn't much in the way of
support and this is evident throughout
the case removing the side panel take a
look inside you'll notice that the
interior is completely black
now these drive bays use a screw loose
tray system that well probably they
should have used screws alignment and
fitment of the trays is
less-than-stellar in the main area or
PSU is at the bottom with foam on the
back for vibration and an easy clip
system in order to install that 120mm
fan up the side some bright orange PCI
retention clips and then another 120
millimeter fan with brightly colored
orange thins and they've also included a
rather large CPU backplate opening
looking in the back you'll see at the
bottom space and to run wires up the
back of the tray and trays inset about a
half-inch so you're gonna be able to run
larger wires they've also put the
screwless drive locks on the back as
well and this whole section is inset for
more room
now we get to assembly of the case which
is quite the adventure we've managed to
bend the drive bays back into position
so they're no longer fall down however
it seems they're still likely to fall
out now one nice feature of the case is
that it will support the newly released
11 inch long ATI 58 70s which is great
for this mid tower design now in order
to install just open up the quick PCI
clips and make sure they don't fall out
now while making sure the cheap plastic
actually stays in reclip them and well
maybe go back to using screws in the
case does have a hidden gem for water
cooling you are able to mount a 120
millimeter rad or a dual 120 millimeter
rad internally at the top with two
spaces 420 millimeter fans wiring on the
case isn't terrible but the bottom 120
millimeter fan area is basically useless
because that's where your power supply
wires will sit there was there is enough
room to route stuff up the back and it
keeps the middle area relatively
clutter-free for good airflow
now airflow in the mid guard is fairly
simple in from the front and out the
back but if you fill up the three
optional fan spots you'll also be
pulling air from the bottom and then
exhausting it out the top as well so
that's a look at the Xigmatek Midgard
and here's our conclusion on the plus
side it has foam for the back of the
power supply lots of dust filters and
pretty colors as a downside it has
overall relatively poor construction
much of the metal is fairly thin and it
leaves the case feeling like it doesn't
have a lot of support as a result it
really makes one wonder why this case is
priced at $100 when unfortunately it's
real competition is about half that and
