great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm twin tree with
hurricane accent so far 2015 looks like
an excellent year with unique
introductions into the case market we're
finally seeing brands thinking outside
the box thinking of ways to be different
from the competition and most
importantly hitting that right spot for
functional features and ease of assembly
I'm happy to say the new BitFenix Aegis
micro ITX chassis satisfies that
criteria but at a questionable price
point at over $100 competing with the
likes of the define r5 and the aged 440
the various color options are always fun
tow our red Aegis will serve as a
perfect vessel for our upcoming AMD
build make sure to subscribe to see that
but there is something about that glossy
plastic that doesn't sit well with me I
kind of wish the surface was mat but the
red definitely stands out so let us know
what you think of this design direction
the frame is somewhat futuristic with
this large slightly curved front panel
with the reflective film that catches
fingerprints and dust easily and check
out the beat Phenix icon installed at
the front you can also get the core
version of the chassis without the
display and display is 2.8 inches 240 by
320 P it can showcase whatever jpeg to
customize the front face of the case
it's not very bright and viewing angles
are pretty bad but they've opened up the
source code for developers so it may
display useful info about your PC
sometime in the future when developers
get to that and not just an image so
that's pretty cool the ventilation on
each side allows front fans to breathe
and the layer of dense mesh is installed
as an added dust proof element as behind
the panel we find a really weak magnetic
dust filter that doesn't want to stay
attached and there are no clips at the
bottom to prevent it from just sliding
down the case supports triple 120 or
dual 140 member of fans for intake with
360 millimeter radiator support at the
front mounted on strips for extra
flexibility but at this price I was
surprised to not see
included fans here aside from the single
120ml exhaust fan at the rear you can
install fans on the outside of the frame
for push-pull but this way you lose out
on that dust filter but luckily the side
ports are dust proof but because of the
icon display cable it would interfere
with the fan blades so you either have
to disconnect that cable or use the
bottom fan slots if you're after this
type of configuration the top panel is
angled I think it complements the design
nicely with two USB 3 ports audio Jack's
activity led a large power and the
recent buttons and a three speed fan
controller for for fans powered via a
molex connector unfortunately not a PWM
header furthermore there is a removable
mesh I'm liking the full dust proof
approach underneath which we find dual
120 or 140 mm or fan mounts again on
mounting strips for extra
maneuverability radiators up to 280
millimeters will fit here and this case
is turning out to have outstanding water
cooling support I just wish the top
panel wouldn't cover that much of the
fans and instead get rid of all that
plastic frame to allow top airflow to
actually do its job as half of the air
is sent back into the case with that
rear fan its side panel time it's large
and it's clear I wouldn't want it any
other way our fingernail scratch test
came out worse than expected and just to
be clear I do these to replicate the
potential contact the panel might have
with a hard surface obviously you
wouldn't want to scratch the thing on
purpose but be really careful with this
one in particular at the bottom we find
another magnetic dust filter spanning
the entire floor with quality case feet
installed at the back there are five PCI
slots allowing extra breathing room for
dual GPU systems and the 120 mil exhaust
mount with two positions that is
convenient if you require extra
clearance internally for a top radiator
and finally moving inside I'm quite
happy with a feature packed Aegis like
this removable shroud for a stealthy
power supply modularity for all the
drive cages like the bottom cage for two
three and a half inch drives can be
moved closer to the front panel and in
its default position to allow extra
clearance for power supply furthermore
we have removable three and a half inch
cage for two more units that sits on the
single clip and so unfortunately there
is no way to secure it for shipping and
I find that whirring above it is a
dedicated two and a half inch drive cage
for two SSDs both of which utilize two
less clips that attach on each side for
the drive and just slide into the cage
now then the problem becomes with
alignment of SATA ports at the back as
the SSD bracket is way too forward
making this entire drive cage system a
bit more of a hassle for wiring both of
them toll can be removed if extra
clearance is required for either a front
or top radiator now below those two
cages is another spot for an SSD it does
not interfere with any hardware but it
turned out to be challenging for cable
routing as again the position of the
drive is not comfortable for static
connections and it's something that big
phoenix has acknowledged and has
promised to fix and in my build I've
removed the top cages so I can install a
240 Miller radiator at the front and
this is where I question why not just
include standard drive CAD is compatible
with two and a half inch drives to be
placed inside the bottom cage that would
be more comfortable for cable management
and I don't have to utilize those
uncomfortable SSD slots and lastly there
is a stashed away SSD bracket on the
other side of the power supply that is
convenient but I prefer to use this area
to actually stash away all the cables
and here's the finish system I do
appreciate the extra height clearance
even though it makes this micro ATX
chassis kind of in line
size-wise with other ATX cases I install
dual 140 ml fans for exhaust to the top
and that 240 millimeter all-in-one Brad
at the front and I really like all the
grommeted cutouts around the motherboard
like the three above to help with clean
wiring although the eight pin cutout
should have been larger and the same
goes for the side grommet that is tiny
and passing anything other than SATA
cables and smaller cables would be
challenging and I appreciate the extra
opening below the motherboard throughout
your audio and USB cables with this
setup GPUs up to 12 and a half inches
will fit until you hit our radiator and
more space of course can be made
available if you mount the front fans at
the front of the frame I don't mind how
the power supply looks with these cables
but mounting the shroud back on and the
build now looks even cleaner and I can
say the interior is very well optimized
for water cooling
especially since BitFenix includes a
rubberized pump bracket with all types
of mounting holes for compatibility that
can be installed on top of the drive
cage when its offset closer to the front
and the bracket can also be installed on
the floor with various mounting
locations furthermore this unique
reservoir bracket is included that is
mounted onto the 240 million radiator
and you will install a tube reservoir on
there it's a unique spacing bracket
finally cable management with our low
profile cables was a total breeze there
are cable tie hubs in all the right
places and if only you can live with
that large opening in the top left route
the cables around it for a cleaner look
but most of the cables are concentrated
at the bottom because there's plenty of
space there and that's really good to
see so the beach Phoenix Aegis hits all
the right notes for modularity and cable
management and appropriately prep for
water cooling and a micro ATX system the
looks aside this could become the beat
spinning signature micro ATX frame in my
opinion but only if they polish up on
the drive mounting better dust filters
open up that top frame include more fans
and chop that price because hovering
around the $120 mark seems uncompetitive
but let us know how you feel about the
beat Phoenix Aegis and what do you guys
think of this style and the frame design
