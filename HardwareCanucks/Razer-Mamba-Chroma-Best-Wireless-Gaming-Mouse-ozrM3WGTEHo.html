great technology selection and service
wireless mice may not have the best
reputation in the gaming industry
because they simply cannot give us the
same confidence as wired mice for gaming
but that soon might change because they
are improving latency is decreasing and
it almost feels like we are gaming with
a wired mouse and they might be coming
good enough for the semi competitive
arena the Razer Mamba chroma is on the
review table today which Razer claims to
be the best Wireless Gaming Mouse and
after just putting my hand on it and
going through a quick csgo match
I was super pleased with the ergonomics
and build quality the body of the Mamba
chroma follows in the footsteps of
previous Mamba mice and also a hint of
Death Adder in there which many gamers
love with the pleasant rubberized
textured grips on each side the slight
curve on the right side for extremely
comfortable hybrid claw / palm grip but
not really usable for finger grip and
very well placed buttons for natural
reach without affecting the grip the
side browser buttons have soft but
distinct actuations
the scroll wheel is fantastic with great
texture and solid scroll steps with
quality side clicks as well without
activating any scrolling the two dpi
shifting behind the scroll wheel are
perfect for quick sensitivity changes
with fine actuations although I find the
lower button to be slightly too far from
my point finger so I just set the top
dpi button to cycle between one to five
stages of sensitivity and this way I
never have to use the bottom button the
primary left and right clicks are
satisfactory you can change the
resistance on each click with this
included tool which is an awesome way to
customize each click from 45 grams to 95
grams for either really fast actuations
in mobile games or add a little travel
distance that in turn adds a bit of
resistance and makes the actuations a
slower which is fine for sniping or non
intense clicking genres each of the
rotation steps can be felt and
configured accurately for each click
and that's highly appreciated although
the difference between the minimum and
maximum tension on the switch is really
minor and probably will be left
untouched by majority of users now the
Razer Mamba chroma is a hybrid Mouse for
both wireless and wired mode I love the
design of the included charging dock
that is also your receiver that elevates
and angles the mouse for beautiful
showcase plus the ambient under glow of
the bass is just gorgeous and it
actually helps to reveal the bass in
totally dark setting if you're looking
to charge the mouse it is magnetic and
you can set the charging color for the
LED just as a confirmation that the
contacts are properly aligned the
lighting in the mouse is also beautiful
with curved slim strips on each side
that are illuminated in seven zones plus
the scroll wheel is brightly lit up and
both of these sections are independently
controlled the Razer logo in the body is
very discreet and not illuminated which
is totally fine to preserve battery life
at the bottom of the mouse you'll find
an on/off switch that is in charge of
power only for the wireless mode pretty
large Teflon feet with two at the front
and one on the back plus at the front a
micro USB port to use the Razer Mamba
with a cable anything up to this point
everything has been fine and dandy but I
would love to see a tiny USB receiver
that I can plug into my laptop and take
the mouse with me on the go without
having to bring the large bass okay so
now into sensor performance and my
experience in wireless and wired mode
having the mouse plugged in brings my
consonants to 100% knowing exactly where
my aim would go and this new 16,000 dpi
Philips laser sensor is actually really
adequate I don't move the mouse much
when I game and having the DPI at 1050
gave me accurate tracking and no
frustration whatsoever with any jitter
or acceleration surprisingly the gaming
experience in Wireless mode was just as
satisfactory but not without minor
issues here and there
first from what I can tell there is no
noticeable difference in latency or
input versus Wired mode and despite the
cable being very
I found the mouse handling and motion to
be a little bit more pleasing in
wireless mode because the cable was not
part of the body so if you are gaming in
the confined environment having a dog
right in front of you is in Wireless
mode is perfectly fine but move that
dongle two meters away and now you have
all types of sensor issues laggy
performance skip sensor performance and
is just not acceptable so you cannot use
the Naga on the couch with the dongle
two meters away near the computer
disappointing I also experienced a few
really bad input lag scenarios in gaming
menus but after switching the USB port
input lag was never an issue unless the
distance factor between the mouse and
the dock increased now battery life
should not be an issue with overnight
charges full day gaming marathons will
leave plenty of juice for the week
the Dreiser claims to have twenty hours
on top and that's perfectly fine and
overall the combination of excellent
ergonomics and personalized actuation
force on the primary switches with
outstanding sensor makes for one unique
wireless mouse but furthermore the Razer
synapse software offers plenty of
customization of each of the buttons
obviously dpi sensitivity is there up to
five stages in 50 dpi increments and not
sure why acceleration is even an option
but there there is positive polling rate
up to 1,000 Hertz is there the lighting
tab gives you five effects that you can
either sync with the doc or create the
lighting mode for the dog separately and
adjust the brightness for wired and
wireless modes independently plus the
ability to switch off the lighting when
your monitors are off which is
unpredictable in my experience and
powering on my system after sleep the
mouse lights were not working until I
restarted the system and the morning
after one of the sides was just not in
the sync with the rest of the colors
until I accidentally press the right
button and everything just went back to
normal it is a bit buggy and we're not
the only ones with these issues you can
read up online entering the chroma
configurator adds all new lighting
customization on the mouse with seven
separate zones on each side that can be
an awesome way to customize your
peripherals for your team and razer has
done a fantastic job both with smooth
color shifts and consistency of color
however I've discovered a terrible bug
when chroma configuration is on in
Wireless mode you get this terrible
input lag and skipped sensor readings so
I don't know why that happens but maybe
it should just be disabled completely
for wireless mode in the power tab you
can set when the mouse goes to sleep and
if you're not checking the battery
status through the software in the top
right you can set the low battery
blinking indicator on the scroll wheel
and finally in the calibration tab you
can configure the sensor based on the
surface map and set your liftoff
distance and because the Razer synapse
software is the hub for all peripherals
you can record macros which will sync to
all other compatible rays of products
but here's the caveat there is no
built-in memory on the mouse so you must
register for the driver software in
order to gain all the customization
options so in the end am I happy with
the ergonomics and wireless performance
absolutely I think this is the best
wireless mouse that I use so far but
Wireless range is terrible and don't
expect to use the chroma configurator in
Wireless mode because that introduces so
many issues and honestly I want to give
the Razer Mamba in a word simply because
the ergonomics are so excellent and same
thing goes for the sensor performance
but in that case you might as well just
pick up the tournament Edition which is
half the price it offers the same
performance same ergonomics and the only
thing that is missing there is it
doesn't have the wireless mode and also
you cannot adjust the resistance of the
switches but this is it for this review
I hope you enjoyed and let us know your
thoughts on wireless pro gaming would
you ever do it I'm Dimitri with Heric
