another gaming keyboard and I'm sure
most of you would have realized that
with the intro so without any further
ado I'd like to introduce you guys to
the craft keyboard by Logitech this is a
complete package for creative
professionals who are looking to take
their interactive experience with their
respective work to the next level but it
comes at a cost for $200 this is an
expensive investment and you should
seriously think twice before taking the
plunge unless if you're a confident that
this would optimize your workflow and
I'm hoping by the end of this video you
will come to a thorough understanding as
to how the craft keyboard works
specifically you know with certain
programs and it will perhaps make you
know your purchasing decision so let's
dive into this but first a quick message
from our sponsor you can only rely on
the pro to do the job with every
keystroke satisfying like the millions
before it
quality feel with every key regardless
of your space Coolermaster master keys
bro they could with you make it yours
let's get some basic stuff out of the
way since I'm sure most of you are
excited to see how the creative dial
input performs first order of business
the design and I love it personally it's
a welcoming change from a traditional
gaming keyboard and I've always had a
soft spot for minimalist design boards
and the craft delivers exactly that it's
a full-size keyboard that comes with
this matte grey coating otherwise known
as graphite throughout the chassis the
edges are rounded which gives it a
unique appearance when it's on a desk
and for those of you wondering it dis
complements the MX master 2's Mouse
really well as you can see the
uniformity with the color scheme is
top-notch so if you're planning to build
a simple setup here you go
the build quality gets a solid 8 out of
10 and the reason I say that is I've
seen keyboards that are less expensive
featuring metal housings the main body
of the craft is primarily made out of
hard plastic materials but it has some
series have to it resulting in a
structure that's barely flexible so
that's awesome this partly also has to
do with the metal housing on the top
portion of the keyboard that carries all
the electronics inside including the
touch sensor for the dial the keys are
well spaced out throughout the body but
most importantly each individual keys a
feature these rounded concave shape
design that's supposed to complement
your typing experience it took me a few
days to get used to but boy does it
align really well with my finger tips
you won't notice the texture difference
once you get accustomed to these new
keys so if I were you I wouldn't worry
about discomfort in the long run the
craft is a cross-platform compatible
meaning it should work with both Windows
and Mac OS and they have carefully
labeled the start and command keys right
beside the spacebar key although I did
find it a little bit confusing at times
where I would accidentally hit one or
the other but I would have preferred
some neutral signs on both these keys
because seriously it's it's really
confusing I mean it's probably just me
but I don't know let me know what you
guys think about it in the comments down
below logitech users scissor type
mechanism to actuate the keystrokes this
eliminates an unnecessary wobbling
around the corner
of each key therefore resulting in
consistent actuations the slim profile
of the keys along with their shorter
travel times made typing faster from my
usage I can't scientifically test how
faster or slower these switches are when
compared to a full-size mechanical
keyboard or a mechanical switch but
here's my verdict on these low-profile
scissor titles which is they are of
great quality and they don't require too
much force to actuate and they're pretty
fast
the keys are individually backlit and
they are very bright during low-light
conditions there is a proximity sensor
located at the top right hand side of
the keyboard that detects your hands
when it approaches the unit and it
lights up the keyboard automatically
it's a great feature to have especially
when you're working those night hours
but I wished it only worked during those
hours and not during daytime as well
this could have extended the battery
life significantly
speaking of battery life the craft is a
wireless keyboard and a connects to your
computer via the unifying USB receiver
or bluetooth it comes with the easy
shift technology that switches between
three different devices and there are
dedicated buttons for that task it works
really well
and I have it paired with my desktop
laptop and even my smart phone the media
playback buttons along with other
controls like volume adjust brightness
adjust task view and Action Center are
implemented within the function keys and
they are assigned as primary buttons out
of the box but the user can always
switch back to the standard mode through
the software I should also mention that
you can program these function keys
through their software and Logitech has
included a handful of commands that
users can take advantage of this also
applies to those dedicated keys that are
located at the top row section of the
numpad although I would leave them as is
since they are important shortcuts
anyway
except for a few that you can customize
ultimately it's your call and I'm glad
that Logitech has opened their options
to the end user clicking on angle
adjustments there are none on the craft
keyboard although by design the metal
casing at the top angles the keyboard by
just a bit and that's all you get
now does that affect economics not
really at least for me but it's
something to be aware of before making
the purchase all right I think it's
about time to talk about the creative
input dial on the craft keyboard other
known as the count and you know what
this is what makes this keyboard stand
out from the competition and I think
some creative professionals might find
this an attractive feature so what
exactly does it do well it instantly
acts as a specific functions for certain
programs and allows the user to adjust
values it's also touch sensitive meaning
programs that require multiple functions
within a contextual tool can take
advantage of the dial although you have
to be really careful when operating it
as it's a little too sensitive let me
show you a quick demo as to how it works
so what you're looking at right now is a
screen capture of the desktop and I have
an overlay shot of me playing around
with the dial in real time let's kick
things off with the option software so
as you can see how the MX master 2's
Mouse and the Kraft keyboard paired up
let's quickly switch over to the Crown
segment and we can see that we can
customize three functions so there's
turn pressed and press and turn so in my
case I have the turn feature set to
adjust a volume then as you can see it
does exactly that when I press the dial
it plays or pause a certain music track
but in this case I don't have a music
player open so that's okay
when I press and turn this switches
between applications so that is a pretty
cool feature like I said you can also
customize these options with certain you
know controls so in this case we have
the option to do a desktop switch if we
want to or you could just leave it as
none if you really don't want to play
around with default settings now when
you install the options software
Logitech automatically scans the
programs that you have installed in a
computer and it checkmarks that was
those applications and you know requests
you install the profiles for those
applications so like as you see here I
have Photoshop Premiere Pro Chrome edge
and Excel PowerPoint and word installed
I don't have illustrator because I
haven't I don't have that program
installed on it but for now let's just
work with a few applications here let's
kick things off with edge the function
is pretty straightforward all you need
to do is just turn and it will switch
between tabs so that's a cool way if you
have multiple tabs open this is a great
way to just skim over those tabs and
look at you know just browse through
what you're looking at which is great
let's switch over to word here for a
second here what you could do is change
the theme style
of the text so all I have to do is just
scroll the dial and it'll just change
the theme just like that now if you want
to change the theme color or the theme
font there are three more options if you
pay close attention to the bottom
section of the screen there are three
options that are grayed out so if you
need to access them only need to do is
just tap and you can adjust the theme
color just like that now if you want to
change the theme font you can just have
one more time and that would just adjust
the theme font so it works really well
it's a little touch sensitive to be
honest because you know you can
accidentally just click or you know tap
on the theme style instead of adjusting
the font so it really does take a little
while to get used to now another thing I
could do is just select the text and
adjust the font if I want to and it does
a really good job doing that it can also
change the paragraph style or I can also
align the text so let's just leave it
centralized because Boston is awesome
when we order to excel there are a few
options that you could access within the
dial so as you can see I have a
benchmarks a file where I can pair
different pcs and what you're looking at
right now is GP temperatures
everything's laid out really well so if
I twist the dial what I can do is adjust
the sheet navigation so I can scroll
through different sheets that I have
within that file now if I tap one more
time on the dial I can scroll and shift
between horizontal cells so now it
doesn't have a vertical solution but
this is great if you're just you know
scrolling through cells there's also one
more option to zoom if you want to get a
better view of the chart so that's
that's a really cool option and there
are other ways that you can also take
advantage of the doubt so for instance
if I click on the chart I can adjust
between different charts that I'd like
to access so in this case I can go 3d if
I want to do that although I prefer it
as it was in the beginning I can also do
a quick layout shift if I want to just
shift between different layouts there's
also the change if I want to change the
color of a chart I could do that but in
this case I have it set a default so it
won't really you know shift that and I
can also change the chart style if I
want to just go with a different theme
so that's that's pretty cool
you know photoshop is where things get a
little interesting so in this case I
thumbnail opened up very straightforward
analysis for the NAR box review so what
I do is just adjust the dial I'm going
to scroll the dolly because as you can
see it adjusts the brightness of the
photo so it takes a little while to
catch up I mean it all depends on how
fast your computer is because remember
Photoshop is an intensive program and it
requires a speedy computer but it does
get the job done really well so I'm just
gonna leave the brightness to zero
because I like the way how it is I can
also adjust a contrast if I want to so
that's a great way to add a little
blacks I can also adjust a saturation
unfortunately there isn't an option to
change the vibrancy but it is something
that hopefully I'm hoping that Logitech
would add in an update now what other
cool feature that you could do with the
dial is adjust the brush size so if I
want to add a lens flare effect I can
just click on you know the Brett brush
the brush paint tool and start adding
colors so I can adjust the brush size
change the colors quickly and you know
add a blend mode and call it a day you
know these are some of the things that
I've seen myself using a regular basis
so I'm really glad that Logitech has
added these implementations within
creative programs except for Premiere
Pro because there are only two ways to
take advantage of the dial the first
thing is to navigate to the timeline the
other option is to use a jog wheel shape
function that just scroll to the
timeline by frames I don't see using
that as a feature but the timeline
navigation works really well and I'm
glad that you know it works
just as it should so at least you know
we have something let's talk about
battery life on the Kraft keyboard now
Logitech advertises a full week of usage
out of this guy and I was able to hit
that timeline no problem in K in some
cases I even went more than that more
than a week of usage so that was awesome
on the Kraft keyboard now this all
depends on usage so in my case I spend
the majority of my time filming in the
studio so I don't spend you know 99% of
the day on my desk editing videos I move
around so like I said it definitely hits
the mark as what Logitech advertises but
I would have preferred
a longer battery on this guy but most
importantly if you recalled the back
lighting feature that turns on
automatically works during daytime so if
this you know somehow found a way to
disable that maybe through software that
you know that could have significantly
improved the battery life so to conclude
I think it's safe to say that the Kraft
keyboard from Logitech deserves its own
space within the keyboard market from a
design standpoint it's a great addition
to a simple and elegant setup especially
when you paired with the MX master 2's
Mouse and the integrated creative input
dial works amazing with programs like
Photoshop excel and some other
productive tasks personally I wasn't
impressed with the profiles for Premiere
Pro specifically because dial only helps
you navigate through the timeline so I
wish you know there are more options to
adjust the brightness or the contrast
exposure vibrancy and the intensity of
an ND filter some you know some features
within the Lumia tree panel would have
been a great addition and I'm sure they
could add these with a software update
and have recalled a few updates that
were pushed on with an option software
while my testing period so it looks like
Waja tech is listening to the community
and I'm just waiting for that update but
should you spend $200 on this keyboard
I'm gonna let you guys decide on that
because for one I know we do focus on a
lot of mechanical keyboards especially
you know gaming oriented keyboards and
this one's completely you know how the
equation as to what we review but as a
creative professional has a content
creator I do find that you know the dial
is next transition to the craft keyboard
obviously limitation of Premiere Pro as
I mentioned earlier is a bummer but you
know people who use a lot of photoshop
or you know people who are working with
a long numbers within Excel can
definitely take advantage of the dials
so I would say it would be a great
investment if you end up doing a lot
more work within those programs and so
that's it for me I'd like to hear your
thoughts on the craft keyboard from
Logitech is it worth its price and would
you consider picking one up are you you
know excited about the dial and what are
your thoughts on this dial specifically
with its implementation and how it works
with software let us know in the
