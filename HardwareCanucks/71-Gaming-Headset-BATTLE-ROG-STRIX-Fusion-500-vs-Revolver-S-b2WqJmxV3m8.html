hard-working axe and virtual 7.1 gaming
headsets are an interesting topic to
discuss particularly because some gaming
brands do them right whereas others just
add that as a marketing label to their
flagship gaming headsets yet they still
don't offer a surround and immersive
gaming experience I say this because I
have received a pair in the office and
it's this guy right over here the Strix
ROG fusion 500 it's the new kid on the
block from Asus and they've added
features like a virtual 7.1 surround
feature RGB lining that's that's still a
thing here and it also comes in this
interesting design and it costs a
hundred and eighty dollars so I actually
decided to compare this pair to another
pair that I had here in the studio that
cost a hundred and fifty dollars so
thirty dollars cheaper then the fusion
500 and this this guy right over here
the HyperX rover s gaming headset and
I've done a full review on the channel
so if you're interested you can check it
out right over here it's actually one of
my favorite pairs here in the office and
I just wanted to compare and see what
you're really getting for in terms of
value when it comes to a surround sound
gaming headset because let's face it
some I mean a lot of you guys might not
like the whole surreal or the surround
experience or some of you really
appreciate the wider soundstage that you
get when you enable which will sound
point one surround sound so we're gonna
find out which one of these headsets
actually deliver a good experience in
fact are they actually surround so let's
find out right after this the new master
liquid ml aiu liquid coolers from
coolermaster come in both 120 and 240
millimeter variants now with addressable
RGB LEDs both the fans and the pump that
can be controlled via this hub with
options to adjust the lighting effects
and speed along with the ability to
control them through the respective
mother board software check out the ML
120 and ML 240 are a iOS down below
alright so kicking things off for the
design and I think asus has certainly
taken an interesting approach in the
department with the fusion 500 I think
they're trying or I think it's trying
really hard to stand out from the
competition with these plastic mirror
finishes on the ear cups and I have to
mention that they're seriously a
fingerprint magnet plus it can scratch
up ease
long-term use so I'd handle this headset
with caution and of course we cannot
forget to mention the ROG branding
they're pretty much visible throughout
the headset
I mean they've even managed to imprint
that on the ear cuffs so the attention
to detail here is appreciated but it's
not my taste in fact if you're looking
for a strong gaming headset with a
minimalist design approach then this is
certainly not it because it definitely
looks gay Murray I mean I would love to
hear your thoughts on the design of the
Strix 500 in the comments the steel
sliders are great they're well defined
and they do lock in place once you've
adjusted it to your convenience setting
and to quickly go over the RGB lighting
on this headset is located on the rear
side of the ear cup the colors are nice
and subtle the the diffusion is very
consistent and it looks really nice but
I just don't understand implementing
that on the gaming headset because when
you're wearing them you really can't see
them and most importantly you're paying
that extra premium cost for this headset
just with the added implementation of
the feature of RGB lining so that's
something to consider I might see this
feature being beneficial for you know
eSports players perhaps in that arena
but that's just my take Asus has
included a driver software to adjust the
lighting controls or the lighting
effects on this headset but oddly enough
there are only three to four effects
that you can play around with which
includes static breathing color cycling
and the last one being the music or an
effect that reacts to your music another
glitch that I had with this driver
software is I was not able to actually
change the color of the lining on this
headset because customizable
control was completely greyed out so it
didn't just make any sense you only have
the option to set it to a white color
option and that was pretty much it just
just make any sense
so I'd say I mean from a software
perspective it's just completely broken
Asus could fix it with a software update
but as of right now I just solely cannot
rely on customizing lighting again with
this headset because it's just it's
broken now asu's has also implemented
bluetooth on the Strix fusion 500 and
before you start thinking then that's
pretty that's an awesome feature for
audio streaming you are wrong because
that isn't for audio in fact it's a no
it's a functionality that can be used to
adjust the lighting effects through your
smart phone so what do you have to do is
tap on the left ear cup - you have to
hold on it to activate bluetooth paired
up with your smart phone
and then you'll be able to adjust
lighting through the aura app that you
have to download from the Play Store
again a complete pointless feature in my
opinion it just doesn't make any sense
you really don't need it
I feel like Asus is just shoving a bunch
of features at your face that you really
don't need and then they decide to
charge you 180 bucks so yeah it just
again doesn't make any sense
switching over to the revolver s and
this one looks like a typical gaming
headset the ear cups features soft -
rubberized material that don't look too
aggressive or flashy compared to the
glossy mirror finish you go at the
fusion 500 the self adjusting headband
is personally not my favorite as the
metal frame can still cause annoying
reverberations when it gets in contact
with anything this headset does not
feature any RGB lighting and I like that
I'm moving on to comfort and I think the
revolver s seemed to take the edge here
because it's overall a very light frame
and the signature memory foam does a
really good job creating a good seal
plus it's not an irritating material so
I can wear this for longer periods of
time the clamping force is also very
minimal on this headset so from a
comfort perspective I'd actually prefer
the HyperX R / s / the Strix fusion 500
speaking of which
for $180 I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10
in the build quality department because
it's mostly constructed out of hard
plastic materials and put together
really well
there were no signs of creaking but I
will mention that this is definitely not
a lightweight headset since the ear cups
housed the ESS - 9018 DAC and a high
quality amplifier so the drawbacks are
the shells are so much bigger and
heavier so this could potentially cause
head fatigue over long-term use I should
also mention that the clamping force on
the sensor is way too high and you can
tell by looking at the shape the ear
cups can rotate 90 degrees
unlike the revolver S but given the
large gear cup design it almost chokes
you and it feels really uncomfortable
especially when taking shorter breaks so
when you're wearing this headset you're
definitely going to notice this burden
that's sitting on top of you and it
really is an uncomfortably tore gaming
headset in the past so in my opinion I
think that roller s actually gets the
anterior in terms of comfort now asus
has decided to implement touch controls
on the fusion 500 and this is actually
located on the left side of the ear cup
so the user has the option
to swipe back and forth to skip between
tracks tap to play pause the music or
swipe up and down to adjust the volume
now my shoes that I had problems with
the play/pause functionality because
sometimes it just wouldn't work
I had to replug the headset for that
function to work for that feature to
work particularly and the other problem
that I had was the latency so when
you're swiping back and forth or
adjusting the volume it takes a couple
of seconds to at least do that so
there's a little bit of a delay when it
comes to adjusting the volume but most
importantly the adjustments are in four
step intervals so it's definitely not
accurate and I just feel like it's it's
not necessary for gaming I said because
it's just way too much complicated in my
opinion I would have much rather prefer
to volume down on the backside of the
rear side of the headphone or perhaps
you know a control box within the cable
would have been a lot better because you
know it's well within reach while
they're gaming can easily adjust the
volume mute the microphone to whatever
you need to because with the HyperX
rollover s the control box is literally
with the cable so you just have to you
have this one dongle that literally lets
you enable virtual 7.1 surround sound
just the volume adjust in microphones
volume the game and of course you do
have the option to mute the microphone
so everything's in this one little box
that's super subtle and nice and it
actually takes away a lot of weight when
implementing that on the actual frame of
the headset do not that the Strix
headset is USB powered so that means you
will need a USB port for it to function
it does not come with a 3.5 millimeter
connectors so using this pair with your
mobile device is totally out of question
the fusion 300 which is the lower-tier
version of the 500 comes with both a USB
connector and a 3.5 millimeter and lock
board and the differences are you don't
get RGB lining there are no touch
controls and of course there's the lack
of ESS hi-fi deck the cable is braided
but unfortunately it's really hard to
maneuver around with given this nature
expect king formation and over time the
cable could actually wear off - now Asus
claims at the fusion 500 is ps4
compatible but that raised a lot of
questions for me because as far as I
know there are not in fact I don't think
there are any gaming controllers out
there with a full sized type-a port so
in order to experience sound you'd have
to connect this directly to the console
in order to experience that
and that's a complete fail my opinion
because if you're living if you have
your ps4 you're in a living room setup
then you'd have to sit directly in from
the TV and that would be an
unaccompanied experience whereas with
the revolver as gaming had said you can
plug this directly to your game
controller button via the 3.5 mm audio
jack and you can experience a sound
right away
the only compromise is that you won't be
able to experience 7.1 surround sound
because this dongle right here is USB
powered so that's something to consider
now before I get into the microphone
test I do want to talk about the sound
quality on both these headsets so let's
kick things off with the fusion 500 and
it was interesting because I want to
kick things off with the stereo mode
that comes by default out of the box
the trebles are severely crushed meaning
they're overtaken by the lower
frequencies and the Mint's which really
causes an unbalanced stereo imaging but
when you enable the virtual 7.1 option
which can be activated by pressing the
button that's located on the left side
of the aircraft and it actually
eliminates a lot of the issues that I
had with the stereo mode that comes by
default without that button enabled so
right now you have the higher
frequencies that are obviously a lot
more lifted they're a lot more clear and
concise the soundstage is not as wider
it expected to be but they're very
powerful thanks to the inclusion of a
you know ESS - say burdock or and of
course the amplifier and all be
high-tech audio stuff that they've
jammed inside this headset the problem
is that I was actually not able to
experience surround sound with the
button enabled because the soundstage is
a lot more closer to me compared to
being far away so for example in
battlefield one when you're firing
gunshots or hearing explosions in the
background or even walking through the
gameplay you won't be surrounded by
those audio cues but you will get a good
sense of positional awareness because
it's after all a stereo experience at
least that's what I think when compared
to the role or s that expands your
soundstage creates this surround
experience and you know you can hear the
environment a lot more in a new again a
wider space when you're driving or when
you're writing a helicopter or where
you're in a game play when you're firing
gunshots it's a lot more immersive with
that on the HyperX rover s when compared
to the infusion 500 so that's something
that I found to be really odd again
from a sound quality perspective these
sound fantastic because the stereo
imaging once you enable that 7.1 button
is great because it kind of I'm not sure
if you kind of understand what I'm
getting to but it just it kind of
creates this amazing stereo experience
rather than rather than being surround
the last thing to talk about is the
microphone quality of the fusion 500 as
you can see the boom microphone is
nonrenewable so it comes with the
headset and that's there's actually a
little compartment on the left ear cup
where you can just simply swivel to
store this microphone the good thing is
that it actually mutes when you're
swiveling so that's pretty convenient
the odd part is that you don't have
controls to your gain levels when it
comes to microphone which is a little
bit disappointing but coming back to the
quality my voice sounds you know it it
doesn't sound as booming it sounds a
little bit on the shallower side there's
not a lot of definition with my bass
because my voice certainly does have
quite a bit of bass but you really can't
pick that up with this headset it almost
feels like the microphone is just a
little bit distant from you and I think
it probably has to do with the
orientation of the actual mic of this on
this headset but the other thing is that
it actually doesn't have any noise
canceling characteristics so if I'm
typing on a mechanical keyboard you can
certainly or the microphone really does
a pretty terrible job isolating that and
it picks up those sounds so yeah overall
I mean it's definitely there when it
comes to the game levels is certainly
clear I mean the person on the other end
shouldn't have a problem listening to me
but again love to hear your thoughts on
the quality of the fusion 500 and so
right now you're listening to the HyperX
Bravo s gaming headset as you can tell
it's actually a lot more better I mean
there's a little bit of processing going
on the background but I think that has
to do with noise cancelling
characteristics and as you can see when
I'm typing on the mechanical keyboard
featuring Cherry MX blue switches it
does a really good job isolating that
noise and of course my voice do
certainly does have a little bit of a
bass there's a lot more it's just a
little bit boom ear in my opinion I'm
sure this would be perfect for twitch
streaming or even Skype calls in general
I think the person on the other end
shouldn't have a problem at all
listening to you I'd love to hear your
thoughts on the comparison which one do
you prefer let me know the comments down
below
so to conclude this
Pearson I'm just gonna be very honest I
don't think you should spend $180 on the
fusion 500 because it's a confusing
headset because for one the touch
controls they just don't make any sense
they don't function the RGB lining with
the software it just doesn't work the
design is not personally my favorite but
I mean some of you might pouch for that
and there's also the whole part with
comfort because it said it's a very
heavy gaming headset there's a lot of
things packed inside this frame because
you've got the high 5 DAC as well as the
amplifier and it's overall just a bulky
headset with a lot of features but from
a sound perspective again the stereo
imaging is fantastic I don't think
you'll have any issues with that but my
concern is that I was actually not able
to experience surround sound with this
headset and I was a little bit
disappointed with that you know again
headphone reviews are subjective but
that's just my take on the fusion 500
now when you look at something like the
revolver s from HyperX I think this had
to delivers a fantastic experience for
150 bucks I'll be in the amplification
when it comes to the stereo imaging is a
lot lower than what you'll find on the
fusion 500 but if you're looking for a
gaming headset with a really good
surround experience especially when it
comes to feeling the gunshots and if you
want to feel that you're in the
environment you should definitely
consider the rover s because it's a
great pair so that about wraps up this
comparison between the Strix fusion 500
and the HyperX
Robert s gaming headset now if you had a
budget of around $200 to spend on a
virtual 7.1 store on gimme headset would
you actually consider the fusion 500 or
would you save a lot less and pick the a
rollover S or are there any alternatives
that you might be interested in love to
