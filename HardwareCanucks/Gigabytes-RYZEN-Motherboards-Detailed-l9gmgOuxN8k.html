accent aim these Rison is coming down
the pipeline very soon and everyone is
excited about what it could offer as a
competition for entos hire and
processors when it's so close to being
officially released CES 2017 is
providing a perfect platform for
motherboard manufacturers to show us
what they will have to offer when the
horizon becomes available some of this
stuff is pretty exciting since we
haven't seen anything truly new on the
AMD chipset side for a very long time if
you have gigabytes upcoming rise in
ready motherboards were shown behind
closed doors for us during the show and
we got a close look at three of them the
ax 370 gaming 5 the ax 370 gaming k5 and
the a be 350 gaming 3 so let's start
things off with a gaming 5a motherboard
that uses aim DS upcoming 370 series
chipset while actual pricing wasn't
discussed gigabyte and every other
multiple manufacturer we talked to so
far made it evident that they are
initially targeting the mid-range
category where they are m4 boards while
higher-end products may be available in
the future it seems like everyone is
approaching Rison and it's a summit
ridge platform as a value focused
solution as for the gaming 5 it uses
gigabytes new auras branding which will
be added to all of their premium gaming
focused products it uses a six plus two
phase PWM for the CPU and ddr4 and it
has well spaced three primary PCIe x16
slots that can be used for either dual
card SLI or triple cross fire and those
slots are reinforced with metal to
provide some additional support for
heavier GPUs being their more expensive
option the gaming 5 has a lot of
interesting features
there's onboard power and auto OC
buttons a killer 2500 Ethernet chipset
and MDOT to slot with access to 4 pcie
3.0 lanes and gigabytes amp up audio
which has replaced o amp for modifying
sound signature at the hardware level
one very interesting addition is the u2
connector for ultra-fast storage which
until now has been an exclusive to
higher-end int'l motherboards it looks
like AMD is licensing this from Intel
which is definitely a development to be
taken note of there are some hallmarks
here too that you will see on all
gigabytes rise in supporting other
boards
the RGB W header for LED control is a
gigabyte specific development that adds
a dedicated white channel to the typical
RGB for enhanced white level control it
is also backwards compatible with the
3-pin RGB headers to the socket actually
hasn't changed all that much between the
older m3 and the new a m4 it still uses
plastic retention brackets from previous
series which you will certainly want to
remove if installing aftermarket coolers
and the socket itself is an almost
carbon copy of its predecessor visually
gigabytes or as gaming k5 will be based
off the gaming 5 but it will be offered
with a lower price point to things like
reinforced PCIe slots and pop audio SATA
Express ports and overclock buttons and
the RGB W headers are still carried over
however the u2 port and some other minor
items have been eliminated you can also
see gigabyte has given this more of a
stealthy appearance than the gaining 5
with the black shrouds for the i/o area
and the chipset and other than notes the
difference between the two boards are
right now at least very minimal since
both use the same 370 series chipset and
finally this is gigabytes GAA be 350
gaming 3 motherboards which as its name
suggests users aim DS lower and 350
series chipset and doesn't make use of
the premium or as branding this means
less connectivity options and features
but at a much lower price on this board
gigabyte has gone with a basic layout
that still has two primary PCIe x16
slots that are reinforced and make use
of some led accents however don't expect
things like SATA Express onboard
diagnostic readouts or more capable pwm
headers this is truly a value focused
product but one thing you may have
noticed in some of our shots is that all
these boards have some form of backplate
display connector
even though Rison processors will not
have any onboard graphics capabilities
the reason for this is pretty simple the
summit reach platform and the aim for
socket will be compatible with upcoming
ap use built using this an architecture
therefore any aim for motherboard can
also be used for next-generation ap use
and so that's all we have to talk about
for now about these new m4 rising
motherboards everyone around here and at
the show are super excited about
seeing what AMD has to offer in the
coming months and I'm sure that we'll be
seeing a lot more of gigabytes boards
very soon thanks again for watching our
coverage for CES and we'll be back with
more soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
