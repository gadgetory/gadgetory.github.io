think I found one of the best-looking
keyboards I've seen this year this is
the Tesoro gram spectrum with beautiful
RGB lighting that is uniquely
complemented by the white frame of the
keyboard its price $129 which within the
mechanical RGB realm is actually
normally justifiable so before we go any
further if this is worth it a quick
message from our sponsor the new NZXT
s340 elite what makes it so elite we've
got a gorgeous tempered glass panel
extra VR ports improve care management
and an awesome magnetic buck the name is
fitting Elite features at the good price
s340 elite check it out in description
below and so the Graham spectrum
physically is quiet bare-bones we have a
metal frame it's light yet sturdy it's a
full layout only no tql versions
available there's no wrist rest included
no USB or audio pass-through it comes
white and black frames with their own
agile red or blue switches and
low-profile key caps the font here is
clear but with a few funky letters and
numbers but very important all the
secondary symbols are located on the top
portion of the key since the LED on the
switch is also at the top so good stuff
there and since the agile switches are
based on chaos switches that the Sora
variant here just has a lower actuation
point at 1.5 millimeters instead of 2
millimeters and shorter travel distance
of three point five millimeters instead
of four and while it seems like only a
marginal difference I actually really
like the faster switches they feel
lighter compared to the MX blues or MX
Reds and almost feel in line with my
favorite MX speed switch that has a one
point two millimeter actuation point for
the blue tactile switch for gaming in
particular keys register faster so you
can spam the same key more times and
rebound time is good actuation force
feels light and because the shorter
actuation on the switch itself I prefer
them over standard MX blues or reds
also keep in mind the spacebar is very
loud winds coming up and the same thing
for zero and all the larger keys now the
switches use standard MX stems so you
can swap out the key caps if you want
but I actually quite like the lower
footprint of the gramm which makes the
wrist rest not really needed and this in
the ten keyless format would be such an
awesome addition for space efficient
setups the removable mini USB cable
corresponds to the color of the frame
the braiding is a little bit too thick
but it comes out on the right side which
you could potentially route with your
mouse bungee and finally you can angle
the keyboard towards you which I would
recommend doing otherwise the flat angle
feels a little bit although my fingers
plus the bottom of the switches is
visible when the keyboard is flat so it
doesn't look very good other things also
stand out if you look for them like the
black metal clips on the larger keys but
the black variant hides the switches a
bit more but it's a very boring design
so the lighting truly shines with this
ambient diffraction on the white model
and despite what color you said it looks
absolutely stunning which is also
because the switch body is transparent
and helps to spread the light a little
bit more despite the LED being on the
top the only problem is color
corresponding to the presets in the
software which looks way outdated one
their UI designers is either colorblind
or just a troll as red gives us hot pink
and green gives us teal but luckily all
the blue family is perfect now good
thing we have these RGB values so you
can dial in the perfect red the white is
a little bit more blueish but that can
also be slightly fixed and so the colour
potential on the keyboard is there this
is just the Soros incompetence shining
right through which is just a shame
aside from the unimpressive software
though I haven't found any other
drawbacks the function keys have 5
profiles we have also windows lock
volume and MIDI controls plus a GPC
button that cycles between TC mo
which is your default profile and then
you can return to your last used gaming
profile we also have an N key rollover
button and a six key rollover which is
just in case for compatibility and with
the arrow keys you can adjust four
levels of brightness plus cycling
between lighting modes and I really like
this we have all this control on the
keyboard itself so you don't have to go
in with a software ya want to ignore the
software altogether but only fly macro
recordings are also possible but it
records the latency between the strokes
just as it was recorded so entering back
into the software into the macro
settings is more convenient but perhaps
it deserves some more pixels I don't
know this looks absolutely ridiculous
which ultimately is the weakest link in
this keyboard the UI suite needs a
complete overhaul and because of this
potentially even a price drop to stay
competitive but before we conclude a
word from our sponsor oh hey there NCA
XCOM is Canada's leading a tailor for
anything your mind desires just keep
within those categories which are plenty
and get tempted by the weekly deals FYI
Black Friday is coming visit ncx dot-com
for all them sweet deals and so
ultimately the Graham spectrum is a nice
low-profile keyboard with capable
lighting system the kale switches are
reliable and - Sora's own variants
having shorter actuation is a thumbs-up
in my books the wide-body variant is
truly a stunning looking keyboard
thanks to that ambience and that sets it
apart from a very crowded space and
because of this they seriously need to
fix the UI ASAP because as a full
package it just feels unfinished and
thus overpriced and that is it for this
one thanks so much for watching we'll
see you in next video
