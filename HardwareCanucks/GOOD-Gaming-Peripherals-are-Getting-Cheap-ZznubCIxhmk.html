focusing on cases motherboards and
high-priced items but today we visit a
cool master and some of their new
peripherals deserve coverage so that's
what we'll be covering but before that
cook message from our friendly
neighborhood sponsors our coffee leg
strip is brought to you by fan tech
schoolmaster and MSI now you guys might
remember our review of the cooler master
master key Slidell but if you don't know
there will be a link in the description
below anyways what distinguished that
mouse and keyboard cover was that it was
offered at a phenomenal value of just
$60 without sacrificing on build quality
or performance it was a perfect fit for
people who wanted an inexpensive mouse
and keyboard that wouldn't let them down
now coolermaster is following that up
with the master set ms 120 the MS 120
again tries to focus on offering a great
price to performance combination since
its price at $89 but offers a pretty
good looking keyboard and mouse
basically this is meant to be a slightly
higher end version of the super popular
master key Slidell with upgraded
peripherals so let's start taking a look
at the keyboard while the light L combo
featured a keyboard with a zoned RGB
lighting and cooler masters mm chemical
tactile switches the master set upgrades
that to mend chemical switches that has
individual RGB backlighting that means
the customizations for lighting are
nearly endless this keyboard also has a
revised Shafi design which is a bit more
ergonomic than being master keys for
those wondering what man can accommodate
active feedback of an actual cherry MX
blue switch without costing a fortune
it's an interesting concept and in our
testing it almost works as for the
amounts offered here it has a Nevada
3050 optical sensor with four adjustable
dpi levels between 500 to 3,500 Omron 10
millimeter micro switches and there's an
on-the-fly dpi switch basically all of
these things are already offered on the
master key Slidell
but there are some differences this
mouse has three zone RGB lighting setup
and a more ergonomic design that's made
for palm or clock rippers there's also
some added textured surfaces in key
areas from what we've seen the master
set will just be as successful as the
lower-priced master keys like l since
it offers a great price to performance
ratio but what happens if you want to
buy a mouse and keyboard separately
well Kula master has something for that
say hello to the master mouse mm 520 and
mm 530
basically the MM 520 is the same mouse
as found in the master said both with
slightly upgraded specifications it
comes with an Avago pwm 3360 infrared
sensor with an adjustable DPI at up to
12,000 PPI true one-to-one input and
unto flight dpi adjustments 20,000,000
rated arm on switches and outs scroll
wheel encoder and for user set profiles
unfortunately it's only meant for right
hand users who prefer claw grip designs
there's also 7 buttons that can be
programmed for alternating functions on
macros the mm5 20 comes driverless so
you can customize the lighting through
the mouse with a few button
configurations so that's pretty awesome
now the master Mouse mm 530 is a bit of
a step up from the 520 and it's meant to
replace the legendary CM storm Mazar
within cooler masters lineup once again
this is designed for white hand users
and it's featured all of these same
hardware specs as the mm 520 the only
real difference here is with the urban
style which is slightly different
finally there's the master keys mm 750
which is simply a minimalistic slim
mechanical keyboard that offers a few
features but focuses primarily upon
delivering a straightforward gaming
experience I'd say it's distinguishing
addition is the slim RGB halo that
completely surrounds the chassis and
emits a faint glow it's really well done
other than that the 750 will be
available with three different Cherry MX
switches the blue red and brown it also
features a detachable dress with a super
company material that I'm super excited
about so I can't wait to test it out
when I get one in the studio it's a bit
hard to see how coolermaster expects
this keyboard to stand out since it is
being launched into a crowded market
right now there are plenty of other
minimalist gaming keyboards with RGB
lighting and cherry switches and priced
at $160 there's a lot that needs to be
tested before I give my full verdict on
the master key 750 so what do you guys
think about the new peripherals launched
here at Computex from cool and master
let us know in the comments down below
I'm Eva with hurricane axe thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
