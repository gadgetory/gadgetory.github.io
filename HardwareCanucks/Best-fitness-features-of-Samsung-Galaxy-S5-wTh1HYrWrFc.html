great technology selections and service
hey there YouTube universe so i'm matt
with hardware canucks and today we're
going to be taking a look at a brand new
device from Samsung well actually know
what it's not that new right now it's
been out for a little bit and to be
completely honest it's been reviewed by
everybody their mother their cousin and
even you know what some of the little
dogs that they keep on the side so what
we're going to do today is we're going
to take a look at this phone and a
completely different light than what
anybody else has actually done it's a
super amoled 5.1 inch screen corn at a
corner and does have a really good
camera it's a 16 megapixel camera on the
back a 2 megapixel camera on the front
and like our friend Dimitri has said it
produces some pretty cool video with
them excellent crispness and let's take
a look at it right now
now one of the new and innovative
settings that you can get is basically
the ability to unlock your phone using
your finger print this is really much
well it's almost the exact same thing is
what you can expect from getting the
iphone 5s one thing that I dislike about
it is that it doesn't work all the time
you have to swipe your finger in one
specific way every single time to unlock
the phone and it's a great idea in
theory but putting it in practice it's
something that they need to work on so
some of the biggest features about this
phone is the look of it the design the
touch in the field so what Samsung
wanted us to experience when they
designed this device is the metal
feeling outside of the phone as well as
the leather backing that actually does
have some positive feedback a lot of
people that have seen this phone and
have you reviewed this phone before us
I've taken a look at the backing and
said that it does have some tactile it
does feel a little bit like leather
there are other people that said that it
doesn't feel like leather and it's kind
of cheap but I personally like it and it
looks pretty good if you get in and
white maybe not so much in the band-aid
edition now if you're used to touch with
you're not really going to have that
much of a different experience is what
you've experienced on let's say the
galaxy s3 or the s4 the s5 really hasn't
changed all that much and regards to UI
design but what has changed in the past
little while is really the settings menu
so if you navigate to settings they've
added a whole lot of different options
you have a lot of flexibility and what
you want to choose through the icons but
one of the key features that not many
people are focused on and it's one of
the big differentiators that Samsung
really hasn't been hitting on since it
launched a little while to go on the s4
that feature is samsung s health so with
this incredibly powerful device and when
I'm currently wearing on my wrist which
is the galaxy 2 neo the gear and Samsung
s5 worked together to really make s
health one of the most important
applications at San
son has ever released so in order to go
into a little bit more in depth into
exactly what s health is does and what
it means to you is the consumer I got to
go inside and get changed so let's go
now let's test
so some of the most important features
of the s5 is built into the application
that they called s help what this
application does is that it tracks how
many steps you've taken the quality of
sleep the calories you've burned and
also provides you applications that help
track your sleep a little bit better and
plan your workouts but the biggest
feature is that if you can join it with
the gear 2 neo this entire ecosystem
becomes the actual and physical
motivation that you need to improve your
life and your overall fitness so the
watch itself has the ability that it can
track exactly how many steps you're
taking how far you're running as well as
your heart rate at any given moment
using built-in accelerometers and
sensors one of the things that I have
noticed about the heart rate monitor
however is I don't replace this again if
you push it the watch itself at least up
to the middle of your arm or if you're
talking or moving at all whatsoever or
even if you've built up a decent amount
of sweat on your arm the watch is going
to have a really hard time picking up
exactly what your heart rate is the
reasoning for that at least for the
sweat part is that the liquid molecules
actually interfere with the sensor
reading the heart rate in the pulse of
your blood so right now it's saying that
I have a heart rate of zero if that was
the case I'd be dead but that is one of
the downfalls to this watch it's not
quite there yet but the application of
it is quite good for what you get now it
also has a sleep monitoring feature the
accelerometer is the key part to this
entire equation as it enables the watch
to track exactly how you sleep so
whenever you move or you're active
during sleep it'll recognize the fact
that you're up and moving in a wake and
it will count that as not restless or
restless sleep so you're moving around a
lot but if you stay stable that counts
as REM sleep and the watch will realize
that this is quality sleep so in other
words it'll have the ability to track
whether you move or not and sleep and
ultimately that will tell you
exactly how your fitness profile is and
your sleep profile so you can change
habits so not eating is late at night or
maybe drinking more water who knows
there could be different options and
lifestyle changes that you could make to
help make your sleep better it's not
only a fitness specific device when I
talk about the gear 2 neo it's actually
a really integrated device as well
because it connects directly to your
phone via bluetooth allowing you to
control multiple different features you
can control the music when you play you
can skip back and forth between tracks
you can change the volume it's actually
got a built-in mp3 player as well too so
you can store some of that it also lets
you send and receive text messages and
phone calls so I'm actually gonna answer
this hello hey how's you want i met you
in the middle of shooting a video ok yet
no problem talk to you later one of the
features of tyson that everybody's been
raving about is s voice which a lot of
people have experienced with the bull
samsung galaxy s4 and beyond so you can
dictate commands specific to the phone
now with s voice it allows you to do
quite a few different features I can
dictate text messages I can dictate will
ask bass voice what the weather is going
to be like so let's actually test it out
what's the weather like in Toronto right
now
sometimes how other s voice doesn't
always get your command correct so there
is a really easy way to sync up your
data without actually having it
automatically sync for you every three
hours of the intervals that you set this
is an integral part of the s health
application as it allows you to sync up
your data in real time the easiest way
to do it is well let's take a look at
the watch first I've done it seven tour
6700 steps and so far the s health
application says that I've done 6680 for
now as you see down here at the bottom
quick and easy sync it connects to the
gear 2 neo and syncs up my steps so so
far I've traveled 5.33 kilometers but
you kind of saw when I was running
walking quite a bother a few things and
I've burnt almost 300 calories so there
also is a dashboard that you can access
if you go to the menu main screen and it
will give you all the necessary
information that you need as well as the
applications that you have access to so
steps calories and calories eaten you
can actually track how many calories
you've intake but that's through a diary
modes you have to enter everything into
the system track your sleep workout you
have all the different exercises heart
rate monitors and the ability you can
add more apps so depending on what's
available through the samsung apps store
not the android app store but the
samsung apps or you can download new and
more amazing apps for the phone if you
go to your own personalized screen you
can take a look at what metals you've
achieved and these metals are based on
achieving your own set goals whether
it's fifty percent of goal or full 100%
of goal and it will give you today's
achievements your last measurements and
weight as well as your heart rate at
some in conclusion the s5 and the gear 2
neo together make a pretty potent
package when it comes to using the
application s health basically the
positives of the application then really
the two devices put together are the
fact that it gives you trackable and
accessible information based on your
health it's an affordable option in
comparison to other fitness trackers
that are basically just pedometers and
it gives you up to date information
including heart rate and steps that
you've taken it also gives you distance
and a few other things but that's not
really that
a positive as it is you know just
something you would expect but if we
take a look at the negatives the heart
rate monitor isn't exactly what we'd
expect it to be it doesn't give accurate
readings if you have a little bit of a
sweat also if it's a little bit too
tight to the skin the heart rate monitor
doesn't deliver the type of results that
you would expect from well a heart rate
monitor as well sometimes the step
counter can be a little bit slow with
tracking your steps but it ends up
catching up to itself voice input legs
but that's to be expected considering
the fact that's using Tizen and we're
not really going to put a high-end phone
into the watch quite yet Samsung has
plans to do otherwise but all in all
it's a really good device and when you
pair it with the s5 and use the s health
application which is really what this
video is all about you're getting a
pretty great series of applications and
a really great group of devices that can
help you live a better healthier life
and really that's exactly what Samsung
had in mind I do recommend it
specifically for those who want to have
that health benefit now but if you're
looking for something that's a little
bit more stylish or something that has a
little more sensors I'd recommend
waiting until the next iteration or the
newest devices come out from Samsung or
what's going to be coming from Motorola
with the 360 or LG in the G watch
alright guys so I'm Matt for hardware
canucks and this has been our quick take
on s health the gear 2 neo and the s5
which is now in my pocket and if you
