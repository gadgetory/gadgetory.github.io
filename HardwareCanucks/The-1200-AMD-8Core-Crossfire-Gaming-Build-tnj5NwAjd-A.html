arcs and I built my last aim D system
five years ago and that's about to
change today with the help of AMD we set
the goal to spend $1200 and build an
amazing looking and outstanding
performing machine the theme here is red
but just enough to keep things subtle
with the possibility of subtle color
changes in the future and we're calling
the system the octo red because we fit a
reasonably powerful eight core processor
into the build while remaining on budget
and I'm actually pretty excited to test
out the performance for all types of
gaming scenarios and also put it through
the paces for you know a standard
editing machine that we have done with
other builds like I said earlier all
parts come together to around $1,200
which can change with sales and
discounts whatnot and we are using our
existing Windows license our existing
peripherals and the monitor that are not
taking into the equation with the price
so finally let's see the full blown-up
view of all the hardware before you
begin the construction of the octo Red
Machine the main highlight of this build
is an 8 core AMD FX 8350 Hertz and turbo
up to 4.3 gigahertz and a TDP of 125
watts it is a slightly older chip
released in late 2014 but it still
should do just fine in today's games and
it has the potential to grant added
benefits in future dx12 applications it
is being housed inside an MSI 990 FXI
gaming motherboard that has a couple of
USB 3.1 ports awesome killer Network
features and this red black color scheme
that will complement our theme very well
to cool the CPU we've chosen the NZXT
x31 all-in-one cooler which has a nice
compact 120mm radiator that will be a
perfect combination for the CPU and we
expect to be under 60 degrees Celsius at
full load inside our case we also have
an 8 gigabyte g-scale memory kit running
at ddr3 1600 megahertz and dual channel
mode while it may not seem all that fast
given today's super fast memory it still
has pretty tight timings and can easily
overclocked if you need
extra performance for graphics we've got
dual Asus 380 X that will be set up in
crossfire this will be my first time
gaming on dual Radeon GPUs and I'm
expecting nothing short of amazing
performance from these cards I'm
especially looking forward to the silent
gaming features where the fans don't
spin until necessary however I'm a
little worried about the fit as the
coolers are quite bulky especially with
the added back plates so we'll see how
that turns out our SSD of choice is a
Samsung 850 pro 512 gigabytes which puts
a priority on getting fast load up times
for games while also adding enough
storage space for more than a few of
today's games it is more money than the
standard hard drive but investing into
fast storage will make the full
experience extra snappy to power the
whole system is our trusty corsair ax
760i that may seem to be a bit low
wattage for this AMD crossfire eight
core system but actually it should do
just fine and remember that these two
graphics cards are quite power efficient
so there should even be some room for
overclocking the processor and we'll
cover overclocking soon in another video
so make sure to stay tuned this is all
going inside the NZXT and 450 with
complementing red and Mac black accents
plus great front intake to deliver
enough fresh air for these two GPUs and
to make sure everything fits in well
with the color scheme we have a black
and red sleeve cables extensions from
cable Mon and the lovely hue plus
lighting system from NZXT to add that
secondary color to the interior of our
case to make the whole build quite
unique and with every build I begin by
using the motherboard box as the
platform with the anti-static bag
underneath just in case
release the socket lever and align the
yellow triangle on the CPU with the
triangle on the socket carefully
lowering it in place and make sure that
opens are aligned without any pressure
remember to keep the user manual close
at hand mainly so you can look up with
dim slots to occupy for dual channel
operations
meanwhile the i/o shield will eventually
need to be installed so it's nice to
have it close by installing the RAM is
simple release the notches and lower
Ram applying even pressure throughout
until the secure peg snaps back into
position
since we are installing a cooler that
requires different mounting hardware
the default mounting clips on the
motherboard must be removed first and
instead these aim these specific
standoffs are installed so we can lower
in the x31 cooler the thermal paste is
already pre applied on the base plate
and all we have to do is tighten the
thumbscrews and this X pattern to make
sure that pressure is evenly applied now
unlike the Intel socket which is
enclosed behind the top metal cover the
AMD CPU is exposed on the sides so make
sure the lever is properly engaged
before moving any further next let's
install the i/o plate pop that in and
begin the assembly inside the case I
remove all the metal drive caddies at
the front since we won't be using them
and just to clear up that front intake
lowering in the motherboard be careful
and aim for the middle standoffs that
catches the motherboard so it's secure
and you can mount the rest of the
necessary screws for our configuration I
repositioned the 140 millimeter rear
exhaust fan to the top so I can mount
our radiator to the back with the fan
set to pull the air through because I
wanted to maintain a level of stealth on
the inside since the fan blades are
white on the NZXT x31 cooler and would
totally ruin the look we're going form
and I always do stock cable management
first just to make sure everything is
prepped for when the power supply is
mounted which makes finishing the rest
of the cables much easier we are using
sleeved extensions on a fully modular
power supply to minimize cable clutter
and because of the non removable power
supply shroud inside the end 450 all the
cables must be pre-installed before
inserting the power supply inside the
case then I quickly map out where each
of the cables has to go and insert the
awesome 24 pin cable so it curves nicely
from the back and then utilize the two
SSD brackets to install our hew Plus hub
and our only SSD on top of the power
supply shroud for a clean and beautiful
showcase the final part for me was to
install the GPUs and this is where we
ran into bit of clearance issues because
the cards are slightly thicker than the
2p
see I slots mounting them right next to
each other was not an option so I had to
remove the hue plus hub from its slot to
have enough clearance for the GPU in the
lower pci slot in order to fit both GPUs
it's a little hiccup in an otherwise
seamless assembly but not to worry the
hue plus MD SSD found a tidy spot on the
drive caddies
Oh
and so here is the finished system with
cleaned up cables and properly installed
the lighting strip on the top to
highlight all the hardware in this very
unique blue and white color combination
I'm very happy with the acoustics of the
system as well at idle and even though
the CPU is clocked at 4 gigahertz it
hovers around 25 degrees Celsius at idle
while never going over 60 while gaming
the crossfire configuration follows with
mid-50s in temperatures on idle but with
that totally silent operation so that's
a positive and never breaking a sweat
even at load maxing out at 71 degrees
Celsius for the hottest card so how does
it handle gaming with 1080p and
everything maxed out pretty good
actually averaging at 87 fps with solid
minimums too at 75 fps in Star Wars
Battlefront at the ultra preset
jumping into battle till four again with
everything maxed out I averaged at 93
FPS with a very rare dip into the
minimums of 50 FPS but you may be
thinking can it run Crysis yes with
everything set to very high you're
looking at pretty solid playable 56 FPS
on average with extra satisfying
smoothness with a few settings don't
down and for conclusion I am very happy
with how the build turned out in the end
there's the small hiccup with a dual
graphics cards clearance which made it
shift a few things around but from a
physical standpoint the temperatures and
the cue sticks plus a rock-solid gaming
performance makes our octet system
absolutely kick-ass so make sure to
subscribe for a follow up video that
we'll be doing going over the extra
performance that we'll be trying to
squeeze from the CPU and also give you a
bit more detail in our crossfire
experience altogether
im3 true with our Canucks thank you so
much for watching make sure to subscribe
