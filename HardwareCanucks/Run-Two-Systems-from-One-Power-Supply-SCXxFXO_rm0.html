fantex and NCIX without them we wouldn't
be here running dual systems inside one
chassis can be a challenging task
especially if you're powering them
separately this not only adds cost for
the power supply units but also finding
room to incorporate two PS use is not a
very common layout features in most
cases today so fantex has come up with
an excellent solution by introducing a
unique patented power splitter unit that
essentially takes a single PSU and
splits the power to two individual
systems the unit itself is designed in a
small form factor that houses a
proprietary mounting system for fantex
cases but they also include double-sided
3m tape for mounting on other cases
which is very thoughtful output wise
there are 224 pin connectors to a pin
and four four pin connectors and overall
it's very versatile fantex has also
introduced a new power combo unit that
combines the wattage of two power
supplies to host in one system this
brings multiple benefits such as higher
power efficiency as one of the units
will be in priority load while the other
will add extra power if necessary you're
also looking at reducing the cost of
delivering higher wattage over multiple
power supply units versus one single
higher wattage unit while also offering
power redundancy features to safeguard
your Hardware in case one of your power
supply fails plus you have that coolness
factor of either splitting the power of
one unit for two systems or go the other
way around by combining the power of two
units for one system this would be quite
handy if you're upgrading hardware that
requires more power for example if your
existing system has 500 watt power
supply but you would require 750 watts
or higher because of additional
overclocking or Hardware additions the
power combo would allow you to buy an
additional 300 watts or higher power
supply to meet your system power needs
without needing to buy any more
expensive power supply to substitute the
original basically reusing your existing
PSU in a system upgrade is now an option
with
power combo you can also combine the
power splitter with the power combo to
first combine the wattage of two power
supplies that will then split over two
systems it is a very interesting concept
one that we hope sees more community
potential</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
