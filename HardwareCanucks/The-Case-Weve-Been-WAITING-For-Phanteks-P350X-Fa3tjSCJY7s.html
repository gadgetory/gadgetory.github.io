affordable enclosure I'm sure you do too
we've gotten so many good ones in the
last like year and a half but my issue
however are all these affordable
enclosures have kind of merged into one
there's no particular like competing
element on one versus the other they all
have pretty much the same hardware spec
size cooling potential so how do you
differentiate yourselves within a really
crowded space and it's exactly what fan
--tx is trying to achieve with this new
enclosure shall we check it out so this
my friends is the new P 350 x from fan
tax this could be the best budget hour
ever created let's check it out I
appreciate the little detail of putting
a tempered glass sticker on the plastic
that you peel and not on the glass
itself and so I position the P 350 X in
the middle between the P 300 also a fan
fics enclosure it's $59 incredible value
and then the fractal design mesh fic
which is a fantastic package all around
but it costs $89 $20 more than the new P
350 X which costs 69 bucks now fantex is
known to cut appropriate corners in
order to meet really competitive price
points so like the P 300 for example
they have temper glass that does not
span the entire side instead the power
supply shroud is part of the frame which
is how they're able to achieve this
really solid structure at $59 that still
looks awesome and so the P 350 X is
slightly bigger but that follows on the
same footsteps of having the same
approach to the tempered glass side
panel and the power supply shroud being
actually part of the structural frame so
at $69 how good is the P 350 X in
comparison to the P 300 and the mesh fic
which I would recommend to anybody
looking to build a tower right now but
what if you want to save twenty bucks
all right enough with the preface let's
review the P 350 X right after this it's
always a pleasure upgrading or adding
new hardware to your system especially
when it comes to storage like this new
OC ZTR 200 drive from Toshiba it's a
great value SSD offers a nice boost in
performance for boot times file
transfers and just general system and
work operation with cutting-edge 3d
flash memory and ultra reliable
controller with built-in power
management consider the upgrade today
with TR 200 it's available in different
capacities check it out below alright so
the P 350 X is out because fantex needed
a tempered glass case for this price
category despite it almost competing
with the P 400 and being quite similar
to the P 300 so the naming scheme of 350
X is actually pretty clear I do like
that they've address the front panel
airflow concerns now the ventilation
spans both sides of the panel and settle
up the top and bottom like on the P 300
where the fine dust filter built in and
enough clearance from the front fan
mount to avoid choking of fans now in my
testing with the panel on/off the CPU
temperature Delta was only three degrees
Celsius so they've done a pretty good
job here for airflow I still prefer the
full mesh approach with cases and
hopefully we'll see something similar
from fantex at some point now the panel
is plastic so they can incorporate the
LED strips but it looks like sandblasted
aluminum with this kind of open section
at the top so it can be used to carry
the enclosure and interestingly to avoid
additional wiring for the LEDs when you
remove the front panel there's a three
contact RGB connector that aligns with
the case so just make sure to properly
orientate the panel as it does look
symmetrical and so this RGB stuff on the
$69 case is actually well done we have
two thin strips at the front and one
below the tempered glass
they are ambient not too in-your-face
and are addressable RGB so that means we
get this beautiful gradient and also
pure whites with a few built-in effects
I love this integration because you can
add more fantex illumination accessories
like deluxe fan frames or the LED strips
and there's also a 3 pin addressable
motherboard connector for the full
control otherwise the mode and color
buttons are right beside the USB 3 and
audio jacks up top so here you only get
a power button without a reset switch
behind the panel we have dual 120-140
mounts with up to 280 Younger the
radiator supported and we only have a
single 120 fan include
as the rear 120 slot is empty and below
is our drive cage with two Drive caddies
that are removable only from the front
now it's not the most convenient place
for routing the drives and actually
limits your power supply clearance so
the only advantage to this layout is the
frame is overall thinner and helps with
general cable management as this front
section is expanded and lets you route
cables from the bottom so they don't
cross the area behind the motherboard
tray because as you can see there's very
little room from the SSD till the side
panel so the orientation of that bottom
drive cage is appropriate here the
tempered-glass mouth is basic but thumb
screws and the panel sits on four pegs
and the bottom lip for the power supply
shroud and I'm totally okay with it not
spanning the full bottom side it gives
the case a little bit of character and
it's also one of the few cases to come
with dual color PCI brackets for you
know the white interior and also good to
mention the backside panel has capped a
thumb screws all ATX standoffs are
pre-installed and the only visible
branding is this discreet text on the
side nice and so the only reason why
you'd want to be 350 x over let's say
the P 300 is the slightly longer frame
as otherwise the dimensions and Kulik
potential is basically identical so the
longer frame means the top section can
now support dual 120 you want 40 fans
that are offset as much as possible to
keep the symmetrical dust filter but the
case is not very tall so the top is not
exactly radiator friendly which means if
you are installing a radiator it is
really meant to go at the front now it's
actually the same height as the Massif
IC or the Corsair 275 R with about the
same length dimensions but here we get
proper support for e ATX motherboards
and because we have the bottom drive
gage the usual cutout at the front for
360 rad is not here I think that's okay
for $69 case because we have plenty of
room for 240 or a 280 rod which is most
likely what you'll be doing anyway with
this enclosure otherwise if you are air
cooling only the P 300 may be a more
suitable option for GPU clearance we
have thirteen in the half inches until
the fans with the radiator in my
configuration and good clearance for top
exhaust fans only but there are a few
annoyances like the
cutouts beside the motherboard are quite
narrow so a thicker cables get stuck for
me while the middle cut out above the
motherboard is not high enough and is
almost fully covered by the motherboard
so I could not even fit a four pin
connector through it and lastly while I
appreciate the two velcro straps there
are no other cable tie points anywhere
to help with cable management now it's
not really an issue because you can see
the cables are flat by default in this
configuration plus there's additional
space near the power supply is just that
accessing the cables for the interior
drives will be difficult but in the end
the P 350 X is a super appealing mid
Tower based on looks and ease of use as
long as you don't have to swap out those
hard drives with a non compromised front
panel design that only gave me a three
degree hotter temperature where the
panel installed now fan Tech's have
always done case lighting right and the
inclusion of a digital RGB on this one
means it's future proof and I feel the
price is on point to challenge the s340
forum NZXT that you can see is in the
top most popular cases at 69 bucks and
so we're gonna have to give the P 350 X
it deserved damn good value award now
the thing is it's not perfect but I feel
like the P 350 X maybe on the most
complete $69 cases we've seen in a while
and it's funny because they're almost
competing with each other like the P 400
when that launched was 6 9 bucks but the
tempered glass Edition was $10 more so
if he wants like the selective roomy
enclosure then you go up to the P 400
Soph antics have done the really good
product separation so that they're not
completely clashing with each other and
kind of suit that price category pretty
well so let me know what you think of
the P 350 X in the comments below I'm a
