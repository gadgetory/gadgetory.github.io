Knox and welcome back to another view
now we all know the main limitations
with the reference 290x was it's cooler
is aimed these power to manage to get
the best out of the core as it capped at
94 degrees Celsius and everyone who was
excited about aim DS come back and
including myself we're seriously looking
forward to the days when custom pork
partners would jump on the Hawaii plane
with hopes for a better cooler high
quality components and consequently
higher and consistent frequencies and
that's exactly what we have here this is
the r9 290x directs you to all claw
condition from Asus giving the unstable
nature of availability and pricing of
these cards at the moment exactly how
much these cards are to be retailing for
is unknown but given the 550 dollar
price tag for the reference 290x expect
to pay the premium for the Asus the
direct cu2 cooler is very popular even
in the early days of its triple slot
designs despite its now somewhat saggy
form luckily with the new heatsink
design dual slot form factor is the
standard and the high-density fins allow
for extreme cooling despite a smaller
thin array this is also the first time
we've seen a customizable card in terms
of color as Asus includes both red and
gold metallic stickers to be applied
onto the shroud to go along with their
current motherboard color schemes
the card is 11.25 inches long and also a
full inch taller than the reference card
again because of this amazing cooler the
aluminum heatsink
underneath the shroud is only part of
the equation of this very impressive
cooler design there are total of five
full copper heat pipes that are all
making contact with the Hawaii core one
of which is 10 millimeters that allows
40% better heat transfer compared to the
other eight millimeter heat pipes
another part of this cooling equation
are the fans and notice they are
different the rear fan is typical with
vertical airflow directionality
penetrating the heatsink and moving the
hot air towards the front fan where the
wide angle blade design actually
channels the airflow through the
backplate and thus dissipating the heat
a Seuss also made sure to include an
additional rear aluminum heatsink that
not only makes the car look awesome when
installed but it will improve PCB heat
dissipation the card is powered through
six plus eight power design has the
usual silent and uber mode switch and an
ROG connect port to be used with
supporting ASUS motherboards for voltage
control and monitoring connectivity wise
we get dual DVI HDMI and DisplayPort
just like on the reference card now here
is my monster triple slot 570 that over
the years has made its Aggie appearance
on our case reviews and to prolong the
longevity of the 290x as the heatsink
and the card is actually pretty heavy
Asus has cleverly installed a metal
support bracket that will prevent the
sagginess from happening and aside from
very impressive cooler design this card
incorporates better components of what
Asus calls super alloy power this means
better quality capacitators MOSFETs and
chokes that all equate for better
performance improved temperatures and
most importantly prolonging the lifespan
of the card and with all that said the
clock speeds have been bumped up to 10
50 megahertz only a 50 megahertz delta
from the reference while memory has been
bumped to 5400 megahertz
the main issue with the reference card
aside from the noise and temperatures
was inconsistent frequencies as the card
struggled to maintain that one gigahertz
mark over a long session in both the
silent and uber modes and this has been
solved with the Asus card as you can see
the frequencies are almost static
resulting in not only higher but
consistent frame rate and so with that
said let's take a look at the benchmarks
one thing to notice is the consistently
higher FPS result compared to the
reference design and also the silent
mode on the Asus card always beats to
Ober mode on the reference and then a
few titles the Asus 290x is neck to neck
with the monster 780ti that is
significantly more expensive
and with the benchmarks out of the way
let's see how the directs you to cooler
performed against the stock 290x cooler
as you can see the reference card
quickly capped at 94 degrees Celsius
threshold while the AC is 290 X in both
modes operated at much lower
temperatures and looking at the bigger
picture here the maximum 78 degrees
Celsius in performance mode is
absolutely impressive considering the
Hawaii core is fully utilized to its
full 10 50 megahertz potential and hats
off to a SUSE for cooling the hottest
core since the Fermi now what's more
impressive is the acoustic performance
of the fans in either mode sitting in
the middle of the pile the Asus 290 X is
a silent card with the two fans working
amazingly well to deliver both cool and
quiet operation this of course is still
a power-hungry card based on the
slightly higher and consistent
frequencies a higher wattage consumption
is expected of course given the
performance output and with such an
amazing cooler throw it seems there's a
bit more frames to be squeezed out as
temperatures are no longer an issue
really and we were able to get an
additional 14% overclock to 1.2
gigahertz on the core and over 6,000
megahertz on the memory this is at 60%
fan speed which means there's still more
left in the tank when it comes to
overclocking and AMD has allowed its
board partners the flexibility for
voltage boosts revealing the an tapped
or soon to be tapped true power
potential of these custom 290x cards and
as we finish up with the overview there
are so many great things about the card
starting with the amazingly effective
cooler to dissipate heat away from the
how I core in order for the power tune
to maintain those frequencies stable
without fluctuations this in turn causes
very impressive frame results while
staying both cool relative to the
reference design and extremely quiet
thanks to the clever fan design we're
just hoping the 570 price tag can
actually be reality for the consumers as
worldwide markup of AMD cards have
inflated the price of the r9 series due
to rising popularity of the
cryptocurrency mining now it seems like
all the shortfalls of the reference card
have been addressed with this Asus
direct
see you to 290x and I'm very pleased
with the results especially since it's
considerably cheaper than a 780ti yet
proving to be just as powerful and
deserves the damn good and damn good
value award as asus has tapped into the
potential of the hawaii core that makes
a m-- d cards that much more attractive
and while this concludes our view of the
asus r9 290x direct see to overclock
