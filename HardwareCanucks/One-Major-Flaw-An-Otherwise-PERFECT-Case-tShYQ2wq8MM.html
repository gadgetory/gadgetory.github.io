corset 275 are you know I feel like this
frame symbolizes the current state of
the case market and that it's affordable
only an $80 chassis with a glass or a
$10 less for the acrylic side panel so I
think that's a pretty good price point
for not just budget consumers but you
know this is actually a nice premium
chassis - I feel like it covers many
aspects of like what we need to see on
an interior of this size you know 240
right in the front the top you know the
front is not choked everything is dust
proof it actually looks nice it comes in
two color versions so white and black so
what exactly is my issue here well let
me tell you right after this the new
Animax lik fusion is their first
addressable RGB all-in-one cooler with a
standard 240 ml rad an absolutely
beautiful RGB ring elimination on the
fans and the pump to highlight that
unique flow indicator through the
transparent top check out the lik fusion
down below oh all right so before I tell
you why I'm upset with the Corsair car
by 275 are let me first tell you why
it's one of the best in its class and I
know that sounds a bit weird but you'll
understand why later so physically it's
nothing too exciting I think we've
almost settled to like very
simple-looking jassi's for this price
point but the front panel has this like
brushed texture to it and a nice
discreet Corsair logo the front so it's
not like a loud coarser case and I
appreciate that I also appreciate that
there is no color variation on the
exterior so the white on the plastic in
the metal and even the dust filter all
look uniform to me so there is no
discrepancy between the materials and
how they look with that paint job the
glass panel is flush against the frame
so doesn't stick out which is awesome
but there is a bit of a like that stark
contrast between my white edition and
the black perimeter on the T G panel and
you also notice these screws they're not
thumb screws and they're quite flat so
it they contribute to the better
aesthetics of the case
but they're not exactly easy to work
with
the thumbscrews on the rear side panel
are captive so that's appreciated
there's a large dust filter spending the
entire top of the chassis it is magnetic
and easily removable and the front also
has a nice large dust filter spending
the entire intake section now as you can
see the front panel is completely closed
from the front so the only intake are
from the sides luckily they're quite
open but still don't expect amazing
airflow because there is a little bit of
restriction going on and the i/o is
quite simple with only two USB threes
chrome audio jacks power and reset
button in terms of airflow I really like
what Corsair is doing here so the front
can support a 360 radiator or 280 rad
with their respective fans and up top we
can have a 240 radiator or you can see
there's also holes for a single 140 mm
or a fan not exactly sure why that is
offset to the front but it's there
regardless and moving on to the inside
there's a lot to like here so first two
fans are included that's nice for stock
configuration for air cooling there is a
nice two and a half inch cutout at the
front for your radiator and fan combo
there's a nice cutout above the power
supply ventilation to pass your i/o
cables like an audio cable the rubber
grommets are well spaced out internally
the motherboard standards are
pre-installed not just for your middle
one but for all ATX standoffs which is
awesome so you can begin assembly right
away and I really appreciate how the
front choke cables are routed through
the top nice discreet so they don't
interfere with a potential radiator or
fans if you decide to install them at
the top position and coming to the back
we have plenty of storage options so
first there are two SSD caddies with
nice captive thumb screws that's always
appreciated there is a hard drive cage
in the power supply chamber with two
Drive caddies and it is removable if you
require a little bit more room for the
power supply and additionally we have to
assess the mounts facing each other near
the front with a nice cutout protrusion
in the center so that the SATA cables
don't interfere and whoever designed
cable management here I want to give
them a hug because there are so many
cable tie points all over the place so
trying to like cleanly secure everything
to the back will not be an issue
and we
have plenty of them where you route your
8-pin cpu cable at the back of the case
now you may be wondering what's there
not to like about this almost perfect
case right on the interior it seems nice
feature set wise and Cale measurement at
the back with plenty of storage you know
it looks fine to 480 bucks so what is
the issue the tempered glass mount I
know that sounds a little bit ridiculous
but let me show you how you attach or
remove that glass panel
so first Remedies flat screws they're
better for visuals but look at this you
require an allen key which is included
by the way in order to remove them so
that's the first inconvenient point the
second one is you can see these rubber
bits so they are not actually attached
to the side panel so that means that
they will fall out the second you take
out the side panel and you will
definitely lose these unless you're
super careful and know about this based
on this review and the third thing is
there are actually no pegs on the frame
in order to hold the side panel and on
top of that or the bottom that there's
actually nothing in the bottom of the
frame to support the side panel when you
go and install it so you have to kind of
hold it in place
screw one and then struggle with the
other three corners another annoying
thing with the glass panel is that the
perimeter here the blackout stuff is
even on all sides but the actual panel
is not square so when you go to actually
install panel you have to be you have to
make sure that you're inserting it in
the correct orientation otherwise
otherwise it may look like it will fit
but it won't and I've already lost three
of the rubber pegs on the corners and
this is by far the worst temper glass
mount that Corsair could have
implemented on their chassis you know
it's $80 so I know it's not exactly
super premium premium but it's not even
budgetary tore either
this compromise of not including tiny
little pegs on the actual frame to hold
the glass mount is a bit ridiculous and
I know from the bigger picture this case
is actually quite nice and we'll do a
building it just a little bit but it
symbolizes where the
industries at you know there's always
these little features that kind of make
the case really good and then there's
this one little thing that somehow is
not yet fixed but has been fixed on
other previous cases from like two years
ago so how does that get to a point of
where we are today and this is not just
with 275 are this is on every single
case release that goes out today where
we expect perfection but we get just
tiny bit below that and it's quite
frustrating
all right so the build is finished man
what an enjoyable experience that was
from fitting all the main components
into doing keel management and I am
already dreading fitting that side panel
back on let me show you around
so first the 360 all one each 150 I fit
in no problem there are no alignment
issues it fits in within the cutout so
it's perfect for this configuration
underneath the motherboard all the
cables are well routed these cutouts are
nicely positioned beside the power
supply there and this one on the shroud
all the cable tie points around the
motherboard are actually very well laid
out even at the top so whoever designed
this cable management is a genius and
look at this my PCI cable for the
graphics card because of the cable type
points I was able to just kind of like
secure to the case and this PCI cable is
now almost hidden now I think the
highlight for the build for me would be
this new memory that we got from Team
Group it's called the Nighthawk so it's
slightly faster than what I have on
g.skill it's want some Computex Awards
has got lifetime warranty so that's
always appreciated it's Ora compatible
so I can sync it to the RGB illumination
on my asus motherboard and just check
out there's beautiful illumination on
both sides giving us nice spill and this
really cool laser-like effect with the
lighting like really cool giving my
motherboard area a little bit more spice
that it deserves and if you guys are
interested in team group Nighthawk
memory check it out in description below
so here you'll have plenty of options to
route your cables any way you want and
I've kind of concentrated them around
these two main rubber grommets and I did
not extend them into this SSD area just
so that you can see how you potentially
populate the SSDs in that spot without
interfering with your primary cables
that are coming from the power supply so
very nice clean job super quick to do I
think this took me like 10 minutes to
complete and the last thing to do with
some temperatures the 360 cooler is very
powerful but I want to see how much
cooler we can get without the front
panel and to see if there's a big
difference and I'm also going to leave a
timer on the screen so you can see how
long it takes me to actually put the
side panel back on let's go
Corsair this is not a good design also I
don't know if this was intentional but
the alum key fits right in the top panel
because it has a bit of protrusion and
so this is where you can store the allen
key when you need to access your case in
the future also the front of the case
you can see there's a bit of an
illumination now the thing is it's a
nice approach because it's a simple
white LED and non RGB however they are
quite harsh you can clearly see the
three distinct LEDs so on any reflective
surface they will be clearly visible and
actually quite distracting all right so
the final thing our temperatures with
the front panel removed we dropped five
degrees Celsius and the fans the front
three fans were running at 200 rpm
slower so we you know gained a little
bit extra cooling and the system was a
tiny bit quieter the GPU in this test
was not affected it was running at 83
degrees Celsius with a panel on or off
so this five degree difference you know
it could be lowered just to eliminate
that whole like restriction on people
complaining about airflow but it also
could be substantially higher as what
we've seen from other cases that have a
completely choked front intake and I'm
gonna stick to my point to say that this
case symbolizes the current case
industry and that it's affordable it's
got TG it's full of features you know
this is actually one of the best keel
management in its class for the mid
tower you know the front airflow is
slightly choked but it's not like super
you know starving for air but it has one
single flaw with that TG mount and I
don't understand it because Corsairs
previous Glassman's have not been that
bad in fact they've been just standard
with thumb screws and little pegs that
actually mount the glass first so I have
no idea why we have this on the 275 bar
and it was this close to getting in the
word but you guys know how I feel about
that mount and I'm all about the user
experience too so you know it delivers
on all that except for actually when you
go in to close the case alright guys so
that's all for me and a 275 or let me
know what you think and did you agree
with me about you know the case industry
as a whole and how this kind of
symbolizes where we are at today with it
I'm Dimitri thank so much for watching
we'll see you
