when I do the finance baby room for
activities modularity stripped down all
you want yeah no problem with the heat
either know what I mean
looking for an intimate moment define s
is something sexy hey guys Ibrahim with
her mechanics and today we'll be taking
a look at the r9 390x try X overclocked
beast from sapphire along with a fury
flagship launch AMD needed to fill the
void to compete with the GTX 980 970 and
960 and then r9 390x is a perfect fit
right between the 980 and the 970 based
on price and performance at four hundred
and twenty nine dollars the 390x is
competitively priced although we were
expecting for AMD to be even more
aggressive with the 300 series cards
hardware wise you're looking at a GCN
1.1 Hawaiian based architecture
codenamed granada xt with core clock
speeds of up to ten fifty megahertz
2,816 stream processors with a hundred
and seventy-six texture units on a 512
bit memory bus with eight gigabytes of
gddr5 memory and the memory clock speed
of six thousand maegor's features like
virtual super resolution free sync
support and upcoming DX wall support are
all covered with the t9e X and we're
happy to see the TDP of 275 watts which
is about eight percent less than the
power-hungry 290 X now let's do a
physical tour the shout here follows a
unique sapphire orange e yellow and
black color scheme with triple eighty
millimeter fan design along with an
extensive aluminum fin array and a vapor
chamber contact play the card measures
at eleven point seven five inches which
is a little long based on the recent
trend of minimizing card size but
regardless be aware of the needed
clearance most ATX cases should
accommodate for the tracks and a problem
unfortunately the PCB doesn't come with
a backplate the black PCB dough is a bit
stealthy and here you can spot the
extended cooler which exceeds B on a PCB
by a hefty 1.5 inches as of i/o you're
getting three DisplayPort 1.2 ports for
4k at 60 Hertz an HDMI port and a DVI
connector so really flexible options
here
sapphire does require a dual
pin power connector is compared to the
eight plus six reference design in order
to accommodate for extreme overclocking
so let's jump into the benchmark and the
390x performs just as expected compared
to the 290x
with about a 10% increase in performance
across the board when we ran games at
1440p at very high settings it manages
to keep strong in a few key titles but
it falls a little behind the GTX 980 in
some games which we hope is a matter of
driver optimisation for the 20x
to maintain a competitive edge but
priced lower than the GTX 980 we see the
value of this very close performance
movie to 4k at Ultra settings and we see
the same story with the 390x
pretty much closing the gap with 980
with better performance numbers in
battlefield 4 shadow of mordor Tomb
Raider and a few more for power
consumption the Granada XT core has some
optimizations built into it for lower
power consumption and the results are
acceptable for increased performance but
not impressive draw power of the r9 390x
is one of the highest in our GPU stack
under load
however when idle it consumes less than
5% which is appreciated Sapphire strikes
cooler brings nothing but good news with
extremely quiet operation this is one of
the quietest cards we've tested so far
and temperatures are really good too at
72 degrees Celsius during load which
means totally stable frequencies and
even more headroom for overclocking we
were able to achieve a stable overclock
of 1146 megahertz which means the small
percentage increase in the frame rates
across the board so I'm going to leave
you guys on a positive note Sapphire has
done a tremendous job with the r9 390x
try x OC GPU temperatures and acoustics
are the two elements to be proud of they
have managed to close the gap between
the 290 X and the 980 in terms of price
to performance and the yellow black
color scheme is attractive although the
lack of a backplate is a letdown plus
you have to consider the length of the
GPU that is just slightly longer than
competing graphics units well that
concludes our review of the Sapphire r9
390x
overclocked monster if you're on the
market for a new gaming powerhouse would
you consider the 390x
