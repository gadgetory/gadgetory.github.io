doing this again
reading the comments finding out what
people really need and we make a
follow-up video guys we listen to your
feedback regarding a recent
investigation video where I compared air
versus liquid coolers on twitter / and
I'm back at it to show you guys some
results after testing out the NR max
Lake Tech 240 and yes I just said licked
X so I'm looking forward to the comments
it's a really odd name from animatics
I'm not really sure why they named their
coolers that way but anyways moving on
now if you don't recall that video
here's a quick rundown
I tested four coolers two of them being
a iOS from NZXT specifically the kraken
x 52 and x 62 and the other two were air
coolers from Noctua the Nhu 12 STR 4 and
the Nhu 14 STR 4 do note that these
coolers came with their own custom
contact surface area that pretty much
covered the entire die of the CPU and
that was a contributing factor for the
lower temperatures we saw when compared
to NZXT offerings the lick tech 240 tr4
from NR max looks like a pretty good
cooling solution for thread Ripper since
the copper cold plate covers 100% of the
IHS so let's find out how well it
compares to the rest of coolers right
after message from our sponsor check out
the outstanding case of an X X open
style headphones by mass drop an AEG
with beautiful design lightweight and
perfectly comfortable with incredible
sound signature and a well rounded price
to join the drop link below
alright so the lick tech 240 tr4 retails
for about $130 and as the name implies
this is a 240 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooling solution now if you're
looking for something a bit bigger they
do offer a three sixty millimeter
variant for an extra $20 and
interestingly enough I did notice a 280
millimeter variant on the website but
oddly I wasn't able to find availability
and pricing on that particular model so
perhaps we could expect that in the near
future the radiator is 39 millimeters
thick and here's a quick comparison shot
to the X 62 without any fans installed
it's a bit on the thicker side so that
could cause mounting issues inside a
standard case because if you add the
fans on top of the rad that could impede
motherboard installation when placed in
a top mount
position luckily I had no she's
installing this AIO inside the air 540
from Corsair but I would still highly
recommend checking case compatibility if
you decide to get this cooler the two
included 120 millimeter fans are built
really well and they feature an anti
vibration armor pads to help with
acoustics the premium polyamide rubber
tubing made installation of breeds and
it's really flexible plus you don't have
to worry about accent Elise which aren't
mostly common within a hose that come
with PVC tubing now what's really
interesting about this particular cooler
is it's custom designed water block /
reservoir combination unit it claims to
deliver a high flow rate up to 450
litres per hour for superior cooling
performance and all of that is backed by
the copper coal plate that covers 100%
of the IHS unthread River processors the
patented shunt channel technology
enables the cold play to eliminate the
boundary layer to increase coolant flow
momentum and accelerate heat transfer
performance I guess we'll find out how
well that plays out in the results all
right let's talk installation for this
AIO if you recall my recent BTS episode
I mentioned how I had a tough time
placing the pump on top of the CPU due
to incompatibility issues within the
bracket and the standoffs well it turns
out that the bracket can be removed
completely from the pump and it can be
readjusted to fit the socket so shout
out to David for pointing that out in
the comments because I totally missed
that and oddly enough inner max doesn't
have any of that info in the manual or
the website so I do want to take this
time to apologize for misinforming you
guys regarding incompatibility issues
because that's really not the case here
is just I completely missed that part so
if you do end up picking one of these
coolers make sure to slide the bracket
all the way into the pump for it to fit
the standoffs now with that out of the
way the rest of the installation was
pretty much similar to traditional
liquid coolers I use the included spring
screws to tighten the four corners
amount to the radiator plugged in pump
power connector to the motherboard which
by the way doesn't require a separate
SATA power source so that's nice the
included PWM fan splitter can be used to
connect the dual 120 millimeter fans
directly to the motherboard using a
single pin and the fan speed can be
controlled through the utility software
that's provided by your respective
motherboard manufacturer so without any
further ado let's jump into the results
I used Ida 60 for stress test on the
1950 X + HW monitor to monitor the
CP temperatures let's kick things off at
stock settings since it gives us a rough
baseline as to how each cooler stack up
with one another as you can see the NMX
cooler surprised me with the idle
temperatures around 30 degrees Celsius
and it's the lowest among the other
coolers under load the lick tech 240 ran
almost neck to neck with the u 12s from
not Toa and the NCHC x 62 but mind you
that cooler features a to 80 millimeter
radiator so the custom-designed copper
coal plate seems to do a pretty good job
keeping temperatures under control given
that it's paired up with a 240
millimeter radiator but what happens
when we overclock the CPU
well that 240 millimeter radiator can
only do so much dissipating the enormous
heat output produced by the overclocked
1950 X CPU but it was under control at 4
gigahertz yielding temperatures around
74 C which is just 5 degrees warmer than
the Krakken X 62 it's obviously a lot
superior to the X 52 so if you're
looking for a 240 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooling solution for X 399 the
lick tech 240 is the one to get let's
move on to some acoustic tests for this
cooler do note that the fan noise was
recorded just a few inches away from the
case so the test might sound a lot
noisier than they really should
so I hope those results answered some of
your questions regarding how the
animatics cool are performed with
respect to ncx these offerings and not
to his air coolers let me know what you
guys think about the anti max lick tech
240 is it something that you would look
into if you consider switching to thread
Ripper and you know be mindful that this
is a 240 millimeter radiator and it
obviously outperforms the x52 from NZXT
but certainly not the X 62 from n 60 so
if you're looking for an aesthetic yeah
yo you should probably stick with the X
62 because it's got the RGB lighting and
it's got a really clean looking CPU
block but if you are looking for a
compact a i/o cooler say like in the 12
to 40 millimeter radiator range pick the
inner max of lick tech 240 it seems to
do a pretty good job at cooling the
thunderbird CPU at stock and overclock
settings so what do you guys think of
the anti max lick tech 240 and I know a
lick tech sounds a little weird but
regardless of that I'd love to hear your
thoughts on this cooler and of course
the performance when compared to the
other coolers that I mentioned leave a
