that simplistic Scandinavian appeal with
easy to work in internals great airflow
and storage potential and comes in both

your preference
hello everyone this is Dimitri with
Harbor Canucks and we travel to Monterey
California for Nvidia's editors day
where we get a sneak peek at the
upcoming technologies Nvidia has been
hard at work with that we'll cover in
future videos but one of the main
highlights is the announcement of
Nvidia's latest Maxwell GPU the geforce
gtx 980 and gtx 970 and up to this point
every maxwell release has shown
impressive results from the desktop 750
Ti and later the 800 m series notebook
GPUs that with excellent power
efficiency and optimized architecture
really paved the way for Maxwell to
truly shine in the graphics market
NVIDIA has done some architectural
changes with this new GM 204 core while
keeping to the same 28 nanometer
manufacturing process and actually
earlier Maxwell releases really
foreshadowed the direction towards
reducing TDP while optimizing
performance so each quarter core on
these new GPUs is up to 40% faster than
its predecessors also this is the first
GPU architecture to natively support
direct3d 12 and coming on to the pricing
of these cards they are really well
tuned to be competitive at $550 for gtx
980 and 329 for gtx 970 and with this
pricing strategy gtx 760 moves to 220
dollars which is a $30 reduction and in
this launch the following cards are
unfortunately being discontinued as
maxwell takes over on the high end
spectrum specs wise we're looking at
2048 quarter cores on a 980 and 16 64 on
the 970 with higher base and boost clock
on the more expensive card both with 4
gigabytes of gddr5 memory on a 256 bit
bus for improved higher resolution FPS
and strictly off these specifications it
doesn't really seem to offer that next
level of confidence on performance but
given the more efficient Maxwell
architecture the GTX 980 out
formed the more expensive 780ti in most
of our benchmarks and so I left the best
for last and NVIDIA has been really
pushing towards power efficiency and the
total power draw for GTX 980 is only 165
watts
while the 970 is just slightly below at
145 Watts both requiring two 6-pin PCI
Express connectors this means reduced
heat output reduce power draw for the
entire system and also quieter operation
all while maintaining extremely high
clock frequencies to both the 980 and
the 970 this is very impressive for
connectivity each card is rocking dual
link DVI output 3 DisplayPort 1.2 and an
HDMI 2.0 port so you can run up to 4 4k
displays at 60 Hertz off a single card
we saw a triple 4k setup plugged into
one card while the system was in sli so
effectively utilizing the power of both
GPUs but running at the total display
output of a single car and while triple
monitor support is available on Kepler
already Maxwell brings this a step
further with the addition of another
monitor and also higher resolution
output per channel also remember the
games new feature that was introduced
with higher-end kepler cards
well the encoder has been optimized to
be two-and-a-half times faster on the
new Maxwell GPU so potentially 4k
gameplay capture with shadow play
without hindering performance and also
eventually 4k streaming - and
potentially a shield device alright so
finally let's take a look at the card
itself it's a simple reference design
that's a very beautiful card it's the
same length as the GTX 780 at 10 1/2
inches or 267 millimeters with a
standard blower type cooler illuminated
GeForce logo and now with an aluminum
backplate that will help to dissipate
heat off the PCB plus it looks pretty
cool and the removal piece beside the
power connector it will help with air
flow when in SLI so removing that plate
will grant extra airflow for the above
you and so now let's see how the GTX 980
performed under 1440p conditions so call
of duty ghosts' it's the only game in
our benchmarks where the 780ti
outperformed the 980 however moving on
to battlefield 4 notice the much higher
minimum frame rate is on the 980
compared to the 780 Ti and with a
similar result with Far Cry 3 again
standing really strong among the other
two GPU Kings and again a much higher
minimum frame rate I sealing in thief
but there are subtitles like black flag
they're almost neck to neck with just
one FPS difference very similar results
across all cards for hitman absolution
and gaining more ground than Metro last
slide but the general trend here as you
can see is total domination for gaming
and the results are conclusive and
revealing as to why Nvidia is
discontinuing the 780ti the 780 and the
770 as Maxwell is here to stay and so
these results are really impressive as
gaming performance really dominated the
charts while keeping to an extremely low
TDP compared to invidious previous cards
and also compared to Amy's flagship 290x
with plenty of headroom left for
overclocking actually and also thanks to
this new GPU multi 4k output is possible
off a single card while priced extremely
competitively so now I'll be interesting
to see how AMD responds to this power
efficient yet outperforming GPU only
drawback we can mention would be
availability so we hope Nvidia is
prepared to fulfill the demand so guys
what do you think of this price point
and the discontinuation of those iconic
700 series cards leave your thoughts in
the comments below also we have a full
written review on Harbor kanakas calm
with SLI benchmarks 4k benchmarks along
with thermal imaging power consumption
and noise results and also overclocking
tests so make sure you visit our site to
get the full details on this latest
launch from Nvidia so we hope you check
it out as always thanks for watching and
we'll see you
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
